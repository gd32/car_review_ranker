# DSI_capstone
This is a car review recommender system that serveds as my capstone project for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive.

## Goals
The intent of this project is to create a recommender system for online text-based car reviews based on topic and sentiment analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the sentiment analysis features of TextBlob.

Ultimately, I hope to create some kind of interactive application that allows users to enter a car of interest and offer a ranked list of reviews based on sentiments or topics generated by my text analysis.
