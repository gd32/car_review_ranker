# Car Review Recommender System
This is a car review recommender system that serveds as my capstone project for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive.

## Goals
The intent of this project is to create a recommender system for online text-based car reviews based on topic and sentiment analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the sentiment analysis features of TextBlob.

Ultimately, I hope to create some kind of interactive application that allows users to enter a car of interest and offer a ranked list of reviews based on sentiments or topics generated by the text analysis mentioned previously.

## Premise
While many car reviews are now found in video format, text-based car reviews can still be an effective resource for consumers wishing to gather research about an upcoming car purchase. However, reviews often differ in their presentation, tone, and conclusions and can give consumers disorienting or misleading information epending on their expectations of the reviews.

By establishing a hierarchy of reviews using tags generated by sentiment or topic analysis, my project aims to improve the ability of consumers to understand the characteristics of individual car reviews to select the review that is most relevant to their interests as a soon-to-be car buyer.
