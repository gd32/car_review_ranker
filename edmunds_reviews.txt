[<p>The  2018 Acura ILX is an entry-level luxury sedan that is available in seven  different trims: <strong>base</strong>, a new <strong>Special</strong> <strong>Edition</strong>, <strong>AcuraWatch</strong> <strong>Plus</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong> <strong>A-Spec</strong>, <strong>Tech</strong> <strong>Plus</strong> and <strong>Tech</strong> <strong>Plus</strong> <strong>A-Spec</strong>. All trims  are powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (201 horsepower, 180 pound-feet  of torque) that sends power to the front wheels through an eight-speed  automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>base</strong> ILX comes with 17-inch wheels,  automatic LED headlights, rain-sensing wipers, heated mirrors, keyless entry  and ignition, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, simulated  leather upholstery, heated front seats, an eight-way power driver sport seat, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a folding rear seatback, a rearview  camera, limited text messaging functions, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio,  and a six-speaker stereo with active noise cancellation, streaming internet  radio and USB/auxiliary input.</p>, <p>The <strong>Special Edition</strong> trim adds 18-inch  wheels, extended side sills and the rear spoiler from the A-Spec package. The <strong>AcuraWatch Plus</strong> trim starts with the  base trim's features and adds adaptive cruise control, a forward collision  warning and mitigation system, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist,  road departure mitigation and an updated driver information screen.</p>, <p>The <strong>Tech Plus</strong> includes all of the  AcuraWatch Plus items along with a multiview rear camera and a 10-speaker  premium audio system. The <strong>Premium </strong>reverts back to the base trim  features and adds an iPhone-based navigation system and a seven-speaker audio  system. Both the Tech Plus and Premium trim levels also include leather  upholstery, a four-way power front passenger seat, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, Siri Eyes Free phone control, a universal garage door opener, a  touchscreen display, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert,  satellite and HD radio, and additional internet music apps. </p>, <p>The <strong>A-Spec</strong> is added to either the Tech  Plus or Premium models and includes the Special Edition content as well as  foglights, suede seat inserts with contrasting stitching, a dark headliner and  metal sport pedals.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Acura MDX may be less expensive than similarly sized three-row luxury  SUVs, but by no means does that imply disappointment. This popular three-row  crossover SUV is versatile and has an appealing mix of safety and  luxury-oriented features. </p>, <p>The  MDX is enjoyable to drive, too. Its two powertrain options, a standard  3.5-liter V6 engine or an optional gas-electric hybrid with a 3.0-liter V6,  provide a suitable amount of oomph for quick passes and freeway merging.  Acura's available Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system can also enhance this  SUV's agility when you're driving around turns. </p>, <p>The  aforementioned hybrid system is distinctive in that Acura designed it to  deliver increases in both power and fuel economy. Indeed, we've found the Sport  Hybrid is quicker than the regular MDX in our testing, and the EPA estimates  you'll get 27 mpg combined in the Sport Hybrid compared to 22 mpg in a regular  all-wheel-drive MDX. </p>, <p>After  a refresh last year, the 2018 MDX is improved further by a faster and more  powerful entertainment system that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay,  addressing the biggest complaints we've had with prior years of the MDX. Though  there are a few remaining drawbacks, they're pretty minor. Overall, the MDX  remains a strong contender if you're shopping for a three-row midsize luxury  crossover SUV. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Acura MDX is a three-row luxury SUV that seats up to seven. It's offered  in three trim levels: <strong>Standard</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong> and <strong>Advance. </strong>The Standard and Technology MDXs come nicely equipped, and  the Advance has all the features you'll likely want in this class of vehicle.  All of the above employ a 3.5-liter V6 engine (290 horsepower, 267 pound-feet)  that's paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission with either front- or  all-wheel drive. The <strong>Sport Hybrid</strong> uses a smaller 3.0-liter V6 in conjunction with three electric motors (combined  321 hp, 289 lb-ft) and a seven-speed automatic transmission to deliver an  estimated 27 mpg combined.</p>]

[<p>Highlights  of the <strong>Standard</strong> package include  18-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights with automatic high beams, adaptive  suspension dampers, a power liftgate, a sunroof, and keyless entry and  ignition. Inside, you'll find power-adjustable front seats with heating,  driver-seat memory settings, a power-adjustable steering wheel, leather  upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control and an auto-dimming rearview  mirror.</p>, <p>Technology  features include support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a dual-screen  infotainment system (with a 7-inch touchscreen), Bluetooth, four USB ports, and  an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player and satellite radio. The MDX's  standard AcuraWatch safety suite features forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane and road departure warning and mitigation,  and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The <strong>Technology</strong> package adds niceties  such as 20-inch wheels, automatic wipers, remote engine start, power-folding  side mirrors, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a navigation  system, a color driver information display, and a 10-speaker premium audio  system with HD radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>Advance</strong> package turns on the charm  with front and rear parking sensors, LED foglights, automatic engine  stop-start, a top-down surround-view camera system, a heated steering wheel,  sport seats with premium leather and trim, front-seat ventilation, heated  second-row captain's chairs, second-row sunshades and two additional USB ports  for the third row.</p>, <p>The <strong>Entertainment</strong> package can be  specified with either the Technology or Advance package and adds a DVD-based  rear entertainment system. If you add it to the Technology package, it comes  with a 9-inch screen and 11 audio speakers; if you add it to the Advance  package, it comes with a 16.2-inch screen (with an HDMI input) and 12 audio  speakers. Note that it replaces the captain's chairs with the standard  second-row bench seating.</p>, <p>Finally,  there's the all-wheel-drive MDX <strong>Sport  Hybrid</strong>. It's available with the Technology and Advance packages only.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2017 Acura MDX SH-AWD w/Advance Package </strong>(3.5L  V6 | 9-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 2018 Acura MDX has received some  revisions, including an updated infotainment system that includes standard  Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support. Our findings remain broadly applicable  to this year's MDX.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Acura NSX is an all-wheel-drive,  mid-engine hybrid supercar that sits at the top of Acura's product range. It's  a formidable technical achievement and a potent performer but is flawed in a  few ways, and we think it could benefit from a dose of emotion.</p>, <p>The 2018 NSX's power starts with a  turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 and a nine-speed transmission that are  purpose-designed and -built for the NSX. On top of that, there are three  electric motors: one to assist the engine and two at the front axle to provide  traction and to influence its handling. Meanwhile, its chassis is a mix of  aluminum and steel, and it has magnetorheological variable dampers all around.</p>, <p>The NSX's advanced design makes for an exotic sports car that is easy to drive  quickly every day. Forget that it will hit 60 mph in about 3 seconds and get  the fuel economy of what an Acura TL used to get back in the 1990s. Its organic  driving experience in the face of enormous complexity is probably the most  striking accomplishment of the NSX.</p>, <p>And yet, as sophisticated as it is, the NSX lacks a sense of occasion. Its V6  doesn't have a particularly exotic sound to it, its cabin borrows elements from  Hondas in the $20,000 range, and the car's styling, while safe and  well-proportioned, does not invite you to linger or admire. Meanwhile, its  extensive hardware is totally concealed. That the NSX has a Quiet mode but not  a Loud mode speaks volumes. </p>, <p>The NSX has personality but not attitude.  It's a supercar without swagger.</p>]

[<p>Unlike some of its competition, the 2018 Acura NSX is available only as a  two-door, two-seat coupe in a single performance specification. There are no  other body styles or trim levels. It comes standard with a twin-turbocharged  3.5-liter V6, a nine-speed transmission, and a trio of electric motors that  continually monitor and optimize the NSX's traction. </p>]

[<p>The V6 powers the rear wheels alone, and  each front wheel has its own electric motor. This lets the car's onboard  computers carefully accelerate or decelerate each wheel to keep the NSX on  course during high-performance driving. A third electric motor pairs with the  V6 engine in common hybrid-electric fashion, adding torque at low speeds and  enabling very smooth engine starts. The combination of gasoline V6 and electric  motors generates 573 hp and 476 lb-ft of torque. </p>, <p>Standard equipment includes LED headlights,  adaptive suspension dampers (magnetorheological), 19-inch front and 20-inch  rear wheels, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate control,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather and simulated suede upholstery,  manually adjustable seats with heating, an eight-speaker sound system with two  USB inputs, a 7-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility,  and the AcuraLink smartphone connectivity system. </p>, <p>There are a few features that are  optional. Its main optional package is the Technology package, which gets you a  navigation system, parking sensors, and a nine-speaker premium ELS sound system  with satellite radio. A couple of packages that outfit the NSX with extra  exterior and interior carbon-fiber trim are also available.</p>, <p>Stand-alone options include carbon-ceramic brakes, upgraded performance summer  tires, premium paint hues, a long list of cosmetic carbon-fiber components  (roof panel, interior trim, engine cover, rear spoiler), a different style of  wheels, power seats in two leather choices, and a simulated-suede headliner.</p>]

[<p>For  many reasons, the Acura RDX is one of our top picks in the luxury compact SUV  segment. It's a well-made and well-equipped SUV that is a clear, premium step  up from mainstream compact SUVs such as the Honda CR-V. Its value is undeniable  and a must-drive for buyers who value smart engineering and style equally.</p>, <p>Chief among the RDX's virtues are space and value for your money. Although a  "compact" SUV, the RDX has plenty of family-friendly space. Should  you need a back seat big enough to affix a rear-facing baby seat, or a pair of  growing teenagers, the RDX is better suited to the task than most other  vehicles in the segment. Cargo capacity is also generous, both in terms of its  on-paper measurements and real-world practicality. </p>, <p>From a value perspective, the RDX is one of the few compact SUVs to come with a  standard V6 engine. It also has a long list of standard features, but it also  remains competitive with its European counterparts even after you load it up  with all the available options. In fact, a fully loaded RDX with the optional  all-wheel drive is priced on par with some of the base models of many  competitors. </p>]

[<p>The  2017 Acura RDX is a compact luxury SUV that seats five people and is powered by  a standard 3.5-liter V6 (279 hp, 252 lb-ft). Although there are no trims, the  RDX can be equipped with three options packages. <strong>AcuraWatch Plus</strong> adds driver assist features; <strong>Technology</strong> adds ELS audio, navigation and sport seats; and the <strong>Advance</strong> package bundles the first two  together and then pads on additional luxury features such as vented seats and  remote engine start. Finally, the RDX can be optioned with all-wheel drive; it  comes standard with front-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Even without any packages, the RDX standard features list is packed. It  includes 18-inch wheels, a rearview camera, automatic LED headlights, cruise  control, keyless ignition and entry, a power liftgate, a sunroof, dual-zone  automatic climate control, heated power front seats (eight-way driver, four-way  passenger), premium vinyl upholstery, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, an auto-dimming mirror, Bluetooth phone and audio, and a  seven-speaker sound system with satellite radio, Pandora internet radio control  (streams from smartphone), an auxiliary audio jack, a USB port and a media  player interface.</p>, <p>The <strong>AcuraWatch Plus</strong> package adds a  forward collision warning and automatic braking system, a lane departure  warning and keeping system, adaptive cruise control and a color trip computer  display.</p>, <p>The <strong>Technology </strong>package adds  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, a navigation system,  traffic information, GPS-linked climate control, leather upholstery, an  eight-way power passenger seat, smartphone apps with Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto integration, HD radio, Aha internet radio capability and a 10-speaker  sound system.</p>, <p>The Advance package includes all of the features from both AcuraWatch Plus and  Technology package and adds front and rear parking sensors, automatic wipers,  foglights, auto-dimming side mirrors, remote ignition, and ventilated front  seats.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Acura RLX is quiet and  comfortable and offers an impressive mix of power and fuel economy from the  Sport Hybrid version. But this year's updates (read more about them in our <a href="/car-news/first-impressions/2018-acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-first-drive.html">RLX First Impression</a> review) just don't go far enough in addressing the issues that make the RLX  hard to recommend over similarly priced luxury competitors. </p>, <p>Certainly, there are positive aspects to  Acura's top sedan. The Sport Hybrid is pretty cool. It's all-wheel-drive, and  each rear wheel is independently driven by an electric motor; an electric motor  in the transmission helps the V6 drive the front wheels. This system produces a  total of 377 horsepower and returns an EPA-estimated 28 mpg combined. The Sport  Hybrid is smooth and unobtrusive in city driving, and it provides competent  handling when you're driving on twisty roads. </p>, <p>The rest of the RLX is a mixed bag,  however. Although Acura packs in plenty of features as standard, the overall  interior design comes off as dated. The biggest offender is the dual-screen  infotainment system. It's frustrating to use, lacks many of the bells and  whistles that other luxury marques offer, and belies all the other impressive technology  that's available in the RLX.</p>, <p>We think it's worth checking out a few  other midsize luxury sedans even if they cost a little more. The Mercedes-Benz  E-Class was recently redesigned and sports a richly appointed interior. The  Volvo S90 offers a likewise impressively modern interior and a hybrid option.  The Audi A6 offers one of the best tech interfaces in the segment, while the  venerable BMW 5 Series and value-packed Genesis G80 are also great choices.  Overall, the 2018 Acura RLX is likable enough, but the competition is generally  more desirable.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Acura RLX comes in just two  trims. The base front-wheel-drive version (referred to as <strong>P-AWS</strong>) comes with a list of features that's more comprehensive than  what you'll get on many competitive base models. The Sport Hybrid comes with an  impressive all-wheel-drive hybrid drivetrain and even more premium features.</p>]

[<p>The base RLX <strong>P-AWS</strong> is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine making 310 horsepower and  272 pound-feet of torque. It sends power to the front wheels via a new 10-speed  automatic transmission. </p>, <p>Standard equipment on the P-AWS trim  includes 19-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a power sunroof,  automatic windshield wipers, a rearview camera, and keyless entry with  push-button start. Inside you'll find three-zone automatic climate control,  heated and power-adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, a power-adjustable  steering wheel, a dual-screen infotainment system, navigation, Bluetooth, and a 14-speaker sound  system with a CD player, HD and satellite radio, a USB-iPod interface, smartphone  app integration (Pandora and Aha internet radio integration), and an auxiliary  audio jack.<strong> </strong></p>, <p>Both the P-AWS and Sport Hybrid come with  a full suite of active safety features and driver aids, including adaptive  cruise control, lane keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency  braking.</p>, <p>The <strong>Sport  Hybrid</strong> also adds LED foglights, auto-dimming and power-folding side  mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, remote start, and a surround-view  camera system. Inside, the Sport Hybrid gets ventilated front seats, heated  rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a power rear sunshade and manual rear-door  sunshades, a head-up display, and a premium 14-speaker stereo system.</p>, <p>Obviously, the biggest upgrade is the  hybrid drivetrain. The V6 motor drives the front wheels through a seven-speed,  dual-clutch automatic transmission with a built-in electric motor, and each  rear wheel has an independent electric motor. Total system power is 377 horsepower  and 341 pound-feet of torque.</p>]

[<p>Acura introduced the TLX in 2015  to replace its TSX and TL sedans, aiming to combine the appeal of both of those  cars with a single model. Since then, we've found the TLX exhibits an agreeable  demeanor. It's not particularly exciting, but it doesn't have any huge  drawbacks either.</p>, <p>This  year's 2018 TLX is a little more dynamic. Though it's the same sedan under the  skin (it continues to be based on the Honda Accord), Acura has freshened the  TLX's styling to bring the sedan up to date with the company's current design  themes. Changes elsewhere are relatively modest. Beyond the additional feature  content, the TLX's updated two-screen infotainment system has quicker responses  and more logical operation, and the retuned transmissions are said to improve  shift refinement. There's also a new A-Spec trim level that gets a sport-tuned  suspension and its own special styling elements. </p>, <p>Overall,  though, the TLX is much like it has been. It's a smart choice if you want a lot  of value from your luxury sedan but probably not the best if performance is a  priority. </p>]

[<p>Picking a 2018 Acura TLX is  straightforward. Acura offers the TLX with one of two engines, a four-cylinder  or a V6, and a couple of option packages. Four-cylinder models are front-wheel  drive only and are available as either <strong>TLX  2.4L</strong> or <strong>TLX 2.4L with Technology  package</strong>. The base V6 model is the <strong>TLX  3.5L</strong>. You can also get the <strong>TLX 3.5L  with Technology package, TLX 3.5L A-Spec </strong>and<strong> TLX 3.5L with Advance package</strong>. All-wheel drive is available for  all TLXs with the V6.<br> <br>  The base <strong>TLX 2.4L</strong> comes with a 2.4-liter engine  (206 hp, 182 lb-ft) and an eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission.  Standard feature highlights include LED headlights, 17-inch wheels, keyless  entry and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, simulated leather  upholstery and power-adjustable front seats. </br></br></p>]

[<p>For 2018,  all TLXs are equipped as standard with a suite of driver assistance features  collectively labeled AcuraWatch. This includes lane departure warning and  intervention, forward collision warning and mitigation with automatic braking,  road departure mitigation, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam  control.<br> <br>  You'll  probably like getting the extra convenience features of the <strong>TLX 2.4L with Technology package</strong>. It  adds keyless entry for the rear doors, leather upholstery, automatic wipers, a  climate control system that compensates for sun direction, navigation, a  10-speaker premium audio system, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross traffic  alert.<br> <br> <strong>TLX 3.5L</strong> models are, appropriately enough,  powered by a 3.5-liter V6 (290 hp, 267 lb-ft) that's connected to a nine-speed  automatic transmission. Beyond what comes with the base four-cylinder variant,  the 3.5L gets 18-inch wheels and more power adjustments for the front passenger  seat.<br> <strong> </strong><br>  The <strong>TLX 3.5L with Technology package</strong> offers  the same features as the Technology package on the four-cylinder version plus  revised leather upholstery and a power-extending thigh support for the driver  seat.<br> <br>  For people  who want all the creature comforts, the <strong>TLX  3.5L with Advance package </strong>awaits. It has all of the Technology package  items plus parking sensors, remote engine start, ventilated front seats, heated  outboard rear seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless device charging, auto-dimming  and power-folding side mirrors, a surround-view camera system and a heated  windshield.<br> <br>New for  2018 is the <strong>TLX 3.5L A-Spec</strong>, which  has the features of the Technology package and some of the features of the  Advance package, plus a sport-tuned suspension, 19-inch wheels, quicker  steering, sport front seats and some cosmetic tweaks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Acura TLX 2.4L with Technology</strong> (2.4L inline-4 | 8-speed dual-clutch automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current TLX has received some revisions,  including a cosmetic face-lift inside and out, retuned transmissions, standard  driver assistance features and a revised infotainment interface. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's TLX.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C checks a lot of boxes on the exotic sports car wish  list: It's from Italy, its engine is behind the seats, the chassis is a  carbon-fiber monocoque, and the entire car weighs less than 2,500 pounds. The  4C also uses rack-and-pinion steering — with no power assist. That  particular cutting-edge automotive technology showed up in, oh, the 1930s. But  having it in a 2018 car when everything else has numb-feeling, electric-assist  racks is almost a revelation.</p>, <p>In the 4C, manual steering both saves  weight and provides greater feedback to the driver, and this car is all about  lightness and feedback. The engine shouts right in your ear, the suspension  communicates every minuscule imperfection in the road, and the minimally padded  seats make sure you feel every vibration. This raw, unfiltered driving  experience is both what makes the Alfa a unique standout among modern cars and  what makes it an unlivable daily driver. The 4C is definitely a second  — or maybe third — car. </p>, <p>For the money, there are plenty of  engaging sports cars that are significantly easier to live with (you know, if  you don't have a garage big enough for a small fleet). The Porsche 718 Cayman  and 718 Boxster, the Chevrolet Corvette, and the Jaguar F-Type are all  exceptional driver's cars. All have their strengths and weaknesses, but they're  all more comfortable and more practical. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C should only be  considered by buyers willing to live with the inherent day-to-day difficulties  of driving a seriously hardcore mid-engine sports car. Its no-frills attitude  is reflected in its skimpy list of standard and optional features. After all,  more features make for a heavier car, and the 4C is all about keeping the  weight down. If you should want a few extras, the <strong>Convenience </strong>package adds a few luxury elements, the <strong>Track </strong>package includes performance  upgrades, and the <strong>Carbon Fiber Interior  Trim</strong> package is self-explanatory.</p>]

[<p>The  4C is powered by a turbocharged 1.7-liter four-cylinder engine (237 horsepower  and 258 pound-feet of torque) paired to a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic  transmission sending power to the rear wheels. Standard equipment for the coupe  includes a 17-inch (front) and 18-inch (rear) wheels, summer performance tires,  LED running lights and taillights, heated mirrors, air conditioning, power  accessories, cloth upholstery, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, a 7-inch driver information display, Bluetooth connectivity, and an  Alpine sound system with a CD player, a USB port and satellite and HD radio.  The 4C convertible also has a manually operated soft top, leather seats and an  alarm system.</p>, <p>The  leather seats are optional on the coupe, and leather seats with faux suede  upholstery are available on both body styles. An optional <strong>Convenience </strong>package adds rear parking sensors, cruise control and,  for the coupe, an alarm system. The <strong>Track </strong>package includes a more stiffly tuned suspension, available 18-inch (front)  and 19-inch (rear) wheels, a flat-bottom steering wheel and additional  carbon-fiber exterior trim. Additional carbon-fiber styling elements are  included with the <strong>Carbon Fiber Interior  Trim</strong> package. Notable stand-alone options include xenon headlights, a  subwoofer, a carbon-fiber roof, a sport exhaust and an Akrapovi&amp;ccaron; dual-mode  exhaust.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the<strong>2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe </strong>(turbo 1.7L inline-4 | 6-speed dual-clutch  automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Alfa Romeo 4C has received some  revisions, including an upgraded standard sound system and the availability of  an Akrapovi&amp;ccaron;  dual-mode exhaust system in 2017. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's Alfa Romeo 4C.</p>]

[<p>Audi.  BMW. Mercedes. These are the popular brands people reflexively shop when  looking for a luxury sedan. But what if you find them to be a bit boring or  complacent? That's where the 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia comes in. This luxury sedan  newcomer isn't well-known, but once you see it, it's hard to ignore. </p>, <p>On  the outside, the Giulia looks like nothing else on the road thanks to its taut  styling and classic Alfa Romeo grille. The beauty is more than skin-deep, too.  The underlying hardware is competitive, with the base Giulia and Giulia Ti  receiving a lively 280-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine driving the  rear wheels through a quick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>It's  the top-of-the-line Giulia Quadrifoglio trim, however, that truly makes its  presence known by aggressively gunning for top performance honors of the class.  It comes outfitted with a powerful Ferrari-developed turbocharged V6 engine,  weight-saving carbon fiber, articulating aerodynamics, and a whole host of  other speed-enhancing features to win over the hearts and wallets of  performance fans. </p>, <p>That  said, the Giulia has its work cut out for it. Alfa's dealer network is small,  and the jury is still out regarding the model's reliability. But if you're  looking for a small luxury sedan that brings some passion to the segment, the  Giulia could very well be your car.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Giulia comes in six trims: the entry-level <strong>Giulia</strong> and <strong>Giulia Sport</strong>;  the midtier <strong>Ti</strong>,<strong> Ti Sport</strong> and <strong>Ti Lusso</strong>;  and the high-performance <strong>Quadrifoglio</strong>.<strong> </strong>The Giulia and Ti models come with a  nice amount of standard equipment and are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (280 horsepower, 306 pound-feet) that puts its power to  the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive  is also available for all 2.0-liter cars. The Quadrifoglio demonstrates the  full potential of the car, including a Ferrari-derived turbocharged 2.9-liter  V6 engine (505 hp, 443 lb-ft). </p>]

[<p>Some  of the key standard exterior features on the base <strong>Giulia</strong> include 17-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, Brembo  brakes, xenon headlights, automatic wipers, rear parking sensors and a rearview  camera. Inside, you'll find remote keyless ignition and entry, leather  upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, dual-zone climate control, adjustable  drive models, a driver information display, Bluetooth, a 6.5-inch central  display, voice commands, three USB ports and an eight-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>This  year Alfa Romeo introduces the Giulia <strong>Sport</strong> trim, which is essentially the Sport package from the previous year. The Sport  trim adds unique front and rear fascias, 18-inch wheels, gloss black window  trim and painted brake calipers. The Sport Interior package is still an option  that includes aluminum trim, huge column-mounted aluminum paddle shifters, a  leather steering wheel and sport pedals. </p>, <p>If  you're looking to upgrade the infotainment system for either of the above  trims, the Navigation package includes an 8.8-inch central infotainment  display, navigation, a rotary controller and satellite radio. A complement to  this would be the newly available 14-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio  system. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity is a stand-alone option on  all trims. </p>, <p>A  Cold Weather package is specific to the Giulia and Giulia Sport models, and  adds heated seats, a heated steering wheel and heated washer nozzles. There are  two levels of active driving assist packages. The Driver Assistance Static  package includes front parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert and auto-dimming exterior mirrors. The Driver Assistance  Dynamic Plus package adds adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning,  forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, automatic high  beams and a heat-reducing infrared reflective windshield.</p>, <p>The  Giulia <strong>Ti</strong> comes with everything the  Giulia model has, plus 18-inch alloy wheels, the front and rear parking  sensors, the 8.8-inch display (navigation is an option), satellite radio and  the aforementioned Cold Weather package. Adaptive xenon headlights are a stand-alone  option.</p>, <p>The <strong>Ti Sport</strong> adds 19-inch alloy wheels,  sport front seats (a worthwhile upgrade) and everything from the Sport trim and  Sport Interior package mentioned above.</p>, <p>The <strong>Ti Lusso</strong> trim is more  luxury-oriented and has different 18-inch wheels, comfort-oriented front seats,  upgraded leather interior trim, an upgraded steering wheel and an interior air  quality system. If you just wanted a leather interior, it's available as a  Leather package. </p>, <p>The  Ti Sport Performance package provides an additional step toward Quadrifoglio  performance on the Ti Sport trim with adaptive suspension dampers and a  mechanical limited-slip rear differential. And if you'd prefer just the  performance package items without the Sport trim's aesthetics and interior  bits, Alfa Romeo offers Ti Performance package, which also includes the  column-mounted paddle shifters. The Harman Kardon premium audio system is an  option as well.</p>, <p>The  Giulia <strong>Quadrifoglio</strong> is the star of  this show with its 505-hp V6 engine. It comes mated to an eight-speed automatic  transmission and features fuel-saving cylinder deactivation. Sadly, the  six-speed manual transmission available in Europe isn't available in the  U.S.-market models at this time.</p>, <p>The  Quadrifoglio's list of standard equipment is lengthy, which is good news for  buyers. There's a high-performance Brembo brake system and a torque-vectoring  rear differential that can transfer 100 percent of available power to either  rear wheel. A two-mode exhaust with bypass valves offers varying levels of  engine music depending on your mood, and a carbon-fiber active front splitter  adjusts for more aerodynamic downforce at speeds above 75 mph. An adaptive  suspension and 19-inch wheels with super-sticky Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires  round out the big hardware items. </p>, <p>Looking  over the Quadrifoglio, you'll be able to pick out the aggressive model-specific  details such as the front fascia, grille, carbon trunk spoiler, bi-xenon  adaptive headlights, and rear diffuser with quad exhaust tips. But beneath the  painted surfaces hides a lightweight hood and roof made of carbon fiber. Moving  inside, you'll find carbon-fiber trim, additional drive modes, and almost all  of the features that are optional on the less expensive Giulias. </p>, <p>A  few options are available at the Quadrifoglio level. They include the Driver  Assistance Dynamic Plus package mentioned earlier, leather and simulated-suede  ultra-high-performance Sparco carbon-fiber racing seats (driver and  front-passenger seats with two-way and four-way power adjustments,  respectively, and no heat), a carbon-fiber-detailed steering wheel and an  ultra-high-performance Brembo carbon-ceramic brake system.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio is the latest entry into the compact luxury crossover  SUV crowd. It differentiates itself through an appeal to emotion and driving  enjoyment. To that end, it boasts distinctive styling, a powerful engine, and a  name borrowed from a winding road in northern Italy. </p>, <p>Though  the name might seem a better fit on a sports car, the Stelvio backs it up with  sharp handling, accurate steering, and an engine that's eager to break speed  limits. Indeed, Alfa Romeo has ensured that driving enthusiasts will find  plenty to enjoy about this SUV, from outfitting Sport trims with satisfying and  enormous aluminum shift paddles to offering a rear locking mechanical differential. </p>, <p>The  third vehicle Alfa Romeo has introduced during its return to the United States,  the Stelvio is based largely on the Giulia sedan, sharing its powerful  turbocharged four-cylinder engine, chassis and trim levels. Also like the  Giulia, the Stelvio will also be available in a high-performance, turbo  V6-powered Quadrifoglio variant that will be available early next year. </p>, <p>Favoring  sport means a few trade-offs when it comes to utility. The Stelvio is a little  smaller than most of the SUVs it competes against, resulting in a more compact  second row and tighter cargo volume. Its towing capability falls on the low  side, and it is not intended to go off-road. The interior is also a little  plain when compared to other options. </p>, <p>Still,  the Stelvio's appeal rests on its special charm and character, and for that we  think it's worth your consideration. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Alfa Romeo is a compact, all-wheel-drive crossover luxury SUV that's  available in three variants: a base <strong>Stelvio</strong>,  luxury-oriented <strong>Ti</strong> and  high-performance <strong>Quadrifoglio </strong>that  will be available early next year.<strong> </strong>The  solidly equipped base and Ti models come with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline  four-cylinder (280 horsepower, 306 pound-feet of torque) and an eight-speed  automatic with all-wheel drive. The Quadrifoglio is a different animal  entirely, with its stiffer suspension tuning, stickier tires and  Ferrari-derived twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V6 (505 horsepower, 443 pound-feet  of torque). </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>Stelvio </strong>comes standard with  features such as 18-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers, Brembo brakes,  xenon headlights, roof rails, a power liftgate, keyless ignition and entry,  dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient interior lighting, leather  upholstery, 10-way power-adjustable front seats and adjustable drive settings.  Technology features include a large driver information display, a 6.5-inch  central touchscreen, a rearview camera, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support,  four USB ports (two in front and two charge-only ports for rear passengers) and  an eight-speaker stereo system. </p>, <p>The <strong>Ti </strong>comes with more standard  equipment, including 19-inch wheels, front parking sensors, an 8.8-inch touchscreen, satellite radio, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. </p>, <p>A <strong>Sport</strong> package, available for both  trims, adds larger diameter wheels (19 inches for base, 20 inches for the Ti),  different exterior and interior trim, paddle shifters and stiffer suspension  tuning. On top of that, the Ti gains sport front seats with power-adjustable  bolsters. </p>, <p>A  Ti-specific Performance package (late availability) adds a driver-adjustable  adaptive suspension and a rear mechanical locking limited-slip differential,  while a Ti Lusso package adds upgraded front seats, additional leather  upholstery and upgraded interior trim. </p>, <p>Additional  safety features are available through separate Static and Dynamic driver  assistance packages. The former adds blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert and auto-dimming mirrors. The latter includes adaptive cruise control,  forward collision warning and mitigation, lane departure warning and auto high  beams. </p>, <p>A  Convenience package adds an adjustable rail cargo system, 115-volt auxiliary  power and cargo net, and is available with or without a hands-free liftgate.  Both the base and Ti offer a similar pool of stand-alone options that include  navigation, Harman Kardon audio, a dual-pane sunroof, and a variety of wheel  types and exterior colors. </p>]

[<p>Ferrari  and Lamborghinis offer the ultimate in European performance while Bentley and  Rolls-Royce do the same with luxury. Aston Martin positions itself in the  middle of these two approaches with its 2018 Vanquish S. Its V12 engine  delivers 580 horsepower and a stirring soundtrack, and its interior shows off  Aston's artistry in combining leather, metal and wood. </p>, <p>This year  is likely the last hurrah for the Vanquish, a car that represents the pinnacle  of Aston Martin's lineup, at least from a pricing perspective. Interestingly,  its new DB11 stablemate costs less and carries the many benefits of a fresh  design, from a more powerful turbocharged engine to an updated interior with  modern technology features. Still, purists might consider the snarl from the Vanquish's  non-turbocharged V12 superior, and some might say the Vanquish looks better,  too. For a car whose value rests largely in its presence, both aural and  visual, that's enough for many to choose the Vanquish S.</p>]

[<p>Like most  of the other 12-cylinder vehicles produced in extremely limited numbers and  offered at high cost, the Vanquish S comes in one near fully loaded trim. It  is also available as a coupe or soft-top convertible, called the Volante. The  majority of options provide buyers the ability to tailor the look and feel of  the Vanquish S to their tastes.</p>]

[<p>Whether  you choose the coupe or convertible, the Vanquish S employs a 5.9-liter V12  (580 horsepower, 465 pound-feet of torque) and an eight-speed automatic  transmission. A manual transmission is not available. Standard equipment  includes 20-inch wheels, launch control, a limited-slip differential,  carbon-ceramic brakes, an adaptive suspension, xenon headlights, LED running  lights, power-folding mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview  camera, power-adjustable front seats with heating, leather upholstery,  Bluetooth, navigation, a 6.5-inch display screen, Apple CarPlay, and a  13-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system with satellite radio. </p>, <p>Convertible  models come with rear seats that are optional on the coupe. Other options  include front-seat ventilation, a squared-off steering wheel derived from the  limited-edition One-77, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, lightweight  carbon-fiber seats, and a wind deflector for the convertible. </p>, <p>The rest  of the options provide buyers a wide variety of aesthetic choices regarding  wheels, brake caliper color, and interior leather and trim options. Aston  Martin's personalization program, called Q, allows for even further  customization of colors and trims. So if there's a color combination, style of  stitching, or material you'd love to have, chances are Aston Martin can make it  happen in the Vanquish S. </p>]

[<p>The latest-generation A3 debuted in 2015 and marked a departure from the  generation it replaced, eschewing the hatchback body style for sedan and  convertible body styles. It then received a modest face-lift in 2017. </p>, <p>The A3 debuted just one year after the debut of the  Mercedes CLA-Class, marking the dawn of a new entry-level era among German  automakers. BMW has yet to introduce a sedan in the vein of the others, instead  doing battle with its rear-wheel-drive 2 Series coupe.</p>, <p>The A3 Cabriolet models lose the roof but gain  reinforcements elsewhere to shore up the structure. In the bargain they gained  about 250 pounds compared to their sedan counterparts. The power-folding top is  fully lined, but its narrow rear window and large, unbroken swaths of fabric  obscure visibility.</p>, <p>Under the skin, the A3 is closely related to the  Volkswagen Golf. That's no bad thing, as both are quite accomplished compact  cars. Be aware that it's possible to option up an A3 to an eye-watering degree.  At some point, buyers might consider an A4 over a heavily optioned A3.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi A3 is  offered in four-door sedan and two-door convertible (Cabriolet) body styles.  Both are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The trim levels  are named <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Premium Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong> in Audi speak, which are listed in order of increasing  content.</p>]

[<p><strong>Drawer</strong><em>:</em></p>, <p>The  2018 Audi A3 is offered in four-door sedan and two-door convertible (Cabriolet)  body styles. Both are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The  trim levels are named <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Premium Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong> in Audi speak, which are listed in order of increasing  content.</p>, <p>Front-wheel-drive A3 models have a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (186 hp, 221 lb-ft) and a seven-speed,  dual-clutch automatic transmission. These models have a fuel economy edge over  their all-wheel-drive brothers to the tune of 2 mpg (EPA combined).  All-wheel-drive variants (Quattro) have a similar engine, but a few changes  elevate its gumption to a more robust 220 hp and 258 lb-ft. Perhaps  paradoxically, Quattro variants have one fewer gear in their dual-clutch  automatic transmissions than do front-wheel-drive models. Despite this and  their inevitably heavier weights (160 pounds for sedans; 200 pounds for  convertibles), Quattro models handily out-accelerate their front-wheel-drive  counterparts. No manual gearbox is available on any flavor of A3. </p>, <p>The base <strong>Premium </strong>is well-equipped, sporting features such as leather upholstery, a backup  camera, dual-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, forward collision  warning and automatic emergency braking, a 10-speaker sound system, heated  front seats and an eight-way power driver seat with power lumbar adjustment.  Cabriolet models are similar but have a power-folding soft top, a nine-speaker  sound system and six-way power front seats with lumbar. </p>, <p>For a reasonable sum, <strong>Premium Plus</strong> adds a mix of cosmetics and worthwhile convenience  features such as 18-inch wheels, an eight-way power passenger seat with lumbar,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, keyless ignition and  entry, parking sensors, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration. These models also gain a dose of exterior appearance items such as  revised bumpers, side sill extensions and illuminated aluminum front door  sills. </p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige</strong> goes all out with power-folding mirrors, LED headlights, an expanded Virtual  Cockpit instrument cluster, navigation, a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio  system and a host of driver assistance features (including lane departure warning,  adaptive cruise, automatic high beams).</p>, <p>Some of the features found on the Premium Plus and  Prestige can be added to the lower trims as options.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Audi A3 2.0T Quattro Sedan</strong> (turbo  2.0L inline-4 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current A3 has received some revisions,  including a host of new driver assistance and cabin features. Our findings  remain applicable to this year's A3, however.</p>]

[<p>The regular A3 sedan is very likable car thanks to  its upscale interior, some excellent technology features and an engaging  driving experience. But there's only one way to get a hatchback Audi A3 in the  United States, and that's to opt for the plug-in hybrid e-tron. This version of  the A3 gets you more cargo space, higher fuel economy and 16 miles of  all-electric driving. </p>, <p>With Audi's diesel engines discontinued in the  United States for the foreseeable future, the automaker's competitiveness in  the fuel-efficient car field comes down to this plug-in hybrid. Notably, the A3  Sportback e-tron is the only luxury car of its size and configuration offered  as a hybrid. It's not until you look at the more expensive BMW 330e that you'll  find a plug-in hybrid powertrain in a luxury car. </p>, <p>The A3 e-tron's all-electric range of 16 miles is  decent, and once you're running on gas it offers about the same estimated  combined mileage as the last A3 diesel. But it also weighs about 400 pounds  more than a regular A3 and costs thousands of dollars more. Government  incentives and state tax credits can help offset the cost for new car buyers,  though.</p>, <p>Overall, the A3 e-tron effectively fills its niche.  But along with the 330e, we also think shoppers should look at similarly  capable non-luxury plug-ins such as the Chevrolet Volt, Ford C-Max Energi,  Toyota Prius Prime or even the all-electric BMW i3 with its optional  range-extending gas generator option. </p>]

[<p>The base  2018 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron <strong>Premium</strong> is a well-appointed luxury compact, but it lacks the option for a lot of  desirable technology upgrades. The <strong>Premium  Plus</strong> offers more options, but only the top-of-the-line <strong>Prestige</strong> has all the technology and active safety features many  luxury buyers expect.</p>]

[<p>All  versions of the A3 e-tron are powered by a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder  gasoline engine paired with an electric motor. Total system output is 204  horsepower, and it's sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic  transmission.</p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the <strong>Premium</strong> trim  includes 17-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated power  front seats, leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, keyless ignition and  entry, Bluetooth  connectivity, a rearview camera and a 10-speaker sound system with a CD player,  satellite radio and a USB interface. A forward collision warning system with automatic emergency  braking is also included. </p>, <p>The only  options package available for the Premium trim is the Sport package, which adds  a flat-bottom steering wheel with paddle shifters, front sport seats, a roof  spoiler and 18-inch wheels. This package can be added to any A3 Sportback  e-tron trim.</p>, <p>Moving up  to the <strong>Premium</strong> <strong>Plus </strong>gets you some upgraded interior trim as well as LED  headlights, front and rear parking sensors, an auto-dimming mirror, and  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. You also get access to the  Technology package, an optional extra that includes a 7-inch central display  screen, navigation, a touchpad controller, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay  integration, Audi's Virtual Cockpit gauge cluster display, a premium Bang &amp;  Olufsen sound system and Audi Connect (a 4G LTE connection that integrates  Google voice search and traffic information into the nav system and offers a  Wi-Fi hotspot and a host of connected app services). </p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige</strong> trim includes the Technology  package and also adds lane departure warning and intervention, adaptive cruise  control, automatic high beams, two rear-seat USB ports, power-folding side  mirrors with auto-dimming and heating. Unfortunately, opting for the Prestige  trim is the only way to equip your A3 Sportback e-tron with a full suite of  active safety features and driver aids.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Audi A4 delivers just about everything we expect from a small luxury sedan.  There's quick acceleration, a comfortable ride, and the latest connectivity and  navigation technologies. But the fact that it does it without overwhelming you  makes it, at least for the time being, <em>the</em> car to get in the segment.</p>, <p>The A4 is  a joy to drive, whether you're slicing your way through mountain switchbacks or  just tackling your daily commute. On the inside, Audi's understated yet  attractive interior design makes operating all of the many high-tech features  easy, thanks to the intuitive MMI infotainment system and smartly placed  physical buttons for more common functions. To top it off, the A4 also provides  plenty of space and comfort for front and rear passengers, accommodating even  taller adults in back. </p>, <p>Trust us,  you'll want this car on your short list.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Audi A4 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans">Best AWD Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2017  Audi A4 is a small luxury sedan available in three main trim levels: <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Premium Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong>.  A more fuel-efficient <strong>A4 Ultra</strong> subtrim is also available in conjunction with the Premium and Premium Plus  trims. Under the hood is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (252  horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque). The A4 Ultra's engine is less  powerful (190 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque) but gets better fuel economy. </p>]

[<p>Front-wheel  drive is standard, with all-wheel drive (called Quattro in Audi lingo)  optional. A seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission comes with all A4s.  A six-speed manual transmission is also available but only on all-wheel-drive  A4s. The Ultra is offered only with front-wheel drive. Unless you really want  maximum fuel economy, we'd suggest sticking with the regular A4 engine instead  of the Ultra. You'll feel the power difference.</p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights for the A4 <strong>Premium</strong> include 17-inch wheels, automatic xenon headlights, a forward collision  mitigation system, adjustable drive settings (Audi's Drive Select), a sunroof,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, heated power front seats,  tri-zone climate control and folding rear seatbacks. Standard technology  features include a rearview camera, Audi's MMI infotainment system with a  7-inch central display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, and a  10-speaker audio system with two USB ports.</p>, <p>The  optional Convenience package adds auto-dimming and power-folding side mirrors,  keyless ignition and entry, driver-seat memory settings and satellite radio. </p>, <p>Our  favorite is the next step up, the <strong>Premium  Plus</strong>. You get the Convenience package features as standard, along with  18-inch wheels, LED headlights, sporty (S line) exterior styling flourishes,  front and rear parking sensors, and a 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen  surround-sound audio system. Audi's blind-spot and rear-facing crash mitigation  system, Side Assist and Pre Sense Rear, is also standard.</p>, <p>The main  option for the Premium Plus is the Navigation and Telematics package. This gets  you with Audi Connect online services (includes a 4G LTE connection and Wi-Fi),  a digital instrument cluster (Virtual Cockpit) and an upgraded version of MMI  with an enhanced 8.3-inch display, navigation, voice controls and  fingertip-scrawl recognition.</p>, <p>Finally,  there's the top-of-the-line A4 <strong>Prestige</strong>.  It comes with all of the above as standard plus a head-up display, additional  interior ambient lighting, a top-down parking camera system, lane departure  warning and intervention, and upgraded interior trim. </p>, <p>Notable  options packages include the Sport, Sport Plus, Cold Weather and Warm Weather  packages.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2017 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige Quattro Sedan</strong> (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current A4 has received only minor feature  revisions. Our findings remain applicable to this year's model.</p>]

[<p>While crossovers are undoubtedly more in demand  these days, reports of the station wagon's death are greatly exaggerated. You  might have noticed the wagon's recent resurgence in popularity. Luxury brands,  in particular, are feeding this revival with models such as Buick's Regal TourX  and Jaguar's XF Sportbrake. But some European manufacturers have already been  serving up luxury wagons for years. Audi is one of them, and its latest  offering is the 2018 A4 Allroad.</p>, <p>Like its name suggests, the Allroad is based on the  popular A4 sedan. The Allroad is more expensive than its sibling, but in return  you get greater cargo-carrying utility, standard all-wheel drive and an  increased ride height. That last one helps provide some light off-road ability.  The Allroad's sumptuous cabin also looks more modern and luxurious than what  you'll find in rival wagons such as the BMW 330i wagon and Volvo V60. These  strengths, along with the Allroad's capable handling, comfortable ride and  silent cabin, combine to make one of the best entries in its class. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi A4 Allroad is a five-seat luxury wagon  that offers greater utility and ground clearance than the A4 sedan. The base <strong>Premium </strong>trim is loaded with features,  including leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof and Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto. The <strong>Premium Plus</strong> costs a  little more and adds keyless entry, a blind-spot monitor and satellite radio.  The <strong>Prestige </strong>is significantly more  expensive and counts automated driver and advanced safety systems among its  upgrades. A turbocharged four-cylinder engine, a seven-speed, dual-clutch  automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard. </p>]

[<p>Every A4  Allroad is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (252  horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque). Standard exterior features on the base <strong>Premium </strong>trim include 18-inch wheels,  underbody skid plates, xenon headlights, LED running lights, automatic wipers,  heated mirrors, roof rails, a panoramic sunroof, a power liftgate, an adaptive  suspension, selectable drive modes, and forward collision warning and  mitigation.</p>, <p>Inside,  you also get tri-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, keyless  ignition, heated and eight-way power front seats (with driver four-way power  lumbar adjustment), a driver information display, 40/20/40-split folding rear  seats, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with wheel-mounted shift paddles,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror, interior ambient lighting, Audi's MMI infotainment  system, a 7-inch central display, a rearview camera, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto, Bluetooth and a 10-speaker audio system with a CD player and two USB  ports.</p>, <p>The  Premium can be further bolstered by the Convenience package, which includes  auto-dimming and power-folding exterior mirrors, keyless entry, driver-seat  memory settings, an upgraded driver info display and satellite radio. </p>, <p>The <strong>Premium Plus</strong> trim adds the Convenience  package, LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring,  rear collision preparation and a 19-speaker premium Bang &amp; Olufsen  surround-sound system. </p>, <p>This trim  is also eligible for the Navigation and Telematics package option that adds a  navigation system; Audi Connect services (includes emergency telematics, 4G LTE  connectivity and in-car Wi-Fi hotspot, among other services); a virtual  instrument panel inside the gauge cluster; a touchpad infotainment controller;  and an 8.3-inch central display screen.<strong></strong></p>, <p>At the top  of the range, the <strong>Prestige </strong>trim  includes all of the above, along with automatic high-beam control,  noise-reducing front windows, adaptive cruise control, a head-up display,  enhanced interior lighting, a surround-view camera system, and a lane departure  warning and intervention system.</p>, <p>The  Premium Plus and Prestige trims can be ordered with the Cold Weather (heated  rear seats and a heated steering wheel) and Warm Weather (manual rear sunshades  and ventilated front sport seats with passenger lumbar adjustment) packages.  Rear-seat side airbags are available as a stand-alone option on any trim level.</p>]

[<p>The previous-generation Audi A5 was one of our  favorite luxury two-doors. Sleek styling and a premium interior helped set it  apart from its German rivals. It was getting a bit dated in the last few years,  though, which is why we're happy to see the debut of the redesigned 2018 Audi  A5.</p>, <p>For 2018, the coupe and convertible A5 models  return, joined by a new hatchback (the Sportback) that has four doors. Seeing a  four-door A5 might seem a little strange to you if you're used to the model  just being a two-door. But like the bigger A7 hatchback, the new A5 Sportback  enhances the car's cargo-carrying versatility. Other notable changes this year  include a more powerful four-cylinder engine and the inclusion of Audi's latest  technology and safety features.</p>, <p>Although we haven't yet tested the A5, we have  driven the mechanically similar A4 sedan and higher-performing S5 coupe. With  that background, we're confident stating Audi has another winner on its hands.  The A5 checks all of the boxes required in the class for performance, comfort,  luxury and technology. It gets an additional edge for its sleek styling,  elegantly simple cabin and easy-to-use infotainment system. On top of that,  there are plenty of advanced safety features that its predecessor was missing.  Pitted against the typical leaders in the class that include the BMW 4 Series  and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, we place the A5 at the top. </p>]

[<p>The redesigned  2018 Audi A5 is available in its typical two-door coupe and convertible  (Cabriolet) body styles as well as a new four-door hatchback (the Sportback).  All A5s are available in <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Premium Plus</strong> or <strong>Prestige </strong>trims and are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (252 horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque). All-wheel  drive is also included, as is a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic  transmission. A six-speed manual transmission is only available on the A5  coupe.</p>]

[<p>Standard <strong>Premium</strong> trim features include 18-inch  wheels, xenon headlights, heated mirrors,  automatic wipers, a sunroof, keyless entry and ignition, selectable drive  modes, tri-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, power front  seats, folding rear seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto, Bluetooth, a 7-inch infotainment display with Audi's MMI  interface, a rearview camera, and a 10-speaker sound system with a CD player,  two USB ports and HD radio. Low-speed frontal collision warning and mitigation  is also included.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>Premium Plus</strong> trim gets you  LED headlights, auto-dimming exterior mirrors, front and rear parking sensors,  Audi's Connect Care (with 4G LTE connection and emergency telematics), rear  collision mitigation, blind-spot monitoring, heated front seats, driver-seat  memory functions and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige</strong> trim rounds out the lineup  with a head-up display, a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system, simulated  leather upholstery for the center console and armrests, a digital instrument  panel, remote vehicle function controls via a smartphone app, a top-down  parking camera system, an 8.3-inch infotainment display and a navigation  system.</p>, <p>Most  features on the upper trim levels are available on supporting trims as options.  Other add-ons include 20-inch wheels, high-performance summer tires, sporty S  line exterior embellishments, adaptive steering, a sport suspension, ventilated  sport seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>The  Prestige model is also eligible for the Driver Assistance package (adaptive  cruise control, lane keeping assist, automatic high-beams and a traffic sign  reader) and an adaptive suspension.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Audi A6 should be suffering from diminished appeal. After all, it's been  kicking around without a full redesign for six model years now while its prime  competitors have been completely redone in the past year. It's old news. Well,  that might be true in terms of attracting attention, but in the end, the A6's  appeal has in fact diminished little. This well-rounded luxury sedan continues  to deliver exactly what shoppers in this segment are seeking: room, features,  luxury and performance in abundance. </p>, <p>And  for 2018, there's even more on offer. Not only does the available 3.0T V6 get  more standard power, even the base Premium trim gets treated to the full gamut  of previously optional tech equipment. You no longer have to pay extra for  things such as a proper USB port or Bluetooth audio, while navigation, Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard in a segment where they are almost  always optional. </p>, <p>The  A6 still makes do with Audi's previous-generation MMI tech interface  — the controller is of an older design and you can't get the nifty  Virtual Cockpit gauge display available on Audi such models as the A4, A5 and  R8. It's also less advanced than the interfaces of its newer Benz and Bimmer  rivals. However, this version of MMI still works, and we wouldn't consider it a  major demerit.  </p>, <p>Indeed,  the entire A6's age shouldn't be held against it. Maybe it could have a few  extra features and maybe its conservative styling is getting stale, but in  terms of checking off luxury car boxes, few do it as well without major  drawbacks. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Audi A6 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans">Best AWD Sedans</a> and <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Luxury Sedans">Best Midsize Luxury Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi A6 is a midsize luxury  sedan available in four trim levels: <strong>2.0T  Premium</strong>, <strong>2.0T Premium Plus</strong>, <strong>3.0T Premium Plus</strong> and <strong>3.0T Prestige</strong>. The A6 2.0T has a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 252 horsepower and  273 pound-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard, and it utilizes a seven-speed,  dual-clutch automatic transmission. Optional all-wheel drive (Quattro) is  available, and is paired with an eight-speed automatic. The 3.0T upgrades to a  supercharged 3.0-liter V6 good for 340 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. All-wheel  drive is standard with that engine.</p>]

[<p>Highlights  for the the <strong>2.0T Premium</strong> and <strong>3.0T Premium</strong> include 18-inch wheels,  adjustable drive settings, xenon headlights, LED running lights, automatic  wipers, auto-dimming mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, a sunroof, front and  rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, tri-zone automatic climate control,  eight-way power front seats (includes heating and driver four-way lumbar  adjustment), driver-seat memory settings and leather upholstery. </p>, <p>Standard  tech for the 2.0T includes Bluetooth, Audi's MMI electronics interface, an  8-inch display, navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, <a href="http://www.audiusa.com/innovation/intelligence/audi-connect">Audi Connect</a> (includes 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot  capability) and a 10-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite radio and  media player interface. Also standard is Audi's Pre Sense Basic safety system,  which senses when a collision is imminent and warns the driver, tensions the  seat belts and closes the windows.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium Plus</strong> (2.0T and 3.0T) trim  adds LED headlights, a blind-spot warning system, power-folding mirrors,  four-zone climate control, a power-adjustable steering wheel and a Bose  surround-sound audio system. </p>, <p>At  the top of the line is the <strong>3.0T Prestige</strong>.  It has the above equipment plus a top-view parking camera system, a power  trunklid, a head-up display, ventilated front seats, front passenger adjustable  lumbar, a power rear sunshade and manual rear side-window shades. </p>, <p>From  here, Audi offers a variety of optional packages to further equip the A6. Keep  an eye out for the Driver Assistance package (adaptive cruise control, the  top-view camera system but with added front and rear corner views, lane  departure warning and intervention, and forward collision warning and  mitigation with automatic braking) and the Comfort Seating package  (individually contoured and ventilated front seats with passenger-seat memory  settings and massage function).</p>, <p>There's  also the Competition package that comes with 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned  suspension, a high-performance rear differential, sport front seats, upgraded  leather upholstery, and various sporty styling flourishes inside and out. </p>]

[<p>There  are typically multiple versions of each vehicle, although many aspects are  shared. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Audi A6 3.0T Quattro Prestige</strong> (turbo 3.0L V6 | 8-speed automatic | AWD)</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current A6 has received some minor  revisions, including more power for the V6 engine. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's A6, however.</p>]

[<p>When you're golfing and sink a  hole-in-one, there's little need to ask for a mulligan. Indeed, 2018 represents  yet another year for the Audi A7 with only the mildest of updates. It's fair to  say that Audi got this car right back when it introduced the A7 for 2012. The  A7 has not only been a success for Audi, but it has inspired numerous copycats.  The A7's fastback roofline is everywhere, from humble compact sedans to fellow  luxury models. </p>, <p>The great thing about the A7, though, is  that there's more to it than just gorgeous styling. It's actually one of those  cars that manages to be both beautiful and practical. That same fastback rear  end that does wonders for its looks also conceals a huge hatchback trunk that's  far more spacious and accessible than what regular sedans offer. And although  the back seat doesn't have as much headroom as those regular sedans, we also  wouldn't classify it as squished. </p>, <p>Then there's the matter of its refined  driving manners, superb 340-hp V6, impeccably crafted interior and well-stocked  features list. And, sure, it's pricier than a comparably equipped A6, but on  the other hand, the A7 also undercuts its sedan and coupe rivals by quite a  bit. So although no car is an easy choice in this class, the 2018 A7's  best-of-many-worlds attributes hold particular appeal.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi A7 is a midsize luxury car  with a hatchback cargo area (Audi dubs this body style a  "Sportback"). There are two trim levels — <strong>Premium Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong> — that both come with a supercharged 3.0-liter  V6 engine (340 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel  drive. Note that there are higher-performance <a href="/audi/s7/2018/">Audi S7</a> and <a href="/audi/rs-7/2018/">Audi RS 7</a> versions available,  which we review separately. </p>]

[<p>The base<strong> Premium Plus</strong> trim level comes standard with 19-inch wheels,  adjustable drive settings (Audi Drive Select), blind-spot monitoring, Audi Pre  Sense Basic (a forward collision warning system), automatic and adaptive LED  headlights, a power liftgate, automatic wipers, auto-dimming and power-folding  mirrors, parking sensors, and keyless ignition and entry.</p>, <p>Inside, you get a sunroof, four-zone  automatic climate control, eight-way power-adjustable front seats (with heating  and driver four-way lumbar and memory settings), leather upholstery, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, a rearview camera, the MMI electronics interface  (8-inch display, knob controller, touchpad), a navigation system, voice  controls, <a href="//www.audiusa.com/innovation/intelligence/audi-connect" target="_blank">Audi Connect</a>,  Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a USB port, Bluetooth and a 14-speaker Bose  surround-sound system with a CD player, satellite radio and a media player  interface.</p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige</strong> adds ventilated front seats, passenger lumbar adjustment, a head-up display, a  corner view parking camera and power-closing doors. </p>, <p>Available on both trim levels is the  Competition package, which adds 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a  high-performance rear differential, high-gloss black trim pieces, sport seats  with upgraded leather, a flat-bottom sport steering wheel, and a four-seat  cabin configuration with more contoured rear sport seats.</p>, <p>The Cold Weather package adds heated rear  seats and a heated steering wheel. The Driver Assistance package adds adaptive  cruise control, a forward collision warning and automatic braking system, lane  departure warning and intervention, and automatic high beams. The Comfort  Seating package (not available with the Competition package) adds upgraded  leather and ventilated front seats with massage functionality and extra  adjustments. The S line Sport package adds 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned  suspension, special exterior flourishes and a black headliner.</p>, <p>Other options include rear side airbags  and a Black optic package that adds gloss-black 20-inch wheels and exterior  trim. </p>]

[<p>There  are typically multiple versions of each vehicle, although many aspects are  shared. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Audi A7 Prestige Quattro sedan</strong> (supercharged 3.0L V6 | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the Audi A7 has received some minor updates,  including a bit more power and new smartphone integration functionality.

[<p>Other German luxury sedans have  endeavored to be flashier and more opulent in recent years, wowing and often  overwhelming occupants with state-of-the-art tech and showy displays of luxury.  The 2018 Audi A8 takes a different path. It's a more conservative entry in the  vaunted flagship luxury segment and pampers you without boasting to the world  that you're being pampered. Perhaps that won't be for everyone in this day and  age, but we think this more subdued approach has a lot of merit. </p>, <p>This generation A8 is entering its sixth  year without a full redesign, however, and is behind the times in a few areas.  Features such as Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Audi's excellent Virtual  Cockpit control interface are not available. Even a simple USB port isn't  available; the A8 still uses Audi's older proprietary cable interface for  connecting phones. A next-generation A8 is expected for 2019, and it will no  doubt be fully up-to-date. </p>, <p>Overall, though, the 2018 A8 gives up  little in terms of comfort, luxury and performance. The 4.0T engine, a  450-horsepower turbocharged V8, is of special note for its ability to sprint  from zero to 60 mph in about 4 seconds while matching the 22 mpg combined of  the standard V6. That engine is no slouch, but when you can get 117 more horsepower  and the same fuel economy for a reasonable price premium, isn't it an easy  choice? </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi A8 is a flagship luxury  sedan comes in a single, long-wheelbase L body style — hence the name  A8 L. There are two trim levels available, each corresponding to a different  engine. The <strong>A8 L 3.0T</strong> has a  supercharged 3.0-liter V6 good for 333 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque.  The <strong>A8 L 4.0T</strong> has a turbocharged  4.0-liter V8 good for 450 hp and 444 lb-ft of torque. All A8 models come with  an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>A8  L 3.0T</strong> comes standard with 19-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, LED  headlights, a sunroof, heated and power-folding mirrors, auto-dimming mirrors,  parking sensors, a rearview camera, power door closers, a power trunklid, and  keyless ignition and entry.</p>, <p>Inside, you get four-zone automatic  climate control, leather upholstery, extended leather interior trim, 14-way  power-adjustable front seats (with heating and four-way lumbar adjustment),  driver-seat memory settings, a power-adjustable steering wheel and power rear  sunshades. Standard electronic equipment includes Audi's previous-generation  MMI infotainment interface, a navigation system, 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, voice  controls and a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system with a CD player,  satellite radio, a media player interface and one Audi proprietary  power/information port for smartphones. There is no USB port. </p>, <p>The <strong>A8  L 4.0T</strong> adds the V8 engine, 20-inch wheels, additional sport-themed styling  tweaks, a panoramic sunroof, diamond-stitched leather upholstery, simulated  suede headliner, 18-way adjustable multicontour front seats (with ventilation  and massage), a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, a trunk pass-through,  a top-view parking camera and a head-up display.</p>, <p>The 3.0T can be specified with the  Executive package, which includes the 4.0T's 20-inch wheels, a panoramic  sunroof, multicontour front seats, heated steering wheel and rear seats, trunk  pass-through, a top-view parking camera and head-up display, along with  adaptive cruise control, a forward collision warning system (Audi Pre Sense  Plus), lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic high beams. Those  driving aids are included in the 4.0T's Executive Plus package, which also adds  power-adjustable outboard rear seats (with ventilation, massage and lumbar  adjustment).</p>, <p>Both trims can be specified with a Black  optic package, which adds a variety of dark exterior pieces and a choice of 20-  or 21-inch wheels. </p>]

[<p>Buying or leasing a subcompact premium crossover is  a great way for you to own a top-tier luxury-branded vehicle without paying  much money. But while these vehicles feature attractive starting prices, the  price adds up quickly once you start tacking on expected luxury-oriented  features such as leather seating or a sunroof. Luckily, somebody must have  forgotten to tell Audi because the 2018 Q3 is feature-rich and much less  expensive than its rivals.</p>, <p>In its base form, the Q3 comes with leather  upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, a rearview camera, front and rear parking  sensors, and heated front seats. These are all optional extras on the Q3's  chief competitors, the Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 and the BMW X1. Combine the superb  value with Audi's traditionally excellent interior materials and a comfortable  ride quality and you've got a small luxury crossover SUV that's tough to  ignore. But the Q3 has some faults. It's not much fun to drive around turns  quickly, and steering feel is completely numb and disconnected. The engine also  disappoints; it's thirsty and doesn't have enough power to accelerate the Q3  with any real authority. There's also a notable lack of the latest in-car  infotainment features. But if speed and tech aren't priorities, the Q3's price  tag is sure to entice. </p>]

[<p>Despite being the smallest and most affordable  crossover in the lineup, the 2018 Audi Q3 is loaded with features even in the  base <strong>Premium </strong>trim. But there's also  the <strong>Premium Plus</strong>, which comes with  even more. All Q3s  are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 200  horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque. It's paired to a six-speed automatic  transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and an all-wheel-drive system  (Quattro) is available. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>Premium</strong> is very well equipped with  standard features that include 18-inch wheels, automatic xenon headlights and  wipers, LED daytime running lights and taillights, silver roof rails, a  panoramic sunroof, heated mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview  camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, a monochrome driver information display, heated and eight-way  power-adjustable front seats (with four-way lumbar adjustment), a 60/40-split  folding rear seat, leather upholstery, ambient interior lighting, Bluetooth, a  charge-only USB port, and a 10-speaker audio system with a CD player, an SD  card slot, satellite radio and Audi's proprietary digital music interface with  a Lightning (iPhone) adapter cable.</p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>Premium Plus</strong> adds the  contents of the Premium's Convenience package (keyless entry and ignition, a  power liftgate, an auto-dimming mirror and aluminum interior trim). It also  includes LED headlights, aluminum exterior trim, power-folding exterior mirrors  (with auto-dimming on the driver side) and blind-spot monitoring, which we think is invaluable given  the Q3's large blind spots.</p>, <p>Two  features packages are available for either trim (though the Premium must be  ordered with the Convenience package). The Sport package adds 19-inch wheels, front sport seats, selectable driving  modes and steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles. The Audi MMI Navigation Plus  package adds a navigation system with online services and a color driver  information display.</p>, <p>Adding the  Sport package to the Premium Plus opens the door to the Sport Plus package,  which includes sportier exterior styling elements and a different wheel design. </p>, <p>The only  option available for both trims are the unique wheels from the Sport Plus  package. The Premium Plus can also be ordered with wood inlays (replacing the aluminum  trim) and a 14-speaker Bose audio system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2015 Audi Q3 Premium Plus Quattro SUV</strong> (turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 |  6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Q3 has received some revisions,  including revised styling and the introduction of the base Premium trim level.  Our findings remain applicable to this year's Audi Q3.</p>]

But Audi's Q5, first launched in 2009, sold so successfully that  it eventually became the company's best-selling vehicle in America. When it  comes to tinkering with that kind of success, you tread cautiously. Which makes  the 2018 Audi Q5 a measured, if overdue, arrival. </p>, <p>The  new Q5 isn't a stylistic departure from its predecessor. The lines are bit  crisper, tighter, narrower. The sheet metal now looks more spun from the larger  Q7 crossover. But these subtle evolutions mask deeper changes under the metal.  The Q5 now rides atop an all-new chassis based on the latest A4 sedan. It's  longer, wider and taller, not by much, but enough to open up more room in the  cabin for rear passengers and cargo loads. More significantly, the new chassis  yields a far smoother ride than before, addressing a frequent complaint leveled  against the outgoing model. </p>, <p>The  standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine carries over, but it now offers more  power. The Quattro all-wheel-drive system for which Audi is renowned also  receives a major overhaul in the Q5, now transformed into a primarily  front-wheel-drive system that can engage the rear wheels in less than a  half-second when traction is required. </p>, <p>Significant  changes also come with technology and driver-assistance features; the lack of  the latter was also a knock on the previous Q5. This new model remedies the  situation with available features such as blind-spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert and city-oriented automatic emergency braking at speeds up  to 52 mph. </p>, <p>All  of which makes the 2018 Audi Q5 worth the wait if you're looking for a premium  crossover that can mix it up as equally on dry roads as those covered in snow  or dirt. In this space increasingly crowded with alternatives from BMW,  Cadillac, Jaguar, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz, the Audi Q5 remains a standout.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Audi Q5 is available in <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Premium Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong> trim levels. All trims come with a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (252 horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque) joined to a  seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. </p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment on <strong>Premium</strong> trims includes  18-inch wheels, roof rails, a rear spoiler, automatic xenon headlights with LED  running lights, LED taillights, rain-sensing wipers, heated side mirrors and a  power liftgate. Inside you'll find push-button ignition, cruise control,  leather upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, eight-way power front  seats (with four-way power lumbar adjustment), auto-dimming rearview mirror,  transmission shift paddles, a 40/20/40-split folding and reclining rear seat, a  rearview camera, Bluetooth phone connection, and an infotainment system  featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. Automatic emergency  braking for vehicles and pedestrians at speeds up to 52 mph (called Pre Sense  City) is also standard. </p>, <p><strong>Premium Plus</strong> models add a panoramic sunroof, LED  headlights, auto-dimming side mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, keyless  entry, heated front seats with driver-seat memory settings, satellite radio,  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p><strong>Prestige </strong>models combine the features listed  above with 20-inch wheels, noise-insulated side windows, a head-up display,  ambient cabin lighting, a bird's-eye view parking camera, a Bang &amp; Olufsen  surround-sound system, a touchscreen navigation system, a Wi-Fi connection and  a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster display.</p>, <p>Premium  trims can add the Convenience package (eight-way power seats, keyless entry,  heated side mirrors and satellite radio); the Navigation and Telematics package  (touchscreen navigation, Wi-Fi and digital gauge cluster); or a handful of  stand-alone options including 19-inch wheels, heated front seats, panoramic  sunroof and rear side airbags. </p>, <p>Options  for Premium Plus trims include 19- or 20-inch wheels, touchscreen navigation,  ventilated sport front seats, heated rear seats and heated steering wheel, the  upgraded audio system, Wi-Fi and rear side airbags.</p>, <p>Heated  rear seats and steering wheel and ventilated sport seats are also available on  Prestige models, as are the rear airbags, aluminum or ash wood trim inlays, and  an adaptive damping suspension. A fixed roof can also replace the standard  panoramic sunroof on Premium Plus and Prestige trims.</p>]

[<p>The Audi Q7 is one of the top luxury crossovers in  the midsize segment. It offers an appealing combo of performance, comfort,  technology and value. Its well-built interior and advanced suite of  semiautonomous driver-assistance features are also noteworthy.</p>, <p>The Q7 may be Audi's biggest SUV, but it's  surprisingly nimble for its size, especially when equipped with the optional  adaptive air suspension and four-wheel steering. Combine that with good  visibility and willing engines and the Q7 is a pleasure to drive. And if you're  not in the mood to drive, the Q7's optional driver aids will not only keep you  in your lane, but they will also anticipate turns and adjust to local speed  limits. </p>, <p>Beyond the impressive technology features, the Q7's  interior is filled with high-quality materials and offers exceptional comfort.  It's also extremely quiet and capable of smoothing out rough roads. The engines  offer usable power and reasonable fuel economy thanks to this generation Q7's  weight loss.</p>, <p>As much as we like the 2018 Audi Q7, its biggest  weakness is cargo capacity. Both the <a href="/mercedes-benz/gls-class/">Mercedes-Benz  GLS-Class</a> and <a href="/volvo/xc90/">Volvo  XC90</a> boast more space, along with appealing interiors. Prospective buyers might also  want to look at the sporty and well-rounded <a href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> and <a href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>.  There are a lot of strong entries in this segment, but the Q7 is one of the  best, whether in base trim or fully loaded.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi Q7 is available in three trim levels.  The entry-level <strong>Premium</strong> trim comes  with enough features to satisfy many buyers but has only limited access to  optional upgrades. From there, the <strong>Premium  Plus</strong> trim adds a few extras, and it can be more thoroughly upgraded and  customized. Finally, the range-topping<strong> Prestige</strong> trim bundles quite a few features and has access to some exclusive  options. </p>]

[<p>Two engines are available for the Q7. The base  engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. It's only available in the Premium or Premium Plus trim levels. The upgraded  supercharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder produces 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft, and is offered in  all three trims. Both engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic  transmission and standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium</strong> trim includes leather upholstery, heated  eight-way power-adjustable front seats, three-zone climate control, keyless  entry and start, and a panoramic sunroof. Standard technology features include  a rearview camera, 7-inch color driver information display in the gauge  cluster, and Audi's MMI user interface with a 7-inch central display, Bluetooth  connectivity, two USB ports and a 10-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Some active safety features are also included on the  Premium trim. Audi Pre-Sense Basic with Pedestrian Detection, which takes steps  to mitigate injury and damage in a collision, is standard. You also get front  and rear parking sensors and a rearview camera along with a power-folding  third-row bench, split-folding second row, auto-dimming rearview mirror, power  rear liftgate, HomeLink garage door opener, heated power-folding side mirrors,  and LED running lights and taillights.</p>, <p>Only two major packages are available for the  Premium trim. The Cold Weather package adds heated rear seats and a heated  steering wheel. The MMI Navigation Plus package adds navigation that allows you  to search for locations with Google Voice Search, smartphone integration, and a  handful of other connected features. </p>, <p>Moving up to the <strong>Premium Plus</strong> trim adds the MMI  Navigation Plus package, along with an upgraded Bose sound system, an electric  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, blind-spot monitoring with Pre Sense Rear,  auto-dimming exterior mirrors and interior LED accent lights.</p>, <p>The Premium Plus trim also has access to quite a few  optional packages.

---http://edmunds.com/audi/q7-e-tron/2018/review---http://edmunds.com/audi/r8/2018/review
[<p>  Fully  redesigned last year, this mid-engine and all-wheel-drive super sports car  shares its engine and underlying structure with the Lamborghini Huracan. Though  it looks decidedly less dramatic by comparison, its performance is anything  but. </p>, <p>While the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is happy to engage launch control and  fling the R8 ahead at exhilarating speeds, it's just as happy loping around  town at low speeds. The interior contains a large digital display gauge  cluster, while the adaptive dampers on the coupe and the Spyder ensure a calm,  daily-drivable ride. The Spyder's folding soft top takes 20 seconds to open or  shut, and it can do either at vehicle speeds up to 31 mph. </p>, <p>Clearly  the genius of the R8, past the born-for-Hollywood design of the original, is  how it pairs incredible performance with real-world drivability. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Audi R8 is available as a coupe or convertible (the Spyder). Aside from  the folding roof, the coupe and convertible are largely the same in terms of  standard equipment. A performance-oriented Plus<strong> </strong>trim is available for the coupe. It offers more horsepower and a  lower weight but sacrifices some comfort for the sake of speed. </p>]

[<p>The  R8's engine is a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 (540 hp, 398 lb-ft of  torque) paired with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission and  all-wheel drive (Quattro). Standard feature highlights include 19-inch wheels,  LED headlights, adaptive suspension dampers, keyless ignition and entry,  leather upholstery, a digital gauge cluster display (Audi's Virtual Cockpit),  Audi's MMI infotainment interface, a navigation system, Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay, and 13-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system. The Spyder adds a  folding soft top and a glass wind blocker. </p>, <p>Options  for the R8 are pretty much limited to different wheels and additional interior  trim and upholstery choices, though carbon-ceramic brakes, laser-enhanced LED  headlights and a variable ratio steering system are also available.</p>, <p>The  R8 Plus<strong> </strong>ups the V10 engine's output  to 610 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque and gains the carbon-ceramic brakes and laser  headlights as standard equipment. It also sports a more stiffly tuned  suspension that lacks the adjustable dampers. In the name of saving weight, it  has a slightly smaller gas tank, a five-speaker sound system and racing-style  seats that lack backrest-angle adjustment. </p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus Coupe</strong> (5.2L V10 |  7-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Audi R8 has received some revisions,  including standard smartphone integration. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Audi R8.</p>]

[<p>For Audi nerds, the arrival of the RS 3  on U.S. shores is a big deal. This fire-breathing compact sedan has until now  been forbidden fruit, with sales limited to overseas markets. The first handful  of RS 3s arriving will bear a 2017 model designation and be identical to the  2018 model.</p>, <p>The RS 3 is what happens when you fortify  Audi's class-leading A3 entry-level luxury sedan with a 400-horsepower  turbocharged five-cylinder engine. Naturally, the brakes and suspension have  been upgraded to match, and most of the A3's and S3's optional equipment has been  made standard on the RS 3.</p>, <p>It's Audi's answer to the Mercedes-Benz  AMG CLA 45 and the terrific BMW M2, both potent performers in their own rights.  The RS 3 is philosophically much closer to the Benz, with its transverse engine  layout and all-wheel drive, while the BMW takes a more classic rear-drive  approach. One thing's for sure — this is the kind of rivalry we can  get behind. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Audi RS 3 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Audi RS 3 is a high-performance variant of the A3 and S3 sedans. It is  available in a single trim level and is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter  five-cylinder engine (400 hp, 354 lb-ft). A seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic  transmission sends power to all four wheels.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features include 19-inch alloy wheels with summer performance tires, automatic  LED headlights, heated and power-folding mirrors, automatic wipers, a panoramic  sunroof, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and ignition, adaptive  suspension dampers, selectable drive modes, dual-zone automatic climate  control, auto-dimming mirrors, leather upholstery, heated eight-way manual  sport seats with power lumbar adjustment, and 40/20/40-split folding rear  seats. Electronic features include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration, a rearview camera, and a 10-speaker audio system with HD and  satellite radio and a USB port. </p>, <p>Most  of the RS 3's options are offered in packages. The Technology package includes  a Wi-Fi hotspot, smartphone vehicle monitoring and control, navigation, an  expanded digital instrument cluster display (Virtual Cockpit) and a Bang &amp;  Olufsen premium audio system. There's also the Dynamic package (wider front  wheels and tires, a sport exhaust and red brake calipers) and the Dynamic Plus  package (a higher top speed, a carbon-fiber engine cover, individual tire  pressure monitors, front ceramic brake rotors and a fixed sport suspension).  Driver assistance features are bundled into a package, and there are two more  packages that largely consist of cosmetic items.</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options are limited to carbon-fiber interior trim, rear-seat side airbags and  premium vinyl-covered armrests and kneepads.</p>]

[<p>There's something intimate about a coupe, even one that's closely related to a  sedan. Perhaps that's because a coupe inherently prioritizes the driver and a  sole passenger over all else. </p>, <p>When the first-generation RS 5 debuted,  it encapsulated that allure quite well. That its non-turbocharged V8 had  character and wound up to stratospheric revs only underscored the sense of  occasion engendered by a coupe.</p>, <p>The redesigned 2018 Audi RS 5, the  second-generation model, trades the fizz and character of the V8 for a  twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6. This new engine, which can also be found under the  hood of the Porsche Panamera 4S, packs a whole lot more punch, particularly  down low in the rev range. However, it doesn't rev as high and it sounds much  more muted than the V8. This is the quandary of modern performance engines  — the demand for more power and lower fuel consumption has resulted  in smaller-displacement turbocharged engines that deliver the goods but can't  quite match the sparkle of a free-revving V8. </p>, <p>The RS 5's standard all-wheel-drive  system transmits all of that power to the ground in a sure-footed way. In the  bargain, it may not be quite as playful as its rear-wheel-drive competitors  when it comes to spirited or track driving. At least you'll have Audi's  terrific cabin environment to luxuriate in, replete with leather, carbon fiber  and satin-finish metal accents. Throw in the available 8.3-inch infotainment  screen and Virtual Cockpit extended instrument cluster and you've got one heck  of a well-rounded, special-feeling coupe after all.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi RS 5 comes in only one trim level, but there are a variety of  option packages from which to choose. Be aware that a few of these packages  have prerequisites; that is, they require you to also opt for other option  packages first.</p>]

[<p>All RS 5s are powered by a turbocharged  2.9-liter (444 horsepower, 443 pound-feet of torque) that drives all four  wheels through an eight-speed automatic. The list of standard equipment  includes 19-inch wheels, full LED headlights, parking sensors, automatic  wipers, keyless entry and ignition, a 7-inch infotainment display, a 10-speaker  sound system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, three-zone automatic climate  control, and a suite of driver assistance systems (forward collision alert with  automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert and intervention, and  blind-spot monitoring).</p>, <p>The <strong>Dynamic  Plus</strong> package is the most expensive, and it provides carbon-ceramic front  brakes and adds direct tire pressure measurement. This package's prerequisite  happens to be the second most expensive option, the <strong>Dynamic </strong>package, which includes variable suspension dampers and a  sport exhaust. Getting <strong>Dynamic Steering</strong>,  which replaces the standard fixed-ratio steering with a variable ratio system,  also requires the Dynamic package.</p>, <p>If you want driver assistance features  such as adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams and a lane keeping  system, tick the box for the <strong>RS Driver  Assistance</strong> package. However, you'll also need to opt for the <strong>Navigation </strong>package, which adds an  8.3-inch MMI infotainment screen and Audi's Virtual Cockpit extended instrument  cluster. </p>, <p>Premium upholstery is what the Fine Nappa  Leather package nets you, which upgrades the leather on the seats, center  console and door armrests and adds LED interior lighting. Audiophiles,  meanwhile, will gravitate toward the Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system.</p>, <p>Interested in cosmetics? Check out the  Black Optic package's 20-inch wheels, gloss black trim and body-color mirrors.  Additionally, a different set of forged 20-inch wheels are optional once you've  selected the Black Optic package.</p>]

[<p>Can a luxury sedan really accelerate to  60 mph in just 3.4 seconds? If it's the 2018 Audi RS 7, most certainly. And  that's the regular version. The Performance trim level, which packs 605  horsepower (up from 560 hp), should be even quicker. </p>, <p>Beyond speed, however, the RS 7 offers  the same virtues as the rest of its siblings in the A7 lineup. It's gorgeous  for one, yet its hatchback body style offers a more versatile cargo area than a  typical sedan. Its cabin is also suitably luxe even if it doesn't have Audi's  latest tech interface. Setting the RS 7 apart, though, is special  honeycomb-stitched leather upholstery and, on the Performance, available blue  stitching and blue-accented carbon-fiber trim. </p>, <p>Quite simply, the 2018 Audi RS 7 is one  of the most desirable cars you can buy. If you have the money and the desire,  it's hard to imagine you'd be disappointed.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Audi RS 7 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sports Sedans">Best Sports Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi RS 7 is a midsize high-performance four-door  with a hatchback body style Audi dubs a "Sportback." Unlike the A7,  which includes five seats, the RS 7 can only be had with a pair of individual  rear sport seats. There are two trim levels, mostly differentiated by  performance. The base <strong>RS 7</strong> has a  4.0-liter turbocharged V8 good for 560 hp and 516 pound-feet of torque, while  the <strong>RS 7 Performance</strong> upgrades that  engine to 605 hp with an overboost function that provides a temporary torque  peak of 553 lb-ft. Both have an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard  all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard features on the <strong>RS 7</strong> include 21-inch wheels, summer  tires, an adaptive sport-tuned air suspension, variable-ratio sport steering, a  sport rear differential, LED headlights, automatic wipers, parking sensors, a  basic collision mitigation system, blind-spot warning, power-folding and  auto-dimming mirrors, a sunroof, a power liftgate, and keyless ignition and  entry. </p>, <p>Inside, you get four-zone automatic  climate control, eight-way power front sport seats with four-way lumbar,  heating and driver seat memory, leather upholstery featuring special RS  honeycomb stitching, a power-adjustable sport steering wheel, a head-up  display, a rearview camera and a corner-view camera system. Also included: an  Audi MMI electronics interface (8-inch display, knob controller, touchpad), a  navigation system, voice controls, Bluetooth, Audi Connect services, two USB  ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, and a 14-speaker Bose  surround-sound audio system. The Black Optic package adds high-gloss exterior  trim to the base RS 7 and a front spoiler and rear diffuser made of carbon  fiber. </p>, <p>The <strong>RS  7 Performance</strong> gains more power, carbon-ceramic brakes, Dynamic Ride Control  (a mechanical damping system that reduces body roll and pitch around corners),  21-inch cast-aluminum wheels, a different bumper design, gloss-black grille  surround, black tailpipes and carbon-fiber mirror housings. An Audi Sport  Titanium exhaust is an exclusive option to the Performance.</p>, <p>Options available on both versions  include the Driver Assistance package, which adds adaptive cruise control with  stop-and-go functionality, a forward collision warning and automatic braking  system (Pre Sense Plus), lane keeping assist and automatic high beams. The Cold  Weather package adds heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel. The Comfort  Seating package swaps out the standard sport seats for less aggressively  bolstered front and rear seats (effectively from the A7) and gains front-seat  ventilation, massage functionality, memory settings for the passenger, and  leather upholstery without the RS honeycomb pattern. Other options include  night vision assist, rear side airbags, a black faux suede headliner, and a  Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system upgrade.</p>]

[<p>If  you want the easy-to-drive qualities of Audi's entry-level sedan, the A3, but  also desire greater acceleration and handling, shop the 2018 Audi S3. The S3's  more powerful engine, performance-oriented tires, sport-tuned suspension and  bigger brakes combine to deliver an exhilarating performance without degrading  the car's all-around usability.</p>, <p>True, the S3 isn't as roomy as its more expensive sibling, the S4 sedan. But  there's enough space for most uses, and the S3's cabin is still handsome and  upscale. You can even get it with Audi's trick Virtual Cockpit instrument  cluster. Fuel economy remains respectable, too. Factor in the S3's standard  all-wheel drive and dual-clutch automatic transmission and you've got a very  user-friendly — and reasonably affordable — luxury sport  sedan.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Audi S3 is offered in two trim levels: <strong>Premium Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong>.  They are pretty similarly equipped, but the Prestige offers more standard  technology features. All S3s have a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine  that generates 292 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque. That power is put  to the ground through a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission and  standard all-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>Premium Plus </strong>include  18-inch wheels, summer performance tires, keyless ignition and entry, front and  rear parking sensors, selectable driving settings (known as Audi Drive Select),  LED headlights, automatic wipers, a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone automatic  climate control, heated front seats, power front sport seats, driver-seat  memory settings, leather upholstery and 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks.</p>, <p>For  the Premium Plus, you also get a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert, Audi's MMI electronics interface (with a console-mounted  controller and a power-retractable display), Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay smartphone integration, a USB port, and a 10-speaker sound system with  a CD player and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Optional  for this trim is the Technology package, which includes an expanded digital  instrument cluster (Virtual Cockpit), an upgraded MMI system (with an improved  display and a touch-sensitive controller), Audi Connect online services (with  4G LTE mobile Wi-Fi), native voice controls, a navigation system and a  14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige </strong>adds the contents of  the Technology package as standard plus heated and power-folding exterior  mirrors (with driver-side auto-dimming), LED interior lighting, adaptive cruise  control, lane departure warning and intervention, and two additional USB ports  for the rear seating area.</p>, <p>Optional on both the Premium Plus and Prestige are a Black Optic Dynamic  package (19-inch wheels with special exterior trim), an S Sport package (red  brake calipers with adaptive suspension dampers) and an S Sport Seat package  (manually adjustable front sport seats with premium leather upholstery).  Stand-alone options include rear-seat side airbags and 18-inch wheels with  all-season tires.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Audi S3 Prestige Quattro Sedan </strong>(turbo  2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Audi S3 has received a few  revisions, including packaging changes and a revised in-car entertainment  system. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's S3.</p>]

[<p>Fully redesigned for 2018, the Audi S4 has wasted no  time in making a powerful statement of intent. This new S4 pushes to the top of  its class with more refined and subtle styling, a thoroughly modern interior  and exhilarating performance.</p>, <p>From a quiet, comfortable and well-thought-out  interior to captivating driving dynamics, there's something for everyone. We  also like the S4's slick integration of the latest technology. Compared to the  BMW 340i and Mercedes AMG C43, the 2018 Audi S4 moves to the forefront. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi S4 is a five-passenger  luxury sport sedan that is the high-performance version of the A4 sedan. It is  available in either <strong>Premium Plus</strong> or <strong>Prestige</strong> trim levels. Both have a  powerful, turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (354 horsepower, 369 pound-feet of torque).  All-wheel drive is standard, as is an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>Premium Plus</strong> trim  include 18-inch wheels with summer performance tires, automatic LED headlights,  automatic wipers, power-folding mirrors with heating, a panoramic sunroof,  front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and ignition, tri-zone automatic  climate control, leather and simulated suede upholstery, power front seats  (with heating and massage functions), driver-seat memory settings,  40/20/40-split folding rear seats, auto-dimming mirrors and interior ambient  lighting.</p>, <p>On the  technology front, you also get Bluetooth, a 7-inch infotainment display, a  rearview camera, a Wi-Fi hotspot, remote control via a smartphone app, Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a 19-speaker Bang &amp;  Olufsen premium surround-sound audio system with a CD player, satellite and HD  radio, two USB ports and dual SD card slots. Additional safety features include  low-speed forward collision warning and mitigation, blind-spot monitoring with  rear cross-traffic alert, and Audi Connect Care emergency telematics.</p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige</strong> trim includes all of the  above, along with a virtual instrument panel display, streaming internet radio  apps, remote vehicle monitoring via a smartphone app, a bigger 8.3-inch  infotainment display, a navigation system, a tracepad feature for infotainment  input and a top-down parking camera system. All of these items are available as  options on the Premium Plus trim.</p>, <p>Other  options include the S Sport package (red brake calipers, adaptive suspension  dampers and sport rear differential); the Warm Weather package (ventilated  front seats and extended premium leather upholstery); an adaptive steering  system; and a heated steering wheel. The Prestige trim is eligible for the  Driver Assistance package that adds traffic-adaptive cruise control, a traffic  sign reader, lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic high beams.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Audi S6 is a car that pampers as well as it performs. On the inside, this  midsize luxury sport sedan boasts a richly trimmed cabin fitted with front  seats that can keep you perfectly comfortable for hours at a time. Or hit the  gas and the S6's 450-horsepower turbocharged V8 will rocket this Audi to 60 mph  in just 4 seconds flat. </p>, <p>If it's  sophisticated entertainment and technology you're after, the S6's got you  covered, too. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration lets you  make the most of the S6's large and clear multimedia interface, and a bevy of  optional features are available to crank up the luxury quotient ever further.  Although the S6's handling abilities are a little underwhelming, the overall  luxury sport sedan package is pretty compelling. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Audi S6 is offered in two trims: <strong>Premium  Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong>. Both share  the same powertrain, body and interior, and differ mainly in the details. </p>]

[<p>Standard  exterior features for the <strong>Premium Plus </strong>trim  include 20-inch wheels with summer tires, S-specific styling elements, xenon  headlights, LED running lights and taillights, a sport-tuned adaptive air  suspension, a sunroof, auto-dimming and power-folding side mirrors, front and  rear parking sensors, a blind-spot warning system, and keyless ignition and  entry.</p>, <p>Inside, you'll find diamond-stitched leather upholstery, selectable drive  modes, eight-way power-adjustable front sport seats (with four-way driver power  lumbar and heating), a power-adjustable steering wheel, driver-seat memory  settings, four-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror  and 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks.</p>, <p>Electronics highlights start with the MMI infotainment system, which includes a  console-mounted control knob with a touchpad that can read your fingertip  scribbles, a central 8-inch display, a navigation system with Google Earth  maps, voice controls and Audi Connect (including enhanced web-based information  services, 4G LTE data connectivity and mobile Wi-Fi capability). Also standard  are a rearview camera, Bluetooth and a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound audio  system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige </strong>trim adds LED  headlights, a power trunklid, a head-up display, LED interior lighting and rear  sunshades (manual for the side windows; power for the rear window).</p>, <p>From this  point, most S6 additional features are organized into optional packages. The  Driver Assistance package<strong> </strong>adds  adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and intervention, a top-down  parking camera system, a forward collision mitigation system with automatic  braking, and automatic high beams. </p>, <p>The Comfort Seating package features upgraded front seats with ventilation and  massage functions, front passenger memory settings, and upgraded leather  upholstery (sans diamond stitching). </p>, <p>The S6 Sport package<strong> </strong>provides  dynamic steering, a torque-vectoring rear differential and a sport exhaust. The  Cold Weather package adds heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel. The  Black Optic package tacks on exclusive 20-inch wheels, body-color exterior  mirrors (instead of the standard silver ones) and gloss-black exterior trim.</p>, <p>Notable  stand-alone options include different 20-inch wheels, rear side airbags and,  for the Prestige only, a night-vision system and a 15-speaker Bang &amp;  Olufsen sound system. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Audi S6 Premium Plus Quattro </strong>(turbo  4.0L V8 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current S6 has received only minor  revisions. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's model.</p>]

[<p>If you scan our "cons" list of  Audi's A7, you'll note that "needs more power" is not among them. Far  from it, in fact, as the car's strong V6 engine allows it to accelerate to 60  mph in a rapid 4.8 seconds. And yet no one ever complained about adding a  twin-turbo V8 with 450 horsepower to a car, and that's exactly what the 2018  Audi S7 gives you. Quite simply, it makes this gorgeous yet practical  hatchback-style sedan even more lustworthy.</p>, <p>Besides performance, practicality and  beauty, the S7 provides the usual Audi virtue of a stylish and impeccably  crafted cabin. It also comes loaded with features. And although Audi's latest  tech isn't available, the previous-generation MMI interface is still plenty  user-friendly and you still get standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. </p>, <p>The S7 does suffer from reduced rear  headroom due to its sleek roofline, and the back has only two seats. If that's  a problem, you could always consider the nearly mechanically identical Audi S6  that also costs considerably less. However, then you'd be giving up the  quintessential S7 style.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi S7 is a midsize  high-performance four-door with a hatchback body style Audi dubs a  "Sportback." Unlike the A7, which comes in a five-passenger  configuration, the S7 can only be had with a pair of individual rear sport  seats. There are two trim levels, <strong>Premium  Plus</strong> and <strong>Prestige</strong>, both of which  come with a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 good for 450 horsepower and 406  pound-feet of torque. A seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission and  all-wheel drive are standard. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>Premium  Plus</strong> trim comes standard with 19-inch wheels, full LED exterior lighting,  an adaptive air suspension, a sunroof, a power liftgate, parking sensors, a  rearview camera, a blind-spot monitoring system, heated auto-dimming mirrors,  automatic wipers, and keyless ignition and entry.</p>, <p>Inside, you get standard four-zone  climate control, power-adjustable front seats with heating, driver-seat memory  settings, diamond-stitched leather upholstery, a power-adjustable steering  wheel, a head-up display and Audi's MMI electronics interface (8-inch display,  knob controller, touchpad). Also on the list: a navigation system, voice  controls, Bluetooth, <a href="http://www.audiusa.com/technology/intelligence/audi-connect">Audi Connect</a>, two USB ports, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration, and a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound audio  system with a CD player, satellite radio, HD radio and a media player  interface. </p>, <p>The <strong>Prestige</strong> gains 20-inch wheels,  high-performance summer tires, LED cabin lighting and soft-closing doors.</p>, <p>On  either trim, an available Driver Assistance package adds adaptive cruise  control, a forward collision warning and automatic braking system (Pre Sense  Plus), lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic high beams. The S  Sport package adds upgraded steering, a sport rear differential and sport exhaust.  The Comfort Seating package supplants the standard diamond-stitched sport seats  for ventilated front seats with massage and memory settings for both seats. The  Cold Weather package adds heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel. The  20-inch Black Optic package gets you 20-inch dark-colored wheels and high-gloss  black exterior trim. Rear side airbags are a stand-alone option. </p>, <p>Optional  for the Prestige only are 21-inch wheels, a night-vision assist system and a  Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system upgrade.</p>]

[<p>There  are typically multiple versions of each vehicle, although many aspects are  shared. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Audi S7 </strong>(turbo 4.0L V8 | 7-speed  dual-clutch automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current S7 has received only minor changes.

[<p>Few sedans  are more powerful than the 2018 Audi S8. With 605 horsepower courtesy of its  twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 and an optional 190 mph top speed, the S8 falls  into an elite group. Combined with standard all-wheel drive, the resulting  acceleration can make some supercars envious. </p>, <p>As  preposterous as its abilities may seem, the S8 remains an understated machine.  It is a flagship luxury sedan, after all, and in this role comfort is as big of  a priority as performance. Like the A8 on which it's based, the S8's interior  boasts extensive leather upholstery and attractive materials throughout. From  its smooth-riding air suspension to its extensive number of standard features,  the S8 delivers on every front.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Audi S8 is a full-size, high-performance luxury sedan that is available only in <strong>Plus </strong>trim. It employs a turbocharged  4.0-liter V8 (605 horsepower, 517 pound-feet of torque) that is connected to an  eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. </p>]

[<p>As Audi's  flagship sedan, the S8 comes well equipped with standard features, including  21-inch wheels, a sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, LED exterior lighting, a  top-down parking camera system, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, a  panoramic sunroof, a power trunklid and soft-close doors. Interior amenities  include keyless entry and ignition, a head-up display, diamond-stitched leather  seating, four-zone climate control, 22-way power-adjustable front seats (with  massage, heating, and ventilation), and power rear window sunshades. The  infotainment system is accessed through an 8-inch retractable center display,  and it's supported by a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound system. Satellite radio  is included, but the S8 continues to have Audi's proprietary music interface  instead of a regular USB port. </p>, <p>Last  year's Cold Weather and Driver Assistance packages have been combined into the  Executive Plus package, which includes lane departure warning and intervention,  traffic-adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and mitigation, a  heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and rear-seat pass-through. The  Dynamics package fits the S8 with carbon-ceramic brakes and increases the car's  top-speed limiter to 190 mph.</p>, <p>Notable  stand-alone options include a night-vision camera system and a 19-speaker Bang  &amp; Olufsen sound system. The rest of the S8's packages are related to  customizing the sedan's color and trim combinations. </p>]

[<p>For 2018, the Audi SQ5 is fully redesigned,  receiving many of the same technology, feature and interior upgrades as the  regular Q5. But it's the SQ5's engine that continues to be this model's biggest  separator from the Q5. Last year's supercharged V6 has been replaced by a new  turbocharged V6, and it should make the SQ5 even more of a blast to drive. It  has the same horsepower as the previous V6 but produces 23 more pound-feet of  torque, and power delivery is lower in the rev range, which will make the SQ5  even punchier.The SQ5's new air  suspension system should also be a nice upgrade and help keep this hefty SUV  flat in corners while providing a better ride quality on rough city pavement. </p>, <p>Daily driving in a SQ5 should be better this year,  too. The biggest issue with last year's model was that it was starting to feel  dated, and the competition had left it behind in terms of technology. This new  SQ5 should fix all of that. Just like the regular 2018 Q5, the SQ5 is packed  with all of Audi's latest and greatest infotainment and safety tech. It finally  even gets USB ports instead of Audi's now — finally, thankfully  — defunct proprietary ports for smartphone integration. On top of all  the new technology, the SQ5 gets a welcome improvement in rear-passenger  legroom and an all-new cabin. We've been very pleased with the quality of  Audi's current-generation interiors, and the SQ5 should be no exception. </p>, <p>If you're shopping for a luxury crossover with the  spirit of a Euro hot rod, the new SQ5 should be a great choice.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Audi SQ5 comes in either <strong>Premium  Plus</strong> or <strong>Prestige</strong> trims. This  means every SQ5 comes very well-equipped. But there are still plenty of  upgrades to be had in terms of luxury, technology and performance.</p>]

[<p>All  versions of the SQ5 will get a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 good for 354  horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. Those numbers aren't a giant increase  over the outgoing supercharged V6, but Audi says maximum torque is available  much lower in the rev range. The new SQ5 should feel quicker when accelerating  from a stop or performing passing maneuvers. The SQ5 also comes with all-wheel  drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Standard  equipment highlights on the <strong>Premium Plus</strong> include 20-inch wheels, LED headlights, parking sensors, a panoramic sunroof,  keyless entry and ignition, an adaptive suspension, a power liftgate,  three-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats,  40/20/40-split folding rear seats, leather upholstery, a 7-inch touchscreen  with Audi's MMI infotainment system, a 10-speaker sound system, and Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. Low-speed collision warning  and mitigation, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are also  standard safety features.</p>, <p>The  SQ5 <strong>Prestige</strong> upgrades the SUV's  technology with Audi's Virtual Cockpit gauge panel, a touchpad controller with  handwriting recognition, a full-color head-up display, a 19-speaker Bang &amp;  Olufsen sound system, a 8.3-inch touchscreen interface, a navigation system, a  top-down parking camera system and extra soundproofing.</p>, <p>You  can get those technology features as options on the Premium Plus. Audi also  offers the S Sport package, which includes an air suspension system with  adaptive ride-height and driving modes, an upgraded rear sport differential,  and a special display mode for the Virtual Cockpit display, which includes a  boost gauge and lap timer. A Driver Assistance package bundles adaptive cruise  control, lane departure warning and intervention, automatic high beams and  speed limit info.</p>, <p>Other  options include a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, manual rear  sunshades, ventilated front seats, rear side airbags, diamond-stitched leather  upholstery, and 21-inch wheels with summer tires.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi TT is fun to drive, has loads of  high-tech features and simply makes you feel great. From its baby R8 style to  its minimalist yet feature-rich interior, it's one of the best choices in a  class of exceptional luxury sport coupe and convertibles. You'd do well to add  it to your short list.</p>, <p>The TT isn't your best choice if it's practicality  you're after. The coupe's rear seats are so tiny that they're pretty much  useless, and the convertible doesn't have rear seating at all. Then again, most  cars in this class lack practicality, and at least with the TT coupe you get a  hatchback design for easier cargo loading. Overall, the TT more than makes up  for any deficiencies with its capable performance and impeccable build quality.  This is one of those rare luxury cars that make you feel as though you're  getting more for your money.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Audi TT is offered in a single trim level as either a four-seat <strong>Coupe</strong> or a two-seat convertible (<strong>Roadster</strong>). Both are powered by a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (220 horsepower, 258 pound-feet)  that is paired with a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission.  All-wheel-drive system is standard.</p>]

[<p>Standard  TT <strong>Coupe</strong> features include 18-inch  wheels with summer performance tires, LED headlights, heated auto-dimming  mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, automatic wipers, a power-deployed  rear spoiler, keyless ignition and entry, selectable drive modes and adaptive  steering.</p>, <p>On the  inside, you get automatic climate control, a virtual instrument panel, leather  and simulated suede upholstery, power-adjustable front seats with heating,  folding rear seats, Audi's MMI infotainment system with a trace pad and voice  control, a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, and a nine-speaker audio  system with satellite radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>From here,  you can add the Technology package, which includes a navigation system, Audi  Connect telematics, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, a blind-spot monitor, Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a 12-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen  premium audio system. The optional S Line Competition package enhances the TT  with 19-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, special exterior and interior  trim, a sport steering wheel and sport seats. You can also get a S Sport Seat  package with full leather upholstery and diamond stitching.</p>, <p>The TT <strong>Roadster</strong> eliminates the rear seats but  gains a center pass-through ski bag along with a folding fabric roof, roll  hoops and a power-deployable wind blocker.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Audi TT Quattro Coupe</strong> (turbo 2.0L  4-cyl | 6-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current TT has received only minor  revisions. Our findings remain applicable to this year's TT.</p>]

[<p>Since it broke onto the scene in 2000, the Audi TT  has consistently impressed us with its distinctive design and weather-beating,  all-wheel-drive traction. Traditionally less impressive has been the car's  performance, but there's a lot to like on that front with the 2018 Audi TTS,  too.</p>, <p>In TTS guise, the car comes with a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine good for 292 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of  torque. Quad exhaust tips, aluminum exterior accents, aero enhancements and  more aggressively bolstered seats with contrast-color stitching round out the  upgrades over the regular TT. </p>, <p>Besides its styling, the TTS is also distinctive in  the way it lines up in the marketplace. It's smaller and lighter than similarly  priced coupes such as the BMW 240i and the Mercedes-Benz AMG C43. However, it's  not as roomy inside as those cars. Audi also offers viable alternatives in its  own house: the related S3 sedan or the bigger S5 coupe. You might even consider  the Volkswagen Golf R, which is the hatchback version of the TTS and S3.</p>, <p>Ultimately, buying a TTS still comes down to how  much you like the car's styling. But at least with the 2018 car, you'll know  that it's got the performance credentials as well.</p>]

[<p>In a nutshell, the 2018 Audi TTS coupe is a  sportier, more powerful variant of the normal TT. It technically offers seating  for four, though the backseats are so small that even children might find them  too confining. It's offered in a single, well-equipped trim level with few  available extras. Motivating the TTS is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder  engine (292 horsepower, 280 pound-feet of torque) that delivers power to all  four wheels via a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. The extreme TT  RS is <a href="/audi/tt-rs/2018/coupe/review/">reviewed separately</a>. </p>]

[<p>The Audi  TTS' standard features include 19-inch wheels with summer performance tires, a  sport-tuned suspension (compared to the regular TT) with adaptive dampers, LED  headlights and taillights, automatic wipers, heated and power-folding side  mirrors, auto-dimming mirrors, a rearview camera, front and rear parking  sensors, and keyless entry and ignition.</p>, <p>Inside, you get a virtual gauge cluster (in lieu of a central display  screen), Audi's MMI infotainment system with touchpad capability and voice  control, automatic climate control, LED ambient lighting, a  tilt-and-telescoping sport steering wheel with wheel-mounted shift paddles,  Audi Drive Select adjustable drive settings, leather and simulated-suede  upholstery, heated eight-way power front seats (with four-way power lumbar  adjustment and power side bolsters), folding rear seatbacks, Bluetooth and a  nine-speaker sound system with a CD/DVD player, an SD card reader, satellite  radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>The TTS has three optional packages. The <strong>Technology</strong> package adds blind-spot monitoring, a navigation system, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto, Audi Connect telematics (with 4G Wi-Fi hotspot capability and  online services) and a 12-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. The <strong>Black Optic</strong> package adds 20-inch wheels  and high-gloss black exterior treatments. The <strong>S Sport Seat</strong> package adds upgraded leather upholstery and additional  leather trim.</p>, <p>Red-painted brake calipers, 20-inch wheels and two-tone upholstery are the  only stand-alone options.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Bentley Bentayga clearly leads the ultra-luxury SUV field. Its 6.0-liter,  twin-turbo W12 makes it astonishingly fast, its sophisticated suspension makes  it impressively comfortable, and its cabin is constructed with some of the  finest materials available on the planet.</p>, <p>The aforementioned engine, the Bentayga's 6.0L W12, puts out 600 horsepower and  663 pound-feet of torque, catapulting it from 0-60 mph in just 4 seconds.  That's an impressive number by sports car standards, but even more so when you  consider the Bentayga's 5,400-pound curb weight. Helping control that weight  through the corners is an air ride suspension. Bentley also offers an option  called Dynamic Ride that allows for increased capability, both on the road and  off. It adeptly uses electric motors built into the suspension to reduce body  roll and increase traction.</p>, <p>Inside,  there's no mistaking the Bentayga for anything other than a Bentley. Even  so-called base trim levels use the practically opulent leathers, woods and  metals. From there, personalizing your Bentayga can get as granular as the  commission of owner-specific paint colors, lambswool carpet, and even veneered  picnic tables to match your car. And, as if to prove a point, just four Bentaygas  a year are available with a unique Breitling Tourbillon clock that costs  $168,000. An entire Porsche Cayenne Turbo S would cost less. </p>, <p>Without  doubt, the Bentayga is one of the most outrageous SUVs ever built, and only  those with deep pockets will get the chance to own one. Its considerable  capabilities, however, make it much more than just an expensive timepiece. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Bentley Bentayga is offered in five different trim levels: the base <strong>Onyx Edition</strong>, <strong>Activity Edition</strong>, the <strong>Signature</strong>,  the <strong>Black Edition </strong>and the  range-topping <strong>Mulliner</strong>. Bentley  offers quite a few packages, which the automaker calls  "specifications," for the Bentayga that add on some useful features.  And, as with every car Bentley makes, the company will be happy to customize  the Bentayga however much you can imagine and afford. </p>]

[<p>The  Bentayga can be had in three seating configurations. The rear seat comes  standard as a traditional three-seat bench with a fold-down center armrest.  Four Seat Comfort Specification offers two rear thrones and replaces the center  seat with a console that has additional storage and USB ports. The two rear  seats get nearly the same amount of power-adjustment options as the front  seats, as well as winged headrests, ventilation and massage. Finally, the Seven  Seat Specification adds a third row of seating and replaces the main rear bench  with a more modest set of split-folding seats.</p>, <p>The  only engine available for the Bentayga is a turbocharged 6.0-liter 12-cylinder  (600 horsepower, 663 lb-ft of torque). It's connected to an eight-speed  automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Most  of the Bentayga's trim levels are similar in that they're all highly  customizable, but they do have some basic differences. The regular <strong>Onyx Edition</strong> Bentayga gets 21-inch  wheels, LED headlights, an air suspension with adjustable ride height and  performance settings, split-folding rear seats with heating, three-zone climate  control and separate controls for the rear seat, a panoramic sunroof, an 8-inch  touchscreen with navigation, and Wi-Fi connectivity. It should go without  saying that leather upholstery and wood veneers also come standard. </p>, <p>In  addition to the standard equipment, the <strong>Activity  Edition</strong> gets roof rails, power-operated rear sunshades and a power  liftgate. The <strong>Signature</strong> Bentayga  builds on the standard Onyx equipment with the Mulliner Driving Specification  package, which offers quilted leather panels on the seats and drilled sport  pedals; the City Specification, which adds automatic parking assistance, a  top-view camera, traffic sign recognition, collision detection with automatic  braking, and rear cross-traffic alert; and the All Terrain Specification, which  brings four off-road driving modes, underbody protection, and auto-dimming door  mirrors. You also get Bentley's Dynamic Ride system, which uses electric motors  built into the anti-roll bars to improve ride, handling and traction in all  situations. </p>, <p>The  Bentayga is available with quite a few more extras. Bentley offers everything  from extra sun visors and power sunshades to special ashtrays and cigar  lighters for the front and rear seats. Or perhaps you'd like a leather bench  that folds out of the trunk to provide outdoor event seating. There are also  20-, 21- and 22-inch wheels, mood lighting, privacy glass, a valet key,  lambswool rugs and a retractable tow bar. </p>, <p>Buyers  looking for more entertainment technology have a choice of two upgraded stereo  systems: a 12-speaker system or a 18-speaker Naim system. A rear-seat  entertainment package adds two 10.2-inch touchscreen tables that mount to the  front seatbacks and allow the user to tap into the SUV's infotainment system  and watch digital TV. </p>, <p>The  Bentayga <strong>Mulliner</strong> comes with the  majority of these packages and features as standard equipment and gets special  22-inch wheels, roof rails, a chrome radiator grille, and unique interior and  exterior colors and veneers. The Touring Specification package is optional and  only available on the Signature and the Mulliner. It adds adaptive cruise  control, lane keeping assist, a head-up display, and night-vision system with a  display in the gauge cluster.</p>]

[<p>There's a new 2019 Bentley Continental Coupe set to go on sale this summer,  which means this is the finale for this second-generation Continental  production run. The 2018 Bentley Continental lineup will consist of just the  convertible, but it will continue to be available with five engine varieties. </p>, <p>Unfortunately, the Continental has been  showing its age lately since it lacks many of the latest advanced safety  features and technological upgrades. While it still has plenty of performance,  luxury, refinement and prestige, it's possible that you'll find a rival  convertible to be more appealing.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Bentley Continental<strong> </strong>is only  offered as a convertible as a new 2019 coupe joins the lineup. The convertible  comes in five versions: the <strong>GT V8</strong>, <strong>GT V8 S</strong>, <strong>GT</strong>, <strong>GT Speed</strong> and the <strong>Supersports</strong>. The <strong>GT</strong> <strong>V8</strong> features the V8  engine, while the <strong>GT V8 S </strong>version  makes a bit more power. The remaining Continentals all come with the W12  engine. The regular <strong>GT</strong> serves as the  base. The line then expands with the Continental <strong>GT Speed</strong>,<strong> </strong>which has a more  powerful W12, and the <strong>Supersports</strong>,  which produces even more power. All Continental variants have an eight-speed  automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>Under  the hood of the <strong>GT V8</strong> is a  turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that produces 500 horsepower and 487 pound-feet of  torque. This allows the V8 to accelerate to 60 mph in a claimed 4.7 seconds.  Standard feature highlights include 20-inch wheels, a fabric folding top, xenon headlights, an adaptive air  ride suspension, an 8-inch infotainment screen, and an eight-speaker audio  system with satellite radio. The <strong>GT  V8 S</strong> increases power output to 521 hp and 502 lb-ft of torque. </p>, <p>The  Continental <strong>GT</strong> uses Bentley's  turbocharged 6.0-liter W12 engine, and here it produces 582 hp and 531 lb-ft of  torque. One step up in terms of power and performance, the Continental <strong>GT Speed</strong> has a revised W12 good for 633  hp and 620 lb-ft of torque. The Speed receives 21-inch wheels and sits 10 mm  lower thanks to a sportier suspension calibration. </p>, <p>At  the top, the Continental<strong> Supersports</strong> takes the power levels up an additional notch to 700 hp and 750 lb-ft of torque  by utilizing larger turbos and different internal hardware. The Supersports  features the most aggressive suspension, transmission and stability control  calibration, and it adds carbon-ceramic brake rotors and brake-based torque  vectoring.</p>, <p>Added  features for the V8 S, the GT Speed and the Supersports include gloss-black  exterior trim, sporty exterior enhancements, a sport-tuned suspension and  unique interior trim treatments. As with all Bentleys, buyers can choose from a  dizzying array of exterior and interior colors, wheels, embroidery, stitching,  piping and wood or metallic trim. Notable options across the lineup include an  optional Naim premium audio system, a Wi-Fi hotspot and adaptive cruise  control.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Bentley Mulsanne is one of the most expensive cars you can buy today.  For the $300,000-plus cost of admission, you get a 3-ton, 18-foot (19-foot for  the extended-wheelbase) luxury sedan that is as close to hand-built perfection  as you'll find. As the price suggests, no expense is spared. Only the finest  leather, metals and wood are selected. And if those aren't satisfying enough,  you can opt for a customized Mulsanne that is tailored to your tastes. </p>, <p>More likely than not, you'll be enjoying  the Mulsanne from one of the plush passenger seats. But the driver won't feel  left out thanks to a massive turbocharged V8 under the sculpted hood. Wherever  you might be seated, you'll be treated to one of the most comfortable rides on  the planet. </p>, <p>There's no doubt the Bentley Mulsanne  makes a statement. It's an extravagance that proclaims wealth, taste and  refinement. In this rarefied air, there's really only one other ultimate luxury  sedan that is competing for your impressive budget: the half-million-dollar Rolls-Royce  Phantom. If you're fortunate enough to be considering either, there is no wrong  choice.</p>]

[<p>Bentley offers three versions of the  Mulsanne to suit customer needs. The <strong>Mulsanne </strong>and the <strong>Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase</strong>,  which adds almost 10 inches of rear legroom, are both powered by the same  turbocharged 6.75-liter V8 (505 horsepower, 752 pound-feet of torque). There's  also the <strong>Mulsanne Speed</strong>, which  wrings an extra 25 hp and 60 lb-ft of torque from the V8. All three largely  share the same equipment and options. Bentley offers a number of packages that  add significant upgrades to this already lavish vehicle and nearly limitless  options for customization.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment highlights include  four-zone automatic climate control with separate rear-seat controls, power  rear-window privacy screens, 14-way power-adjustable front seats and eight-way  power-adjustable rear seats (all with heating), a power tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, an eight-speaker sound system, an 8-inch infotainment  touchscreen and, of course, leather upholstery and wood trim.</p>, <p>Outside the cabin, the Mulsanne includes  an air ride suspension, LED headlights and taillights, a sunroof, automatic  soft-close doors and trunk, parking sensors, 20-inch wheels, and keyless entry  and ignition.</p>, <p>There are several packages, which Bentley  refers to as "specifications," that offer some extensive upgrades. </p>, <p>The Comfort Specification adds massage  and ventilation to both front seats and the rear outboard seats, special  comfort headrests with faux suede pads, and two extra loose cushions. On the extended-wheelbase  Mulsanne, the Comfort Specification also adds airline-style reclining seats  with footrests. The Premier Specification adds the much-needed Flying B hood  ornament, stainless-steel door-pillar finishers, a special filler cap, two  umbrellas, a valet key, a veneered cellphone drawer for the front center  console, and a remote-control garage door opener.</p>, <p>The Entertainment Specification adds dual  10.4-inch rear-seat tablets and veneered picnic tables, which deploy from the  front seatbacks. These tablets can be removed from their mounts and used even  outside the car. With this package, you also get the absolutely bonkers  2,200-watt, 20-speaker Naim sound system.</p>, <p>Finally, the Mulliner Driving  Specification adds special 21-inch wheels (although a version of this package  can be had without the wheels), branded treadplate plaques, a sport-tuned  suspension with driver-selectable modes, diamond-quilted and perforated seats  and door panels, a leather headliner, and uniquely machined shift lever, air vent  controls, foot pedals and interior door handles. </p>, <p>The  Mulsanne comes with a host of other optional extras, such as three choices of  drink cabinet (cocktail, bottle cooler with tumblers or bottle cooler with  Champagne flutes — all with bespoke crystal), extra rear-seat vanity  mirrors, black rear-window curtains with power controls, adaptive cruise  control, front corner-view cameras, a chromed radiator shell and lambswool  rugs. </p>, <p>A  number of connectivity options allow owners to track their car with GPS or  control the infotainment from a connected smart device. Also on offer are  digital television reception, in-car Wi-Fi with a 4G internet connection, and  integrated iPad and keyboard docks built into the rear-seat picnic tables.</p>, <p>It's also worth mentioning the options  for color, trim, veneer and embroidery, which number in the hundreds. But, as Bentley is happy to tell  you, its ability to customize any aspect of the car, from custom marquetry to  installing specially built compartments such as humidors or jewelry boxes, is  limited mostly by the buyer's imagination and pocketbook.</p>]

[<p>Even  as the BMW 2 Series hits the midway mark in its current generation, it remains  a strong choice among entry-level luxury sport coupes and convertibles.  Benefitting from elements pulled from more expensive models in the BMW lineup,  the 2 Series boasts plenty of features for the money, strong performance  regardless of which engine you choose, and all of the style and refinement  expected of any BMW.</p>, <p>It's  a joy to drive, whether for its exciting dynamics or just in your daily  commute. Unlike some models in the class that sacrifice comfort for handling,  the 2 Series delivers both at impressive levels. Quite simply, it's a must-see  if you're in the market.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW 2 Series is available as either a coupe or convertible in <strong>230i</strong> or <strong>M240i</strong> trims that are mainly distinguished by engines. The 230i  coupe is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (248  horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque). The M240i gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter  inline six-cylinder (335 hp, 369 lb-ft). Both engines are paired with an  eight-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the rear wheels.  All-wheel drive is available as an option for all models while a six-speed  manual is available at no additional cost on all rear-wheel-drive models except  for the 230i convertible.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>230i</strong> coupe's standard features  include 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, LED foglights, automatic wipers,  selectable drive modes, cruise control, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone  automatic climate control, simulated leather upholstery, power-adjustable front  sport seats, driver memory settings, 60/40-split folding rear seats, a rearview  camera, a 6.5-inch infotainment screen with iDrive control, BMW's  ConnectedDrive telematics, Bluetooth, a USB input, and a seven-speaker sound  system with a CD player and HD radio. The 230i convertible comes with a  power-folding fabric top and a mesh wind deflector.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>240i</strong> coupe or convertible  adds 18-inch wheels, an auto-dimming driver-side and rearview mirror, a sunroof  (coupe only), sporty exterior flourishes, a rear spoiler, a sport exhaust, an  adaptive suspension, upgraded brakes, a universal garage door opener and  satellite radio.</p>, <p>Many  of the 240i's extra features are available as options on the 230i. Notable  option packages include the Driving Assistance package (forward collision  warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and a speed  limit display) and the Premium package (a navigation system, an instrument  panel with added information, remote control of some systems through a  smartphone app, heated front seat and a heated steering wheel). Other add-ons  include 19-inch wheels with summer performance tires, front and rear parking  sensors, adaptive headlights, adaptive cruise control, leather upholstery, a  wireless charging pad, a Wi-Fi hotspot, Apple CarPlay smartphone integration  and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2014 BMW 228i Coupe</strong> (turbo 2.0L  inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | RWD)</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 2 Series has received some  revisions, including some added standard features in 2016, increased power  output, new model names and an updated iDrive system in 2017. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's 2 Series, however.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 BMW 3 Series should make the short list for  shoppers seeking a compact luxury sport sedan. Whether enjoying its blend of  features and refinement or pushing its smooth power and sharp handling to the  limit, you'll be impressed. </p>, <p>Today's 3 Series advances the heritage  that BMW established decades ago when it practically invented the compact  luxury car. The 3 Series is the best-selling car in its class, and for good  reason. Few can match its artful blend of performance and refinement, though  that doesn't stop other automakers from trying. </p>, <p>In either sedan or wagon style, the 3  Series makes few compromises. It's a truly fantastic all-rounder with no  significant flaws — it's simultaneously comfortable and sporty, small  without being confining, and offers fuel-efficient and powerful engines.  There's a 3 Series for seemingly every flavor. Fuel economy a priority? The  diesel-powered 3 Series achieves 36 mpg combined. Need maximum cargo space? The  3 Series wagon offers 53 cubic feet of room. Just want to test the waters of  BMW ownership? The base model 320i, while sparsely equipped for a luxury sedan,  offers the model's hallmark balance and performance for a reasonable price.</p>, <p>It's true that the current generation of  the 3 Series is getting a bit dated, and newer rivals might hold an advantage  in stylistic appeal. Overall, though, the 3 Series is still one of the best.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 BMW 3 Series as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best All-Wheel-Drive Sedans">Best All-Wheel-Drive Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW 3 Series is available in sedan and wagon body styles. (The 3 Series  Gran Turismo hatchback is reviewed separately, as are coupe and convertible  models collectively known as the BMW 4 Series.) Sedans come in <strong>320i</strong>, <strong>328d</strong>, <strong>330i</strong>, <strong>330e</strong> and <strong>340i</strong> trim levels with standard rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive  (called xDrive) is optional on all but the 330e plug-in hybrid. The wagon is  available only in 330i xDrive and 328d xDrive trims. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>320i</strong> is the most affordable way into  a 3 Series, but it lacks many standard and optional creature comforts. It  starts with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (180 horsepower, 200  pound-feet of torque) and a choice of a six-speed manual or an eight-speed  automatic transmission. Standard feature highlights include 17-inch wheels,  remote locking and unlocking, push-button start, automatic wipers, dual-zone  automatic climate control, premium vinyl upholstery, BMW Assist emergency  telematics, Bluetooth connectivity, the iDrive infotainment interface, a  6.5-inch display and a nine-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>The <strong>330i</strong> has a more powerful 2.0-liter  engine (248 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque) as well as LED headlights,  power-adjustable front sport seats, power-folding and heated side mirrors,  auto-dimming mirrors, paddle shifters for automatic transmission-equipped  models, driver-seat memory settings and split-folding rear seatbacks. </p>, <p>The <strong>328d</strong> and <strong>330e</strong> sedans come similarly equipped. Both use a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired only to the eight-speed automatic, but  the 328d engine uses diesel fuel and generates 180 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque.  The 330e engine takes conventional gasoline but is augmented by an electric  motor for a combined 248 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque. </p>, <p>The  328d and 330i wagons are equipped like the sedans and also come with a  panoramic sunroof, roof rails, a power liftgate and the eight-speed automatic  transmission. </p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>340i</strong> sedan has a turbocharged  3.0-liter six-cylinder engine (320 hp and 330 lb-ft), the contents of the  Premium package (see below), keyless entry and ignition, a sunroof and a  16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system (optional on most other models). The M  Sport package (see below) is also standard, but its contents can be replaced by  those from the Sport or Luxury package. </p>, <p>There  are several option packages for the 2018 3 Series. In our opinion, the main  ones to look out for are the Premium and the Executive since they further equip  the 3 Series with a host of desirable convenience and tech-oriented extras. The  Premium package, for example, adds heated front seats, a head-up display, a  navigation system, a 8.5-inch display screen and BMW's Remote Services (can  lock and unlock doors or find car in a parking lot via smartphone app). The  Executive package adds adaptive LED headlights, side- and top-view parking  cameras, and upgraded leather upholstery. </p>, <p>Other  popular picks include the Track Handling package (improves handling and  steering) and the Driving Assistance package that adds many advanced driver  safety aids. <strong></strong></p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is an interesting mix of vehicle traits. It's  not a crossover, but it comes with all-wheel drive and a slightly elevated  seating position. It offers more cargo capacity than a 3 Series wagon and more  rear legroom than a BMW X3, yet most would say it handles very much like a  sedan.</p>, <p>If  you can get past the slightly awkward proportions of 3 Series GT, it begins to  look like a best-of-all-worlds vehicle. There's strong turbocharged  acceleration even from the base 330i's four-cylinder engine and ample amounts  of buttery-smooth thrust should you opt for the 340i with its turbo inline  six-cylinder. All models also come standard with BMW's xDrive for all-season  traction.</p>, <p>So  what are the shortcomings? Well, ultimately the 3 Series-based X3 SUV still has  more cargo room and ground clearance, and the smaller sedan and wagon variants  deliver more of the crisp handling that BMWs are known for. However, we think  those things matter less than the Gran Turismo's list of standard equipment,  which doesn't include basic luxury-level items such as keyless entry and  adjustable lumbar support. At this price, those features should be included. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is available in two trim levels: <strong>330i xDrive </strong>and <strong>340i xDrive</strong>. All-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic  transmission come standard on both. The main difference is under the hood. The  330i packs a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (248 horsepower, 258  pound-feet of torque) and the 340i upgrades to a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline  six-cylinder (320 hp, 330 lb-ft). </p>]

[<p>The  Gran Turismo <strong>330i xDrive </strong>isn't  brimming with standard luxuries, but it does include 18-inch alloy wheels (with  all-season run-flat tires), LED headlights, automatic wipers, power-folding and  auto-dimming side mirrors, a panoramic sunroof and a power liftgate. Interior  highlights include dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable sport  front seats, driver-seat memory settings, simulated leather upholstery, a  rearview camera, 40/20/40-split folding rear seatbacks and an auto-dimming  rearview mirror. On the technology front, the 330i comes standard with  Bluetooth, BMW's iDrive infotainment interface, a 6.5-inch display screen, BMW  Connected Services, and a nine-speaker audio system with a CD player, HD radio,  an auxiliary audio jack and a USB port.</p>, <p>An  optional Convenience package (note that BMW calls its packages  "tiers") adds keyless ignition and entry, power lumbar support and  satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>340i xDrive </strong>has the above equipment  plus the Convenience package as standard. </p>, <p>Selecting  the Premium package for either model adds heated front seats, a navigation  system, a larger 8.8-inch display, a head-up display, and BMW Remote Services,  allowing for remote controlled functions through the mobile app.</p>, <p>The  next level up is the Executive tier. It includes a surround-view parking camera  system, adaptive full LED headlights with automatic high beams, leather  upholstery, a digital instrument cluster and BMW's Parking Assistant, which  helps guide you into parking spaces.<br> <br>  You  can add the M Sport Design package to either of the top two tiers. It offers a  variety of sport-themed interior trim treatments, an aerodynamic body kit,  BMW's Shadowline exterior trim, an M steering wheel, and an option to add the  Adaptive M suspension.</br></br></p>, <p>For  added safety, consider the Driver Assistance package. It includes lane  departure warning, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking,  a drowsy driver warning system and a speed-limit display. </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options for the Gran Turismo include 19-inch wheels, a heated steering wheel,  heated rear seats, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, Apple  CarPlay, and wireless charging with a Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2014 BMW 328i xDrive Gran Turismo</strong> (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 3 Series Gran Turismo has been  revised, including new engines introduced in 2017. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's 3 Series Gran Turismo, though keep in mind that the  four-cylinder engine in the 328i rated here generates slightly less horsepower  and torque than one found in the 2018 330i.</p>]

[<p>BMW is strongly associated with luxury sport coupes  and convertibles. The company practically invented the modern interpretation of  this class with its 3 Series. Four years ago, the 4 Series replaced the 3 Series  coupe and convertible in name, but not in spirit. The 4 Series has been  delivering all the performance, refinement and strength of its predecessor. </p>, <p>Recently, however, the competition has stepped up  its game. You've also got redesigned versions of the Audi A5 and S5 and the  Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe to consider. In our opinion, these rivals have  unseated the 4 Series from the top spot in the class, but not by a significant  margin. This could be partially attributed to the 2018 BMW 4 Series' age, even  though it's updated this year. The changes just aren't significant enough to  push it to the top. Overall, though, the 4 Series remains a solid choice for a  luxury sport coupe or convertible.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW 4 Series is available in three body styles: a coupe, convertible and  four-door Gran Coupe. Within these models, you can choose between the <strong>430i</strong> or <strong>440i</strong> trims that differ mostly by engine type. The 430i is powered  by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (248 horsepower and 258  pound-feet of torque), and the 440i receives a turbocharged 3.0-liter  six-cylinder engine (322 hp and 332 lb-ft). All of these 4 Series models come  with an eight-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the rear wheels,  though you can get a six-speed manual on the coupe as an option. BMW's xDrive  all-wheel-drive system is also offered as an option.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>430i</strong> include  18-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights and foglights, a sunroof (coupe),  power-folding and heated mirrors, auto-dimming mirrors, automatic wipers,  selectable drive modes, cruise control, a rearview camera, BMW's Assist eCall  emergency telematics and smartphone app control over some car functions.</p>, <p>On the  inside, you get dual-zone automatic climate control, simulated leather  upholstery, 10-way power-adjustable front sport seats, 40/20/40-split folding  rear seats, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a universal garage door  opener, BMW's iDrive infotainment system, a 6.5-inch display, a rearview  camera, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, and a nine-speaker audio system  with a CD player, HD radio and a USB input.</p>, <p>The <strong>440i</strong> adds keyless entry and ignition  and a premium 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system with  satellite radio. These features are options on the 430i. Convertible models  have a power-operated retractable hardtop with a removable wind deflector.</p>, <p>Notable  options include various sporty exterior touches, adaptive headlights, automatic  high beams, an M Sport or adaptive suspension, an automated parking system, a  head-up display, a navigation system, premium leather upholstery, heated front  seats, a power rear sunshade, a surround-view camera system, Apple CarPlay and  a wireless charging pad. On the safety front, you can also add front and rear  parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning and  mitigation, a lane departure warning system and adaptive cruise control.</p>]

[<p>German luxury automakers are currently the masters  of creating new vehicle types outside the typical coupe, sedan, SUV body  styles. Case in point: the 2018 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. Rather than the  traditionally styled 3 Series sedan or its 4 Series coupe variant, the 4 Series  Gran Coupe offers an unusual combination of coupelike styling, four-door  versatility and the inherent utility of hatchback.</p>, <p>Fresh from a batch of revised engines last year, the  2018 Gran Coupe sports slight changes to its head- and taillight clusters, an  updated iDrive system and additional standard features. Best of all, the  updates did little to affect the Gran Coupe's price tag. BMW's typically  fantastic balance of a comfortable ride and stable handling is on display here  as well. Downsides are limited to the cramped rear seat, aging interior design  and the premium you'll pay over the similar 330i. However, buyers looking for  something a little different might find what they're looking for in the unusual  but very capable 2018 BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe.</p>]

[<p>Despite its coupe billing, the 2018 BMW 4 Series  Gran Coupe is a four-door hatchback with a traditional sedan profile. Two trim  levels are available, <strong>430i </strong>and <strong>440i</strong>, with the main distinction between  the two being what's underneath the hood. The 430i's turbocharged four-cylinder  offers a compelling blend of performance and fuel economy. The 440i has a more  powerful and nearly as efficient turbocharged six-cylinder engine. Both models  are available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive (called xDrive in BMW  speak). An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission available.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>430i </strong>is motivated by a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (248 horsepower, 258 pound-feet). Standard  features include 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and foglights, automatic  wipers, a sunroof, a power liftgate, power-folding and heated outside mirrors, auto-dimming  mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic  climate control, ambient lighting, power front seats, driver-seat memory  settings, a 40/20/40-split rear seat, simulated leather upholstery, adjustable  driving modes, steering wheel-mounted shift paddles, BMW's ConnectedDrive  Services, a 6.5-inch central display screen, and a nine-speaker sound system  with a CD player, a USB port, and HD and satellite radio.</p>, <p>You'll  primarily upgrade to the <strong>440i</strong> for  its turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine (320 hp, 330 lb-ft). You also  get power lumbar adjustment for the front seats, hands-free liftgate operation  and a Harman Kardon premium audio system.</p>, <p>Many  optional packages are common to both trim levels. These include the <strong>Premium </strong>(navigation, an 8.8-inch  display screen, heated front seats and lumbar support for 430i models), <strong>Luxury </strong>(chrome exterior trim, leather  upholstery and the Harman Kardon audio system for 430i models) and <strong>Executive </strong>(adaptive headlights with  automatic high-beam control, a 360-degree camera system, automated vehicle  parking and a head-up display) packages. You can also up the Gran Coupe's  sporting capability with the <strong>M Sport</strong> (performance tires, a sport suspension, a sport steering wheel and more  aggressive-looking front and rear styling) and <strong>Track Handling</strong> (non-run-flat performance tires, upgraded brakes, an  adaptive suspension and variable-ratio sport steering) packages. </p>, <p>Notable  stand-alone options include 19-inch wheels, heated front and rear seats, a  heated steering wheel, a digital instrument panel, blind-spot monitoring, a  forward collision warning system, adaptive cruise control, wireless device  charging and Apple CarPlay functionality.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 BMW 428i Gran Coupe</strong> (turbo 2.0L  inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 4 Series Gran Coupe has received some  revisions, including a name change from 428i to 430i (to reflect a  new-generation four-cylinder engine with the same displacement) and an updated  infotainment system. Certain sections might not have an applicable star rating,  but our overall findings remain applicable to this year's 4 Series Gran Coupe.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW 5 Series lives up to the expectations set by its forebears. There's an  engine for nearly every taste, and the car's handling capabilities are  fundamentally sound. Factor in the 5 Series' latest tech and safety features,  and you've got a prime pick for a midsize luxury sedan.</p>, <p>BMW  redesigned its 5 Series last year, giving the car updated styling and a bit  more interior room without increasing weight. This year brings more changes,  too. The 2018 5 Series has three new powertrain options: a plug-in hybrid  (530e), a six-cylinder diesel engine (540d) and a twin-turbo V8 (M550i) that  puts the car very close to BMW M5 territory. We were already fans of the base  530i and the 540i, so these additions carry an added benefit, whether it be the  efficiency of the 530e and the 540d or the muscular power of the M550i. </p>, <p>On  the technology front, BMW continues to push the envelope, offering wireless  Apple CarPlay integration, natural language voice recognition, and even a cool  3-D simulation of your car from the outside (you have to see to believe) by  using the optional surround-view cameras. And as far as modern driver assist  aids go, BMW's are among the best. </p>, <p>Of  course, there are other luxury sedans you should consider, including the Audi  A6, the Lexus GS and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. We think highly of the 5 Series  within this group, though, and it earns a solid recommendation.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 BMW 5 Series as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best All-Wheel-Drive Sedans">Best All-Wheel-Drive Sedans</a> and <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 BMW 5 Series is a five-passenger  sedan available in five trim levels, all with different powertrains. The <strong>530i</strong> (248 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of  torque) and the <strong>530e iPerformance</strong> plug-in hybrid (248 hp, 310 lb-ft) are powered by variants of BMW's  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Next are two six-cylinders: The <strong>540i</strong> (335 hp, 332 lb-ft) gets a  turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, and the <strong>540d</strong> (261 hp, 457 lb-ft) has a 3.0-liter inline-six diesel. At the top of the range  is the <strong>M550i</strong> with its turbocharged  4.4-liter V8 (456 hp, 480 lb-ft). BMW's all-wheel drive, called xDrive, is an  option on the 530i, the 530e and the 540i. It's standard on the 540d and the  M550i. An eight-speed automatic is standard across the board. </p>]

[<p>The base <strong>530i</strong> and the <strong>530e</strong> come  pretty nicely equipped from the start with LED adaptive headlights, 18-inch  wheels, and driver-selectable vehicle settings to alter steering, transmission  response and throttle calibration. They also include power-folding and heated  mirrors (the driver's side has auto dimming), automatic wipers, a sunroof,  dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable steering wheel,  power-adjustable front sport seats, driver-seat memory functions, a  40/20/40-split folding rear seat and simulated leather upholstery. </p>, <p>Standard technology features include the  iDrive interface, with a knob and button-based touchpad controller and a  10.2-inch touchscreen display. Also standard: a navigation system,  natural-language voice controls, Bluetooth, BMW emergency services, two USB  ports, and a 12-speaker sound system with a CD player. </p>, <p>The <strong>540i</strong> and the diesel-powered <strong>540d</strong> are  equipped very similarly to the previous two trims but have standard leather  upholstery. </p>, <p>It's a bigger price jump to the new  performance-focused <strong>M550i xDrive</strong>,  which includes everything above plus 19-inch wheels with performance tires, an  adaptive suspension with electronically controlled dampers, upgraded brakes,  full LED adaptive headlights with automatic high beams, aerodynamic bodywork, a  rear spoiler, upgraded power front seats, an M Sport steering wheel, keyless  entry and a power trunklid.</p>, <p>With the exception of the M550i xDrive,  after you decided what powertrain you want, you can select from one of three 5  Series styling packages. The Sport<strong> </strong>is  the default choice and comes with gloss-black design elements on the bumpers.  The Luxury style features chrome accents from the front grille to the rear  tailpipes, with light alloy wheels and modified bumper inserts to match. The M  Sport steps up the sportiness with an aerodynamic style treatment, a lower M  Sport suspension, and Shadowline exterior trim.</p>, <p>From this point, BMW offers a variety of  packages, or "tiers'' in BMW lingo. The Premium package adds a power  trunk, keyless ignition and entry, satellite radio, gesture control and heated  front seats. Go with the Executive package to get full LED adaptive headlights  with automatic high beams, soft-close automatic doors, parking sensors, an  automatic parking system, a dynamic digital instrument cluster, and a  surround-view camera system with 3-D mode. </p>, <p>Naturally, more customization is  available. The Dynamic Handling package includes an adaptive suspension and  active roll stabilization. For the M550i, which comes with the adaptive  suspension, you also get Integral Active Steering, which is a rear-steer system.  A Luxury Seating package bundles ventilated multicontour front seats with  massage function and upgraded leather upholstery.</p>, <p>The Driving Assistance package has two  levels, the first of which includes a head-up display, blind-spot monitoring  and lane departure warning. Upgrading to the Driving Assistance Plus version  also gets you forward collision warning with object and pedestrian protection,  adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist.</p>, <p>Many of these features can be equipped as  stand-alone options alongside Apple CarPlay, remote control parking, night  vision with pedestrian detection, a heated steering wheel, a rear-seat  entertainment system, Harman Kardon or Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio  systems, wireless smartphone charging and ceramic-trimmed controls.</p>]

[<p>There are  few cars left like the BMW 6 Series, and fewer still with BMW discontinuing the  6 Series coupe for 2018. While we expect a new generation will debut next year,  this year's 6 Series remains an excellent choice for luxury drop-top cruising. </p>, <p>Of course,  there are sportier and smaller four-seat convertibles, and there are  significantly more expensive ones too. But few can match the BMW 6 Series'  blend of style, quality and comfort. Drivers will find both engine options satisfying,  while available all-wheel drive allows four-season practicality. While the  current generation is dated, we still think the 2018 6 Series is worth  considering if you're looking for a stylish luxury convertible. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW 6 Series is a four-seat convertible available in <strong>640i</strong> and <strong>650i</strong> trims.  Some differences exist between the two (wheel size, the sound system and level  of seat adjustability, for instance), but the trims primarily designate the  type of the engine. The 640i has the six-cylinder, and the 650i has the V8. BMW  makes every option and package available for both trims, ensuring variety no  matter which engine you pick. Rear-wheel drive, which BMW calls sDrive, is  standard, and all-wheel drive (xDrive) is optional. </p>]

[<p>Under the  hood for the <strong>640i</strong> is a turbocharged  3.0-liter engine (315 horsepower, 332 pound-feet of torque). An eight-speed automatic  is the only transmission choice. Standard feature highlights include 18-inch  wheels wrapped in all-season tires, keyless entry, a rearview camera, parking  sensors, heated front seats, automatic high beams, navigation, Bluetooth,  wireless phone charging, Wi-Fi hotspot, and a nine-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>The <strong>650i</strong> adds a powerful turbocharged  4.4-liter V8 (445 hp, 480 lb-ft of torque). Aside from the engine, this trim  gains a few features that are optional on the 640i, such as 19-inch wheels,  upgraded power adjustable seats and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. </p>, <p>BMW offers  a variety of premium color, upholstery and trim upgrades, providing buyers  plenty of opportunities for personalization. While some stand-alone options are  available, most upgrades are grouped in packages. A heated steering wheel only  comes in the Cold Weather package, for instance, and you must order the  Executive package for ventilated seats. The M Sport package introduces a sport  body kit, a sport steering wheel, a higher top-speed limit, and  package-specific 19-inch wheels with either all-season or summer tires. </p>, <p>Blind-spot  monitoring is not standard but is available in the Driving Assistance package,  which also includes a head-up display, lane departure warning, and front collision  warning with low-speed automatic braking. An upgraded Driving Assistance Plus  package adds adaptive cruise control and enhanced front collision mitigation.  When you select the Parking Assistant package you get an automated parking  system and side- and top-view cameras. </p>]

[<p>Sometimes mashups are so successful and  transformative, it's a wonder they started as a pairing of seemingly disparate  concepts. Renowned producer Danger Mouse broke onto the music scene with <em>The Grey Album</em>, a mashup of The Beatles'  White Album and Jay-Z's <em>Black Album</em>.  Dominique Ansel started a nationwide food craze after he introduced a new  pastry that combined elements of a doughnut and croissant. And Mercedes-Benz  lit the high-end luxury car market on fire with the CLS, a sedan with a  coupelike roofline. It wasn't long before BMW entered the fray with its own  "four-door coupe." Its current model, the 2018 BMW 6 Series Gran  Coupe, promises a desirable blend of four-door practicality and the  driver-centric sportiness of a classic grand tourer.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, the 6 Series Gran Coupe exhibits  flaws inherent with a sedan doing its impression of a coupe. Rear headroom and  vehicle entry/exit are significantly impeded by the sweeping roofline that makes  the car look so slinky in profile. The cargo area is more than 5 cubic feet smaller  than that of the related 5 Series. The seat-high center tunnel makes it nearly  impossible for anyone to occupy the middle seat. And then there's the cost for  all this sleek sexiness: The 640i Gran Coupe is considerably more expensive  than a 5 Series with the same engine.</p>, <p>The Gran Coupe excels in the way BMW typically does,  with exquisite interior materials, a robust features list and smooth, powerful  engines. Just be aware of the compromises.</p>]

[<p>It may be difficult to put a label on the 2018 BMW 6  Series Gran Coupe, but there's no question about the level of performance and  luxury it brings to the table. It's available in two trims — <strong>640i </strong>and <strong>650i </strong>— that are primarily differentiated by the engines  that lie underhood. Both can be ordered in rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive  (xDrive), and numerous features packages are shared between the two models  regardless of powertrain. There are some stand-alone options and a few premium  exterior paint, interior trim and upholstery choices available through BMW's  Individual program.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>640i </strong>is  powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six (315 horsepower and 330  pound-feet of torque) matched to an eight-speed automatic transmission with  steering wheel-mounted shift paddles. Befitting a high-end luxury sedan, the  list of standard features is lengthy and impressive. Accoutrements include  18-inch wheels, sport-tuned adaptive suspension dampers, adaptive LED  headlights with automatic high beams, LED foglights, automatic wipers, front  and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, power-folding and auto-dimming  mirrors, and a tilt-only sunroof.</p>, <p>Inside, you get dual-zone automatic climate control,  10-way power front seats (with heating and four-way lumbar adjustment),  driver-seat memory settings, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  leather upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, ambient lighting, a  wireless charging pad, a Wi-Fi hotspot, a navigation system, the iDrive  infotainment system with an integrated touchpad on the controller, a 10.2-inch central display screen, smartphone app integration, and a nine-speaker sound  system with a CD player, a USB port, and HD and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>650i </strong>eschews  the sensible six-cylinder and is instead driven by a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8  (445 hp, 480 lb-ft). It also adds 19-inch wheels, 20-way power-adjustable seats  (with passenger-seat memory settings and adjustable side bolsters and thigh  support), upgraded leather upholstery, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon premium sound  system and BMW concierge services.</p>, <p>Several optional packages are available on both  models. The <strong>Cold Weather</strong> package  provides heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel. The <strong>Driving Assistance</strong> package features  blind-spot monitoring, a head-up display, speed-limit information and BMW's  Active Driving Assistant, which bundles lane departure warning, a forward  collision warning system and low-speed forward collision mitigation (with  pedestrian detection). There's also a <strong>Driving  Assistance Plus</strong> package that further adds adaptive cruise control and  forward collision mitigation that can operate at higher speeds. The <strong>Parking Assistance</strong> package adds a  360-degree parking camera and an automated parking system. </p>, <p>The <strong>Executive</strong> package adds power-closing doors, four-zone climate control and ventilated  front seats. The 640i's version of this package includes the multicontour  seats, Harman Kardon stereo and concierge services, while the 650i's version  adds a power rear sunshade, manual rear window shades, contrast stitching and  ceramic-trimmed controls. These items are available as individual options on  the 640i.</p>, <p>The <strong>M Sport</strong> package includes unique 19- or 20-inch wheels, an aero body kit, a sport  steering wheel, a simulated-suede headliner and a higher top-speed limiter.  There's also an <strong>M Sport Edition</strong> package that roughly combines the M Sport package and the contents of the  650i's Executive package. The BMW Individual Composition package lets you  special-order leather and wood trim hues, while the Black Accent package equips  the Gran Coupe with gloss-black exterior trim and a two-tone extended leather  interior.</p>, <p>Stand-alone options include some of the above items  plus adaptive suspension stabilizer bars (known as Adaptive Drive), enhanced  Integral Active Steering with rear-wheel steering (not available on xDrive  models), a night-vision camera, active front seats, Apple CarPlay functionality  and a 16-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen surround-sound audio system.</p>]

[<p>Never one to shy away from filling a  niche, BMW is out with its all-new 2018 6 Series Gran Turismo. It's essentially  the answer to a BMW exec asking: "What do we get if we take a wagon and  squish the rear roofline down so it kind of looks like a coupe, but also give  it standard all-wheel drive and a slightly taller profile to make it more like  an SUV?" If you've found yourself asking the same question, you'll  definitely like the Gran Turismo.</p>, <p>The Gran Turismo moniker didn't just come  out of nowhere, though. First introduced as the 5 Series Gran Turismo back in  2010, it featured heavy and disjointed styling with a radical rear hatch that  also incorporated a trunklid. We were never huge fans of it, but apparently it  did well enough for BMW to keep it going with this year's 6 Series Gran  Turismo.</p>, <p>The 2018 GT is essentially the new  generation of the 5 Series Gran Turismo. It's similar to the redesigned 5  Series sedan that debuted last year, though it's longer on the outside and  roomier on the inside. Compared to the old 5 GT, the 6 GT gets BMW's latest  tech, sleeker styling, and a more conventional hatchback design.</p>, <p>Got all that? You might also get confused  by the existence of the 6 Series Gran Coupe, which is also a coupe-style sedan.  But unlike the Gran Coupe and its vestigial center rear seat, the Gran Turismo  is a true five-seater. The GT's hatchback provides more maximum cargo room (65  cubic feet versus 44.7 cubes with the rear seats folded). From a functional  perspective, the GT is just better at hauling people and cargo. Its standard  air suspension can even lower the back end to help load items. </p>, <p>Still, don't mistake it for a swoopy  cargo hauler. It's heavy, and it drives like it. And you don't get the full  versatility of a crossover SUV such as the X5; the Gran Turismo isn't meant to  go off-road, and its raked cargo area can't take on bulky cargo as easily. What  we're left with then is something that's capable but not exceptional. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo is a four-door sedan that features a large rear  hatchback to make loading cargo easier. It is available in the 640i xDrive,  which comes with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (335 horsepower, 332 pound-feet of  torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Standard  features are generous, and plenty of options are available to further customize  the 640i.</p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights include 19-inch wheels, LED headlights, keyless ignition and  entry, parking sensors, a rear air suspension, a panoramic sunroof,  auto-dimming mirrors, a power rear liftgate, power-adjustable heated front  seats, leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control and a  power-adjustable steering wheel. Also included are a configurable gauge  cluster, a navigation system, BMW's iDrive infotainment system, a 10.2-inch  central touchscreen, two USB ports, a wireless charging pad, and a 12-speaker  sound system with a CD player and satellite radio. </p>, <p>The  640i also comes with forward collision warning with low-speed automatic  emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane  departure warning, and BMW Assist communications. </p>, <p>The  optional Luxury package adds power rear seatback adjustment. Gran Turismos  equipped with the M Sport package come with aluminum interior trim, an M-badged  steering wheel and an aero body kit.</p>, <p>You  can also get a Dynamic Handling package that includes adjustable suspension  dampers, active steering, an air front suspension and active roll control. </p>, <p>If  you're looking for more luxury-oriented features, get the Executive package for  its soft-close doors, head-up display system, surround-view parking camera  system, gesture control for the iDrive interface, parking sensors and an  automatic parking system. The parking sensors, surround-view system and  automatic parking system are available in a Parking Assistance package. </p>, <p>For  long-haul drivers, a Luxury Seating package adds upgraded multicontour front  seats and two-tone leather surfaces with contrast piping. The seats are also  ventilated and feature a massage function. A Driving Assistance Plus package  adds adaptive cruise control and enhanced collision avoidance systems. </p>, <p>Notable  stand-alone options include a heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay smartphone  integration, a rear-seat entertainment system, either a Harman Kardon or Bowers  &amp; Wilkins surround-sound system, a night-vision system and a remote-control  parking system.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes Benz S-Class is unquestionably an  automotive institution in its own right, and the Audi A8 has a full redesign on  the way, but buyers in this segment owe it to themselves to check out the BMW 7  Series. In our time with the latest 7 Series, it has impressed us with its  quiet and comfortable cabin, high-quality materials, potent acceleration (yes,  even the plug-in hybrid model), excellent driving dynamics, extensive  technology options, and, of course, a spacious rear seat.</p>, <p>With the plug-in hybrid 740e xDrive iPerformance and  the turbocharged V12-powered M760i xDrive both on sale this year, the 7 Series  has a fully fleshed-out line of powertrains. The more mainstream turbocharged  six- and eight-cylinder models are still compelling choices, and both are  available with AWD. </p>, <p>The base 7 Series comes with a lot of great content,  but many of the most appealing options are bundled into pricey packages that  can quickly drive up the cost of the car. A few choices are a bit confounding,  such as making Apple CarPlay integration a $300 extra. This isn't anything new  for BMW, so don't expect it to change anytime soon. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 BMW 7 Series is available with four  different engines, all of which make use of an eight-speed automatic  transmission. Depending on your engine choice, all-wheel drive or rear-wheel  drive come standard. All-wheel drive is also optional on trims that come  standard with rear-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>When the 7 Series was redesigned in 2016, the  standard wheelbase option was removed, so all 7 Series are now long wheelbase.  That means extra rear legroom is standard. Thanks to standard leather  upholstery and wood trim, even the base 7 Series is a luxurious people mover. </p>, <p>The base <strong>740i</strong> Sedan comes with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine rated to  produce 320 hp. Stepping up to the <strong>750i</strong> adds a handful of additional standard features and upgrades the engine to a  445-hp turbocharged 4.4-liter V8. Both can be had with either AWD or RWD.</p>, <p>The <strong>740e  xDrive</strong> <strong>iPerformance </strong>plug-in  hybrid uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and an electric motor to  produce a combined 322 horsepower. At the top of the 7 Series range is the  flagship <strong>M760i xDrive</strong>, which is  powered by a massive 6.6-liter turbocharged V12 that produces 601 hp. Both the  plug-in hybrid and the V12 are only available with AWD.</p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the 740i Sedan includes adaptive air suspension with  driver-selectable modes, 19-inch alloy wheels, adaptive LED headlights with  automatic high beams, automatic windshield wipers, front and rear parking  sensors, a power trunklid, and power-closing doors. The 740i comes with other  luxuries such as 14-way power-adjustable leather seats with heating, wood trim,  four-zone climate control, a panoramic moonroof and auto-dimming rearview  mirror. </p>, <p>Standard  technology features include a 10.2-inch infotainment screen with navigation and  BMW's iDrive, a touchpad controller with gesture control, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi  connectivity, a wireless Qi charging station, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound  system, and a number of Internet-connected features that work online or with  special BMW apps.</p>, <p>Several  packages are available for the 7 Series. The Autobahn package adds  variable-ratio steering and a system that anticipates road conditions and  adjusts the car's dampers. The Cold Weather package adds heated rear seats and  a heated steering wheel. A Parking Assistance package is available with a  360-degree camera view and active parking assistant.</p>, <p>The  Driving Assistance Package includes a head-up display and a number of active  safety features such as blind-spot information and forward collision detection  with automatic braking. Upgrading to the Driving Assistance Plus package adds  those features as well as some semi-autonomous technology including adaptive  cruise control and active lane keeping with collision avoidance.</p>, <p>There are  also packages that add even more luxury for both the front seats and rear  passengers. The Executive package adds 20-way power-adjustable front seats with  cooling and massage, as well as rear window shades and ceramic controls dials.  The Luxury Rear Seating package adds heated, ventilated and massaging rear seats as well as and a 7-inch tablet to control seat and climate functions that can be  removed from a dock in the center armrest. For true rear-seat luxury, the Rear  Executive Lounge Seating package adds a rear-seat entertainment system and  reclining rear seats with extendable footrests. This package does limit the  luxury options available for those in the front of the car.</p>, <p>Additional  paint and leather colors, as well as extra trim options and extended leather  and wood coverage, can be had with either the Interior Design package or the  more extensive BMW Individual Composition package. Finally, the M Sport package  adds a sport exhaust, unique wheels, and exterior and interior design  elements.</p>, <p>There are  also a number of stand-alone options including an upgraded sound system,  upgraded brakes, night vision, remote control parking, LED lighting for the  moonroof, and Apple CarPlay compatibility.</p>, <p>The 740e  iPerformance has the same standard options as the 740i, although it comes with  unique interior accents. Upgrading to the 750i gives you the bigger engine, as  well as a few extra standard luxuries, like the 20-way power-adjustable seats.  The M760i xDrive, meanwhile, gets both added luxuries and sports-oriented  features, as well as unique colors and design elements, while losing access to  some comfort-oriented options.</p>]

[<p>Those  familiar with BMW know the M performance division creates some scintillating  cars. Fewer people will know where Alpina slots in with BMW, which only makes  the 2018 BMW Alpina B6 Gran Coupe all that more intriguing.</p>, <p>Alpina's  earlier success in racing and subsequent move to producing performance-enhanced  BMW models eventually evolved into a long-term partnership with the marque as  well as recognition as a manufacturer — and not simply a tuner  — of vehicles. Currently only two Alpina models are available, one of  them the 2018 B6 Gran Coupe. </p>, <p>You can  think of the B6 as the ultimate expression of the 6 Series Gran Coupe with  unique exterior styling differences, exclusive exterior paint options,  Alpina-specific 20-inch wheels, unique interior material treatments, and  upgrades to the engine, suspension and eight-speed automatic transmission.  Thanks to the Alpina treatment, the B6's twin-turbo V8 powerplant produces 600  horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque, eclipsing the numbers of the mighty M6  by 40 hp and 90 lb-ft of torque while returning significantly better fuel  economy estimates to boot.</p>, <p>The Alpina  B6 isn't as much of an attention magnet as some other offerings in this  segment, but because of its rarity, you won't likely see another in your  neighborhood or city. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW <strong>Alpina B6 Gran Coupe</strong> is offered  in a single, well-equipped trim with a handful of available packages and  stand-alone options. It comes with a fire-breathing 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8  engine (600 hp, 590 lb-ft) paired to an Alpina-tuned eight-speed automatic  transmission, sending power to all four wheels through a rear-biased  all-wheel-drive system. </p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment for the B6 includes 20-inch wheels with summer performance tires,  Alpina-specific exterior styling details, an adaptive sport-tuned suspension,  adaptive LED headlights with automatic high-beam control, LED foglights,  automatic wipers, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera,  power-folding and auto-dimming heated side mirrors, and keyless ignition and  entry.</p>, <p>Inside,  you'll find four-zone automatic climate control, 16-way power-adjustable front  seats (with four-way lumbar support, heating and memory settings), leather  upholstery, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, ambient lighting and a split-folding rear seat.</p>, <p>On the  technology side, features include Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a  navigation system, voice controls, the newest iDrive 6.0 infotainment interface  with a touchpad-equipped controller, wireless mobile phone charging (Qi  standard), an onboard Wi-Fi hotspot with a complimentary 3 GB of data over  three months, smartphone app integration, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon  surround-sound system with a CD player, HD and satellite radio, and a USB port  and an auxiliary audio jack.</p>, <p>There are  three option packages for the Alpina B6. The <strong>Executive package</strong> adds ventilated front seats with active bolsters,  a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, a power rear sunshade, manual rear  window shades and ceramic-trimmed controls. The <strong>Driver Assistance package</strong> includes BMW's Active Driving Assistant,  a suite of active safety aids that bundles a frontal collision warning system  with low-speed collision mitigation (and pedestrian detection) and lane  departure warning. You can add onto this package with the <strong>Driver Assistance Plus</strong> <strong>package</strong> for a surround-view camera system, speed-limit information, a head-up display,  blind-spot monitoring and adaptive cruise control system.</p>, <p>There are  several choices of extra-cost leather upholstery and wood trim, and the B6's  simulated suede headliner can be matched to the upholstery color. Notable  stand-alone options for the 2018 BMW Alpina B6 include Apple CarPlay, a  blind-spot monitoring system, a night-vision camera with pedestrian detection  and a premium Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system. All-season tires are a no-cost  option.</p>]

[<p>The  world of executive luxury sedans is small, and it gets even smaller when you  are shopping the high performance versions. The BMW Alpina B7 fits that  criteria and more, however, wrapping a seemingly unending supply of luxury and  acceleration in a unique and highly exclusive package.  </p>, <p>The  B7 starts as a BMW 7 Series. From there, Alpina, a specialty automotive company  in Germany that's closely aligned with BMW, applies its own performance  upgrades and styling changes. Though sold in the United States as a BMW, the B7  is available through Alpina as the B7 Bi-Turbo in other markets. The  exclusivity provided by the name and the subtle exterior modifications,  including the 20-spoke Alpina wheels, gives the B7 a distinct appearance versus  the standard 7 Series. </p>, <p>While  the previous generation of the B7 was available in standard or long-wheelbase  variants with either rear- or all-wheel drive, the current B7 only comes in one  long-wheelbase model with standard all-wheel drive. Alpina prioritizes  refinement versus the all-out performance found in vehicles from BMW's M  Division. That doesn't mean the B7 is slow; its turbocharged V8 still cranks  out a sweet 600 hp, or 1 hp shy of the output from the M760i's turbo 6.6-liter V12. </p>, <p>In your search for supreme luxury, you'll  find a few competitors that offer similar levels of performance and  exclusivity, including the Mercedes-AMG S 63 and Porsche Panamera Turbo S  E-Hybrid. There's no way to go wrong with this group, but certainly the 2018  Alpina B7 is a commendable choice. </p>]

[<p>The  Alpina B7 is a four-door high-performance and equally luxurious sedan that is  available in one highly equipped trim level.<strong> </strong>As in the BMW 7 Series on which it is based, its wheelbase matches  that of the previous generation's long-wheelbase variants, providing extra room  in the backseat. There's only one engine choice, and it's a good one: a  twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 (600 hp, 590 lb-ft of torque). An eight-speed automatic  and all-wheel drive are standard. </p>]

[<p>As  you might expect from, the B7 packs a lot of standard features. Aside from a  stronger engine and a transmission calibrated to transfer all that thrust, the  B7 also uses an adaptive air suspension that can raise the vehicle for greater  ground clearance or lower it for high-speed aerodynamics. Rear-wheel steering  is standard, improving both low-speed nimbleness and high-speed stability.  Perhaps the most interesting piece of technology is the Active Comfort Drive  with Road Preview system, which uses cameras to watch the road ahead and  adjusts the suspension in anticipation of bumps. </p>, <p>Alpina-specific  exterior features include a specially styled bumpers, quad exhaust finishers, a  rear spoiler and 20-inch wheels. Other standard exterior equipment consists of  LED headlights with auto high beams, LED foglights, heated and power-folding  side mirrors, soft-close doors, parking sensors, a rearview camera, automatic  wipers and hands-free trunk operation.</p>, <p>The  interior boasts 20-way power-adjustable front seats (with heat, ventilation and  massage), premium leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, heated rear  seats, BMW's iDrive interface with a 10.2-inch display, a head-up display,  adjustable ambiance lighting, a power tilt-and-telescope steering wheel,  four-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof and power side-window shades.  Other technology features include a 16-speaker Harman Kardon stereo, wireless  phone charging, an in-car Wi-Fi hotspot, a large key fob with an LCD  touchscreen, a surround-view parking camera system, and automated parallel and  perpendicular parking. </p>, <p>BMW  offers two levels of active safety features. The Driving Assistance package  includes blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning and mitigation, lane  departure warning and speed limit information. The Plus variant of this package  adds lane departure intervention and adaptive cruise control. </p>, <p>The  Luxury Rear Seating package adds extra-plush seats with ventilation and massage  function, heated armrests, and a 7-inch tablet to control vehicle functions.  The Rear Executive Lounge Seating Package adds a reclining rear seat and  footrest, rear-seat entertainment, and a table that folds out from the center  console. This package also deletes the rear center seat along with the  front-passenger seat massage, side bolster, lumbar and headrest adjustments. </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include Apple CarPlay, an Ambient Air package that infuses the climate  control with various scents, a 16-speaker Bowers &amp; Wilkins Diamond  surround-sound audio system, a system that allows you to park the car using  only the key fob, and a night-vision camera.</p>]

[<p>The BMW i3 is probably one of the most innovative cars on the road today.  That's true even though it's currently in its fifth model year. BMW pioneered  the use of carbon fiber as the basis for the production car's structure to save  weight. And it paid off: The i3 is quite lightweight for a battery-electric  car, abetting its agile nature and quick acceleration. Other manufacturers  still have a ways to go to catch up to BMW in this choice of material.</p>, <p>The i3's styling is polarizing; of that  there is no doubt. But it looks like no other car on the road and has a cabin  that is truly striking and upscale. It's functional, too, with a breezy,  spacious feel and easy backseat access thanks to the rearward-hinged rear  doors. These doors can turn into a bit of a hassle in tight parking lot  quarters, however.</p>, <p>You've got a new choice for an i3 this  year: the i3s. It boasts a more powerful electric motor, a sport-tuned  suspension, and wider tires to improve performance and handling. BMW is still  offering the Range Extender version, too, which has a tiny gasoline engine (and  fuel tank) that serves as an electric generator. It gives you a little more  range once the battery runs out of juice, but the main appeal is peace of mind. </p>, <p>From a logical standpoint, the 2018 BMW i3  doesn't fare all that great in relation to its main competitors. You can get  more driving range from the Chevrolet Bolt and the Nissan Leaf, for instance,  and both cars are less expensive to boot. But the BMW earns back some emotional  points by being a nicer car to drive and spend time in. The same could be said  for Tesla's new Model 3, however. It matches the i3 for premium design and  performance and, as the kicker, offers potentially two or three times the  driving range. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 BMW i3 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/" title="Best Electric Cars">Best Electric Cars</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 BMW i3 is a four-door hatchback  with seating for four passengers that's available in <strong>i3 </strong>or <strong>i3s </strong>trim, both of  which are battery-electric, or you can have either one additionally equipped  with a gasoline-powered <strong>Range Extender</strong>. All four versions are equipped with  a 33-kWh battery.</p>]

[<p>Base <strong>i3</strong> models are equipped with an  electric motor (170 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque) that drives the rear wheels. With  the same battery as last year's model, there's enough energy for an estimated  114 miles of range. It comes well equipped with 19-inch alloy wheels, LED  headlights and Level 3 DC fast-charging capability. Inside, the interior  upholstery is cloth (Deka World) and it comes with keyless entry, rain-sensing  headlights, adaptive cruise, heated front seats, Bluetooth, HD and satellite  radio, and BMW's basic Business navigation system with a modest 6.5-inch  display screen. </p>, <p>New  this year is the <strong>i3s</strong>, which has more  power and sharper handling than the i3. The electric motor in the i3s cranks  out 184 hp and 199 lb-ft of torque, which shortens its sprint from zero to 60  mph to 6.8 seconds (0.4 second quicker than the base i3). Compared to the i3,  the i3s' ride height sits 0.4 inch lower, and its fenders, track width (the  distance between the center of the tires), 20-inch wheels and performance tires  are wider. The wider, stickier tires come with a modest penalty —  maximum range drops to 107 miles.</p>, <p>The  only difference between the all-electric and the <strong>Range Extender</strong> versions is, quite simply, the range-extending,  0.6-liter two-cylinder gasoline generator, which is the same as last year's.  Because the Range Extender is heavier, these models don't travel quite as far  when operating on electricity alone, maxing out at an estimated 97 miles. A  2.3-gallon fuel tank enables a combined range of 180 miles for both Range  Extender versions of i3 and i3s models.</p>, <p>All  models can be equipped with the Technology + Driving Assistant package, which  adds advanced navigation with a widescreen display and advanced real-time  traffic, all-speed adaptive cruise control, and forward collision warning with  emergency braking. Opting for this package allows Apple CarPlay to be added,  too. </p>, <p>For  the i3, BMW offers three main upholstery packages — Mega World, Giga  World and Tera World — that add combinations of leather and wool or  full-leather upholstery plus different wheels and interior trim. Stand-alone  options include parking sensors, 20-inch wheels (for the regular i3), a premium  Harman Kardon audio system and a sunroof.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2017 BMW i3 w/Range Extender</strong> (battery  electric w/0.6L 2-cyl. gasoline generator | 1-speed direct drive | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current i3 has received some revisions,  including an updated infotainment system and a revised stability control  calibration. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's i3.</p>]

[<p>Think  of the M2 as a hot-rodded variant of the BMW 2 Series that's built to satisfy  driving enthusiasts. To that end, the M2 features typical M division upgrades  that include a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine good for 365  horsepower, sport-focused chassis and suspension changes, wider and stickier  tires, and bigger brakes.</p>, <p>The  result is one exceedingly agile and entertaining sport coupe that accomplishes  its goal without sacrificing too much in the way of comfort. Sure, it's a  little bit louder inside and rides a bit firmer, but not enough to restrict its  use to a weekend-only toy. </p>, <p>The  M2 might be our favorite BMW when it comes to driving quick, but it runs in a  highly competitive group with coupes that can offer even higher performance  levels and more exotic engines. Nevertheless, the M2's combination of luxury  and daily usability makes it an easy car to love. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW M2<strong> </strong>is a high-performance  rear-wheel-drive coupe that's available in one trim level. Most of the features  you'd want come standard, and there are only a few options and one package to  choose from. Under the hood is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder  (365 horsepower, 343 pound-feet of torque) that's connected to a six-speed  manual. A seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission is optional. </p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment includes lightweight 19-inch wheels, LED headlights, keyless ignition  and entry, auto-dimming mirrors, leather upholstery, carbon-fiber interior  trim, and power-adjustable sport front seats with heating. The infotainment  system includes a 8.8-inch central display, navigation, satellite radio, a USB  input, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system and BMW's ConnectedDrive phone  integration service. </p>, <p>After  that, the options list is pretty short. An Executive package<strong> </strong>adds forward collision warning and  mitigation (with automatic emergency braking), lane departure warning, a heated  steering wheel, rear parking sensors, adaptive headlights with automatic high  beams, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hotspot. The M Driver's package  increases the M2's speed limiter from 155 mph to 168 mph and provides one day  of training at a BMW high-performance driving school.</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include a sunroof and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration.</p>]

[<p>It's a common problem: You have to  transport your family, but you still want to go fast and have fun. What's a  driving enthusiast to do? Try the 2018 BMW M3. This performance variant of the  brand's 3 Series merges practicality and performance into one highly enjoyable  sport sedan. </p>, <p>The transformation from luxury-oriented 3  Series to really fast luxury-oriented M3 includes a vastly more powerful  six-cylinder engine, bigger wheels, stickier tires, stronger brakes and firmer  suspension tuning. The exterior changes are more subtle. Aficionados will  recognize it immediately, but most might not notice the quad exhaust tips,  domed hood, wider fenders and carbon-fiber roof.</p>, <p>What we really love about the M3, though,  is that it retains its civility in spite of the performance upgrades. The ride  quality remains comfortable thanks to adaptive dampers, the seats are  supportive yet comfortable enough for long road trips, and the back seat and  trunk are spacious. While there are higher-performing competitors, and more  luxurious ones, few blend both traits with the fluidity of the 2018 BMW M3. </p>]

[<p>The BMW <strong>M3 </strong>is a four-door, five-passenger high-performance car that's based  on the company's 3 Series. Its sedan layout gives it practicality for daily  use, while its sporting hardware upgrades make it more exciting to drive. The  few options packages available can increase performance further and add more  comfort features. </p>]

[<p>Under the hood is a 3.0-liter  turbocharged inline-six engine (425 horsepower, 406 pound-feet of torque) that  sends its power to the rear wheels through either a six-speed manual  transmission or a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic. </p>, <p>Standard equipment highlights include  adaptive suspension dampers, LED headlights, 18-inch wheels, power and heated  front seats, dual-zone climate control, keyless ignition and entry,  auto-dimming mirrors, BMW iDrive infotainment interface (with a 8.8-inch  display screen), a navigation system and a Harman Kardon sound system.</p>, <p>The Competition package sharpens the M3's  responses by boosting engine output to 444 hp and further tuning the suspension  and differential. It also includes lightweight 20-inch forged wheels. </p>, <p>The Driving Assistance package is where  you'll find advanced safety features. This package includes lane departure  warning, forward collision warning (with pedestrian detection) and low-speed  automatic emergency braking. It also adds a feature that displays the posted  speed limit in the gauge cluster. </p>, <p>The Executive package adds more  convenience-based extras such as adaptive headlights with auto high beams,  heating for the steering wheel and rear seats, a head-up display, side- and  top-view parking cameras, and an automated parking system.</p>, <p>Stand-alone options include  carbon-ceramic brake rotors, a nonadaptive suspension, a sunroof, blind-spot  monitoring, wireless device charging and Apple CarPlay phone integration.  Owners seeking more thrill should consider the M Driver's package, which is  essentially one day of high-performance driving education.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the <strong>2015 BMW M4 </strong>(turbo  3.0L inline-6 | 6-speed manual | RWD). </p>, <p>NOTE: The M4 is the coupe variant of the  M3. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's BMW M3, however.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW M4 represents an ideal marriage of sporting capability and luxury in one  car. Based on the brand's 4 Series, the M4 receives comprehensive upgrades that  make it equally capable of flying along a mountain road, lapping a racetrack or  just comfortably commuting to work. </p>, <p>Essentially,  the M4 is the hot-rodded version of the 4 Series coupe and convertible. It gets  the typical BMW M division treatment, including a significantly more powerful  twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine, stickier tires, bigger brakes and subtly  more aggressive styling. The conversion to M status doesn't diminish the 4  Series' luxury quotient either. The ride is compliant enough to drive the M4  and enjoy it daily, the seats are comfortable for a road trip and the interior  still boasts attractive materials and logically placed controls. And even  though it's a two-door, the M4 has decently roomy rear seats and a useful  trunk. </p>, <p>If you're  looking for a sports car that's more livable day to day or you want something a  little more exciting than the standard luxury coupe or convertible, you'd do  well to pick the 2018 BMW M4. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW M4 is a two-door, four-passenger high-performance car that's based on the  company's 4 Series and offered as a coupe or a convertible. We're big fans of  the M4's excellent balance of performance and comfort. And while we'd recommend  buying a few optional extras, the M4 is going to be a joy to drive every day  regardless of how you equip it.</p>]

[<p>As you'd  probably expect with a high-end two-door such as the M4, there's plenty of  standard equipment. For starters, you get a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline  six-cylinder engine (425 hp, 406 lb-ft) and either a six-speed manual  transmission or an optional seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic. Also included  is launch control, automatic rev-matching on downshifts, 18-inch wheels with  summer tires, an adaptive sport-tuned suspension (a standard nonadaptive  suspension is a no-cost option), an electronically controlled rear  differential, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate control,  leather upholstery, power front sport seats with heating, driver-seat memory  settings and fold-down rear seatbacks.</p>, <p>In  addition to the performance and cabin basics, the M4 has a decent amount of  standard tech equipment, including an 8.8-inch display screen with BMW's iDrive  infotainment interface, a rearview camera, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon  surround-sound audio system, Bluetooth, navigation, a suite of smartphone and  online applications under the BMW ConnectedDrive banner, HD radio and satellite  radio, a USB audio input and a CD player.</p>, <p>A few key  optional packages are available for the M4 as well. The <strong>Competition package</strong> ups the M4's power rating to 444 hp and adds  20-inch wheels, revised settings for the adaptive suspension, an even sportier  exhaust and some interior trim upgrades such as M stripes on the seat belts.  The <strong>Executive package </strong>adds full LED  headlights, automatic high beams, side- and top-view cameras, an automated  parking system, head-up display, and speed limit information.</p>, <p>Other  options include 19-inch wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, a heated steering wheel,  parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, a power rear sunshade (coupe only), a  head-up display, Apple CarPlay and wireless device charging. </p>, <p> On the  coupe, you get your choice of either a roof made of carbon-fiber-reinforced  plastic or a traditional steel roof with a sunroof. The M4 convertible has a  power-retractable hardtop with a wind blocker, as well as extended leather  upholstery and door trim incorporating sun-reflective technology. When equipped  with the Executive package, the convertible also includes front-seat neck  warmers.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2015 BMW M4 Coupe </strong>(turbo 3.0L inline-6  | 6-speed manual | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current BMW M4 has received some revisions,  including the addition of standard adaptive suspension and an optional  Competition package, which increases horsepower. Despite those changes, our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's BMW M4.</p>]

[<p>With its combination of four doors, a powerful  engine and capability to take on twisty back roads, racetracks and highways  with equal aplomb, BMW's M5 has been a mainstay for sport sedan buyers since  1986. But some would say BMW hasn't been keeping up with the times. Recent M5  generations lacked the athleticism of the earlier cars, and the competition  keeps getting better. For this redesigned model, though, BMW is aiming to put  the 2018 M5 back on top as the definitive sport sedan. </p>, <p>For power, the M5 relies on a retuned  version of the previous car's turbocharged V8. It now pumps out 600 horsepower  and 553 pound-feet of torque. More notably, that power is put through a  standard eight-speed automatic transmission (replacing last year's dual-clutch  automatic and optional manual transmission) and an adjustable all-wheel-drive  system. While BMW has used all-wheel drive for its X5 M and X6 M SUVs, this is  the first time it makes an appearance on an M division sedan. </p>, <p>It's the 2018 M5's handling that you'll  be most interested in, though. The previous M5 lacked the hard edge that made M  cars unique, but this one has it. BMW says the new M5 is lighter than before  and more engaging to drive. This is still a big sedan, but the revised  suspension and steering calibration have brought back some of that old-school  M5 mojo.</p>, <p>Of course, the M5 is the same well-appointed  luxury sedan as the regular 5 Series. But whether there's enough luxury might  be a question. Although its power and handling are prodigious, you have to know  how to manipulate the dizzying number of adjustable modes for the transmission,  throttle, suspension, steering, and drivetrain settings to make the most out of  the car. And even with the suspension in Comfort mode, some may find the ride  too harsh and the cabin too noisy. </p>, <p>Nevertheless,  ardent sport sedan aficionados will gladly make that compromise. The 2018 BMW  M5 is a dynamic return to form.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 BMW M5 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW <strong>M5 </strong>is a four-door,  five-seat sedan. It comes in only one primary configuration, and is equipped  with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine that produces 600 horsepower and 553  pound-feet of torque. The engine is mated to an eight-speed automatic  transmission that sends the power to all four wheels.</p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights include 19-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension, adaptive LED  headlights, a power trunklid, 20-way power front seats, a head-up display,  heated steering wheel and front seats, ambient interior lighting, and a  10.2-inch touchscreen-based navigation system. For the audio system, the M5  comes with a 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound system. Standard safety  features include front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning,  blind-spot detection and front collision mitigation.</p>, <p>There  are two option packages. The Driving Assistance Plus package enhances the  onboard safety package by adding active lane keeping assist, front and rear  cross traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control. The Executive package adds a  smorgasbord of luxury features such as four-zone climate control, power rear  sunshade with manual side window shades, ventilated and massaging front seats  and heated rear seats, wireless phone charging, an onboard LTE data modem,  soft-close doors, automatic parking, and a surround-view camera system.</p>, <p>Finally,  numerous stand-alone options that span performance, luxury and safety features  are available. These include larger 20-inch wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes,  night vision, Apple CarPlay connectivity, a rear-seat entertainment system, a  sunroof, and a 16-speaker Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio system.</p>]

[<p>Analyzed  logically, the 2018 BMW M6 seems excessive, absurd even. Do you really need a  big, two-door convertible that can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.3  seconds? Well, no. But this level of automobile surpasses <em>need </em>and plunges straight into the heart of desire.  </p>, <p>As  with other BMW M cars, the M6 starts off as a more common car from the lineup — in this case,  the 6 Series convertible —  and then gets the full M performance division treatment. That includes an  immensely powerful turbocharged V8, an upgraded suspension, stronger brakes,  and just enough styling flourishes to make the car stand out. </p>, <p>Even  in base form, the M6 convertible is stunningly fast for a car of its size and  weight. Add the 40 additional horsepower available in the Competition package  and the optional carbon-ceramic brakes to crank it up even more. A raft of  other options —  including different wheel designs, heated rear seats, contemporary driver aids,  special interior trim and even a manual transmission — offer an impressive level of  personalization. </p>, <p>The  M6 convertible's well-insulated fabric top also keeps wind noise mostly at bay.  And with the top down, the separate glass rear window can be raised to serve as  a wind blocker, facilitating civilized conversation and preserving hairstyles  to a degree. </p>, <p>Why  so much power and performance in a big convertible like this? The better  question is: Why not? If it's practicality you want, there's the M6 Gran Coupe  with its four doors. If it's economy you're seeking, the regular non-M-badged  650i convertible provides prodigious 445 horsepower for thousands less. There's  no rational explanation for why you'll need the M6 convertible, which is all  the more reason to want it. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW M6 is a high-performance luxury convertible available in a single trim  level. It stands apart from other 6 Series convertibles with sporty elements  such as unique front and rear fascias, quad tailpipes and a range of other  equipment. Under the hood is a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine (552  horsepower, 500 pound-feet of torque) paired to a seven-speed, dual-clutch  automatic transmission or a six-speed manual transmission. </p>]

[<p>From  there, the M6 convertible adds 19-inch alloy wheels, adaptive suspension  dampers, a limited-slip rear differential, adaptive LED headlights, front and  rear parking sensors, automatic wipers, automatic soft-close doors,  auto-dimming side mirrors with heating, keyless entry and ignition, heated  power front seats, driver-seat memory settings, leather upholstery and trim, a  power-adjustable steering wheel and carbon-fiber accents.</p>, <p>Also  standard are Bluetooth, adjustable drive settings, BMW's iDrive interface (with  a 10.2-inch display), a rearview camera, voice controls, a navigation system,  wireless device charging, a USB port, and a 16-speaker Harman Kardon  surround-sound audio system with HD and satellite radio. </p>, <p>The  M6 convertible's Executive package adds a heated steering wheel, ventilated and  massaging front seats, and a 16-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. The  Driving Assistance package features a lane departure warning system, blind-spot  monitoring, a forward collision warning system, low-speed collision mitigation,  and a head-up display. The Parking Assistance package adds side- and top-view  parking camera views. </p>, <p>For  more power (or if you want to take your M6 Gran Coupe to the track), you can  get the Competition package that increases engine output by 40 hp. It also  includes lightweight wheels; revised tuning for the suspension, steering and  rear differential; retuned stability control that provides a higher threshold  for intervention in the M Dynamic mode; and a black chrome finish for the  tailpipes. </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include an alternative 20-inch wheel design in silver or black,  carbon-ceramic brakes, a beige convertible top, Apple CarPlay compatibility,  and an infrared night-vision system with pedestrian detection. </p>]

[<p>Like the  M5 on which it's mechanically based, the 2018 BMW M6 Gran Coupe gets the full M  division treatment, at least compared to the standard 6 Series Gran Coupe. That  includes an immensely powerful turbocharged V8 with 560 horsepower (or an  optional 600 hp), an upgraded suspension, stronger brakes and plentiful luxury. </p>, <p>You also  get four doors, making the Gran Coupe a perhaps more pragmatic choice than the  M6 coupe or convertible, although its claims to be a five-passenger car  — it is, technically — are fanciful given its tidy  rear-seat room and middle seat hump. The M6 Gran Coupe works best for a  family of four, a couple with minimal luggage needs, or a single owner with a  few good friends. </p>, <p>In stock  form, the M6 Gran Coupe is stunningly fast for a car of its size and weight.  Add the Competition package and carbon-ceramic brakes and it's cranked up even  more, with excessive power and stopping ability. A raft of other options  — from five wheel designs, heated rear seats, contemporary driver  aids, interior trim, even a manual transmission — offer an impressive  level of personalization. </p>, <p>The price  for all this, of course, is price. The M6 Gran Coupe commands a significant  premium compared to the M5, for example, even though both cars perform at about  the same level. The M5 also has better backseat and trunk space. But for the  best mix of style, performance and practicality, the M6 Gran Coupe is among the  best on the road. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW M6 Gran Coupe is a five-passenger, high-performance luxury sedan available  in a single trim level. It stands apart visually from other 6 Series Gran  Coupes with sporty elements such as a carbon-fiber roof, unique front and rear  fascias, quad tailpipes, and a range of other equipment. </p>]

[<p>Standard  features start with a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine (560 horsepower, 500  pound-feet of torque) paired to a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission.  They also include 20-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers, a limited-slip  differential, automatic adaptive LED headlights, LED foglights and taillights,  front and rear parking sensors, automatic wipers, automatic soft-close doors,  power-folding and heated auto-dimming mirrors, keyless entry and ignition,  four-zone automatic climate control, power front seats (with heating and memory  settings), leather upholstery, extended leather trim, a power-adjustable  steering wheel, carbon-fiber accents and split rear-folding seatbacks. </p>, <p>Also  standard are Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, driver-adjustable  settings, BMW's iDrive interface (with a 10.2-inch display), online services  (including news and weather), smartphone app integration, a rearview camera,  voice controls, a navigation system, wireless device charging, a Wi-Fi hotspot,  and a 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system with HD radio,  satellite radio and USB-iPod integration. </p>, <p>The M6  Gran Coupe's Executive package adds a heated steering wheel, a head-up display  (also available separately), a power rear sunshade, power rear side-window  shades, ventilated, fatigue-reducing "active" front seats, heated  rear seats and a 16-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. </p>, <p>The Driver  Assistance Plus package features a lane departure warning system, blind-spot  monitoring, a surround-view camera system, and a forward collision warning  system with pedestrian detection, while the Parking Assistance package adds  side- and top-view parking cameras. </p>, <p>For more  power (or if you're interested in taking your M6 Gran Coupe to the track), you  can get the Competition package that increases engine power to 600 hp and 516  lb-ft of torque. You also get lightweight alloy wheels; revised tuning for the  suspension, steering and rear differential; retuned stability control that  provides a higher threshold for intervention in the M Dynamic mode; and a black  chrome finish for the tailpipes. </p>, <p>The M  Driver's package includes one full day of high-performance driver's training at  a BMW Performance Center and a higher top-speed limit (190 mph). </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include an alternative 20-inch wheel design in silver or black,  carbon-ceramic brakes, a synthetic suede headliner, Apple CarPlay compatibility  and an infrared night-vision system with pedestrian detection. A conventional  six-speed manual transmission is also a no-cost option. </p>]

[<p>With  the growing popularity of smaller, parking lot-friendly sport-utility vehicles,  traditional vehicles such as sedans and wagons are being left in the dust. And  SUVs such as the 2018 BMW X1 show why. Its small small size is perfect for  urban driving, while its low load floor and large cargo volume are perfect for  hauling duty. It is more expensive than many of its traditional competitors,  but the BMW X1 is aiming to give compact crossover buyers who want something  more sporty or luxurious a good choice in this already crowded market.</p>, <p>It  starts with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (228 hp, 258 lb-ft)  sending power to either the front or, optionally, all four wheels via an  eight-speed automatic transmission. Either powertrain combination is lively yet  smooth, and the X1 can zip to 60 mph in a class-leading 6.5 seconds. But the X1  isn't all about sportiness; its 40/20/40-split rear seatback increases  flexibility for carrying large or bulky items and people at the same time.</p>, <p>But  there some downsides to having a performance crossover. For one, the same  sticky tire and sporty suspension setup that keeps the chassis stable and stuck  in the turns also transmits high frequency bumps and noise into the cabin. Although  noise levels are no worse than others, the harsh ride over bumpy surfaces may  leave drivers wishing for a softer setup. Also, technology features that are  standard or packaged together in got-to-have option groups, such as parking  sensors and Apple CarPlay connectivity, are stand-alone options, so  double-check your build sheet before committing to the car.</p>, <p>Overall,  though, the 2018 BMW X1's functional and sporty characteristics warrant a solid  recommendation.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW X1 is a five-seat compact SUV in the luxury segment. It comes in two  versions: the front-wheel-drive <strong>X1  sDrive28i</strong> and the all-wheel-drive <strong>X1  xDrive28i</strong>. From there, you have two directions to go: xLine Design or the  sportier M Sport Design. After that, you can add various option groups that BMW  calls tiers. The M Sport Design already comes with the Convenience group, which  is optional on the xLine Design. Afterward, packages and stand-alone options  are available based on which initial design and group you select.</p>]

[<p>Powered  by a peppy 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (228 hp, 258 lb-ft) and  an eight-speed automatic transmission, the BMW X1 is an engaging small luxury  crossover. With the xLine Design, the X1 comes standard with 18-inch wheels,  foglamps, keyless ignition, automatic wipers and a power tailgate. On the  inside, standard equipment includes a 40/20/40-split folding rear seats,  power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat memory settings and a seven-speaker  audio system.</p>, <p>An  available Convenience package adds a panoramic sunroof, ambient interior  lighting, auto-dimming mirrors, keyless entry, satellite radio and adjustable  front-seat lumbar support.</p>, <p>The  M Sport Design package includes the features of the xLine Design's Convenience  group and adds various visual and performance upgrades that include different  18-inch wheels, gloss-black exterior trim, special interior trim, a sport-tuned  transmission and sport front seats.</p>, <p>Both  models can be equipped with a Premium equipment group that includes LED  headlights, a heated steering wheel and heated front seats, a head-up display  and a navigation system.</p>, <p>Also  available is a Driver Assistance package (includes automatic high beams, lane  departure warning and front collision warning and mitigation) and a Luxury  package (leather seating surfaces and wood trim).</p>, <p>Other  options include a 12-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound system, Apple CarPlay  connectivity, parking sensors, adaptive cruise control, in-car Wi-Fi hotspot  and wireless charging capability, and sliding and reclining rear seat  adjustability. M Sport Design cars can also swap out for stickier performance  tires and a stiffer M Sport suspension.</p>]

[<p>When the BMW X6 first launched for the  2008 model year, we were quick to scoff at a high-riding four-door SUV that the  Bavarian automaker had the nerve to call a coupe. Who would want a vehicle that  was, after all, a less practical and more expensive version of the venerable  X5? Time has proven us (kind of) wrong. While the X6 was never a major hit,  it's been successful enough that it's still around and has spawned spinoffs:  the X4 (based on the X3) and now the new 2018 BMW X2.</p>, <p>Like all of its even-numbered siblings,  the X2 shares its underpinnings with an existing SUV; in this case, it's the X1  subcompact crossover SUV. A slight reduction in overall height and length makes  the X2 look like a tall hatchback, in contrast to the X1's traditional crossover  profile. The X2 also has less headroom and cargo capacity than the X1, and it  costs significantly more. </p>, <p>As such, our advice is similar to what  we've said about those other stylized BMWs: There's little rational reason for  buying an X2. The X1 and rivals such as the Audi Q3, the Jaguar E-Pace and the  Volvo XC40 are all more practical and still plenty stylish. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW X2 is a subcompact luxury crossover with seating for five. It comes in  two versions: the front-wheel-drive <strong>sDrive28i</strong> and the all-wheel-drive <strong>xDrive28i</strong>.  Both are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (228  horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque) paired to an eight-speed automatic  transmission. Most optional extras are grouped into packages, which include  additional safety, luxury and performance features. A number of stand-alone  add-ons include leather upholstery, adaptive cruise control and Apple CarPlay  compatibility.</p>]

[<p>Both  trims share the same level of standard features, including 18-inch alloy  wheels, LED headlights and foglights, automatic wipers, a rearview camera, a  power liftgate, push-button ignition, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, driver-seat memory settings, power-adjustable front seats (with  adjustable bolsters and thigh extension), a 40/20/40-split rear seat, simulated  leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient interior  lighting, Bluetooth, BMW's <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/explore/connecteddrive.html">ConnectedDrive services</a>, the iDrive infotainment interface,  a 6.5-inch touchscreen, and a seven-speaker audio system with HD radio, a CD  player and a USB port.</p>, <p>A  number of packages are available, centering on additional luxury, performance  and safety features. Those who enjoy the finer things will want to consider the  Convenience and Premium packages. The <strong>Convenience </strong>package adds power-folding mirrors, keyless entry, a panoramic sunroof,  auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors, satellite radio and adjustable  lumbar support for the front seats. The <strong>Premium </strong>package includes a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a head-up  display, an 8.8-inch touchscreen and a navigation system. </p>, <p>The  comprehensive<strong> M SportX</strong> package  starts with the Convenience package and adds sporty upgrades, including 19-inch  wheels, aerodynamic enhancements, a sport-tuned automatic transmission, and an  M Sport steering wheel with wheel-mounted shift paddles. A sport-tuned  suspension is optional. The <strong>Dynamic  Handling</strong> package further adds adaptive dampers. </p>, <p>On  the safety front, the <strong>Driving Assistance</strong> package includes additional driver aids, such as automatic high-beam control,  lane departure warning, and forward collision warning with low-speed automatic  emergency braking.</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include 19- and 20-inch wheels, different interior appliques, front and  rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise control, leather upholstery, a Harman  Kardon premium sound system, Apple CarPlay integration, a wireless charging pad  and a rear spoiler.</p>]

[<p>Interest in any particular car typically  wanes as its gets older. Unless, that is, you're talking about the BMW X3. The  second-generation X3 was sold for seven years, yet BMW's constant enhancements  made this X3 a sales juggernaut long past the traditional life span. Now the  company has ushered in a fully redesigned 2018 X3 in hopes of keeping you  within the BMW family, even as rival automakers introduce a host of new and  recently revised luxury crossover SUVs.</p>, <p>From the outside, it's hard to tell BMW  did anything. The 2018 X3 resembles the outgoing model to the point that you  might not be able to tell the difference. The X3  itself is longer and wider, though, and the size boost produces tangible  increases in head- and legroom for all passengers. Like the outside, the inside  of the X3 is massaged rather than  overhauled. The central display is now a touchscreen that sticks up from the  dash, and it's loaded with the latest iDrive infotainment software and wireless  Apple CarPlay functionality.  </p>, <p>The redesigned X3 isn't a revolutionary  departure from its massively successful predecessor. From that vantage point,  the 2018 BMW X3 might seem like a bit of a disappointment. But as the old adage  goes, you don't fix what isn't broken. This newest X3 remains one of our top  recommendations for a luxury crossover SUV. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW X3 is a five-passenger crossover sold in two trims, each with its own  distinct powertrain. Under the hood of the <strong>xDrive30i</strong> is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (248 horsepower, 258  pound-feet of torque) paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and  all-wheel drive. Standard exterior features include 18-inch wheels, LED  headlights and foglights, automatic wipers, roof rails, a power tailgate, a  rearview camera, and power-folding, auto-dimming and heated mirrors. </p>]

[<p>Inside,  you'll find an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel with wheel-mounted shift paddles, keyless ignition, adjustable driving  modes, tri-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front sport seats,  a 40/20/40-split rear seat with individual seat recline, simulated leather  upholstery, driver-seat memory settings, a 6.5-inch central display, BMW's  iDrive infotainment interface, a USB port and a 12-speaker audio system. </p>, <p>There  are multiple options packages available for the xDrive30i. The <strong>Convenience </strong>package adds LED  headlights, keyless entry, a panoramic sunroof, satellite radio and four-way  power lumbar adjustment for the front seats. The <strong>M Sport</strong> package adds the contents of the Convenience package, plus  19-inch wheels, more aggressive-looking front and rear bumpers, a sport  steering wheel and a simulated leather-covered dashboard. Selecting either of  these opens the gates to the <strong>Dynamic  Handling </strong>package, which includes adaptive suspension dampers, upgraded  brakes and variable-ratio steering. </p>, <p>The <strong>M40i </strong>is driven by a turbocharged  3.0-liter six-cylinder engine producing 355 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque.  Additional features includes adaptive LED headlights, automatic high beams, a  sport exhaust, a sport-tuned suspension, front and rear parking sensors, a  launch control feature and the contents of the above three packages.</p>, <p>A  number of packages can be added to either model. Driver aids are available  through the <strong>Driving Assistance</strong> (forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure  warning, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert), <strong>Driving Assistance Plus</strong> (Driving  Assistance package, adaptive cruise control, front cross-traffic, alert and  lane departure warning and mitigation) and <strong>Parking  Assistance</strong> (front and rear parking sensors, an automated parking system and  a 360-degree parking camera) packages. </p>, <p>Additional  luxury features are included in the <strong>Premium </strong>(19-inch wheels, heated front seats, navigation, a 10.3-inch touchscreen, a  head-up display and BMW Remote Services) and <strong>Executive </strong>(Premium and Parking Assistance packages, adaptive LED  headlights, automatic high beams, leather upholstery, a digital instrument  panel and hands-free gesture controls for the touchscreen) packages.</p>, <p>Some  of the above features can be ordered as stand-alone options. Additional extras,  depending on packages selected, include 20- and 21-inch wheels, ventilated  front seats, heated rear seats, manual side-window shades, wireless phone  charging, Apple CarPlay, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system and a trailer  hitch.</p>]

[<p>How much are you willing to sacrifice for fashion?  This is an important question to answer as it will largely dictate how much  appeal the 2018 BMW X4 is going to have for you. The X4 is a lot like the  larger BMW X6. Both have a distinct sloping rear roofline for a coupelike  profile, plus plenty of aggressive styling flourishes to up the sporty  quotient. Compared to the X3 on which it is based, the X4 certainly looks  cooler. But let's not forget what the "U" in SUV stands for —  utility. That fastback rear hatch significantly cuts into cargo capacity as  well as rear-passenger space. </p>, <p>If style is a priority for your small luxury  crossover SUV, the 2018 BMW X4 is certainly a strong contender. But for  everybody else, we suggest checking out more capable alternatives, some of  which are within BMW's own model lineup.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW X4 xDrive28i is already a potent little performer and will satisfy the  majority of drivers. Almost all of the features from the range-topping M40i are  available as options, so you won't be missing much other than the overabundance  of power.</p>, <p>BMW's  suite of advanced safety features is among the best in the industry, so for  either the xDrive28i or the M40i, we'd recommend adding the Driving Assistance  package. Otherwise, we caution against adding much else since options are  expensive and quickly send the price into another bracket.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  BMW X4 is a compact luxury SUV with a sloping rear roofline, much like the  larger but equally sleek BMW X6. It is available in two trim levels: the <strong>xDrive28i </strong>and <strong>M40i</strong>. The xDrive 28i is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (240 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque) while the M40i  gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder (355 hp, 343 lb-ft). Both come with  an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard <strong>xDrive28i</strong> features include 19-inch  alloy wheels, automatic adaptive xenon headlights, LED foglights, rain-sensing  wipers, a sunroof, heated and power-folding exterior mirrors, auto-dimming  mirrors, a power liftgate, front and rear parking sensors, selectable drive  modes and cruise control.</p>, <p>On the  inside, the features list continues with dual-zone automatic climate control,  eight-way power front seats with driver memory functions, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, simulated leather upholstery,  40/20/40-split folding rear seats, a universal garage door opener, BMW Assist  emergency telematics, BMW's iDrive infotainment system, a rearview camera,  Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, and a nine-speaker CD player with HD radio  and USB-auxiliary input.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the X4 <strong>M40i </strong>will add an  adaptive suspension, keyless entry and ignition, and a premium Harman Kardon  audio system with satellite radio. It also comes with the M Sport package that  includes unique aerodynamic exterior touches, black exterior trim, a  sport-tuned suspension, an increased top speed, sport seats and a sport  steering wheel. </p>, <p>Bundled  options include the Cold Weather package (heated front and rear seats, a heated  steering wheel and headlight washers); the Driving Assistance package (forward  collision warning and mitigation, lane departure warning, blind-spot  monitoring, a head-up display and a speed limit display); and the Parking  Assistance package (a surround-view camera system and an automated parking  system). The M40i is also eligible for the Lighting package (adaptive LED  headlights and automatic high beams).

[<p>The 2018 BMW X5 serves as a benchmark for  the modern luxury performance crossover SUV. It impressively combines the  attributes you normally associate with a BMW sedan and then adds true utility.  A wide range of engine choices and trim packages ensures buyers can find the  right configuration for their needs. </p>, <p>The  X5 engine options include a turbocharged six-cylinder (300 horsepower, 300  pound-feet of torque), a diesel six-cylinder (255 hp, 413 lb-ft), a powerful V8  (445 hp, 480 lb-ft) and a plug-in hybrid (308 hp, 332 lb-ft). No matter what's  under the hood, the X5 simultaneously provides a comfortable ride and sporty  handling, and the X5's all-wheel-drive system provides extra traction in wet  weather or the occasional trip off pavement.</p>, <p>There  are a few downsides to the X5, with the main one being interior space. It's  just not as roomy as some rival crossovers with third-row seats. Some of those  rivals have fresher and newer designs, too. But overall we think the X5 is a  solid pick if you want a luxury vehicle that offers a great combination of  performance and utility.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 BMW X5 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 BMW X5 is a midsize luxury SUV that is available in <strong>35i</strong>, <strong>35d</strong>, <strong>40e</strong> and <strong>50i</strong> trim levels. All have all-wheel  drive (xDrive) except for the 35i, which comes standard with rear-wheel drive  (sDrive). A high-performance X5 M variant is reviewed separately. There is  seating for five passengers, and an optional third-row seat increases capacity  to seven.</p>]

[<p>Standard features for the <strong>35i</strong> and <strong>35d</strong> models  include 19-inch wheels, adaptive xenon headlights, LED foglights, power-folding  and heated mirrors, auto-dimming mirrors, automatic wipers, a panoramic  sunroof, roof rails, a power liftgate, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>On the inside, you get dual-zone automatic climate control,  a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, premium vinyl upholstery,  power-adjustable and heated front seats, driver-seat memory functions,  40/20/40-split folding rear seats, BMW Assist emergency communications, a 10.2-inch  central display screen, BMW's iDrive infotainment interface, a navigation  system, voice controls and a nine-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>The <strong>40e</strong> plug-in  hybrid includes all of the above, along with adjustable suspension dampers and  rear air suspension (optional on all other X5s), along with hybrid-specific  instrumentation and additional iDrive menu items.</p>, <p>The X5 <strong>50i</strong> includes all of the features found in the 35i along with keyless ignition and  entry, leather upholstery, upgraded front seats, four-zone climate control and  16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system.</p>, <p>Options include the Luxury, xLine and M Sport equipment  lines that have different wheel designs (up to 20 inches), color schemes, and  trim and upholstery types. The M Sport also includes sport front seats and  shift paddles for the transmission.</p>, <p>Other bundled options include the Premium package for all  but the 50i (keyless ignition and entry, four-zone climate control and  satellite radio) and the Luxury Seating package (multicontour front seats with  ventilation).</p>, <p>The Driver Assistance package adds a variety of driver  safety aids, and you can get even more with the Driver Assistance Plus package.  The Dynamic Handling package for xDrive models adds adaptive dampers, a rear  air suspension and a body-roll mitigation feature for improved road holding.  The Lighting package bundles upgraded adaptive LED headlights and automatic  high-beam headlight control.</p>, <p>Other options for the BMW X5 include Apple CarPlay, a  16-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen surround-sound audio system, upgraded or extended  leather upholstery, upgraded interior trim and manual sunshades for the rear  windows. All X5s except the hybrid can be equipped with second-row comfort  seats (with fore/aft and recline adjustment) and a third-row seat (includes the  rear air suspension). You can also order a rear-seat entertainment system and a  night-vision camera system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2014 BMW X5 </strong>(turbo 3.0L inline-6  | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current X5 has received minor revisions,  including changes to the infotainment unit and a shuffling of options and trims  structure. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's X5.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW X5 M handles everyday SUV duty with comfort, style and refinement.  It's also ridiculously fast and cuts winding roads like a knife. How fast? It  dashes from zero to 60 mph in 4 seconds flat, a shade faster than BMW's iconic  M4 sport coupe. Now wondering whether you need an SUV that makes more than 500  horsepower or reaches a top speed of 160 mph misses the point. It's best to  just marvel at a machine that can take you for both a sedate run to Costco, or  to county jail for excessive speed, with such ease. </p>, <p>But  the X5 M isn't just about making an SUV out of a high-performance sport sedan.  Its roomy cabin is richly appointed with quality leather and user-friendly  technology; the tall ride height gives a commanding view of the road; and the  cargo area, while not cavernous, ranks with those of other SUVs in its class.  Let this assuage any feelings of frivolous indulgence if you're considering the  X5 M as a family car. </p>, <p>That's  not to say it's the best choice, however. Given its performance bias, the X5  M's suspension is tuned firm for superb handling. It's not rock hard, but some  passengers will notice. The interior leaks more wind and road noise than SUVs  at this price should. There's no third-row seat, and the X5 M costs  significantly more than the top "regular" X5 model, the X5  xDrive50i. But if you like cars that breathe fire and come nearly loaded (this  being a BMW, there are still plenty of costly options available), the X5 M is  one of the best picks in its class.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 BMW X5 M is a high-performance  midsize luxury SUV with seating for five. It's offered in a single trim level.  As with any BMW, a bundle of options offer further personalization. Several are  grouped into the useful Executive package, while most are stand-alone items. </p>]

[<p>The  X5 M is powered by a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine (567 hp, 553 pound-feet  of torque) paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Standard  features include 21-inch wheels, high-performance tires, adaptive suspension  dampers, a rear air suspension, a panoramic sunroof, roof rails, front and rear  parking sensors, a power liftgate, adaptive headlights, keyless entry and  adaptive cruise control. </p>, <p>Interior  highlights include heated front seats, 40/20/40-split folding rear seatbacks,  four-zone climate control, a leather-wrapped dash, ambient cabin lighting,  aluminum trim accents and a rearview camera. </p>, <p>Finally,  standard tech features include a navigation system with a 10.2-inch touchscreen  display with a touchpad-equipped controller, Bluetooth phone and audio, a  16-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, satellite and HD radio, and BMW's  umbrella of smartphone-integrated connected services called Connected Drive.</p>, <p>Considering  all that standard equipment, the X5 M has a short options list. The Executive  package includes adaptive LED headlights, power-closing doors, a heated  steering wheel, rear side window shades, a head-up information display,  wireless smartphone charging and a Wi-Fi hotspot. A suite of driver safety  features also comes with the package and includes forward collision warning,  pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, automatic  high beams, surround-view cameras and a self-parking system. </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include 20-inch wheels, aluminum-look exterior trim, a 16-speaker Bang  &amp; Olufsen audio system, Apple CarPlay compatibility, night vision with  pedestrian detection, and a rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens.</p>]

[<p>When  the X6 launched for 2008, it was met with skepticism from automotive critics.  Its coupelike roofline didn't allow the prodigious amount of cargo space people  expected from three-row monster-sized SUVs. Nor did it really drive like a  sleek, low-slung sports sedan. There were probably a few who predicted an  untimely demise. Yet here we are a decade later and the 2018 BMW X6 is still  around. </p>, <p>Undoubtedly,  there's a small but willing group of buyers who want a luxury sedan but with a  higher seating position and ground clearance. The X6's sporty look has been  part of the appeal as well, and it's backed up by two powerful turbocharged  engine options.</p>, <p>If  you know you won't be transporting five passengers or hauling an armoire, the  X6 could be a fun choice for a SUV. But expect to pay a price for its exclusive  looks and capability. It's more expensive than its similarly equipped but more  conventional sibling, the X5 SUV. And for that "savings" with the X5,  you get more interior volume, towing capability and better visibility.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW X6 is a fastback SUV in three main configurations. The X6 <strong>sDrive35i</strong> has a turbocharged  six-cylinder engine (300 horsepower, 300 pound-feet of torque) and rear-wheel  drive. The <strong>xDrive35i</strong> has the same  engine but with all-wheel drive. At the top of the range is the all-wheel-drive <strong>xDrive50i</strong> and its turbocharged V8  (445 hp, 480 lb-ft). Standard equipment is similar on each, and a variety of  option packages are available to further deck out the X6.</p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment (BMW calls this the xLine Design) includes 19-inch wheels, adaptive  xenon headlights, automatic wipers, a sunroof, a power liftgate, front and rear  parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery,  power-adjustable and heated front seats, driver-seat memory settings and a  40/20/40-split folding rear seat.</p>, <p>The  X6 also comes with BMW's iDrive infotainment interface, navigation, BMW  ConnectedDrive services (including BMW Assist emergency communications) and  integrated smartphone apps, and a nine-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>xDrive50i</strong> gets you the V8  engine, keyless ignition and entry, four-zone automatic climate control,  upgraded front seats, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system, a  surround-view camera system, lane departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, and  forward collision warning with low-speed automatic braking. </p>, <p>Except  for the V8 engine, all of these features are optionally available for the 35i  models.</p>, <p>Both  trims can be equipped with an Executive package that comes with soft-close  doors, adaptive LED headlights with automatic high beams, and a head-up  display. An available Dynamic Handling package includes adaptive suspension  dampers with a rear air suspension and active roll stabilization. There's also  an M Sport package that gives the X6 sportier-looking body work and special  interior trim.</p>, <p>Finally,  Apple CarPlay integration, a premium Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system, a  rear-seat entertainment system and a night-vision system are just some of the  stand-alone options available.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 BMW X6 M stands tall like an SUV, and its four doors and liftgate appear  to offer something like SUV utility. But it's an illusion since this racy  567-hp sportback makes only a fleeting concession to practicality.</p>, <p>Like  any BMW M division vehicle, the X6 M handles daily driving duties with style  and refinement, but it also turns violently fast with just a firm kick of the  gas pedal. How fast? It dashes from zero to 60 mph in 4 seconds flat, a shade  faster than BMW's iconic M4 sport coupe. Whether you need an SUV with this much  power misses the point. It's best to just marvel at a machine that can take you  for both a sedate run to Costco, or to county jail for excessive speed, with  such ease. </p>, <p>But  to say the X6 M's fastback exterior design favors style over substance is an  understatement. Though the sloping roofline gives the car a sleek and racy  look, it also compromises rear-seat access and headroom and limits cargo  capacity. The X6 M's suspension is also tuned for high-performance handling,  which means that it's firm and choppy. It's not rock-hard, but your passengers  will notice. Suffice to say, there's also no option for a third row. </p>, <p>All  of which is to say that the X6 M isn't your best choice for a proper family  SUV. If you need that, BMW's X5 M delivers the same kind of performance with a  dash more practicality. But if you like an SUV that breathes fire, one that  won't be mistaken for any other SUV on the road, then the X6 M is an obvious  choice. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Buick Cascada promises to be a reasonably priced four-person luxury  convertible. Unfortunately, under its sleek shell the Buick Cascada is an aging  vehicle that is not up to the standards of today's market. It simply can't  compete in terms of price, performance, comfort, features or quality. </p>, <p>We do like the Cascada's low levels of  interior noise for a convertible. And, yes, the trunk is more sizable than  other convertibles'. But that's only if you commit to top-up motoring and close  the partition that lets you lower the roof. Beyond that, the car's substantial  weight and small engine conspire to make it slower, less efficient and less  gratifying to drive than its competitors. Meanwhile, the dated interior is  packed with buttons and a touchscreen infotainment system that's decidedly a  generation behind those of competitors. It doesn't help that the firm seats and  hard plastics within don't live up to the badge's premium aspirations.</p>, <p>Before committing to a Cascada, we  recommend test-driving some of the Buick's competitors. The Ford Mustang  convertible offers a more powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine, more  comfortable front seats, and a folding roof that doesn't interfere with trunk  space. </p>, <p>If you don't like the sports-car look,  there's the Mini Convertible, which feels more premium, is more fun to drive,  and is only a little less utilitarian than the Cascada when the top comes  down.  The Cascada's top trim level is  even priced within spitting distance of the Audi A3 Cabriolet, which in base  trim offers similar equipment and a significantly more upscale experience. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Buick Cascada convertible is offered in three trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Premium </strong>and <strong>Sport Touring</strong>.  All trims come with largely the same equipment, with the Premium receiving a  handful of upgrades and the Sport Touring primarily being an appearance  package. </p>]

[<p>Powering  all versions is a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 200  horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque. It drives the front wheels through a  six-speed automatic transmission. </p>, <p>Standard  equipment for the <strong>base</strong> model  (referred to as simply Cascada) includes 20-inch alloy wheels, a power-operated  convertible soft top, adaptive xenon headlights, LED daytime running lights and  taillights, heated mirrors, rear parking sensors and remote engine start.  Inside, you'll find dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery,  eight-way power and heated front seats, 50/50-split folding rear seats, a  heated tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a 7-inch touchscreen display (with  Buick's IntelliLink interface), voice controls, a rearview camera, OnStar (with  4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot), and a seven-speaker sound system with a CD player,  satellite radio and a USB media interface.</p>, <p>The  Cascada <strong>Premium </strong>adds foglights,  automatic wipers, automatic headlights, forward collision warning, lane  departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, air deflectors for the front  and rear seats, and a navigation system.</p>, <p>Step  up to the new <strong>Sport Touring</strong> trim and  you get a unique paint color and distinctive alloy wheels, special black  interior trim and flat-bottom steering wheel.</p>]

[<p>Originally  debuting for the 2008 model year, the first-generation Buick Enclave stood out  in the three-row crossover SUV segment for its roomy interior and smooth and  quiet ride. The redesigned 2018 Buick Enclave aims to continue in that  tradition while raising the bar in the style and technology departments.</p>, <p>Equipped  with a more powerful 3.6-liter V6 engine this year (302 horsepower and 260 pound-feet), the Enclave should be notably quicker, especially since this  year's model weighs hundreds of pounds less. The 2018 Enclave is slightly  longer than last year and offers additional legroom for the second-row and  third-row passengers. Maximum cargo space is less than before, but there's  still a generous 97.6 cubic feet with the second and third rows folded down. </p>, <p>We expect the 2018 Enclave will be an  appealing choice for a premium three-row crossover SUV, but we won't know for  sure until we get a chance to test one ourselves. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Buick Enclave is available in four trims. They all use the same 3.6-liter  V6 engine (302 hp, 260 lb-ft) and a nine-speed automatic transmission. The  standard <strong>Enclave </strong>is available only  in front-wheel drive; the remaining trims are available in front- or all-wheel  drive. The <strong>Essence</strong> features  additional safety and comfort tech, while the <strong>Premium</strong> trim adds more luxury and safety amenities. At the top, the <strong>Avenir</strong> promises tech, safety and  comfort features on par with what's offered in the best luxury crossovers. All  Enclaves have seating for seven.</p>]

[<p>Even  in base form, the <strong>Enclave</strong> comes with  features that make it competitive in the three-row SUV segment. It comes  standard with 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, rear parking sensors, keyless  entry and ignition, remote engine start, three-zone automatic climate control,  power-adjustable front seats with heating, adjustable second-row captain's  chairs and 60/40-split folding third-row seats. Standard in-car technology includes  an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto integration, OnStar communications (with 4G LTE and  Wi-Fi hotspot), USB ports (two in front and four for rear passengers), and a  six-speaker sound system with satellite radio. </p>, <p>The <strong>Essence</strong> includes a blind-spot  monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, a cabin air ionization system  and leather seating surfaces. Optionally, you can add all-wheel drive, a  heavy-duty tow package that allows you to pull up to 5,000 pounds, a top-down  parking camera system and a sunroof.</p>, <p><strong>Premium </strong>models add low-speed forward  collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, front parking sensors,  driver-seat memory settings, a Bose 10-speaker premium speaker system, lane  departure warning and intervention, a heated steering wheel, heated seats for  outboard second-row passengers, ventilated seats for the front row, and  power-folding third-row seats.</p>, <p>Top-trim <strong>Avenir</strong> models roll on 20-inch wheels  and receive a navigation system (optional on the Essence and Premium), a larger  driver information display, a rearview mirror with integrated camera display,  the sunroof and top-down parking camera system, premium leather upholstery,  upgraded interior trim, and a wireless device charging pad. Optionally, you can  spec your Avenir with an adaptive suspension and an Avenir Technology package  that allows for stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, automatic braking, grille  shutters to increase aerodynamic efficiency, and the aforementioned adaptive  suspension package. </p>]

[<p>Like  other subcompact crossover SUVs, the 2018 Buick Encore's core appeal is its  maneuverability and fuel efficiency. But the Encore is also a bit more upscale  than the norm. It has more standard and optional features, and its interior is  quieter at highway speeds. </p>, <p>The  Encore's performance, however, is still a little disappointing. The Encore is  related to the Chevrolet Trax, and both have a base 138-horsepower turbocharged  engine. Acceleration is slow, and real-world fuel economy is underwhelming.  Buick offers a more powerful 153-hp engine upgrade, but it's not a huge  difference. Additionally, you'll typically pay more to get an Encore compared  similarly sized rivals. </p>, <p>From  our standpoint, the Encore's appeal largely depends on what you're looking for.  If you like its size and mix of premium features, it's more than likely an  ideal pick. But you should also look at the Mazda CX-3, which is just as nice  and less expensive to boot. Additionally, the Encore's price is pretty close to  what you'll pay for a roomier crossover, such as the Chevrolet Equinox and  Honda CR-V.</p>, <p>Overall, we recommend a few test drives of competitors, but if you're looking  for a nimble, relatively upscale subcompact crossover SUV, the 2018 Buick  Encore certainly has some curb appeal.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Buick Encore is a compact crossover SUV offered in six trim levels: <strong>1SV</strong>, <strong>Preferred</strong>, <strong>Sport Touring</strong>, <strong>Preferred II</strong>, <strong>Essence</strong> and <strong>Premium</strong>.  Less expensive Encores come standard with a turbocharged 1.4-liter  four-cylinder engine (138 hp, 148 lb-ft), a six-speed automatic transmission  and front-wheel drive. From the Sport Touring trim level on up, there's a more  powerful 1.4-liter engine (153 hp, 177 lb-ft) available. Every trim aside from  the base 1SV is also available with all-wheel drive as an option. </p>]

[<p>For  the most part, the base <strong>1SV</strong> and <strong>Preferred</strong> trim levels are equipped  similarly. On both, you get 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED  running lights, keyless ignition and entry, heated mirrors, roof rails, rear  privacy glass, air-conditioning, cruise control, a power driver seat, a fold-flat  front passenger seat and 60/40-split folding rear seats. </p>, <p>Technology  features include <a href="http://www.onstar.com/us/en/home.html">OnStar</a> communications (with 4G LTE and an  in-car Wi-Fi hotspot), a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto, and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio and two  USB ports. Also included is Buick's IntelliLink electronics interface, which  features an 8-inch touchscreen and smartphone app integration.</p>, <p>On  the<strong> Preferred</strong>, you also get floor  mats and a cargo cover.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>Sport Touring</strong> model means  the addition of foglights, a rear spoiler and remote start to the base model's  features. Options include a seven-speaker Bose sound system and a blind-spot  monitoring system. </p>, <p>The <strong>Preferred II </strong>adds dual-zone  automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 120-volt  household-style power outlet, and the blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert systems. </p>, <p>Moving  up to <strong>Essence</strong> adds LED headlights,  leather upholstery, a six-way power passenger seat (with manual recline and  power lumbar), heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and driver-seat  memory settings.</p>, <p>Finally,  the top-of-the-line <strong>Premium</strong> trim  adds front and rear parking sensors, a forward collision warning system, a lane  departure warning system, automatic wipers and the seven-speaker Bose sound  system. </p>, <p>The  Preferred II, Essence and Premium are available with the Experience Buick  package, which adds 18-inch chromed alloy wheels, a sunroof and a navigation  system. The latter two items are available separately on all but the base  model.</p>]

[<p>Among small luxury crossover SUVs, the  2018 Buick Envision might be worth your attention. Though its exterior styling  is generic, it comes with a generous amount of features for the price and has  an attractive interior trimmed in high-quality materials. It slots between the  compact Encore and larger Enclave in Buick's portfolio. As such, it's pretty  easy to maneuver around town but still has a decent amount of interior and  cargo space.</p>, <p>We recommend stepping up to the  Envision's optional turbocharged 2.0-liter engine since it provides a more  suitable amount of power for a luxury crossover. At that point, the Envision is  priced similarly to crossovers such as the Acura RDX and Volvo XC60 but still  less than what you'll likely pay for an Audi Q5 or BMW X3. In total, there's  nothing about the Envision that makes it truly stand out in this class, but it  nonetheless covers the bases well enough to make it worth a look.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Buick Envision is a midsize crossover SUV with seating for five. There are  five trim levels offered, starting with the base <strong>Envision</strong> trim. It is only available as front-wheel drive and comes  with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (197 horsepower, 192 pound-feet of  torque). All-wheel drive can be added to the <strong>Preferred</strong> and <strong>Essence</strong> trims. The <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Premium</strong> <strong>II</strong> trims have all-wheel drive as standard and come with a  turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (252 hp, 260 lb-ft). All Envisions use a  six-speed automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the base <strong>Envision</strong> trim  include 18-inch wheels, foglights, auto-dimming and heated mirrors, a  hands-free power liftgate with adjustable opening heights, rear parking  sensors, keyless ignition and entry, remote start, dual-zone automatic climate  control, power-adjustable and heated front seats, and 60/40-split folding rear  seats. Standard tech features include OnStar communications (includes 4G LTE  connection and Wi-Fi hotspot), Bluetooth, a rearview camera, an 8-inch  touchscreen, a rearview camera, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration, four USB ports (two are charge-only), Bluetooth, and a six-speaker  sound system with satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>Preferred</strong> trim is essentially the  same but is eligible for more options. The <strong>Essence</strong> trim adds three-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, a heated  steering wheel, driver-seat memory settings, heated outboard rear seats, and  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. </p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>Premium</strong> trim gets you  19-inch wheels, front parking sensors, automatic wipers, a larger driver  information display, a seven-speaker Bose premium audio system, a 110-volt  household power outlet, a forward collision alert system, and lane departure  warning and intervention system. </p>, <p>At  the top of the range, the <strong>Premium II</strong> trim adds adaptive xenon headlights, automatic high beams, an automated parking  system, a navigation system, a head-up display, an extendable thigh support for  the driver seat, and ventilated front seats. This trim is eligible for the  Driver Confidence package that includes adaptive cruise control, a top-down  parking camera system, and forward collision mitigation system with automatic  braking.</p>, <p>Some  features are available on supporting trims as options. Other add-ons include a  panoramic sunroof, side assist steps, a roof rack and a cargo cover. </p>]

[<p>Buick has been trying for years to  re-establish itself as a luxury brand, and the 2018 LaCrosse represents a solid  step toward reaching that goal. Though it certainly delivers for shoppers  simply seeking a larger, more comfortable and more refined car than what is  offered in the midsize sedan segment, this big Buick transcends its typical  large sedan competitors by staking a legitimate claim to luxury status.  Possessing a nicely crafted cabin, attractive styling and sophisticated driving  manners, it genuinely competes with cars from Lexus and Lincoln. In other  words, this is so not Grandma's old Century.</p>, <p>For 2018, Buick has diversified the  LaCrosse's lineup with a new base engine that puts an emphasis on fuel economy.  Called eAssist, this mild hybrid system subtly helps the four-cylinder engine  return a Buick-estimated 35 mpg highway. It's important to note that the  eAssist is not a full hybrid like those offered by several of the LaCrosse's  key competitors. However, it is cheaper than those competitors, and it's really  best to think of the eAssist as simply a fuel-economy-focused base engine. </p>, <p>Regardless of the engine you get, the  2018 Buick LaCrosse delivers an impeccably quiet and comfortable driving  experience. We also like the LaCrosse's surprisingly adept handling when the  car is fitted with the highly recommended Dynamic Drive package. Overall, we  recommend the LaCrosse if you're searching for a comfortable and luxurious  large sedan.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Buick LaCrosse is available in <strong>base 1SV</strong>, <strong>Preferred</strong>, <strong>Essence</strong> and <strong>Premium</strong> trim levels. All come standard  with a mild hybrid powertrain known as eAssist that features a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder, a six-speed automatic and a small electric motor that together  produce 194 horsepower and 187 pound-feet of torque. Optional is a 3.6-liter V6  (310 hp, 268 lb-ft) paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel  drive is standard, while the Essence and Premium can be fitted with all-wheel  drive and the V6.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>base  1SV </strong>comes standard with 18-inch wheels, automatic xenon headlights,  foglights, heated mirrors, rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, keyless  ignition and entry, remote engine start, dual-zone automatic climate control,  rear air vents, simulated leather upholstery, eight-way power-adjustable front  seats (with two-way driver lumbar adjustment), OnStar (with an onboard 4G LTE  Wi-Fi hotspot), an eight-speaker sound system and the Buick IntelliLink  infotainment interface that includes an 8-inch touchscreen, two USB ports,  Bluetooth connectivity, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone app  integration.</p>, <p>The <strong>Preferred</strong> adds a power-adjustable steering wheel, satellite radio and a cargo net.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>Essence</strong> trim gets you  adaptive headlights, auto-dimming mirrors, driver-seat memory functions, leather  upholstery, heated front seats, passenger-seat two-way lumbar adjustment and  wireless smartphone charging. Optional for this trim level is the Driver  Confidence 1 package that adds blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alert systems. </p>, <p>The <strong>Premium</strong> trim includes the Driver  Confidence 1 items and adds forward collision warning, a head-up display, lane  departure warning and intervention, the Safety Alert driver seat (buzzes to get  your attention to various safety warning systems), an ionizing air cleaner, a  heated steering wheel, and ventilated front seats with massage and four-way  lumbar adjustment. The Driver Confidence 2 package adds adaptive cruise  control, forward automatic emergency braking (detects vehicles and pedestrians)  and an automatic parking system.</p>, <p>The  Essence and Premium can be bolstered with three option packages. The Sun and  Shade package has a panoramic sunroof and a power rear sunshade. The Sights and  Sounds package adds a navigation system to IntelliLink and an 11-speaker,  premium Bose surround-sound audio system. Finally, the Dynamic Drive package  equips the LaCrosse with 20-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers and, for  front-wheel-drive models, an upgraded front suspension design.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Buick Regal Sportback is an all-new model that adds a slight twist to the  formula used for Regal sedans of the past. Instead of a traditional trunk on  most cars in the class, the Regal Sportback has a hatchback that gives it a  sleeker, coupelike profile and an added dose of utility. It's something that  German automakers have been doing for a while now with vehicles such as the  Audi A7 and BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe.</p>, <p>Compared  to the previous Regal, the Sportback offers more than twice the cargo capacity  (31.5 cubic feet) and a more flexible, easier-to-access cargo area. Folding the  rear seats down further expands the cargo area to 60.7 cubic feet, which is  even more than Buick's Envision compact SUV offers.</p>, <p>You  wouldn't know it was so big inside from looking at it, however. But the Regal  Sportback rides on a wheelbase that's 3 inches longer than the previous Regal,  a change that gives it a long, low profile. Overall, the Regal Sportback is  slightly longer in both overall length and wheelbase than the Acura TLX, a car  that shares a similar price range.</p>, <p>The  standard engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 250  horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque in the front-wheel-drive model. With  the optional all-wheel drive, the torque number jumps to 295 lb-ft.  Front-wheel-drive models come with a nine-speed automatic, and all-wheel-drive  models get an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>If  you're interested in even more performance, there's the new Regal GS, which  shares the same body style but comes with a 310-horsepower V6 and standard  all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>We'll  know more about the 2018 Buick Regal in the coming months once we obtain one  for testing. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Buick Regal Sportback is  available in four trim levels: Regal <strong>1SV</strong>, <strong>Preferred</strong>, <strong>Preferred II</strong> and <strong>Essence</strong>.  A sporty RS trim is expected to debut later in the model year.</p>]

[<p>The standard engine is a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (250 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque) in  front-wheel-drive models. With the optional all-wheel drive, the torque number jumps  to 295 lb-ft. Front-wheel-drive models come with a nine-speed automatic, and  all-wheel-drive models get an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The Regal <strong>1SV</strong> offers standard features including 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, LED daytime running lights, heated power side mirrors,  keyless entry and ignition, 60/40-split folding rear seats, a rearview camera,  OnStar (with a 4G LTE connection and Wi-Fi hotspot), and a seven-speaker audio  system with a 7-inch touchscreen interface and USB port. </p>, <p>Moving up to the <strong>Preferred</strong> adds a power-adjustable driver seat, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. It also offers options  such as the Driver Confidence package that includes 18-inch wheels, LED  headlights, rear parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert. The Sights and Sounds package adds a navigation system, an 8-inch  touchscreen (with Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration), dual rear seat charge-only USB ports, and a Bose eight-speaker  audio system with HD radio. A sunroof is also available as a stand-alone  option. </p>, <p>The <strong>Preferred  II</strong> comes with the upgraded 8-inch touchscreen plus 18-inch wheels,  dual-zone automatic climate control, 40/20/40-split folding rear seats, a  heated steering wheel, and a driver information screen between the gauges.  All-wheel-drive models also feature active noise cancellation through the audio  system. You can get the optional Driver Confidence package with this trim as  well. It offers the same features listed above plus wireless device charging,  while the Sights and Sounds package adds navigation and the premium Bose audio  system.</p>, <p>The range-topping <strong>Essence</strong> trim bundles the standard features of the lower trims and  adds leather upholstery, heated front seats and a power-adjustable passenger  seat. The optional Driver Confidence package adds the same features as on the  lower trims but also tacks on driver-position memory and an auto-dimming side  mirror for the driver. A second Driver Confidence package (called Driver  Confidence II, naturally) pads on adaptive cruise control, forward collision  alert, automatic emergency braking, and lane departure warning and  intervention. This package is only available for the Essence and requires the  Driver Confidence I package. </p>, <p>We expect the Regal GS' main upgrades to  include a 310-hp V6 engine, a sport-tuned suspension, larger wheels, Brembo  brakes and sport seats.</p>]

[<p>Buick hasn't sold a wagon in quite some  time (remember the Roadmaster?), but now it's back with the 2018 Buick Regal  TourX. The twist is that Buick has cribbed a few crossover SUV themes,  including standard all-wheel drive, plastic body cladding and a bit of extra  ground clearance, to create the new TourX. </p>, <p>Like the redesigned Regal Sportback upon  which it's based, the TourX is bigger, more stylish and a more compelling entry  in the luxury segment than previous Regals. It also offers a lot more passenger  space and, naturally, utility. Buick says that the TourX has more cargo space  than its wagon rivals and even many compact luxury SUVs. Compared to those  SUVs, you'll also like its lower price and its lower roof and load height. </p>, <p>Though we've yet to drive the TourX, we  expect this new Buick will be a solid alternative to a premium wagon or  crossover SUV. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Buick Regal TourX is a  five-passenger wagon with standard all-wheel drive and a slightly raised ride  height. There are three trim levels — <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Preferred</strong> and <strong>Essence</strong> — each of which comes  standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (250 horsepower,  295 pound-feet of torque) and an eight-speed automatic transmission. </p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the <strong>TourX base</strong> includes 18-inch wheels, LED  running lights, heated mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, a height-adjustable  driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a rearview camera, OnStar  communications (with a 4G connection and onboard Wi-Fi), a 7-inch touchscreen  interface, a USB port, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a Bose audio system. </p>, <p>The <strong>Preferred </strong>adds an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a power-adjustable driver seat and a  leather-wrapped steering wheel. It also opens the door to a variety of options.  The Preferred Driver Confidence 1 package includes LED headlights, rear parking  sensors, and blind-spot and rear cross-traffic warning systems. The Sights and  Sounds package adds remote start and upgrades to gauges, the audio system and  the infotainment system, which includes an 8-inch touchscreen, a navigation  system, Bluetooth, two rear charge-only USB ports and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>Essence </strong>trim adds a hands-free liftgate, dual-zone automatic climate control,  heated front seats, a power-adjustable passenger seat, leather upholstery, a  40/20/40-split folding rear seat, a heated steering wheel, and most of the  content of the Preferred Sights and Sound package. The upgraded audio system  can be added through the Essence's own Sights and Sound package. </p>, <p>The Essence Driver Confidence 1 package  includes all of those items from the Preferred version plus a driver-side  auto-dimming mirror, driver-seat memory functions and a wireless smartphone  charging pad. The Driver Confidence 2 package adds all of that plus adaptive cruise  control, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency  braking, and lane departure warning and intervention. </p>, <p>A panoramic sunroof is a stand-alone  option on the Preferred and the Essence.</p>]

[<p>With its eye-catching angular sheet  metal, the 2018 Cadillac ATS sedan stands out among today's crop of small  luxury sedans. These are qualities to be appreciated if you think that most other car makers utilize  conservative styling and design to the point of drabness. A light curb weight, a choice of  turbocharged four-cylinder and V6 engines, precision handling and even an  optional manual transmission give the ATS legitimate performance chops. </p>, <p>The ATS sedan is respectably comfortable  as well. But there are downsides. The ATS sacrifices some function with its  tidy cabin dimensions, cramped back seat and small trunk. The four-cylinder  sounds raspy and coarse at high rpm. We've also found the touchscreen tech  interface (called CUE for Cadillac User Experience) slow and awkward compared to the competition, although a  new-generation system in this 2018 model may remedy that. </p>, <p>Success in this crowded, competitive  segment is a tall order. The ATS isn't necessarily faster or more efficient than  its rivals, which include the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.  But it is competitive, and that's enough to warrant consideration for your next  luxury sport coupe. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Cadillac ATS sedan is offered in four trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Luxury</strong>, <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> and <strong>Premium Performance</strong>.</p>]

[<p>The  base and Luxury trims come with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine (272  horsepower, 295 pound-feet of torque) paired to an eight-speed automatic or a  six-speed manual transmission and rear-wheel drive.

The Premium Luxury and  Premium Performance trims come with a 3.6-liter V6 engine (335 hp, 285 lb-ft)  paired to an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is  optional on Premium Luxury.

Tech features include the revamped CUE interface with an 8-inch touchscreen  display, OnStar services (with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot), Bluetooth, Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, wireless device charging,  three USB ports, and a 10-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system with  satellite radio.</p>, <p>The<strong> Luxury </strong>trim adds adaptive xenon  headlights, front and rear parking sensors, leather upholstery, additional  front-seat power adjustments, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a  navigation system and driver-position memory settings. The optional Safety and  Security package adds driver assistance features such as forward collision  alert, lane departure warning and intervention, blind-spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert, automatic high beams and automatic wipers. </p>, <p>Picking  the <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> gets you the  Safety and Security package as standard plus a sunroof.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium Performance</strong> trim includes all  the previously mentioned features, plus high-performance tires, a sport-tuned  suspension, adaptive suspension dampers, a limited-slip rear differential, a  head-up display and a power-adjustable steering column. </p>, <p>Many  standard features on the upper trims are optional on lower trims. The Driver  Assist package, available on the Premium Luxury and Premium Performance trims,  adds the head-up display, adaptive cruise control and advanced safety  technologies, including forward and rearward collision mitigation and automatic  emergency braking. </p>, <p>The  Track package, available only on the Premium Performance trim, adds a  heavy-duty engine cooling fan and upgraded brake pads.

[<p>America's answer to the dominance of  European sport sedans, the 2018 Cadillac ATS-V offers an outstanding mix of  performance, comfort and style. It's a welcome alternative to the  high-performance coupes and sedans from Audi, BMW  and Mercedes-Benz. You'll need to make peace with the ATS-V's few  foibles, but the thrills outweigh the flaws, especially for the price. </p>, <p>Blessed with the inherently good bones of  Cadillac's sharp-handling base ATS, the high-performance ATS-V —  available as both coupe and sedan — ratchets up the car's capability  several notches with a twin-turbocharged V6 engine, beefy brakes, and a trick  suspension that constantly adapts in microseconds to changing road surfaces  (Cadillac calls it Magnetic Ride Control). This suspension gives the ATS-V  exceptional control at the racetrack, but also impressive comfort on normal  roads and highways. It's easily the sharpest and most agile car in its class. </p>, <p>The 464-horsepower V6 engine generates  absurd power for a car of this size, and it comes paired with a six-speed  manual or an eight-speed automatic transmission. Power flows to the rear wheels  only, another characteristic that will speak to the enthusiast driver's heart.  In our testing, the ATS-V sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, yet it  still achieves EPA-estimated fuel economy of 20 mpg combined. </p>, <p>Capable and fast, the ATS-V sacrifices  some function with its tidy cabin dimensions, cramped back seat and small  trunk. We've also found its touchscreen tech interface (called CUE) slow and  awkward compared to the competition, although a new-generation system in this  2018 model may remedy that. </p>, <p>Of course, the competition is stiff, but  we're happy to see the ATS-V hold its own against its BMW M3 and M4 and  Mercedes-AMG C 63 rivals. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Cadillac ATS-V is a high-performance luxury compact car offered as either  a four-door sedan that seats five passengers or two-door coupe that  accommodates four passengers. Both come in a single, well-equipped trim level.  A handful of options can tailor the ATS-V to your preference, such as the <strong>Luxury </strong>package for audiophiles, the <strong>Safety and Security</strong> package for its  driver assistance features, or the <strong>Track</strong> package for race enthusiasts. </p>]

[<p>Power  comes from a 3.6-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine (464 horsepower, 445  pound-feet of torque) paired to a choice of a six-speed manual transmission or  an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. The ATS-V is only  available with rear-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Key  standard features include a carbon-fiber hood, 18-inch alloy wheels, Brembo  high-performance brakes, an adaptive sport suspension, an electronically  controlled limited-slip differential, front and rear parking sensors, a  rearview camera, keyless entry and ignition, leather upholstery and heated  front seats. Coupe models come standard with split-folding rear seatbacks; the  sedan features a non-folding seatback fixed in place. </p>, <p>Tech  features the revamped CUE interface with an 8-inch touchscreen display, OnStar  services with 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot (requires data plan), a Bose audio system,  satellite radio, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto smartphone integration, Pandora internet radio, wireless device charging,  three USB ports, an SD card slot, and an auxiliary audio input.</p>, <p>Cadillac's  Teen Driver features are also standard. They allow owners to limit certain  functions when younger drivers are behind the wheel, such as muting audio until  front-seat occupants fasten seat belts or preventing drivers from disabling  safety systems such as traction control. Teen Driver can also capture data,  including distance driven, maximum speed, overspeed warnings, and hard braking  events, and generate a "report card" for owners to review with  younger drivers. </p>, <p>The  ATS-V offers a handful of stand-alone options and packages. The Luxury package  adds xenon headlights, an upgraded Bose surround-sound audio system, a  navigation system, a 110-volt, household-style power outlet and, for the sedan,  split-folding rear seats. Opting for the Luxury package also gives you the  choice of a sunroof. </p>, <p>The  Safety and Security package is only available in conjunction with the Luxury  package. It includes anti-theft features, automatic high beams and wipers, a  head-up display, a lane departure warning and intervention system, blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision alert and, for the  sedan, rear side airbags. </p>, <p>The  Carbon Fiber package adds carbon-fiber exterior trim, black sill extensions and  a body-color rear spoiler. </p>, <p>For  drivers who pursue motorsports, the Track Performance package includes a  race-oriented video and data recorder as well as the features from the Carbon  Fiber package. This package first requires that you order the CUE system with  navigation and makes certain features ineligible, among them a sunroof or the  bundles in the Luxury and Safety and Security packages. </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include a sunroof (requires the Luxury package), red or gold brake  calipers, Recaro sport seats, the performance video and data recorder, and  microfiber steering wheel and shift knob trim. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac CT6 can best be described as a  full-size luxury sedan, but it's priced like a midsize. If you like the idea of a spacious  and upscale luxury sedan with a little Detroit attitude, this Cadillac fits the  bill.</p>, <p>Under the  hood, the CT6's segment-straddling identity is apparent. Turbocharged  four-cylinder power is standard, and it's the same engine that's featured in  the Cadillac's midsize CTS. You won't find that combination in any of its  German competitors. </p>, <p>But  there's no doubt that the CT6 reaches new heights of luxury relative to its  midsize brethren. Throw in generous rear passenger accommodations, top-shelf  interior trimmings and a competitive starting price, and the CT6 becomes a  legitimate challenger to the traditional leaders.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Cadillac CT6 is a large luxury sedan available in four main trim levels. The <strong>base CT6</strong> is well equipped, while the <strong>Luxury </strong>trim adds high-end safety and  convenience features. Next, the <strong>Premium  Luxury </strong>adds even more technology, followed by the <strong>Platinum</strong>,<strong> </strong>which makes  all options standard.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>base CT6</strong> comes standard with a  2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo engine (265 hp, 295 lb-ft) and includes 18-inch  wheels (19s with the V6), front and rear parking sensors, LED headlights and  taillights, heated mirrors, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, leather upholstery, eight-way power front seats (with two-way  power lumbar), driver-seat memory settings and dual-zone automatic climate  control. Also standard on the technology front are GM's OnStar system (with 4G  LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi hotspot capability), Bluetooth, a 10.2-inch  touchscreen with Cadillac's CUE interface, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  smartphone integration, a rearview camera, voice controls, four USB charge  ports, wireless charging and an eight-speaker Bose sound system with satellite  radio and three audio USB ports.</p>, <p>An  optional Driver Awareness and Convenience package adds a panoramic sunroof,  automatic high-beam headlights, automatic wipers, power-folding mirrors, heated  front seats, a navigation system and an array of extra safety features (see  Safety section for details). There's also an optional V6 engine rated at 335 hp  and 284 lb-ft. </p>, <p>The <strong>Luxury</strong> trim starts with all of the  above equipment and adds another engine choice, a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 (404  hp, 400 lb-ft), automatic parking system, auto brake hold (prevents  forward/rearward creep when your foot is off the brake), a hands-free trunklid,  four-way power lumbar for the front seats, front passenger-seat memory  settings, a top-down 360-degree parking camera system, rear side window shades,  upgraded interior lighting and a 10-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system.</p>, <p>The  optional Comfort package adds ventilated front seats and heated rear seats.  There is also an Enhanced Vision and Comfort package with those upgraded seats  plus a unique rearview mirror that displays streaming video from a special  rearview camera.</p>, <p>Moving up  to the <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> gets you an  upgraded gauge cluster display, a head-up display, and the Enhanced Vision and  Comfort package as standard.</p>, <p>For both  the Luxury and Premium Luxury trim levels, an available Rear Seat package  bolsters the CT6 Luxury's feature list with a rear entertainment system and  four-zone automatic climate control. An available Active Chassis package (not  available with the 2.0-liter engine) bundles adaptive suspension dampers,  active rear steering and 20-inch wheels. A 34-speaker (yes, 34) Bose Panaray  premium audio system is also optional. For the Premium Luxury trim only, an  optional Driver Assist package adds adaptive cruise control, a night vision  camera system and enhanced safety-related automatic braking.</p>, <p>At the top  of the totem pole is the <strong>Platinum</strong>,  which adds all of the above as standard equipment plus 12-way power-adjustable  front seats with massage functions, premium leather upholstery, and eight-way  power-adjustable outboard rear seats with ventilation.</p>, <p>The <strong>Plug-In </strong>variant takes many of the  options available in the Premium Luxury and Luxury configuration and makes them  standard, along with a new 2.0-liter turbocharged hybrid powertrain (335 hp,  432 lb-ft). The Driver Awareness and Convenience and the Enhanced Vision and  Comfort packages are all standard. The Hybrid comes with 18-inch wheels and is  only available in rear-wheel drive. Due to the large battery pack, you do lose  significant trunk volume.</p>]

[<p>The  ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2016 Cadillac CT6 Platinum </strong>(twin-turbo 3.0L V6 | 8-speed automatic  | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 2018 Cadillac CT6 has received some  revisions, including a new nine-speed automatic transmission for 2017 and the  deletion of the Premier trim level.

[<p>The  midsize luxury sedan segment is packed with great choices. To succeed, the 2018  Cadillac CTS can't just copy the more popular German or Japanese models.  Instead, Cadillac has focused on giving buyers unmistakable design, sporty  driving characteristics and modern in-car technology. </p>, <p>With  suspension tuning done on fabled race circuits and highways around the world,  the CTS definitely has the handling chops you might expect from a luxury sport  sedan. The CTS could even claim to be the most engaging car in its class for  driving along a curvy road. Particularly with the CTS V-Sport, you'll find that  it turns in crisply and has loads of confidence-inspiring grip.</p>, <p>Under  the hood is one of three engines. The turbocharged four-cylinder and non-turbo  V6 are underwhelming for this class; they come up a little short in either  refinement (the four-cylinder) or power (the V6). But with the CTS V-Sport,  you'll feel the impressive pull from a 420-horsepower turbocharged V6. </p>, <p>The  interior is much like the CTS exterior: crisply styled and well equipped.  Standard technology includes Bose audio, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay  smartphone integration, LED ambient lighting and remote start. The CTS' biggest  downside, though, comes from that very same interior. Some may find the  excessive use of reflective materials distracting, and the disconnected feel of  the touch-actuated, buttonless infotainment system is generally displeasing to  use. </p>, <p>Overall,  the CTS holds its own in this class and should be a solid pick, especially if  you're looking for a luxury sedan with a high sporting quotient. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Cadillac CTS as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedan/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Cadillac CTS luxury sport sedan is in five trims: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Luxury</strong>, <strong>Premium Luxury</strong>,<strong> V-Sport</strong> and<strong> V-Sport Premium  Luxury. </strong></p>]

[<p>The <strong>base</strong> trim comes with a turbocharged  four-cylinder engine (268 hp, 295 pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed  automatic transmission, 17-inch wheels, Brembo front brakes, rear parking  sensors, a rearview camera, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic  climate control, power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat memory settings,  simulated leather upholstery and fixed rear seats with a trunk pass-through. </p>, <p>Technology  features include OnStar telematics (with 4G data connectivity and Wi-Fi  capability), wireless smartphone charging, Bluetooth, the Cadillac User  Experience (CUE) infotainment system (without navigation), an 8-inch  touchscreen interface, voice controls, three USB inputs, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto, and an 11-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system with satellite  radio.</p>, <p>For  this base CTS, buyers can add a Seating package that includes leather  upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, split-folding rear seatbacks, a  power-adjustable and heated steering wheel, and LED interior ambient lighting.</p>, <p><strong>Luxury </strong>offers the option of a 3.6-liter V6  (335 hp, 285 lb-ft) plus adaptive xenon headlights with auto high beams, a  panoramic sunroof, a navigation system, a 13-speaker Bose sound system and a  variety of driver safety aids (automatic wipers, lane departure warning and  intervention, forward collision alert, blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert). The optional seating package from the base CTS is  included in the Luxury.</p>, <p>An optional V-Sport package (not to be confused with the V-Sport trim level)  bundles 18-inch wheels, high-performance brakes and tires, and a sport-tuned  suspension with adaptive dampers.</p>, <p><strong>Premium Luxury </strong>fits the CTS with the  adaptive suspension dampers, 18-inch wheels, a self-parking system (both  parallel and perpendicular), three-zone automatic climate control, heated rear  seats, a rear camera mirror, a head-up display, a top-down parking camera  system, a power rear sunshade (rear side-window shades are manual), and  illuminated door handles and front doorsill plates. </p>, <p>There's an optional Driver Assist package for the Premium Luxury trim that adds  adaptive cruise control and a collision mitigation system with automatic  braking. Other options include 20-way-adjustable front sport seats and a  configurable digital gauge cluster.</p>, <p>The CTS <strong>V-Sport</strong> comes with a  turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine (420 hp, 430 lb-ft) and starts with the Luxury  trim level's standard features (minus the sunroof) and adds the self-parking  system, 18-inch wheels with summer tires, upgraded brakes, a sport-tuned  suspension and steering system, a driver-selectable Track mode for  high-performance driving, an electronic limited-slip rear differential and an  upgraded cooling system. All-wheel drive is not available.</p>, <p>At the top of the range is the CTS <strong>V-Sport  Luxury</strong> that adds just about all of the standard and optional features of  the Premium Luxury trim, including the sunroof.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Cadillac CTS V-Sport Premium  Sedan </strong>(turbo 3.6L V6 | 8-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current CTS V-Sport has received minor  revisions and renaming of trim levels.

[<p>Once upon a time, Cadillacs drew  inspiration from the Space Age, with grand tailfins and taillights inspired by  rockets and a fanciful future that never came. Well, the real future is here,  and the 2018 Cadillac CTS-V definitely doesn't look like a rocket. It does,  however, move like one, boasting a mighty supercharged V8 that slams 640  horsepower to the rear wheels. It's even faster than even <em>that </em>sounds.</p>, <p>However, the CTS-V is not some ham-fisted  muscle car. No, the CTS-V has a truly state-of-the-art chassis and suspension  that allow it to take corners better and impart more communication to the  driver than other high-performance luxury sedans. Oh, and it does so while  costing considerably less.</p>, <p>That suspension also allows it to have an  impressively comfortable ride for a performance car, though if you're looking  for a comfy Cadillac couch, this definitely isn't it. Another thing to keep in  mind is that although the CTS-V undercuts its German competitors on price, its  cabin just isn't up to the level of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes. Cadillac has come  a long way, but you do get what you pay for in this regard. </p>, <p>Overall, we're quite fond of the CTS-V.  If you're looking for one of the most thrilling high-powered sedans on the  market, this Caddy has to be on your shopping list. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS-V is a  high-performance version of the regular CTS sedan, which is reviewed separately.  The V version packs a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that produces 640 horsepower  and 630 pound-feet of torque. You can only get it with an eight-speed automatic  transmission and rear-wheel drive. Only one trim level is available. </p>]

[<p>Standard equipment includes 19-inch  wheels, summer performance tires, Brembo performance brakes, an electronic  limited-slip differential, a magnetically controlled adaptive suspension, an  automatic parking system, xenon headlights with auto high beams, automatic  wipers, a driver auto-dimming mirror, remote ignition, keyless ignition and  entry, forward collision warning, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic warning  systems, lane departure warning and intervention, and rearview and curb-view  parking cameras. </p>, <p>Comfort and entertainment features  include dual-zone automatic climate control, eight-way power-adjustable front  seats (with heating, manual thigh extenders and power-adjustable bolsters),  driver-seat memory settings, leather and simulated suede upholstery, a heated  power-adjustable steering wheel, a simulated suede headliner, a 12.3-inch  all-digital gauge display, a head-up display, an 8-inch touchscreen interface,  OnStar communications (with 4G LTE and a Wi-Fi hotspot), wireless smartphone  charging, Bluetooth, three USB ports, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a navigation  system, and a 13-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system with satellite and HD  radio.</p>, <p>The Luxury package adds tri-zone climate  control, a split-folding back seat, heated rear seats, a power rear sunshade,  manual rear side sunshades, a 110-volt power outlet and Cadillac's rearview  camera mirror. A panoramic sunroof can be added to the Luxury package. The  Carbon Fiber package adds a carbon-fiber hood vent, spoiler, front splitter and  rear diffuser.</p>, <p>Also available are 20-way power front  seats, which can be upgraded with ventilation or replaced by Recaro performance  seats.</p>]

[<p>The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Cadillac CTS-V </strong>(supercharged 6.2L V8 | 8-speed automatic |  RWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current CTS-V has received a few minor  updates, including a revised infotainment system.

[<p>Cadillac bases its 2018 Escalade on General Motors' full-size SUV platform that  underpins the Tahoe and Yukon twins. The main difference is that everything on  the Escalade is "more." There's more power, more brash styling, more  standard features, even more features that are optional. All of this gives the  Escalade true luxury SUV cred.</p>, <p>The inherent attributes of its  traditional SUV design are all here, too. On the plus side, the Escalade can  tow up to 8,300 pounds, which is more than most other luxury crossover SUVs.  But its solid rear-axle suspension and body-on-frame construction also result  in a less than ideal ride quality and a compromised cargo area. Overall, we  think the 2018 Escalade is worth a look, but make sure to also check out this  year's more refined Lincoln Navigator. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac Escalade is a full-size, body-on-frame luxury SUV available  in four trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Luxury</strong>, <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>.  The base trim comes with a dizzying array of equipment, but the Premium Luxury  and Platinum take this big, plush American machine to yet another level. All  Escalade models are equipped with a 6.2-liter V8 engine (420 horsepower, 460  pound-feet of torque) and a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive  is standard, and four-wheel drive is optional.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>base </strong>trim is generously appointed inside and out. Standard equipment includes  20-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension, LED headlights, automatic wipers, front  and rear parking sensors, automatic parallel and perpendicular parking assist,  a hands-free power liftgate, remote start, three-zone automatic climate  control, a heated and power-adjustable steering wheel, power-adjustable pedals,  leather upholstery, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats,  driver-seat memory settings, heated rear seats and split power-folding  third-row seats. </p>, <p>Standard electronic features include the  CUE infotainment interface (with an 8-inch touchscreen), OnStar (with 4G  in-vehicle Wi-Fi), a surround-view parking camera system, a customizable gauge  cluster display, a navigation system, five USB ports, a wireless device  charging pad and a Bose 16-speaker audio system with satellite radio.</p>, <p>For a few more driver aids and a bit more plush equipment, you can step up to  the <strong>Luxury </strong>trim. This adds 22-inch  wheels, a sunroof, power-folding second-row seats, a head-up display, a  camera-based rearview mirror system (the rearview mirror is actually a screen  displaying what the camera sees behind the vehicle) and the Driver Awareness  package (automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning  and intervention, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and  mitigation with automatic braking).</p>, <p>Our recommended trim, the <strong>Premium Luxury</strong>,  adds adaptive cruise control, a rear entertainment system with a Blu-ray player  and an overhead-mounted display, and a more advanced collision mitigation  system with both forward and reverse automatic braking.</p>, <p>The most expensive (and most lavishly appointed) Escalade is the <strong>Platinum </strong>trim level. It certainly has  all the bells and whistles, but you may not need all the extras it provides.  The Platinum adds power-retracting side steps, upgraded power front seats (with  massaging function), upgraded leather upholstery, a cooled front-seat center  console and two more rear entertainment screens (mounted in the front  headrests).</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Cadillac Escalade Premium</strong> (6.2L V8 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Escalade has received some  revisions, including additional driver assistance and infotainment features and  a new 10-speed automatic transmission for 2018. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Escalade, however.</p>]

[<p>With  undeniable road presence and luxury cachet, the 2018 Cadillac Escalade ESV  offers an admirable skill set. Its chiseled design is bold and distinctive, and  it adds brawn to its beauty with a powerful V8 engine, traditional  body-on-frame construction, and an ability to tow up to 8,100 pounds. Being the  long-wheelbase version with enhanced passenger and cargo room, the ESV can  accommodate eight passengers with exceptional room and comfort. </p>, <p>Those  truck-based underpinnings come back to haunt the Escalade, however: It rides  rougher than most other luxury SUVs (not helped any by massive 20- and 22-inch  wheels). Other rivals are also easier to live with every day and achieve better  fuel economy, even if they lack the Escalade's power and capabilities. But if you  need to ferry several passengers in grand style, and maybe even pull an  Airstream trailer while doing it, the Escalade ESV is among the best. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a  full-size luxury SUV available in four trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Luxury</strong>, <strong>Premium Luxury </strong>and <strong>Platinum</strong>. The base trim comes with a dizzying array of equipment,  but the Premium Luxury and Platinum take this big, plush American machine to a  whole different level.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>base </strong>trim is generously appointed both inside and out. Standard  features include a 6.2-liter V8 engine (420 horsepower, 460 pound-feet), a  10-speed automatic transmission, rear-wheel drive (four-wheel drive is optional  on every trim), 20-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension, LED headlights, front  and rear parking sensors, an automatic parking system, a hands-free power  liftgate and remote start. </p>, <p>Inside the cabin, you'll find  tri-zone automatic climate control, a heated and power-adjustable steering  wheel, power-adjustable pedals, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated  power-adjustable front seats, heated rear seats, and power-folding split  third-row seats. </p>, <p>Standard electronic features include  the CUE infotainment interface with an 8-inch touchscreen, OnStar with 4G  in-vehicle Wi-Fi, a surround-view camera system, a customizable gauge cluster,  a navigation system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a Bose 16-speaker  audio system with satellite radio, five USB ports and a wireless device  charger.</p>, <p>For additional driver aids and more  plush equipment, the <strong>Luxury</strong> trim  adds 22-inch wheels, a sunroof, automatic high beams, power-folding second-row  seats, a head-up display, a camera-based rearview mirror system in which the  rearview mirror is a screen displaying what the camera sees behind the vehicle.  It also includes a blind-spot monitoring system, lane departure warning and  intervention, rear cross-traffic alert, and forward collision warning and  mitigation with automatic braking.</p>, <p>Our recommended trim, the <strong>Premium Luxury</strong>, hits the sweet spot  with the above features plus adaptive cruise control, a rear entertainment  system with a Blu-ray player and two overhead-mounted displays, adaptive cruise  control, and a more advanced collision mitigation system with both forward and  reverse automatic braking.</p>, <p>The most lavish Escalade ESV is the <strong>Platinum</strong> trim, which adds  power-retracting side steps, upgraded power front seats with massaging  function, upgraded leather upholstery, a cooled front-seat center console, and  two more rear entertainment screens (mounted in the front headrests) with the  ability to display individual video sources, for times when your passengers  can't agree on what to watch.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Cadillac Escalade Premium </strong>(6.2L V8 | 8-speed automatic | 4WD). </p>, <p>Note: The ESV has a longer wheelbase  and more room for passengers and cargo than the regular Escalade. Additionally,  there have been some changes since this test was conducted, including this  year's new 10-speed transmission. Our findings, however, remain broadly  applicable to this year's Cadillac Escalade ESV.</p>]

[<p>With  a smooth driving character and poise to match its chiseled looks, the 2018  Cadillac XT5 builds on the success of the brand's previous small crossover SUV,  the SRX. The XT5, now in its second year of production, is an all-new,  ground-up overhaul. </p>, <p>The  XT5 is longer than its predecessor and yields more rear-seat legroom, but it's  also lighter and more fuel-efficient. On the road, the XT5 feels confident and  reassuring whether pointed straight ahead over long highway miles or turning  quickly on winding roads. All-wheel drive is optional, but it's meant more for  inclement-weather driving than any kind of off-road adventuring. An available  towing package enables the XT5 to pull up to 3,500 pounds behind it.</p>, <p>Although  the XT5 cuts a handsome figure, we've found in our testing that it doesn't  excel in any particular area. The V6 engine, which is the only engine Cadillac  offers, won't wow you with its performance or fuel economy, while some interior  design choices impede ease of use and visibility.</p>, <p>The  XT5 is in the mix with other crossovers you might consider. It offers more  cargo space and a more attractive price than the Lexus RX 350, but less  passenger and cargo room than the Lincoln MKX. The Audi Q5, BMW X3 and  Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class are all a bit smaller but typically offer better fuel  economy and a broader range of engines. Still, with its distinctive styling,  spacious interior and a pleasant ride and drive, the Cadillac XT5 merits a  close look. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Cadillac XT5 is a five-passenger SUV available in four trim levels: <strong>XT5</strong> (base), <strong>Luxury</strong>, <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>. </p>]

[<p>A  3.6-liter V6 engine (310 horsepower, 271 pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed  automatic transmission and front-wheel drive are standard across the lineup.  All-wheel drive is optional on all but the base XT5 trim and comes standard on  the top Platinum trim. </p>, <p>Highlights  of the <strong>XT5</strong> base model's standard  features include 18-inch wheels, LED daytime running lights, rear parking  sensors, simulated leather upholstery, power-adjustable front passenger seats,  a power liftgate with height memory, a 40/20/20-split folding rear seat (with  sliding and reclining functionality), keyless ignition and entry, and remote  engine start. All-wheel-drive models have heated front seats.</p>, <p>Tech  features for the base XT5 include an 8-inch touchscreen, voice controls, Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, OnStar services (includes a 4G  LTE data connection and Wi-Fi hotspot), four USB ports, wireless device  charging, and an eight-speaker Bose sound system with satellite radio.</p>, <p><strong>Luxury</strong> trim upgrades include leather  upholstery, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, driver-seat memory  settings, a panoramic sunroof, front parking sensors, rear cross-traffic alert  and blind-spot monitoring. Available options are ventilated front seats, heated  rear seats and a navigation system bundled with an upgraded, 14-speaker Bose  surround-sound system. Opting for the navigation and Bose bundle also allows  you to replace the standard halogen headlights with LED lamps. </p>, <p>An  optional Driver Awareness package for Luxury trims adds automatic high beams,  lane departure warning and lane keeping assist, pedestrian detection, forward  collision alert and automatic emergency braking. The Advanced Security package  includes an alarm that senses vehicle movement inside and out, a locking  steering column, door lock and latch shields, and locking wheel lugs. </p>, <p>The <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> trim adds 20-inch  wheels, an adaptive suspension that constantly adjusts to road conditions,  ventilated front seats, interior accent lighting, a navigation system, the  upgraded Bose sound system, and the features of the Driver Awareness package.  Options are three-zone automatic climate control and the Driver Assist package,  which bundles adaptive cruise control, an enhanced collision mitigation system  and an automatic parking system. </p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Platinum </strong>includes most of the  previously mentioned standard and optional features, but adds all-wheel drive,  unique 20-inch wheels, upgraded leather upholstery, a hands-free power  liftgate, a rear camera mirror (projects a real-time image from a  liftgate-mounted camera), a top-view camera system and a head-up display. While  the Advanced Security package is standard, the Driver Assist package remains  optional. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac XTS delivers on the  brand's traditional strengths: a smooth ride quality, a quiet cabin, a big back  seat and classy styling. It should be appealing if you value these qualities  and don't need a bunch of performance capability in your luxury sedan.</p>, <p>That's not to say the XTS doesn't have  any hustle. Although we've found the standard V6 struggles to launch the big  sedan with any urgency, the 304-horsepower engine does fine once up to speed.  We'd love to steer everyone into the top V-Sport trim and the 410-horsepower  turbo V6 engine that comes with it, but that fully loaded model might be  overkill for most drivers. Fast but perhaps not practical. </p>, <p>That's why it's hard to go wrong with any  of the XTS trims, whether you just want a standard set of luxury and tech  features or more modern conveniences and all-wheel drive. For 2018, the XTS  gets a more refined cabin environment, with increased sound deadening and  upgraded seats and a few exterior freshening tweaks. Whichever XTS you choose,  you'll get a sharp luxury sedan with loads of room, especially in back, and a  comfortable, quiet ride.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac XTS is a five-passenger  large sedan available in four trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Luxury</strong>, <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>.  The turbocharged V-Sport variant is only offered in <strong>Platinum</strong> trim. The <strong>base</strong> trim (called simply XTS) comes nicely equipped with a fair amount of luxury and  tech, while the <strong>Luxury</strong> amps things  up with features like heated front and rear seats and a navigation system. The <strong>Premium Luxury </strong>adds more desirable tech  features, and the <strong>Platinum </strong>loads up  with the best of the Cadillac catalog. The <strong>V-Sport  Platinum</strong> also comes fully loaded but adds a 410-hp V6 engine. </p>]

[<p>The XTS comes equipped with a 3.6-liter  V6 engine (304 horsepower, 264 pound-feet of torque) paired with a six-speed  automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is available on  all but the base trim. </p>, <p>Standard features on the <strong>base </strong>model include 19-inch wheels, LED  headlights, heated side mirrors, rear parking sensors, keyless ignition and  entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats,  leather upholstery, and 60/40-split folding rear seats with a cargo  pass-through. </p>, <p>Tech features include a rearview camera,  Bluetooth, OnStar (includes a 4G LTE data connection and Wi-Fi hotspot), an  8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and  an eight-speaker Bose audio system with satellite radio. </p>, <p>The <strong>Luxury</strong> trim adds automatic wipers, ambient interior lighting, extended wood trim, a  heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a  navigation system, front and rear parking sensors, and an automatic parking  system (front-wheel-drive models only).</p>, <p>An optional Driver Awareness package for the Luxury trim adds  lane departure warning, lane keeping assist (FWD only), blind-spot monitoring,  rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision alert, a vibrating safety-alert  driver seat and a surround-view camera system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium Luxury</strong> comes standard with  the Driver Awareness package and adds 20-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension,  adjustable front-seat thigh support, adaptive headlights, a head-up display, an  upgraded driver-configurable gauge cluster display, a 110-volt power outlet, front-seat  memory settings, a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system, and tri-zone  automatic climate control.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>Platinum</strong> adds an  electronic limited-slip differential, a panoramic sunroof, a simulated-suede  headliner, upgraded leather upholstery, extended leather trim (center console,  dash panel), 22-way power-adjustable massaging front seats, and a deluxe rear  armrest with audio and sunshade controls. Advanced driver aids include adaptive  cruise control and forward collision mitigation with automatic emergency  braking </p>, <p>The <strong>V-Sport Platinum </strong>is, no surprise,  equipped almost identically to the regular Platinum trim, with the exception of  a turbocharged 3.6-liter V6 engine underhood (410 hp, 369 lb-ft). All-wheel  drive comes standard with the V-Sport, as does a six-speed automatic  transmission. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2014 Cadillac XTS V-Sport Premium </strong>(turbo  3.6L V6 | 6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current XTS has added tech features that  include a Wi-Fi hotspot, wireless smartphone charging and Apple CarPlay/Android  Auto. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's XTS.</p>]

[<p>Just last year, the Chevrolet Bolt hit  the scene and crushed the electric vehicle competition with its huge range,  spacious interior and enjoyable driving characteristics. But this year the  competition is fighting back. The Tesla Model 3 is finally trickling into  customers' driveways, the Nissan Leaf is new with 151 miles of range, and the  BMW i3 is sportier. Plus, Kia's promising us a long-range Niro EV. So now the  question is: Is the 2018 Chevrolet Bolt still worth checking out? Short answer:  Yep.</p>, <p>With more than 200 miles of range, plenty  of space for people and cargo, a surprisingly fun driving experience, and a  friendly price tag, the Bolt is a mainstream electric car that makes ditching  gasoline seem possible. It can certainly fill the needs of most commuters,  though its bargain-bin interior quality still disappoints.</p>, <p>The primary alternative you'll want to  consider is the new Model 3. It boasts all the Tesla mystique and drivability,  along with a futuristic, minimalist interior and access to Tesla's Supercharger  network. However, supply is still short as of our review's publication time,  and it's worth keeping in mind that Chevrolet has a nationwide dealer network  that can quickly and easily provide service should anything go wrong.</p>, <p>The electric car segment is only going to  get more competitive, especially with the promise of new battery technologies  just around the corner. Chevy got a good head start, and the 2018 Bolt remains  a compelling example of what the electric car can be. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/" title="Best Electric Cars">Best Electric Cars</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV is an  all-electric four-door hatchback that is offered in just two trim levels: <strong>LT</strong> and <strong>Premier</strong>. Both  share the same mechanical running gear, including the 200-horsepower electric  motor and the large 60-kWh underfloor battery that is good for about 238 miles  on a full charge. </p>]

[<p>With  the <strong>LT</strong>, you'll get a 7.2-kWh onboard  charger, 17-inch alloy wheels, xenon headlights, LED daytime running lights, a  rearview camera, and keyless ignition and entry. Inside, you'll find  height-adjustable cloth seats, 60/40-split folding rear seats, a configurable  gauge cluster display, automatic climate control, a 10.2-inch touchscreen,  OnStar communications (with a 4G LTE connection and a Wi-Fi hotspot),  Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a  six-speaker sound system with two USB ports.</p>, <p>Options  for the LT include the Comfort and Convenience package, which consists of  heated front seats, an automatic heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Driver Confidence I package brings in  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors. Another  noteworthy LT option is a cargo area floor cover for extra storage capability.</p>, <p>Step  up to the <strong>Premier</strong> and you'll get  everything described above, including the LT options. You'll also get cargo  roof rails, leather seats, ambient interior lighting, heated rear seats, a  center rear armrest, a top-down parking camera system, and an upgraded,  camera-based rearview mirror.</p>, <p>Premier  options include the Infotainment package, which has a seven-speaker Bose audio  system, wireless smartphone charging and two charge-only USB ports for rear  passengers. There's also the Driver Confidence II package, which consists of a  forward collision warning system with pedestrian detection and low-speed  automatic emergency braking, a lane departure warning and intervention system,  and automatic high-beam headlamp dimming. </p>, <p>The  only significant option that's common to both trim levels is DC fast-charging  capability, which allows the car to use SAE Combo 400-volt Level 3 charge  stations that can fill the battery to 80 percent in little more than an hour.  We consider this option to be essential for a car with as much range as the  Bolt because, as more of these stations get built, DC fast charging will open  the door to interstate travel.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Premier Hatchback</strong>.<strong><u></u></strong></p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Bolt has received some revisions,  including only very minor equipment changes. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Bolt.</p>]

[<p>There's  a lot to appreciate about the 2018 Chevrolet Camaro. Sure, the Camaro ZL1 gets  all the (deserved) views on YouTube for its gonzo 650-hp V8, but it's not the  only Camaro you can buy. If you're just interested in stylish motoring, you can  go with the base turbocharged four-cylinder engine or the capable V6. Then  there's the available 6.2-liter V8, which has more than enough performance for  most driving enthusiasts. </p>, <p>We  also like the 2018 Camaro's precise handling, smooth ride on the highway and  plenty of standard equipment for the money. If you haven't been around a Camaro  in a long time, you'll likely be shocked how refined the latest version is. The  Camaro still has its drawbacks, and key rivals are happy to pick up where it  leaves off. The Ford Mustang, for example, is a bit more livable and practical  when driven on a daily basis. And the Dodge Challenger has them both beat when  it comes to retro muscle-car looks and usable backseat space. Overall, we're  impressed by the Camaro's combination of power, precision and head-turning  looks. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Camaro is available as a four-seat coupe and convertible, with <strong>1LS</strong>, <strong>1LT</strong>, <strong>2LT</strong>, <strong>1SS</strong>, <strong>2SS</strong> and<strong> ZL1</strong> trim levels.  The LS and LT models come standard with a turbocharged four-cylinder, and a V6  is also available. The SS has a V8 and the ZL1 has a supercharged V8. The 1s  and 2s represent levels of equipment, but there are several optional packages  and stand-alone items to help you customize your ideal Camaro. </p>]

[<p>The  LS and LT models come standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder  engine (275 hp 295 lb-ft), but they can be equipped with a 3.6-liter V6 (335  hp, 284 lb-ft). The 1LS and 2LT come standard with the six-speed manual  transmission while the 1LT has an eight-speed automatic. Like all Camaros, the  LS and LT models are rear-wheel-drive. </p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the base <strong>1LS</strong> includes  18-inch alloy wheels, LED running lights, a limited-slip differential (with the  manual transmission), a rearview camera, keyless ignition and entry,  power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and adjustable  driving modes.

All of the 2SS and SS 1LE extras,  minus the cosmetic differences, are also included. The <strong>ZL1 1LE Extreme Track Performance package</strong> adds 19-inch forged  aluminum wheels with wider tires, special race-oriented suspension dampers, a  carbon-fiber hood and rear spoiler, and tinted taillights. With the ZL1 1LE  package, a fixed rear seat is also available. </p>, <p>Other  available extras include a sunroof, a performance exhaust (all V6- and  V8-powered models), a navigation system (2LT, 2SS and ZL1 trims), and a Heavy  Duty Cooling and Brake package (1LS, 1LT and 2LT).</p>]

[<p>If  you don't need all the capability that a full-size pickup provides, a truck  like the 2018 Chevrolet Colorado might be right up your alley. Midsize trucks  such as the Colorado are appealing thanks to virtues such as carlike  maneuverability and fuel economy. The Colorado certainly has some of that  appeal, along with plenty of available options and good all-around pickup-truck  competency. </p>, <p>The  Colorado has several tough competitors, though, namely the Toyota Tacoma and  the Honda Ridgeline. The Tacoma has strong resale value and excellent off-road  capabilities, while the Honda Ridgeline has excellent on-road performance and  interior refinement. The Colorado offers long-distance comfort, a simple cabin  layout and a range of desirable engines. Picking a winner in this segment will  largely come down to what attributes you value most, but the 2018 Colorado is  definitely worth a test drive. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Chevrolet Colorado as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Pickup Trucks">Best Pickup Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Colorado is a midsize pickup offered in extended-cab and  crew-cab body styles. There are two bed lengths and five trim levels: <strong>Base</strong>, <strong>Work Truck</strong> (WT), <strong>LT</strong>, <strong>Z71 </strong>and <strong>ZR2</strong>. For a no-frills truck, the <strong>Base </strong>and <strong>Work Truck </strong>models  have limited features and low prices. The midrange <strong>LT </strong>offers extras such as a larger touchscreen and a standard 4G LTE  Wi-Fi hotspot, while the top-of-the-line <strong>Z71</strong> combines some basic off-road prowess with top equipment. The <strong>ZR2 </strong>model features significant  suspension and body changes that give it improved off-road capability.</p>]

[<p>The  entry-level model, known simply as <strong>Base</strong>,  covers the truck basics without a lot of extras, but it still has a decent  amount of equipment. It's offered only as an extended cab, and standard  features include a 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder engine (200 horsepower and  191 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed manual transmission, 16-inch steel wheels,  air-conditioning, vinyl upholstery and floor covering, a four-way power driver  seat with manual recline, front bucket seats, a tilt-only adjustable steering  wheel, power windows, a rearview camera, and a six-speaker sound system with  Chevrolet's app-based MyLink system, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity,  voice controls, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a 7-inch display. </p>, <p>There  aren't too many changes when you step up to the <strong>Work Truck </strong>(WT)<strong> </strong>model,  but it does come in both extended-cab and crew-cab body styles and adds fold-up  rear jump seats (extended-cab models only), cloth upholstery, carpeting and  floor mats.</p>, <p>The  biggest difference between the Base Colorado and the Work Truck trim is the  latter's list of available options. Essentially you can equip the Work Truck  with a few tech items, optional engines and exterior trim that make it feel  less basic. From the WT level on up, you can get a six-speed automatic  transmission for the base four-cylinder or one of the Colorado's two optional  engines: a 3.6-liter V6 (308 hp and 275 lb-ft) paired to an eight-speed  automatic transmission or a 2.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine  (181 hp and 369 lb-ft) paired to a six-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Notable  options for the WT include remote keyless entry, cruise control, an EZ-Lift  tailgate, and OnStar telematics (roadside assistance, turn-by-turn navigation,  automatic crash response) and 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot connectivity. </p>, <p>If  you don't want to sort through all the WT's options sheets, you can simply spring  for the <strong>LT</strong>, which gets you most of  the above items, plus 17-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an 8-inch touchscreen, satellite radio,  in-car 4G LTE Wi-Fi, and two additional USB ports.</p>, <p>More  options are available for the LT, with the most notable ones being heated front  seats, automatic climate control, heated exterior mirrors, and forward  collision and lane departure warning systems. For LT models and above, there's  an available seven-speaker premium Bose audio system and a navigation system  (an enhancement of the standard 8-inch MyLink interface).</p>, <p>For  more luxury items and some mild off-road ability, you'll want to check out the <strong>Z71</strong>. It comes standard with most of the  LT's optional equipment, plus it adds dark-tinted 17-inch alloy wheels,  all-terrain tires (instead of all-season tires), an off-road-oriented  suspension, a locking rear differential, hill descent control, unique cloth and  simulated leather upholstery, and other model-specific trim pieces. </p>, <p>Even  with the off-road-oriented suspension, the Z71 is still more oriented toward  street use. For more ability off the beaten path, the <strong>ZR2</strong> is your truck. The ZR2 has a raised suspension with special  dampers, bigger all-terrain tires, fender flares, special bodywork for improved  approach and departure angles, a spray-in bedliner (optional on other trims)  and an electronically locking rear differential. Chevy offers the V6 or the  diesel engine for the ZR2.</p>]

[<p>The  Chevrolet Corvette has been a performance icon in the United States for more  than six decades now, and this 2018 version is no different. The base  Stingray's powerful 6.2-liter V8 engine (455 horsepower, 460 pound-feet of  torque) sits up front and drives a set of gigantic Michelin Pilot Super Sport  tires. </p>, <p>If  the regular Corvette Stingray is too tame, the Corvette Grand Sport raises  track credibility up to near maximum levels thanks to made-for-the-track  aerodynamics and mechanical modifications. Then there's the supercharged Z06.  With its 650 hp, it'll lay down lap times that even European exotics costing  four or five times more will have trouble matching. </p>, <p>Naturally,  the Corvette is a sports car, replete with the usual foibles, such as  two-person seating and a low ride height that makes it hard to get in and out.  But you'll likely be surprised to find that the Corvette's track-ready performance doesn't  come paired with a harsh ride. Across its model lineup, the Corvette continues  to be the rare alpha performance car that's comfortable for normal driving,  too.</p>, <p>Taking  just one test drive in a 2018 Corvette may have you forgetting about civility  and embracing what so many sports car aficionados already know: This is  American performance at its best.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Corvette is a two-seat sports car that is available in both  coupe and convertible body types. The coupe features a removable roof panel  that stows in the trunk, while the convertible has a power-operated soft top.  The <strong>Stingray</strong>, <strong>Z51 </strong>and <strong>Grand Sport</strong> are  split into 1LT, 2LT and 3LT subtrims; the <strong>Z06</strong> comes in 1LZ, 2LZ and 3LZ subtrims.</p>]

[<p>Chevy fits the  Stingray, Z51 and Grand Sport with a 6.2-liter V8 (455 hp, 460 lb-ft). A  performance exhaust that increases output to 460 hp is available on the  Stingray and included on the Z51 and Grand Sport models. A seven-speed manual  transmission with automatic rev-matched downshifts is standard, while an  eight-speed automatic is optional. </p>, <p>Standard features for the <strong>Stingray</strong> 1LT include 18-inch front and 19-inch rear wheels with  summer tires, Brembo brakes, xenon headlights, LED running lights, keyless  ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery,  power-adjustable front seats and a power-adjustable steering wheel.</p>, <p>You also get OnStar (with a 4G LTE data connection and Wi-Fi  hotspot capability), Bluetooth, a driver information display, an 8-inch central  touchscreen with Chevy's MyLink infotainment interface, a rearview camera, two  USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a nine-speaker Bose sound system  with satellite radio.</p>, <p>All Stingray 2LT models come with front-view parking  cameras, auto-dimming driver side and rearview mirrors, a head-up display, a  cargo shade (coupe only), upgraded interior trim, heated and ventilated seats  with additional power adjustments, driver-seat memory settings and a 10-speaker  sound system.</p>, <p>The Stingray 3LT models add premium leather upholstery with  extended surface coverage, simulated-suede upper interior trim and a navigation  system that includes the Corvette's unique performance data recorder.</p>, <p>The <strong>Stingray Z51</strong> upgrades the Vette's performance potential with 19-inch front and 20-inch rear  wheels, larger front brakes, slotted brake rotors, sportier suspension tuning,  revised transmission gear ratios for snappier responses (manual only), an  electronic limited-slip differential, a differential cooler, dry-sump oiling  for the V8 engine and a dual-mode performance exhaust.</p>, <p>The <strong>Grand Sport</strong> largely mirrors the Stingray Z51 in terms of feature content, but it adds a  slew of performance features taken from the Z06, including an upgraded cooling  system, wider fenders and tires, adaptive dampers, upgraded suspension  components and bigger brakes. <br>  Sport seats are optional on all Corvettes.</br></p>, <p>The <strong>Z06</strong> 1LZ  starts with the Stingray Z51 1LT's standard equipment and adds a supercharged  V8 (650 hp, 650 lb-ft), a Z06-specific sport-tuned suspension with adaptive  dampers, larger brakes, wider tires, a carbon-fiber hood, a more aggressive  aero package (including wider front and rear fenders, expanded cooling vents,  and a unique front grille and rear fascia) and the head-up display. The Z06 2LZ  gets the 2LT's upgrades, while the Z06 3LZ gets the 3LT's upgrades.</p>, <p>For  the Grand Sport and Z06, Chevy offers a Z07 performance package. It adds  carbon-ceramic brakes, an even more aggressively tuned suspension, bigger and  stickier tires, and extra aerodynamic body pieces. For all Corvettes, various  interior and exterior styling and trim upgrades are also available.</p>]

[<p>The Cruze is a popular sedan for Chevrolet, and the  company is doing its best to keep it competitive against some equally popular  rivals. Just last year, Chevy introduced the Cruze hatchback, which offers more  cargo-carrying versatility than the sedan, and a new diesel-powered engine that  can get more than 50 mpg on the highway. This year, you can combine both  — Chevrolet is offering a Cruze hatchback diesel for the first time.</p>, <p>Continuing on are some of the Cruze's core  strengths, such as an appealing mix of technology and safety features, a  premium-looking cabin, and a ride quality that is both sporty and comfortable.  At the same time, though, there are some great small sedans and hatchbacks out  right now. The Honda Civic, which was redesigned two years ago, is one of the  best small cars on the market. The Hyundai Elantra and Mazda 3 are also  compelling alternatives if you want something with more sport or technology.  Overall, we like the Cruze but suggest you also check out a few of these top  rivals before making a final decision.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Chevrolet Cruze is a compact sedan or hatchback. The sedan is available in <strong>L</strong>,<strong> LS</strong>, <strong>LT</strong> and <strong>Premier </strong>trim levels, while the hatch comes in <strong>LT </strong>and <strong>Premier </strong>only. The  diesel engine is only available as the <strong>LT  Diesel </strong>trim in either body type. Powering most Cruze trims is a  turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine (153 horsepower and 177 pound-feet  of torque). </p>]

[<p>The <strong>L</strong> is only available to dealers through  custom ordering. Standard equipment includes 15-inch steel wheels, automatic  headlights, remote locking and unlocking, air-conditioning, a six-way manually  adjustable driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 60/40-split  folding rear seatbacks, Bluetooth connectivity, a four-speaker audio system  with a USB port, OnStar (with 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi hotspot), a  rearview camera, and a MyLink infotainment system with a 7-inch central  touchscreen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone app integration. A  six-speed manual is the only transmission available.</p>, <p>Much more  common is the <strong>LS</strong>, which is similarly  equipped but adds a front center armrest and carpeted floor mats. It can also  be equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission and a range of  dealer-installed options.</p>, <p>Our  recommended trim, the <strong>LT</strong>, steps up  to 16-inch alloy wheels, upgraded headlights with LED running lights, heated  mirrors, cruise control, steering-wheel-mounted phone and audio controls, a  rear center armrest with cupholders, and a six-speaker audio system with  satellite radio. Hatchback models also get a cargo cover and rear spoiler. A  charge-only USB port is added to models equipped with the automatic  transmission, while manual-equipped models have a front armrest with a sliding  feature.</p>, <p>For the  LT, the optional Convenience package adds keyless ignition and entry, heated  front seats, an eight-way power driver seat and remote engine start (with the  automatic transmission).</p>, <p>The <strong>LT Diesel</strong> is powered by a turbocharged  1.6-liter four-cylinder diesel (137 hp, 240 lb-ft) and adds the contents of the  Convenience package minus remote start. The available Leather package adds a  heated and leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather upholstery and a  height-adjustable front passenger seat.</p>, <p>The Cruze <strong>Premier </strong>gets everything above plus  17-inch wheels, an upgraded rear suspension, chrome exterior accents, ambient  interior lighting and illuminated vanity mirrors.</p>, <p>Both the  LT and Premier offer an RS Appearance package (foglights, a rear spoiler, a  sport body kit and 18-inch wheels for Premier models) and a Sun and Sound  package that includes a sunroof, a color driver information center, ambient  interior lighting, a larger 8-inch center touchscreen display and a  nine-speaker Bose audio system. A navigation system is additionally available  for this package on the Premier.</p>, <p>The LT and  Premier are also eligible for the Driver Confidence package, which consists of  rear parking sensors and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.  The Driver Confidence II package, offered only on the Premier, adds automatic  high-beam headlight control, forward collision warning, and lane departure  warning and intervention.</p>, <p>The Driver  Confidence, Sun and Sound package, offered only on the LT Diesel with the  automatic transmission, combines the contents of the Sun and Sound package with  the Driver Confidence package. The Premier-exclusive Enhanced Convenience  package throws in an auto-dimming rearview mirror, automatic climate control,  heated rear outboard seats, wireless personal device charging and a 110-volt,  household-style power outlet. </p>]
---http://edmunds.com/chevrolet/cruze-limited/2018/review---http://edmunds.com/chevrolet/equinox/2018/review
[<p>In 2016, the Chevrolet Equinox outsold  every other vehicle in GM's lineup except the Silverado pickup. Not a bad year,  but the Equinox still didn't do as well as its competitors from Ford, Honda,  Nissan and Toyota. That's not a complete surprise since the segment favors the  latest and greatest, and the Equinox has stayed more or less the same since  2010. We appreciated the previous model for its copious interior and cargo  room, but it was clear the Equinox was uncompetitive in terms of performance,  comfort and value. That changes with the debut of the redesigned 2018 Chevrolet  Equinox. </p>, <p>The new Equinox is smaller and lighter  than the vehicle it replaces, and it's powered exclusively by turbocharged  four-cylinder engines with standard engine stop-start technology. Chevy says  the most economical of these, an optional 1.6-liter diesel engine, will achieve  an impressive 40 mpg on the highway. Even if you don't go for the diesel  option, the standard engines all deliver improved fuel economy figures compared  to the previous Equinox. </p>, <p>The downsizing has barely impacted the  Equinox's spacious interior. There's plenty of legroom for tall passengers in  all outboard seats — though the panoramic sunroof reduces headroom  for those in the rear — and the back seats fold flat at the pull of a  lever to increase the size of the cargo area to 63.5 cubic feet. You'll  appreciate the extra space because the 29.9 cubic feet behind the rear seats is  smaller than most in this class.</p>, <p>The Equinox features plenty of advanced  safety equipment, from standard items such as a rearview camera and Chevy's Teen Driver reporting feature to a top-down parking camera  system and lane departure warning and intervention. Tech features are also  abundant, with every Equinox boasting a touchscreen display and Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto capability. </p>, <p>The Equinox is not the most exciting  compact crossover to drive, but it is one of the best all-rounders in the  class. If you can look past its small cargo area, you'll be rewarded with a  comfortable ride, roomy cabin and one of the best touchscreen systems in the  business.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-small-suvs/" title="Best Small SUVs">Best Small SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The base <strong>L </strong>model seems like a great deal, until  you realize that it's a custom-order model and you'll have to wait for it to be  built. You'll find the <strong>LS </strong>at  practically any dealer, but it doesn't offer much more than the L for the added  price. Best to skip straight to the <strong>LT</strong>,  which is just a bit more expensive and includes more features and access to  additional options. If you want the LT and its two packages, the  leather-trimmed <strong>Premier</strong> includes it  all. </p>]

[<p>Three  engines are offered on the Equinox. The standard engine is a turbocharged  1.5-liter four-cylinder (170 horsepower, 203 pound-feet of torque) matched to a  six-speed automatic transmission. A more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter engine  (252 hp, 260 lb-ft) is optional and comes standard with a nine-speed automatic  transmission. Also optional is a fuel-efficient 1.6-liter diesel (137 hp, 240  lb-ft) mated to a six-speed automatic. The 1.5-liter engine is the only engine  available now. The optional engines won't be offered until later in the model  year. Until we have a better understanding of the features offered in  conjunction with the selection of the diesel and 2.0-liter engines, the  following trim breakdown applies solely to the 1.5-liter engine.</p>, <p>The  front-drive-only base <strong>L </strong>is well  equipped, and it comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights,  LED daytime running lights, a fuel-saving engine stop-start system, a rearview  camera, heated mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, a driver information  display, height-adjustable front seats, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  Chevrolet's <a href="//www.chevrolet.com/teen-driver-technology">Teen Driver</a> watchdog modes, Bluetooth, OnStar  (with 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi hotspot), a 7-inch touchscreen and a  six-speaker audio system with a USB port, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. </p>, <p>It's a  built-to-order trim, however, so you're most likely going to see the next-level <strong>LS </strong>on dealer lots. It's pricier and  doesn't add much besides rear floor mats, a spare tire, a tire jack and a  digital compass. It does open the door to an expanded range of exterior colors  and availability of all-wheel drive, however, so it's worth considering if you  want the least expensive AWD model. </p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>LT </strong>adds xenon headlights,  rear privacy glass, a leather-wrapped shift knob, an eight-way power driver seat  (with two-way lumbar adjustment), auxiliary rear-seat release levers and  satellite radio. </p>, <p>The LT  offers two notable feature packages. The Sun and Infotainment package adds a  panoramic sunroof, an upgraded driver information display, an 8-inch touchscreen,  a second USB port in the front, two USB ports in the armrest bin and two  charge-only USB ports in back. The Confidence and Convenience package includes  rear parking sensors, a power liftgate, remote engine start, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, rear  cross-traffic alert, and blind-spot monitoring that also detects rapidly  approaching cars in the next lane. </p>, <p>Finally,  the range-topping <strong>Premier </strong>includes  the above packages (minus the panoramic sunroof, which can be added  separately), along with 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights,  foglights, auto-dimming mirrors, roof rails, a hands-free liftgate, chrome  exterior trim, ambient interior lighting, driver-seat memory settings,  perforated leather upholstery and wireless device charging.</p>, <p>Even the  top-trim Premier leaves some goodies on the table. Standard on all-wheel-drive  models and optional for front-wheel-drive models is the feature-heavy  Confidence and Convenience II package. It adds automatic high-beam control, a  top-down, 360-degree parking camera system, a heated steering wheel, an  eight-way power passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated rear outboard  seats, lane departure warning and mitigation, Chevy's <a href="//media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2015/Jan/0116-safety-alert-seat.html">Safety Alert seat</a>, a meter that measures the distance  (in time) between you and the car in front, and forward collision alert with  automatic emergency braking at low speeds. The Sun, Sound and Navigation  package builds on top of this package with 19-inch wheels, the panoramic  sunroof, navigation and a seven-speaker Bose audio system with HD radio.</p>]

[<p>A full-size passenger van is really the only choice if you're looking to  transport a large number of people. The 2018 Chevrolet Express is one option,  with versatile seating arrangements that can carry eight, 12 or 15 passengers.  But unless you like the styling or are comforted by the wide availability of  spare parts, we suggest you look elsewhere. </p>, <p>The age of the Express is the primary  knock against it. Though it has undergone minor interior and exterior refreshes  over the years, today's Express is essentially the same as the one that  launched way back in 1996. All other competitors have been fully redesigned  since then. Rivals also offer high-roof variants to allow for better passenger  entry and exit. Although used-parts availability and an established track record  might be potential draws, overall we can't recommend the Chevrolet Express  Passenger given the many strengths of its competition and lack of competitive  advantage.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Express Passenger  is a full-size van with abundant seating configurations and room for up to 12  people. (Its Express Cargo sibling retains the front two seats and uses the  rest of the interior as an expansive cargo area.) It's available in two load  ratings, 2500 and 3500, and in two trims, base <strong>LS </strong>and <strong>LT</strong>. Additionally,  the 3500 can be ordered with a long wheelbase, which increases the length of  the cargo area by about 20 inches. The additional room allows for another row  of seats if you desire. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>LS </strong>is powered by a 4.3-liter V6 (276 horsepower, 298  pound-feet of torque) paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission.  Standard features include 16-inch steel wheels, a 60/40-split opening passenger  door, 12-passenger seating (2-3-3-4 with a 50/50-split back row), air conditioning,  power windows and locks, a driver information display, vinyl upholstery and  floor covering, GM's OnStar communications, a rearview camera, and a  two-speaker audio system with an AM/FM stereo and an auxiliary port. </p>, <p>A  tilt-only steering wheel and cruise control are standard on 3500 models and  optional for the 2500. Opting for the extended-wheelbase 3500 adds rear air  conditioning, which is available as a separate option for the other LS models.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>LT </strong>adds front and rear  chrome bumpers, remote locking and unlocking, cloth upholstery, carpeted  flooring and rear air conditioning. This trim also adds the tilt-only steering  wheel and cruise control to the 2500. </p>, <p>Many  of the features added by the LT are available on LS models as well. A bundle  containing a 6.5-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth, a CD player, a USB port and a  navigation system is available for any Express Passenger model. A rearview  camera with the display located in the rearview mirror can be ordered on any  vehicle without the touchscreen. Other stand-alone options include  power-adjustable heated mirrors, rear parking sensors, a heavy-duty locking  rear differential, remote vehicle start, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  power-adjustable front seats, satellite radio and a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>, <p>Some  features and packages are available only when the appropriate body type is  selected. The Paratransit package for 3500 extended-wheelbase models removes  the rear seat and reverts to vinyl floor coverings. This body style can also be  ordered in a 15-passenger (2-3-3-3-4 seating) configuration. Standard-wheelbase  2500 and 3500 models can be ordered in an eight-passenger (2-3-3)  configuration. </p>, <p>Two  additional powertrains are available on any body style. For hauling a large  number of people, consider the 6.0-liter V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft) matched to a  six-speed automatic transmission. If fuel efficiency is a priority, check out  the 2.8-liter four-cylinder diesel engine (181 hp, 369 lb-ft) paired to an  eight-speed automatic. </p>]

[<p>Full-size vans are great vehicles for contractors and small-business owners  thanks to their expansive cargo areas and substantial payload and towing  capabilities. The 2018 Chevrolet Express is one of these versatile equipment  haulers, with class-leading towing figures and a reasonable starting price. But  its many drawbacks should lead you to consider one of its rivals instead.</p>, <p>The primary knock against the Express is  its age. The Express launched in 1996 and it has received only sporadic  refreshes and updates since then. The cabin is positively dated against the  rest of the class, and the Express offers none of the latest safety and  technology features of its competitors. </p>, <p>Although offered in standard and extended  wheelbases, the Express has less cargo volume than other vans due to its single  low roof height while others offer multiple roof configurations. And while  towing and payload capabilities are commendable, its inefficient V8s will put a  larger dent in the monthly fuel bill than competitors' V6 engines. Given the  strength of the competition and lack of distinctive advantages, it's difficult  to recommend the Chevrolet Express.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Express Cargo is a full-size van with two seats and an  expansive cargo area. (Its Express Passenger sibling fills this space with  additional rows of seating.) Two load ratings are available: 2500 and 3500.  Each can be ordered in a standard or extended-wheelbase configuration. No  matter which starting configuration you choose, the Express Cargo comes only in  a single, modestly equipped <strong>WT </strong>trim.  Numerous stand-alone options are available.</p>]

[<p>By default, the rear-wheel-drive Express  Cargo is powered by a 4.3-liter V6 (276 horsepower, 298 pound-feet of torque)  paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Alternate powertrains are available  if the standard V6 doesn't meet your requirements, including a 6.0-liter V8  (341 hp, 373 lb-ft) matched to a six-speed automatic and a 2.8-liter  four-cylinder diesel engine (181 hp, 369 lb-ft) with an eight-speed auto. </p>, <p>The <strong>WT</strong>'s  standard features include 16-inch steel wheels, 60/40-split opening doors on  the right side, a driver information display, air conditioning, power windows  and locks, vinyl upholstery and floor covering, LED cargo lighting, six D-ring  cargo tie-downs, a 120-volt outlet, a rearview camera, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, GM's OnStar  communications, and a  two-speaker audio system with AM/FM radio and an auxiliary jack. </p>, <p>Major equipment packages include the  Convenience package, which adds a tilt-adjustable steering wheel and cruise  control, and the Chrome Appearance package, which brings chrome bumpers and  grille. The Hotel Shuttle package adds the Chrome Appearance items plus the  6.0-liter V8, a sliding rear passenger door, heated power mirrors, a second row  of seating, tinted glass and rear cargo windows. Meanwhile, the Safety package  adds the contents of the Convenience package, the V8 engine, power-adjustable  mirrors, rear parking sensors with backup alarm and blind-spot monitoring,  while the Ambulance package uses the V8, a heavy-duty locking differential and  a more powerful battery and alternator. A separate bundle adds a 6.5-inch touchscreen,  navigation, Bluetooth, a CD player and a USB port.</p>, <p>Some of the above features can be added  as stand-alone options. Other options include all-terrain tires, remote locking  and unlocking, remote engine start, rear parking sensors, a backup alarm, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, cloth upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, satellite radio, a spray-in cargo liner, and rear  air conditioning and heating.</p>]

[<p>As  you'd expect from a large domestic sedan, the 2018 Chevrolet Impala has a  smooth ride quality, a spacious interior with plenty of room for rear-seat  passengers, and a trunk that's one of the largest available in any sedan. It's  also quiet at highway speeds and has plenty of power when equipped with the  optional V6 engine. </p>, <p>This  generation of Impala enters its fourth year of production in 2018, but  consistent small updates to its equipment over the years mean it can be  equipped with all the technology you expect from a modern car. With the  addition of a rearview camera, keyless entry and start, and Chevy's quite good  MyLink infotainment system (with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay) to the base LS  trim, the Impala also has all the bases covered: from a cost-conscious cruiser  that doesn't seem stripped down to a feature-packed, near-luxury competitor.</p>, <p>We  do have our reservations. The base engine is lackluster, and thick roof pillars  and a short rear window hamper outward visibility. Those aren't deal-breakers,  but there are other choices if the Impala isn't to your liking. The Toyota  Avalon is surprisingly good to drive, and has the option of a hybrid  powertrain. There's also the value-packed Hyundai Azera and the Chrysler 300,  which can be had with a big V8. Still, the 2108 Chevy Impala offers a lot of  comfort and space, and that's ultimately the most important aspect in this  class of car.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Impala is a four-door, five-passenger sedan that's available in  three trim levels. Thanks to equipment upgrades this year, the base <strong>LS</strong> trim is more than just bare-bones  transportation. Moving up to<strong> LT</strong> trim  gets you upgraded interior materials and access to a number of option packages.  The range-topping <strong>Premier</strong> trim  offers an extensive and upscale list of standard features.</p>]

[<p>Two  engines are available for the Impala. A 2.5-liter four-cylinder (197 hp, 191  lb-ft of torque) is standard on the LS and LT trim levels, while a 3.6-liter  six-cylinder (305 hp, 264 lb-ft of torque) is standard for the Premier and  optional for the LS and LT. Both engines use a six-speed automatic transmission  and are only available with front-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Thanks  to changes made this year, the LS trim starts with a good selection of standard  features. You get 18-inch steel wheels, sound-insulating laminated windows,  automatic headlights, cruise control, power-adjustable mirrors,  air-conditioning, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, and 60/40-split folding rear seats. New  for 2018 are keyless entry and start, a rearview camera and Chevy's MyLink  infotainment system with an 8-inch touchscreen interface, a six-speaker audio system,  OnStar (includes 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot connectivity), Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto compatibility, and two USB ports. </p>, <p>Moving  up to the LT adds 18-inch alloy wheels, remote engine start, heated mirrors, as  well as dual-zone climate control, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift  knob, power front-passenger lumbar adjustment, fore-aft adjustable front  headrests, folding rear headrests, and a few other small interior trim  upgrades.</p>, <p>The  Impala LT also has access to a number of upgrade packages. The Driver  Confidence package adds blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and  rear parking sensors. A sunroof and rear spoiler can be added with the Sunroof  and Spoiler package. The LT Entertainment Package adds navigation, an  11-speaker Bose stereo system, a CD player, ambient interior lighting and a  120-volt outlet.</p>, <p>There's  also the LT Convenience package, which includes heated front seats and a heated  steering wheel and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Convenience package can  be upgraded with the LT Leather Package, which adds leather upholstery and a  full power-adjustable front passenger seat.</p>, <p>The  top-trim Impala Premier gets 19-inch wheels, xenon headlights, heated power  seats and leather upholstery, a wireless charging pad, and some unique exterior  accents. It also includes the contents of the LT's Driver Confidence,  Entertainment, and Sunroof and Spoiler packages.</p>, <p>Packages  for the Premier trim include the Premier Confidence Package, which adds  adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and  20-inch wheels. The Premier Convenience package adds ventilated front seats, a  heated and power-adjustable steering wheel, auto-dimming rearview and  driver-side mirrors, memory settings for the exterior mirrors and steering  wheel, and ground illumination. </p>, <p>Both  the LT and Premier trims also have access to the Midnight Edition Appearance  package, which adds black-painted 19-inch wheels, replaces the chrome exterior  trim with black-painted pieces, and includes special black interior trim  pieces. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Midnight Edition Impalas are only available in  black.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2014 Chevrolet Impala LTZ</strong> (3.6L  V6 | 6-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Impala has received some revisions,  including an overhaul of the infotainment system, the addition of more standard  features, and changes to option packages. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Impala, however.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Malibu stands out in the midsize  sedan field for its sharp looks and mix of appealing qualities. It's loaded  with technology and offers a roomy interior. There's also a range of engine  choices, including a hybrid option. Overall, we think it's a solid pick. </p>, <p>Since its complete redesign for the 2016 model year,  the latest Chevrolet Malibu is very competitive in the midsize sedan category.  Some rivals might boast better driving dynamics or more features for the money,  but the Malibu provides a solid and stylish all-around package. </p>, <p>Chevrolet has loaded all but the most basic trim  with desirable features, which means you won't have trouble finding the  features you want. We also like the way the Malibu handles, and acceleration  from the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder is surprisingly peppy. The Malibu  Hybrid is a smooth and refined driver, which returns an impressive 45 mpg  combined. </p>]

[<p>For 2018, the Malibu has four trim levels. The base <strong>L </strong>trim is sparsely equipped, so unless  you're looking for the least expensive sedan possible, it's better to step up  to the <strong>LS</strong> or <strong>1LT</strong>. Both add a considerable amount of content, although like the  L, they rely on a smaller, slightly underpowered engine. The <strong>Premier</strong> trim comes almost fully loaded  and adds a more powerful motor. The Malibu is also available in <strong>Hybrid</strong> trim with similar features to  the LT.</p>]

[<p>The base<strong> L</strong> trim comes with a 16-inch steel  wheels, keyless entry and ignition, cruise control, air-conditioning, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, OnStar, Bluetooth phone connectivity and a  six-speaker audio system, and not much else. Notably, a rearview camera and  Bluetooth audio streaming are both lacking.</p>, <p>The minor  price hike to the<strong> LS</strong> trim adds quite  a bit of equipment. A rearview camera, 16-inch aluminum wheels, and a Chevrolet  MyLink infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen and Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay compatibility are all notable upgrades. You also get laminated side  windows, which reduce noise, and a 4G LTE connection with Wi-Fi.</p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>1LT</strong> trim gets you all of the  LS' features, as well as 17-inch wheels, heated mirrors, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat, rear-seat air vents and satellite radio. </p>, <p>The 1LT  can also be upgraded with several packages. The Convenience and Technology  package adds remote-vehicle start, an auto-dimming mirror and wireless charging  pad, and it upgrades the touchscreen interface to an 8-inch screen with  navigation. A Leather package is also available, which adds leather upholstery,  heated front seats, power front-seat lumbar adjustment, and, oddly, a  nine-speaker Bose audio system. The Driver Confidence package adds automatic  high beams, front and rear parking sensors, and forward collision warning.</p>, <p>New for  2018 is the Redline Edition appearance package, only available on the 1LT,  which adds blacked-out 19-inch wheels along with black and red trim pieces in  place of chrome.</p>, <p>The L, LS,  and 1LT are all powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine (160  hp and 184 pound-feet of torque) mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The Malibu <strong>Hybrid</strong> uses a 1.8-liter  four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 182  horsepower and a noteworthy 277 pound-feet of torque. It comes with the same  standard features as the Malibu 1LT and can be upgraded with the Convenience  and Technology package, the Leather package and the Driver Confidence package. </p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Premier</strong> trim includes all of the  1LT's features, as well as the contents of the Convenience and Technology and  Leather packages. The engine is upgraded to a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (250 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque) and paired with a  nine-speed automatic transmission. Also included are 18-inch wheels, ventilated  front seats, driver-seat memory settings, a heated steering wheel, dual-zone  automatic climate control, and unique exterior styling cues. </p>, <p>The  Premier can be upgraded with the Driver Confidence package and the Driver  Confidence package II, which includes an electronic parking brake, adaptive  cruise control, parking assist, and an automatic forward collision avoidance  system. The Premier Sun and Wheel package adds a dual-pane power sunroof,  19-inch wheels and upgraded floor mats.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our First Drive of the <strong>2016 Chevrolet Malibu Premier</strong> (turbo  2.0L inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Chevrolet Malibu has received some  revisions, including a new nine-speed automatic transmission for the Premier  trim in 2017, and the deletion of the 2LT trim level. Our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's Chevrolet Malibu.</p>]

[<p>It's pretty easy to figure out why the  Chevrolet Silverado is General Motors' best-selling vehicle. Americans love  pickups, so there's that. But Chevy does its part by offering a huge range of  Silverado configurations. It's sold with three cab layouts, three bed sizes and  three engine choices across six distinct trim levels. Whether you want a  bare-bones work truck or a luxurious cruiser, there's probably a 2018 Chevrolet  Silverado 1500 for you.</p>, <p>A number of notable additions for 2018  further bolster the Silverado's wide-ranging appeal. They were options last  year, but a rearview camera and 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto are now standard on even the humble Work Truck trim. The eAssist  package, which adds an engine stop-start system for improved fuel economy in  city driving, is now available nationwide — the package was  previously sold in a limited number of California dealerships.</p>, <p>The Silverado isn't as new as the Nissan  Titan, as light as the Ford F-150, or as comfortable as the Ram 1500. But  Chevy's bread and butter does most things well and should command a high spot  on your shopping list of potential pickups.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Pickup Trucks">Best Pickup Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>Like most full-size trucks, the 2018  Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is not only sold in a number of cab and bed  configurations, a bevy of trims and options packages are also available. </p>]

[<p>The Silverado 1500 full-size pickup is  available in three cab styles: the two-door regular cab, the four-door extended  (Double) cab and the crew cab. The regular cab seats three and can be had with  either a 6.5-foot-long standard bed or an 8-foot-long bed. The extended cab can  seat up to six and comes only with the standard bed. The crew cab adds  full-size rear doors and increased rear legroom and is available with the  standard bed or a shorter 5-foot-8-inch bed. All cab and cargo bed  configurations can be ordered with two- or four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Regular cabs are limited to the Work  Truck (WT), LS and LT trims. The extended cabs come in WT, LS, Custom, LT and  LTZ trims, and the crew cab comes in all the aforementioned trim levels as well  as the plush High Country. The off-road-oriented Z71 package can be ordered in  LT and LTZ models with four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The <strong>WT </strong>is powered by a 4.3-liter V6 engine (285 horsepower, 305 pound-feet of  torque) matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. Its standard features  list includes 17-inch steel wheels, xenon headlights, LED daytime running  lights, black front and rear bumpers, manually adjustable mirrors, a bed light,  a rearview camera, air-conditioning, cruise control, power door locks, a  tilt-only steering column, a driver information display, vinyl seating, vinyl  floor covering and a 40/20/40-split front bench seat.</p>, <p>Standard technology includes a 7-inch  touchscreen with Chevrolet's MyLink interface, Bluetooth and a six-speaker  audio system with a USB port, an auxiliary audio jack, and smartphone  compatibility via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The standard equipment changes slightly  depending on the cab configuration. Extended-cab models get a full-width folding  rear bench, while crew cabs have a 60/40-split folding bench. Extended- and  crew-cab models get power windows, while regular cabs get manually operated  windows. Front tow hooks are standard with four-wheel-drive models.<strong></strong></p>, <p>The <strong>LS </strong>adds stainless-steel finish wheels (crew-cab models get alloys), chrome  bumpers and grille, power and heated mirrors, deep-tinted glass, remote locking  and unlocking, OnStar (with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi), and power windows for the  regular cab.</p>, <p>The Silverado <strong>Custom </strong>is similar to the LS but receives special exterior trim,  front tow hooks and 20-inch chrome wheels (Onstar and remote locking and  unlocking are deleted but can be added back by selecting the Convenience  package).</p>, <p>From the LS, stepping up to the <strong>LT </strong>adds a tailgate damper, alloy  wheels, body-colored door handles and mirrors, cloth upholstery (with  adjustable lumbar support for the driver), carpeting, vinyl floor mats, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, an upgraded driver  information display, and an 8-inch touchscreen with HD radio, satellite radio  and a CD player. Double- and crew-cab models with front bucket seats also get a  floor-mounted console with wireless phone charging.</p>, <p>Under the hood of the <strong>LTZ </strong>lies a 5.3-liter V8 engine (355 hp,  383 lb-ft) matched to either a six-speed or eight-speed automatic, depending on  configuration. Its additional features include chrome exterior trim, 18-inch  alloy wheels, LED headlights, LED foglights and taillights, a heavy-duty  locking rear differential, front tow hooks, a seven-pin wiring harness  connector, a trailer hitch, remote engine start, a security system,  power-folding mirrors with puddle lamps, auto-dimming driver and rearview  mirrors, a power-sliding rear window with defogger, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, a 110-volt power outlet, dual-zone automatic climate control,  leather upholstery, eight-way power driver and passenger front seats with  heating and two-way power lumbar adjustment, and driver-seat memory settings.</p>, <p>The luxe <strong>High Country</strong> includes a unique grille, 20-inch chrome wheels, front  and rear parking sensors, chrome side step rails, cargo box tie-downs, a  spray-on bedliner, a trailer brake controller, a heated steering wheel, a  seven-speaker Bose audio system, a navigation system, ventilated front bucket  seats with four-way power lumbar adjustment, power-adjustable pedals, carpeted  floor mats, wireless phone charging and the contents of the Enhanced Driver  Alert package (see below).</p>, <p>The <strong>Z71 </strong>package, which is available for the LT or LTZ with 4WD, features 18-inch  wheels and off-road-oriented hardware such as special shock absorbers, a  heavy-duty air cleaner, hill descent control, underbody shields, recovery  hooks, and a few unique exterior and interior styling tweaks.</p>, <p>Many of the features on the upper trim  levels are offered on the lower ones as packages or stand-alone options. Other  available features, depending on the trim level and configuration, include  various axle ratios, off-road-oriented tires, larger wheels, tow mirrors,  power-retractable side step rails, a power sunroof, LED cargo box light and a  rear-seat entertainment system with a DVD/Blu-ray player. Notably, the Max  Trailering package features an integrated trailer brake controller,  heavier-duty suspension calibration and a higher-capacity radiator.<strong> </strong>For the ultimate hot-rod Silverado, a  6.2-liter V8 engine mated to an eight-speed auto is available on LTZ and High  Country trims, producing a stonking 420 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>Another key option group is the Enhanced  Driver Alert package, optional on the LT and LTZ and standard on the High  Country. It includes a lane departure warning and prevention system, automatic  high-beam control, forward collision warning with low-speed emergency braking,  a safety alert seat, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>There are also the All Star Edition and  Texas Edition options packages, whose highlights (depending on the package)  include 20-inch wheels, one of the available towing groups, remote starting, a  power driver seat and, of course, unique badging. Choosing an LT crew-cab model  with the All Star Edition or LTZ crew cab with the Sport package opens the gate  to the eAssist package. It adds a fuel-saving engine stop-start feature with an  electric motor charged by regenerative brakes. Also included is the 5.3-liter  V8, an eight-speed automatic transmission, a tonneau cover and LED cargo box  lights.</p>, <p>Several styling packages are available,  depending on body style and trim level. These include the Special Ops,  Realtree, Midnight, Rally 1, Rally 2 and Centennial Edition packages. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a heavy-duty truck with a refined demeanor  and laudable towing capability. Think of the 2500HD as the Silverado 1500's big  brother, capable of towing and hauling more but with many of the same styling  cues and overall virtues.</p>, <p>Maximum  towing weight for the 2500HD checks in at 14,500 pounds with a conventional tow  hitch or 18,100 pounds when using a fifth-wheel or gooseneck trailer. Those  numbers are good enough to compete with any 2500 series pickup truck on the  market and certainly more than most people will need. </p>, <p>From  behind the wheel, the Silverado 2500HD also drives a bit like a pumped-up  version of the 1500. It is still quiet and comfortable on the inside, without  much in the way of highway noise. It also feels well put-together, boasting  sturdy switches and knobs along with a clear and crisp center touchscreen. If  you're in need of a massively competent pickup that's also well-rounded as a  daily driver, make sure to take a closer look at the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado  2500HD. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck with increased  payload and towing capabilities compared to the standard full-size pickup from  Chevy (the Silverado 1500). The 2500HD is available in four trims: Work Truck (<strong>WT</strong>), <strong>LT</strong>, <strong>LTZ </strong>and <strong>High Country</strong>. The base WT is aimed  squarely at those looking to use the 2500HD as a workhorse at the job site. The  LT is the minimum if you want your family to be comfortable, while the LTZ adds  luxuries such as leather seating and dual-zone climate control. The High  Country adds an upscale flair with ventilated front seats and navigation.</p>]

[<p>Chevy  offers the 2500HD in regular-cab, double-cab and crew-cab body styles with a  choice of rear- or four-wheel drive. The regular cab is available only with a  long bed (8.2 feet), while the double-cab and crew-cab models offer either a  standard bed (6.5 feet) or the long bed. If you're looking for a truck with a  dual rear axle (aka dually), you'll want to check out the beefed-up Silverado  3500HD.</p>, <p>All  models come standard with a 6.0-liter V8 (360 horsepower, 380 pound-feet of  torque) matched to a six-speed automatic. The optional turbocharged 6.6-liter  diesel V8 (445 hp, 910 lb-ft) is paired to a more robust Allison 1000 six-speed  automatic. Buyers can add a bi-fuel option to the 6.0-liter engine, allowing it  to run on gasoline or clean-burning compressed natural gas (CNG). </p>, <p>Standard  equipment for the regular-cab <strong>WT </strong>trim  includes 17-inch steel wheels, an auto-locking rear differential, rubberized  floors, vinyl upholstery, a 40/20/40-split front bench seat, a driver  information display, power door locks, manual crank windows, a rearview camera,  air conditioning, cruise control, a tilt-only steering wheel, a 7-inch  touchscreen with Chevy's MyLink infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto, Bluetooth connectivity and a six-speaker audio system. The double- and  crew-cab WT models get six speakers as standard as well as power windows.  Optional on the WT is OnStar (with 4G LTE connection and Wi-Fi hotspot) and  satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>LT </strong>trim adds those optional  infotainment features, plus an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen, 17-inch alloy  wheels, heated and power-adjustable mirrors, a remote-locking EZ Lift &amp;  Lower tailgate, remote locking and unlocking, full power accessories, cloth  upholstery, an upgraded driver information display, radio and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel.</p>, <p>Above  the LT, the <strong>LTZ </strong>trim includes  18-inch chrome alloy wheels, foglights, power-folding mirrors, a power-sliding  rear window with defogger, remote engine start, dual-zone automatic climate  control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, power-adjustable  and heated front seats, driver's seat memory settings, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, a 110-volt power outlet, and a seven-pin wiring harness with a  trailer brake controller.</p>, <p>At  the top of the ladder, the <strong>High Country</strong> comes with 20-inch wheels, side-assist steps, cargo box tie-downs, a spray-in  bedliner, a navigation system, power-adjustable pedals, wireless phone  charging, ventilated front seats, upgraded leather upholstery and a Bose audio  system. Also included is the Driver Alert package (lane departure warning,  forward collision warning and parking sensors).</p>, <p>Most  features on the upper trims can be added to the lower trims as options. Other  extras, depending on trim, include the 4WD-only Z71 Off-Road package, tow  mirrors, a sunroof, a rear-seat entertainment system, a hard or soft tonneau  cover, and gooseneck or fifth-wheel hitch preparation.</p>]

Maximum towing weight for the 3500HD checks in at 23,300 pounds. On paper, this  is less than the competition, but it's certainly more than most people will  need. </p>, <p>From  behind the wheel, the Silverado 3500HD is a bit less comfortable than its 1500  and 2500 brethren, but we've come to expect that from the 3500 breed.

The double- and crew-cab WT models get power windows.Optional on the WT is OnStar (with 4G  LTE connection and Wi-Fi hotspot) and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>LT </strong>trim adds those optional  infotainment features plus an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen, alloy wheels, heated  mirrors, a remote-locking EZ Lift &amp; Lower tailgate, remote locking and  unlocking, full power accessories, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, cloth  upholstery, an upgraded driver information display and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel.</p>, <p>Above  the LT, the <strong>LTZ </strong>trim includesfoglights, power-folding mirrors, a  power-sliding rear window with defogger, remote engine start, dual-zone  automatic climate control, leather upholstery, power-adjustable and heated  front seats, driver's seat memory settings, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, and a 110-volt household-style power outlet.</p>, <p>At  the top of the ladder, the <strong>High Country</strong> comes with side-assist steps, cargo box tie-downs, a spray-in bedliner, a  navigation system, power-adjustable pedals, a heated steering wheel, wireless  phone charging, ventilated front seats, upgraded leather upholstery and a Bose  audio system.

[<p>Last year's update helped keep the aging  Sonic competitive, adding technology and optional active safety features to an  already fun-to-drive small car. It has some flaws, but most subcompacts are  compromised in one way or another.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Sonic sets itself  apart from most subcompacts with its standard infotainment system. For most  subcompacts, you'd pay extra for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. On the Sonic,  it's standard. And with standard OnStar, even the lowest trim of the Sonic can  have an onboard 4G LTE data connection and a Wi-Fi hotspot. As a bonus, the  Sonic is a fun little car to drive, and it comes with a spacious interior and  plenty of cargo room.</p>, <p>Of course, the lowest-cost Sonic does  give up quite a few other conveniences, such as power windows and mirrors.  Getting your hands on the eminently practical hatchback also requires stepping  up to the midlevel trim. And the base engine is not only a bit anemic, but it  also returns subpar fuel economy when compared to the rest of the class. </p>, <p>Additionally, the cabin can get noisy,  and opting for the suspension that adds the most to the Sonic's driving  experience makes the ride borderline harsh. There's also a lot of hard plastic  on display in the cabin, even in the Sonic's top trim, and some competitors  offer more in the way of active safety features and driver aids.</p>, <p>There are some solid alternatives in the  segment, depending on your needs. The Honda Fit is a monster of practicality  thanks to its large cargo area and versatile folding seats, but its handling  does feel a bit floaty and it's pricey for the class. There's also the all-new  Kia Rio, which is easy to recommend thanks to its upscale interior and sporty  driving dynamics. Still, if you're willing to pay a little more than the base  price, you can get a well-equipped and relatively spacious Chevy Sonic with  both good fuel economy and performance. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Sonic's trim levels actually have a few surprises, though on  the surface they seem straightforward enough. There are three trim levels: the <strong>LS</strong>, <strong>LT</strong> and <strong>Premier</strong>.The Sonic is also available in sedan  and hatchback body styles. Chevy offers two engine choices along with a  plethora of options.</p>]

[<p>The two powerplants for the Sonic are a  1.8-liter four-cylinder engine (138 horsepower, 125 pound-feet of torque) and a  turbocharged 1.4-liter four cylinder (138 hp, 148 lb-ft of torque), which  offers dramatically improved fuel economy. The 1.8-liter engine comes with  either a five-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic, while the  1.4-liter receives either a six-speed manual or the six-speed automatic</p>, <p>The  base Sonic<strong> LS</strong> sedan is, in many  ways, a bare-bones commuter, although it doesn't skimp when it comes to  infotainment. Standard equipment includes 15-inch steel wheels, automatic  headlights, LED daytime running lights, manual side mirrors and manual windows,  a rearview camera and remote locking and unlocking. Inside, you'll find a  four-way manually adjustable driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel  and a 60/40-split folding rear bench.</p>, <p>Infotainment  duties are handled by a 7-inch touchscreen running Chevy's MyLink system. This  includes Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, two USB ports  and a four-speaker sound system. GM's OnStar is also included, which adds a 4G  LTE data connection and a Wi-Fi hotspot. </p>, <p>The  base LS trim is only available with the sedan bodystyle and the 1.8-liter  engine. It does not have access to any major options packages.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>LT</strong> sedan adds 15-inch  alloy wheels, power windows, heated power mirrors, upgraded cloth upholstery, a  six-speaker stereo system and satellite radio. Oddly, the cheaper LT manual  sedan comes standard with the 1.4-liter engine and the six-speed manual, while  the automatic comes with the 1.8-liter engine and its six-speed automatic. The  1.4-liter engine is available as a stand-alone option, or with some upgrade  packages, for the LT automatic sedan.</p>, <p>Quite  a few packages are available for the LT sedan. The Convenience package adds  heated front seats, a six-way power-adjustable driver seat, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel with heating, an upgraded trip computer with more functionality,  and proximity entry with push-button start. The Driver Confidence package adds  forward collision alert, lane departure warning and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>The  optional RS package adds sporty styling cues to the exterior and interior, and  a leather-wrapped, flat-bottom steering wheel. The Fun and Sun package includes  a sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels and the 1.4-liter engine (with the LT  automatic). This package can be had with or without the RS package. Opting for Sun  and Fun with RS gets you the RS appearance package and a sport-tuned  suspension.</p>, <p>The  Sonic LT can also be had in the hatchback bodystyle. Both the automatic and  manual LT hatchback come with the 1.8-liter engine and the RS package.  Otherwise, similar upgrade packages are available.</p>, <p>The  Sonic <strong>Premier</strong> sedan comes with  17-inch wheels, the 1.4-liter engine, simulated leather upholstery, proximity  entry and push-button start, heated front seats, a power-adjustable driver seat  and a heated steering wheel (automatic transmission only). Opting for the manual  transmission gets you the RS package as standard. The Driver Confidence package  is available for the Premier sedan, and the sunroof is a stand-alone option.  The Premier hatchback with either the automatic or manual transmission comes  with the RS package.</p>]

[<p>Subcompacts appeal to the practical and  budget-conscience. They're inexpensive, frugal and, most important for city  dwellers, easy to park. The 2018 Chevrolet Spark has all those traits but also  adds a healthy list of standard and optional features to the mix. </p>, <p>Even  in its most basic LS trim, the Spark comes with modern conveniences that rival  those on bigger and more expensive cars. A fold-down rear bench seat increases  functionality, as does its standard smartphone integration with Android Auto and  Apple CarPlay. It's also nimble around turns yet comfortable enough for longer  trips.</p>, <p>But  to be frugal, efficient and small means some aspects must be compromised. For  the Spark, that's in its acceleration — which is slow even for this  class of car — and total usable cargo space. There's very little room  behind the rear seats. And while the rear seats are comfortable, taller adults  may brush their heads up against the roof. </p>, <p>Generally,  though, you should be pleased with Chevy's Spark if you're looking for  affordable urban-oriented transportation.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Spark is available in four trim levels that differ primarily in  standard feature content. The Spark <strong>LS</strong> is a well-equipped base model, and the <strong>1LT </strong>adds more features. The <strong>2LT</strong> has  more convenience and driver assist features, while the <strong>Activ</strong> model increases ground clearance and tacks on roof rails for  a more active lifestyle. All trims come with a 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine  that produces 98 horsepower and 94 pound-feet of torque. The engine drives the  front wheels through either a five-speed manual transmission or continuously  variable automatic transmission (CVT).</p>]

[<p>The  Spark <strong>LS</strong> comes with a rearview  camera, a 7-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability,  Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a four-speaker audio system, air conditioning,  and Chevrolet's OnStar communications system that includes a 4G LTE in-car  Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>, <p>The <strong>1LT</strong> adds 15-inch alloy wheels, power  accessories (windows, mirrors and door locks), cruise control, remote keyless  entry, foglights, and a six-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>From  here, the <strong>Activ</strong> adds simulated  leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  roof rails, special 15-inch wheels and bodywork, and a raised suspension that  provides 0.4 inch of additional ground clearance.</p>, <p>Alternately,  go for the <strong>2LT</strong>. Compared to the 1LT,  it<strong> </strong>adds rear parking sensors,  simulated seating surfaces, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, push-button  start, an upgraded driver information display, heated front seats, and chrome  door handles and trim.</p>, <p>A  sunroof is optional for the 1LT and 2LT trims. For the 2LT only, you can get a  Driver Confidence package that adds forward collision warning and lane departure  warning systems.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Suburban is a vehicle with a very broad set of skills. With  three rows of seating and a massive interior, it can fit up to nine passengers  or carry more than 120 cubic feet of cargo. Its traditional trucklike  construction and beefy V8 engine help it tow as much as 8,300 pounds in the  right configuration. It's also a quiet, comfortable and relatively  well-equipped vehicle. All of this means that the Suburban is a prime candidate  for large families with a taste for adventure.</p>, <p>That  utility does come with some drawbacks. The Suburban's XL size means it's a  handful in tight parking lots, and its truck-based suspension can't deliver the carlike ride  comfort of a crossover. Poor fuel economy means you'll be paying a lot at the  pump, too. But if you're looking for a rig that doesn't compromise on  size, utility or power, the Suburban is tough to beat. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV with seating for up to nine  passengers. It is offered in three trim levels: <strong>LS</strong>, <strong>LT</strong> and <strong>Premier</strong>. </p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights for the <strong>LS</strong> include a 5.3-liter V8 engine (355 horsepower, 383 pound-feet of torque), a  six-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch alloy wheels, seating for eight  passengers (a front-row three-passenger bench seat is optional), automatic  wipers, remote start, rear parking sensors, tri-zone automatic climate control,  power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped tilt-only steering wheel and a  household-rated power outlet.</p>, <p>On  the technology front, you get Chevy's MyLink infotainment system with an 8-inch  touchscreen interface, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto, five USB ports, and a six-speaker audio system with satellite radio. Also  included is OnStar communications (with a 4G LTE connection and onboard Wi-Fi)  and the teen-driver system (limits certain settings for young drivers). </p>, <p>The  optional Enhanced Driver Alert package adds forward collision alert with  automatic low-speed braking, a vibrating safety-alert driver seat, automatic  high beams, lane keeping assist and power-adjustable pedals.</p>, <p>The<strong> LT</strong> trim includes all of the above,  along with a power-operated liftgate, leather upholstery, heated front bucket  seats (thereby reducing passenger capacity to eight), a telescoping steering  wheel, driver-seat memory functions, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a  nine-speaker Bose audio system.</p>, <p>The  optional Luxury package adds a power-operated tailgate, power-folding mirrors,  auto-dimming driver-side mirror, foglights, front parking sensors, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, keyless entry and ignition, heated  second-row seats, power-folding second- and third-row seats, a heated and  power-adjustable tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel. The Texas Edition package  is equipped identically but adds badges, plus crossbars for the roof-mounted  cargo rails.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premier</strong> trim includes the Luxury  package and adds 20-inch wheels, xenon headlights, an adaptive Magnetic Ride  Control suspension, ventilated front seats, a navigation system, upgraded  power-adjustable front seats, a wireless charging pad and a 10-speaker premium Bose  surround-sound audio system.</p>, <p>The  LT and Premier trims are eligible for second-row bucket seats (thereby reducing  seating capacity to seven). You can also get the Sun, Entertainment and  Destinations package on these trims. It includes a sunroof, a navigation system  (LT trim) and a rear-seat entertainment system. Adaptive cruise control with  enhanced automatic emergency braking, power-retractable rocker-sill passenger  steps and a head-up display are available only on the Premier trim. </p>, <p>Many  of the standard features offered by the top trim levels of the Suburban are  available as options for the lower trim levels. </p>, <p>Offered  on all trims are 22-inch wheels. The Max Trailering package, available on all  trims, includes a special rear-axle ratio, electronic two-speed transfer case  (for four-wheel drive models), a trailer brake controller and an auto-leveling  suspension for nonmagnetic suspension vehicles. This year's new RST (Rally  Sport Truck) package adds some special exterior styling details.</p>, <p>The  Z71 Off-Road package is available only on the LT trim, and it includes  all-terrain tires, unique cosmetic elements, tubular-type rocker-sill passenger  steps, underbody skid plates, an off-road suspension calibration, the  electronically operated two-speed transfer case, hill descent control, front  parking sensors and rubber floor mats.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Chevrolet Suburban LT </strong>(5.3L V8 |  6-speed automatic | 4WD | Z71 Off-Road Package).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Chevy Suburban has received some  revisions, including the addition of optional safety features such as forward  collision warning and a teen-driver system. Overall though, findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's Suburban.</p>]

[<p>Most midsize and smaller SUVs have  switched to more carlike unibody construction in pursuit of improved ride  quality, driving experience and efficiency. But for large SUVs, truck-based  body-on-frame construction is still king. The 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe demonstrates  some of the strengths of this approach, but it also has quite a few  shortcomings.</p>, <p>On the upside, the Tahoe boasts a stout  towing capacity — up to 8,600 pounds — for pulling boats,  campers and the like. There's plenty of power, too. A 355-horsepower V8 is  standard, and an optional 420-hp V8 is new this year. A nicely appointed cabin  — easy to use and to climb into and out of — is another of  the Tahoe's strengths. We also like the quiet ride and robust air conditioning,  which is more than a match for the large interior space.</p>, <p>However, the Tahoe's sluggish driving  experience, along with the peculiarities of its compromised cargo space, are  weaknesses not shared by most unibody SUVs. Chevrolet's efforts to improve the  Tahoe's efficiency also compromise its usefulness off-road, particularly the  low front air dam that limits ground clearance. Buyers looking to do anything  but the mildest off-roading would be well-advised to opt for the Tahoe's Z71  package. </p>, <p>Buyers looking for large SUVs don't have  many choices. The Ford Expedition has received some major updates, and its  latest model promises lots of space and capability. There's also the Toyota  Sequoia, an affordable alternative with superior cargo and passenger space. And  if you don't plan on towing much, crossovers such as the Honda Pilot and  Volkswagen Atlas offer plenty of room for three rows of adults to travel in  comfort, and lots of technology tricks to boot.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe is a large  three-row SUV that comes in three trim levels: <strong>LS</strong>, <strong>LT</strong> and <strong>Premier</strong>. All trim levels come standard with a  5.3-liter V8 engine (355 hp and 383 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed  automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. Four-wheel drive and a  single-speed transfer case are available for all trim levels. Seating for eight  is standard; an optional 40/20/40-split middle-row bench seat increases  passenger capacity to nine, but it is only available on the base LS trim. </p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>LS </strong>include 18-inch  alloy wheels, heated mirrors, automatic wipers, remote keyless entry, remote  ignition, rear parking sensors, a trailer hitch receiver with wiring harness,  side steps and roof rails. On the inside, you get tri-zone automatic climate  control, a 10-way power-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding second- and  third-row bench seats and a tilt-only, leather-wrapped steering wheel. </p>, <p>Standard  tech for the LS includes a teen-driver monitoring system, OnStar communication  (including a 4G LTE connection and a Wi-Fi hotspot), a 110-volt power outlet,  Chevy's MyLink infotainment system (with 8-inch touchscreen), a rearview  camera, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, five USB ports, and a six-speaker sound system with a  CD player and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The  optional Enhanced Driver Alert package adds forward collision warning with  low-speed automatic braking, automatic high beams, lane departure warning and  intervention, and power-adjustable pedals. </p>, <p>The <strong>LT </strong>trim includes all of the above,  along with a power liftgate, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a 10-way  power-adjustable front passenger seat, a telescoping steering wheel,  driver-seat memory functions, an auto-dimming rearview camera, a universal  garage door opener and a nine-speaker Bose audio system.</p>, <p>The  optional Luxury package adds a hands-free tailgate opener, power-folding  mirrors, an auto-dimming driver-side mirror, foglights, front parking sensors,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, keyless entry and  ignition, heated second-row seats, power-folding second- and third-row seats, a  power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with heating, and a wireless charging  pad. The Texas Edition package is equipped identically (minus the charging pad)  but adds unique badging and crossbars to the roof rails.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premier </strong>trim includes the Luxury  package and adds 20-inch wheels, xenon headlights, adaptive suspension dampers,  ventilated front seats, second-row bucket seats (reducing seating capacity to  seven), a navigation system, 12-way power front seats and a 10-speaker Bose  premium surround-sound upgrade.</p>, <p>The  LT and Premier trims are eligible for the Sun, Entertainment and Destinations  package that includes a sunroof, navigation for the LT trim and a rear-seat  entertainment system. Adaptive cruise control, power-retractable side steps and  a head-up display are also available on the Premier trim. </p>, <p>New  for 2018 are the RST Edition and RST Performance Edition packages. The RST  Edition is an appearance package for the LT and Premier trims that adds  blacked-out exterior pieces such as wheels and badging. The RST Performance  Edition, available only on the Tahoe Premier, adds a 6.2-liter V8 (420 hp and  460 lb-ft of torque), a 10-speed automatic transmission, a trailer brake  controller, a sport-tuned suspension and, on four-wheel-drive models, a  two-speed transfer case.</p>, <p>Offered  on all trims are 22-inch wheels as well as the Max Trailering package that  includes a different rear axle ratio, an electronic two-speed transfer case (on  4WD models), a trailer brake controller, and an auto-leveling suspension for  vehicles without the magnetic suspension. The Z71 Off-Road package is available  only on the LT trim and adds all-terrain tires, unique cosmetic elements,  tubular side steps, underbody skid plates, an off-road suspension, an  electronic two-speed transfer case, hill descent control, front parking sensors  and rubber floor mats.</p>, <p>Many  features offered on higher-trim models are available on supporting trims as  options.</p>]

[<p>For 2018, the redesigned Chevy Traverse  loses weight and gains power, passenger space and technology, along with a new  luxury-level top trim. In  this case, the big numbers are almost 400 less pounds to cart around and an  extra 3 inches of legroom for the second-row passengers. Third-row legroom has  also increased, offering more than the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.  You'll be hard-pressed to find more passenger room without stepping up to a  full-size SUV.</p>, <p>Along  with the extra passenger space is an increase in overall cargo capacity. With  98.5 cubic feet of available space, the Traverse is tops in the class when it  comes to interior space. It also has more room behind the third-row seat  compared to other vehicles in its class. Interestingly, the dimensions of this  year's Traverse have grown a bit, but its   fraternal twin, the GMC Acadia, actually shrank for its 2017 redesign.  This marks the first time the two vehicles are sized differently. </p>, <p>This  lighter Traverse carries over the same V6 from the last generation, but it  gains 29 horsepower to make a total of 310 hp and is paired with a new  nine-speed transmission. This pairing, along with some aerodynamic tweaks,  improves fuel economy by about 3 mpg to a maximum of 21 mpg combined (18  city/27 highway). There's also a new turbocharged four-cylinder engine, but  it's only available on the sport-styled RS trim.</p>, <p>A  bigger 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto/Apple CarPlay and OnStar (with a 4G  connection and Wi-Fi) are standard across the range. Chevy's Teen Driver system  — which lets you track the car, receive notifications if it's in an  accident, and set limits on functions such as stereo volume — is  standard equipment in the new model. Safety features such as blind-spot  monitoring are available across more of the range now, and adaptive cruise  control comes to the Traverse, although only to the top High Country trim. </p>, <p>Speaking  of the High Country: Chevy is expanding the Traverse range to push up against  near-luxury offerings. This new, leather-draped trim features LED headlights as  well as all of Chevy's available driver aids and safety tech. There's also a  special all-wheel-drive system designed to improve traction and control both  on- and off-road compared to the other trim levels' optional AWD systems.  Unfortunately, adaptive cruise and related safety features, such as forward  collision alert with automatic braking, are limited to the top two trims.</p>, <p>That  extended range of trims means the Traverse isn't just taking on traditional  competitors such as the versatile Honda Pilot, fun Mazda CX-9 or practical  Toyota Highlander. A 2018 Chevrolet Traverse High Country is priced above the  top trims of most direct competitors <em>and </em>the  entry-level trims for luxury SUVs, such as the sporty Acura MDX, classy Volvo  XC90 or very German Audi Q7.</p>, <p>Still,  whether Chevy can play with the heavy hitters of the luxury class won't be  relevant to most buyers. The midlevel trims offer a competitive list of  features and lots of passenger space all wrapped up in an appealing package.  We'll have a better idea of just how the new Traverse stacks up once we get our  hands on one, but based on what we know so far, this looks like a strong entry  in the three-row crossover category.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Traverse boasts seven trim levels: <strong>L</strong>, <strong>LS</strong>, <strong>LT Cloth</strong>, <strong>LT Leather</strong>, <strong>RS</strong>, <strong>Premier</strong> and <strong>High Country</strong>. These trims run the gamut from reasonably  well-equipped to luxury SUV competitor. Most of these trim levels are fitted  with a V6, but the sport-styled RS trim is unique in that it comes with a  torquey turbocharged four-cylinder engine. </p>]

[<p>The  standard engine for the Traverse is 3.6-liter V6 (310 hp, 266 lb-ft of torque)  paired with Chevy's new nine-speed automatic transmission. Most trims can be  had in either front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive configuration. </p>, <p>While  it may be the base model, the Traverse <strong>L</strong> comes respectably equipped with LED running lights, xenon headlights, heated  mirrors, 18-inch wheels and engine stop-start. Inside, you get cloth  upholstery, a tilt-adjustable steering wheel, seating for eight, a rearview  camera, OnStar communications (with a 4G LTE connection and onboard Wi-Fi  hotspot), Chevy's Teen Driver system, and a 7-inch MyLink touchscreen  infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.</p>, <p>The  L is only available in front-wheel drive and doesn't have access to most  optional extras. It's a build-to-order trim, so you're unlikely to ever even  see a Traverse L on a dealer lot. </p>, <p>Functionally,  the <strong>LS</strong> trim will be the base trim  you'll likely come across. The LS has the same equipment as the L, but can be  had with all-wheel drive and a few optional extras, such as second-row tablet  mounts with dedicated USB charging ports and a cargo management package. </p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>LT Cloth</strong> gets you  second-row captain's chairs in place of a bench, reducing seating capacity to  seven but improving accessibility and comfort. The LT Cloth also gets roof  rails, mirror-integrated turn signals and a power-adjustable driver seat.</p>, <p>Two  notable options packages are available for the FWD Traverse Cloth. The  Convenience and Driver Confidence package adds rear parking sensors, blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, a power liftgate, remote engine start, an  upgraded 8-inch infotainment touchscreen, a color driver information display,  and heated front seats. It also includes some active safety features:  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors.  The Trailering package adds a trailer hitch and heavy-duty cooling system. Note  that optioning the LT Cloth with all-wheel drive gets you the Convenience and  Driver Confidence package standard. </p>, <p>The <strong>LT Leather</strong>, in either front- or  all-wheel drive, gets the Convenience and Driver Confidence package and adds  navigation functionality to the MyLink system. It also gets some luxury  upgrades. These start, as you might expect, with leather upholstery and  continue with a 10-speaker Bose sound system, a 120-volt power outlet, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror with a built-in rearview camera display, a  top-down parking camera system, and a power-adjustable passenger seat. A  panoramic sunroof is available as a stand-alone upgrade.</p>, <p>The <strong>RS</strong> trim receives a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder (257 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque) and is only available in  front-wheel drive. It is equipped much the same as the LT Leather, but with  unique styling cues and accents, including 20-inch wheels and a blacked-out  grille and bowtie badge. </p>, <p>Near  the top of the range, the <strong>Premier</strong> trim adds LED headlights, auto-dimming side mirrors, hands-free operation for  the liftgate, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a power-adjustable  steering column, and driver-seat memory settings.</p>, <p>Major  packages for the Premier include the Driver Confidence II package, which adds  forward collision alert with pedestrian detection and low-speed automatic  braking as well as lane departure warning and intervention. There's also the  Redline Edition package, an appearance package that blacks out all the chrome  trim and adds the panoramic sunroof. Adding all-wheel drive to the Premier trim  gets you the Driver Confidence II package, Trailering package and adaptive  headlights.</p>, <p>The  range-topping <strong>High Country</strong> comes  with all the Premier's goodies and adds a special all-wheel-drive system with  an auto-locking rear differential, along with automatic high beams, the  panoramic sunroof, adaptive cruise control, a power-folding third-row seat, and  unique interior leather upholstery. It can only be had with all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>The  Chevrolet Trax originally debuted in the United States for the 2015 model year.  At the time, we noted that it was "an affordable suburban runabout that's easy to drive, easy  to park and has up-to-date technology features" but followed that with  "it's not quick, though, and its interior materials are far from best in  class." Three years on, the 2018 Chevrolet Trax is still easy to drive,  but Chevy has addressed only part of our concerns.</p>, <p>Last  year, Chevy gave the Trax a face-lift both outside and in and added more  technology, but the underlying mechanicals weren't changed. So in spite of the  improvements, the 2018 Trax's ride quality, performance and fuel efficiency all  lag behind the rest of the class. After all, the Trax's biggest competitors  have all either been completely redesigned or introduced fresh in the  intervening years.</p>, <p>Still,  there's no denying the Trax is priced competitively and offers appealing  features such as Chevy's MyLink infotainment system as standard equipment. The  interior is smartly designed to take advantage of the available space, and the  seats are comfortable. Visibility is also quite good. The Trax certainly has  its strengths, but its weaknesses make it hard for us to recommend.</p>, <p>As  such, more recent competitors bring a lot to the table and are worth a look.  The sporty Mazda CX-3 provides an engaging driving experience, while the Honda  HR-V is surprisingly roomy and versatile. Buyers looking for a little more  ruggedness might try the Jeep Renegade or the go-anywhere Subaru Crosstrek,  which also offers a comprehensive suite of driver aids and active safety  features.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevy Trax is available in three trim levels: <strong>LS</strong>, <strong>LT</strong> and <strong>Premier</strong>. The base LS trim has enough  standard equipment not to feel stripped down, but the LT adds more practical  features and has access to several options packages. The Premier trim not only  gets interior upgrades, it also has added active safety features.</p>]

[<p>All  three trims are powered by a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine (138  hp, 148 ft-lb of torque). Also standard is a six-speed automatic transmission  and front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional. Front-wheel-drive models  have front disc brakes and drum brakes in the rear, and all-wheel-drive models  get disc brakes at all four corners.</p>, <p>The  base Trax <strong>LS</strong> comes with 16-inch  steel wheels (alloys if you upgrade to all-wheel drive), power-adjustable  manual-folding side mirrors, keyless entry and a rearview camera. Inside you'll  find a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  air-conditioning, OnStar communications (with a 4G LTE connection and a Wi-Fi  hotpsot), Chevy's MyLink infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen  interface, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration,  two USB ports and a six-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>LT</strong> gets you roof rails,  LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, heated mirrors, remote vehicle  start, cruise control and a storage drawer under the passenger seat. The  infotainment system receives satellite radio, and a 110-volt outlet is added  for the backseat area.</p>, <p>There  are four major packages for the Trax LT. The LT Convenience package adds  premium cloth upholstery (with simulated leather inserts), a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, keyless ignition and entry, and a six-way power-adjustable  driver seat. The Driver Confidence package includes blind-spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors. Opting for the Sun and Sound  package gets you a six-speaker Bose stereo system and a sunroof. </p>, <p>New  for the 2018 Trax LT is the Redline Edition, an appearance package that adds  black body accents and 18-inch alloy wheels painted black with, surprise  surprise, a red line around the circumference. </p>, <p>The  top-tier <strong>Premier</strong> trim comes with all  of the LT's packages (aside from the Redline Edition), as well as foglights,  18-inch wheels, full simulated leather upholstery and heated front seats. It  also gets extra active safety features: forward collision alert and lane  departure warning. The only options package for the Premier is the Midnight  Edition, which, more surprises, comes with black paint and black interior and  exterior trim pieces.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid, which means you can drive using pure  electric power until the Volt's battery is depleted. After that, it switches to  a combination of gas and electricity. That in itself is unremarkable. What  truly makes the Volt special is its EPA-rated electric range of 53 miles, a  number that far exceeds class standards. For a lot of drivers, that's enough to  never need to use gasoline.</p>, <p>While  all dedicated electric vehicles can go farther than that, the beauty of the  Volt is that once you run out of juice it switches over to its normal  gasoline-electric hybrid operation. Whether it's short-distance commuting or  going cross country, the Volt has you covered. On top of that, the Volt boasts  plenty of standard equipment and an easy-to-drive nature. </p>, <p>Although  you might prefer the traditional look and spaciousness provided by a plug-in  midsize sedan (such as the Kia Optima Plug-In Hybrid), the pure electric range  of these vehicles is considerably less than the Volt's. As such, we definitely  recommend checking out Chevy's smartly designed plug-in hybrid hatchback. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volt is a five-seat, plug-in hybrid hatchback sedan offered in <strong>LT</strong> and <strong>Premier</strong> trims. Both come with a plug-in hybrid system consisting of  twin electric motors, a 1.5-liter gasoline engine/generator and a 18.4-kWh  lithium-ion battery pack. Total system output is 149 horsepower. You need to  plug it in to recharge fully, but the battery pack can also be partially  recharged on the go from the gas engine/generator and regenerative braking. </p>]

[<p>Standard feature highlights for the Volt <strong>LT</strong> include 17-inch wheels, LED  headlights (low-beam) and taillights, keyless entry and ignition, remote start,  60/40-split folding rear seatbacks, automatic climate control and a  leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel. Notable technology  features for the Volt are a reconfigurable driver information and gauge cluster  display screen, Bluetooth, <a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/">OnStar</a> (with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity), an 8-inch central  touchscreen with Chevrolet's <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/mylink-radio.html">MyLink</a> interface, Apple CarPlay and  Android auto connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio.</p>, <p>Optional for the LT is a Comfort package that includes  heated mirrors, heated front seats, and a leather-wrapped and heated steering  wheel. Leather upholstery can be ordered with the LT Comfort package as well.  An eight-speaker Bose audio system is available as a stand-alone option.</p>, <p>Move  up to the Volt <strong>Premier</strong> and you get  the LT's equipment, the contents of the Comfort package, the Bose audio system,  plus different 17-inch wheels, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated rear  outboard seats, a wireless charging pad for cellphones and other equipment, and  an automated parking system (parallel and perpendicular).</p>, <p>A  Driver Confidence package is available for the LT and Premier trims and it  includes blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and rear parking  sensors. The Driver Confidence 2 package for the Premier trim (requires the  Driver Confidence package) adds forward collision warning with automatic  low-speed emergency braking, lane departure warning and intervention, and  adaptive headlights. If you get the Driver Confidence 2 package, you can also  spring for adaptive cruise control and an upgraded automatic emergency braking  system. A navigation system is optional for the Premier.</p>]

[<p>Bold  American style in a big, quiet sedan sounds like a tall order, but it's all  there in the 2018 Chrysler 300. The 300 shuts out the noise and bumpy roads along the daily commute, but  it announces itself loudly, both through sharp exterior lines and the rumble of  an available V8 engine. The 300's appeal continues with modern tech features,  including an infotainment system that ranks as one of our favorites with its  large touchscreen interface, wide range of features, and quick responses. Two  premium sound systems are available as well as a full set of driver assistance  features such as forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control. </p>, <p>There was a time when Detroit routinely  stamped out big rear-wheel-drive sedans like the Chrysler 300. Today, it's hard  to find a car that truly competes with it. A domestic counterpart such as the  Buick LaCrosse is similarly big, stately and dripping with class. But as a  front-wheel-drive car that doesn't offer a V8, it lacks the 300's lean muscle.  The Genesis G80 might be the 300's closest analog since it offers the same kind  of blissful isolation in a rear-wheel-drive package and an optional V8.  Ultimately, the 300's core appeal is that there's nothing else quite like it on  the road today.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chrysler 300 is a full-size  sedan available in five trim levels: <strong>300  Touring, 300 Touring L, 300S, 300 Limited</strong> and <strong>300C</strong>. The standard engine in Touring, S, and Limited trims is a  3.6-liter V6 (292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft). The same engine makes a bit more  power in the 300S (300 hp and 264 lb-ft). An eight-speed automatic transmission  is standard, as is rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional. The 300C  models come with a 5.7 V8  (363 hp and 394 lb-ft) with the eight-speed automatic and rear-drive only.  </p>]

[<p>The <strong>300 Touring</strong> base trim comes nicely  equipped with features that include 17-inch wheels (19-inch wheels for  all-wheel-drive models), heated mirrors, a rearview camera, keyless entry and  ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, and an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat. Tech features include an  8.4-inch touchscreen interface, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth  connectivity, and a six-speaker sound system with two USB ports and HD and  satellite radio. </p>, <p>A  handful of option packages are offered for Touring models. The Sport Appearance  package adds 20-inch wheels and blacked-out exterior trim details, while the  Chrome Appearance package offers the same, but with chrome trim elements  instead. The Driver Convenience Group package includes 18-inch wheels, a  comfort-tuned suspension, LED foglights and remote start.</p>, <p>The <strong>300 Touring L </strong>adds some premium  touches with 18-inch wheels (20-inch wheels are optional), heated front seats,  leather upholstery and a power-adjustable passenger seat. </p>, <p>An  optional Value Package bundles LED foglights, remote start, navigation,  real-time SiriusXM traffic information, and a panoramic sunroof. You can also  opt for the 300 Premium package, which bundles many of the options already  mentioned with blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear  parking sensors, and a 10-speaker Beats audio system. </p>, <p>The  sport-oriented <strong>300S</strong> comes with  20-inch wheels with performance tires (19s with AWD), a sport-tuned suspension  (RWD only), heated and power-adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, LED  foglights, remote start and transmission paddle shifters. On the  rear-wheel-drive 300S, you can opt for the 5.7-liter V8 engine.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>300 Limited </strong>brings heated  and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a power-adjustable and heated  steering wheel, driver-seat memory settings, and an auto-dimming driver side  mirror. </p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>300C </strong>comes standard with 20-inch  wheels, a touring-tuned suspension (the softest, smoothest ride of the lot),  adaptive xenon headlights, heated and cooled front cupholders, upgraded leather  upholstery and an upgraded steering wheel. Options include a power rear window  sunshade and a 19-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. A panoramic sunroof is  optional across the range of trim levels, and many of the upper trim features  are available on the lower trims as stand-alone options or via various  packages.</p>, <p>Available  on all but the Touring trim is the SafetyTec Plus package, which includes front  and rear parking sensors, automatic high beams, automatic wipers, lane  departure warning and prevention, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a forward collision mitigation system  with automatic emergency braking.</p>]

[<p>No other vehicle can match a minivan's  ability to comfortably ferry passengers and cargo. But the minivan's  utilitarian design and somewhat dorky public image are equally able to put off  all sorts of shoppers. For those people, we recommend taking a look at the 2018  Chrysler Pacifica. </p>, <p>Sure, it's still a minivan, but with a  curvaceous front end and luxurious cabin, the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica is  different from the others, and quite a departure from the capable yet  long-in-the-tooth Town &amp; Country it replaced last year. This is the minivan  for those who crave more than just function. </p>, <p>Not that the Pacifica lacks the tenets  that make minivans unique; after all, it's made by the company that created the  modern minivan in the 1980s. In addition to a spacious cabin, roomy third row  and ample cargo area, the Pacifica retains one of the Town &amp; Country's best  features: Stow 'n Go seats. Most minivans have a third row that neatly folds  into the cargo pit to create a flat load floor behind the second row. The  Pacifica is the only one with second-row seats that also fold into the floor.  In just a few minutes, the Pacifica transforms from an eight-passenger people  mover into a two-seater that easily fits 4-by-8 sheets of drywall.</p>, <p>We're equally impressed by the Pacifica's  quality cabin appointments, especially in the top-trim Limited model.  Soft-touch plastics, stitched trim and supple leather fill the interior,  accenting other highlights such as an intuitive touchscreen interface and  widely available rear-seat entertainment system. Light pours in through the  massive dual-panel sunroof to illuminate the bright two-tone interior. And all  the latest advanced driver aids are here, from blind-spot monitoring to an  automated parking feature and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>There are drawbacks, of course. The  nine-speed automatic is a little clunky, and many desirable features are tied  to the high-end Limited model. But by and large, the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica is  worth your consideration for its enviable interior design, thoughtful cargo  solutions, and numerous luxury and safety features.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chrysler Pacifica comes in six main trim levels: <strong>L</strong>, <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>Touring Plus</strong>, <strong>Touring L</strong>, <strong>Touring L Plus</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong>. The naming can be a  little confusing but, as expected, the more expensive the trim level, the more  standard features you get. There's also a Pacific Hybrid, which is reviewed  separately.</p>]

[<p>Every  Pacifica is motivated by a 3.6-liter V6 (287 horsepower, 262 pound-feet of  torque) that sends power to the front wheels via a nine-speed automatic  transmission. Seven-passenger seating is standard across the board, and  eight-passenger seating is optional on all but the L model. </p>, <p>The  base <strong>L</strong> trim level comes standard  with 17-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, keyless entry (for the driver door  only) and ignition, a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring, rear parking  sensors, rear cross-traffic alert, dual-zone climate control, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding third-row seat, a 7-inch  touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker audio  system with a USB port and an auxiliary jack. Tri-zone climate control is  available at an additional cost.</p>, <p>The  Pacifica <strong>LX </strong>is equipped with alloy  wheels, body-colored exterior trim, a driver information display, an automatic  engine stop-start system, an eight-way power driver seat (with four-way  lumbar), tri-zone climate control and folding/collapsible second-row Stow 'n Go  seats.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>Touring Plus</strong> adds  automatic headlights, foglights, LED taillights, chrome exterior trim, full  keyless entry, remote engine start, power-sliding rear doors, a power liftgate,  automatic climate control, satellite radio and a charge-only USB port located  in the front row. The 18-inch wheels can be ordered separately.</p>, <p>The  next level up is the <strong>Touring L</strong>. Its  standard features include an eight-way power passenger seat (with power  lumbar), heated front seats, leather upholstery, a second-row USB port and  second- and third-row retractable sunshades. </p>, <p>There  are several packages available for the Touring L. The <strong>Alpine Sound</strong> package adds a 13-speaker audio system and an 8.4-inch  touchscreen with HD radio and a third-row USB port. The <strong>Advanced SafetyTec</strong> package bundles automatic high beam control,  front parking sensors, a sound-reducing windshield, automatic wipers, lane  departure warning, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, an automated parking system, a top-down parking  camera and a larger driver information display. </p>, <p>Later  in the model year, a navigation system will be available for the Touring Plus  and Touring L. For the Touring Plus, it also adds the 8.4-inch touchscreen and  its upgrades. Also available for the LX, Touring Plus and Touring L is a  rear-seat entertainment system with a DVD player.</p>, <p>The  upgraded driver info display and sound-reducing windshield are included with  the <strong>Touring L Plus, </strong>along with two  sunroofs (panoramic for the first two rows and an additional fixed sunroof  above the third row), a heated steering wheel, heated second-row seats, ambient  lighting, the 8.4-inch touchscreen, navigation and the Alpine audio system.</p>, <p>The  Touring Plus can be equipped with the Advanced SafetyTec pack, a 20-speaker  Harman Kardon sound system, and hands-free operation for the sliding rear doors  and liftgate.</p>, <p>All  Touring models can be further equipped with 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>The  top-dog <strong>Limited </strong>comes with 18-inch  wheels, xenon headlamps, LED foglights, auto-dimming exterior and rearview  mirrors, power-folding mirrors, driver memory settings, ventilated front seats,  premium leather upholstery, the hands-free liftgate and sliding doors, an  in-vehicle vacuum cleaner and a power-folding third-row seat.</p>, <p>As  loaded as it is, even the Limited can be bolstered with additional features.  The Advanced SafetyTec package is available here, as is an upgraded rear  entertainment system. It combines the 20-speaker audio system with a Blu-ray  player, dual 10-inch seatback touchscreens, an HDMI input and a household-style  power outlet. Twenty-inch wheels are sold as a stand-alone option.</p>, <p>Available  on all models is a secondary driver key that Chrysler calls KeySense. Intended  for younger drivers and valets, this key starts the car is a mode that limits  top speed and volume, keeps all driver aids activated and restricts  user-defined satellite radio channels. The Trailer Tow Group is available on  Touring Plus models and above, and it adds a four- and seven-pin wiring harness  and a 2-inch hitch receiver. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Chrysler Pacifica </strong>(3.6L V6  | 9-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Pacifica has received some  revisions, including standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's Pacifica.<em><u></u></em></p>]

[<p>Before 2017, there weren't many choices  if you wanted good mileage from a vehicle with three rows of seating. The  Toyota Highlander Hybrid was pretty much the only game in town. However,  there's not much cargo room behind the third row in any three-row crossover,  and adults don't fit easily into the legroom-challenged rear seats. The 2018  Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid solves both of these problems, with a spacious  seven-passenger layout and a cleverly concealed battery pack.</p>, <p>The Pacifica Hybrid is actually a plug-in  hybrid, which means you can charge the hybrid battery pack with an external  power source to get up to 33 miles of all-electric driving range. In some  scenarios, that's enough juice to drop kids at school, go to the office, run an  errand at lunch, then return for the kids and evening soccer practice, all  without dipping into the gas tank. When you do need gas, a stout V6 engine  kicks in to assume duty. The EPA estimates you'll get 32 mpg in combined  driving, which is still by far the best in the minivan segment.</p>, <p>You only give up two things when choosing  the plug-in Pacifica Hybrid over the standard minivan. The gas-only Pacifica  features a seat management system called Stow 'n Go for the second and third  rows. With it, both rows of seating fold neatly into the floor to create a flat  load space behind the front seats. The Hybrid's 16-kWh battery pack occupies  the empty space below the second row that allows those seats to be folded in  the normal Pacifica. Additionally, a second-row bench is not available, so you  can only seat seven in the Pacifica Hybrid.</p>, <p>Other than these minor drawbacks, the  Pacifica Hybrid is pretty much the same as the standard Pacifica. There's the  hybrid powertrain, of course, but you get the same high-quality interior  materials, intuitive user interface and comfortable ride. And because the base  Touring Plus Hybrid matches up with a midtrim Pacifica from a features standpoint,  every Hybrid is fairly well-equipped. In fact, the fully loaded Limited isn't  significantly more expensive than the Touring Plus, though this says more about  the Hybrid's high starting price than the top trim's comparatively low upgrade  cost. If you can look past the Pacifica Hybrid's base cost and lack of  second-row Stow 'n Go, you'll be rewarded with a handsome minivan that offers  cargo and third-row room superior to what you'll find in any rival.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is a three-row minivan that seats seven  passengers. It's available in three well-equipped trim levels: <strong>Touring Plus</strong>, <strong>Touring L</strong> and <strong>Limited. </strong></p>]

[<p>Under  the hood of every Pacifica Hybrid is a 3.6-liter V6 engine augmented with dual  electric motors (260 horsepower total); the system is paired with a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that drives the front  wheels. It can travel about 33 miles on electric power alone. After that, the  V6 and normal hybrid operation take over. A 240-volt power supply can fully  recharge the 16-kWh battery pack in about two hours. </p>, <p>Standard  exterior features on the <strong>Touring Plus </strong>include  17-inch wheels, automatic headlights, LED taillights, foglights, power-sliding  doors, heated mirrors and keyless entry and ignition. Inside, you'll find an  eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with four-way power lumbar), a driver  information display, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, tri-zone automatic  climate control, ambient lighting, second-row power windows and a 60/40-split  folding third-row seat. </p>, <p>Technology  features include an 8.4-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity,  Bluetooth, voice commands, and a six-speaker audio system with HD and satellite  radio, a USB port and an auxiliary jack. Standard driver aids include a  rearview camera, rear parking sensors, and blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert. A power liftgate is available as a stand-alone option. </p>, <p>The <strong>Touring L</strong> adds the power liftgate,  along with roof rails, remote engine start, an upgraded center console, heated  front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather upholstery, and second-  and third-row window shades. </p>, <p>Both  Touring models can be ordered with a navigation system (which also adds 4G LTE  Wi-Fi connectivity) and a rear-seat entertainment system, which includes a DVD  player and an overhead display screen.</p>, <p>Upgrades  to the top-level <strong>Limited</strong> are  numerous. On the outside, the Limited adds automatic high beam control,  automatic wipers, chrome trim, and hands-free operation for the sliding doors  and liftgate. Inside, you'll find an auto-dimming mirror, adaptive cruise  control, upgraded leather, a power passenger seat, ventilated front seats, a  heated steering wheel, an automated parallel and perpendicular parking feature,  the navigation system, a 20-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system, and  second- and third-row USB ports. </p>, <p>Passengers  in back will also appreciate the Limited's added Blu-ray player, seatback video  screens, a household-style power outlet, and wireless streaming from connected  Android devices. Additional driver aids are also included, with front parking  sensors, lane departure warning, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, and a 360-degree parking camera added to the list. A  panoramic sunroof and 18-inch wheels are optional.</p>, <p>Standard  on the Limited and optional on the other models is a secondary driver key that  Chrysler calls KeySense. Intended for younger drivers and valets, this key  starts the car is a mode that limits top speed and volume, keeps all driver  aids activated and restricts user-defined satellite radio channels.</p>]

[<p>In recent years, the muscle-car class has  been contested by the Chevrolet Camaro, Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang. The  Challenger differs from the Mustang and Camaro with its larger size, unabashed  retro look and boulevard-cruiser attitude. The Challenger's bigger size allows  for much more backseat room and a sedan-size trunk, but don't think this means  the Challenger is tame by comparison.</p>, <p>You have a wide variety of choices,  ranging from the 305-horsepower SXT V6 up to the drag-strip-dominating Demon and  its potential for 840 horsepower. When pitted against its rivals, the 2018  Dodge Challenger doesn't have the sharp handling to keep up on a curvy road,  but it bests them in comfort, refinement and pure retro appeal. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Dodge Challenger is a five-seat, two-door coupe that is available in seven  major trim levels, most of which are further divided into several subtrims.  Major trim levels include the <strong>SXT</strong>, <strong>GT</strong>, <strong>R/T</strong>,<strong> R/T 392</strong>,<strong> SRT 392, SRT Hellcat </strong>and<strong> SRT Demon. </strong>The SXT and GT Challenger  trims are powered by a V6; the others are driven by increasingly more powerful  V8s, culminating in the 840-hp Demon. </p>]

[<p><strong>Drawer</strong></p>, <p>The  2018 Dodge Challenger is a five-seat, two-door coupe that is available in seven  major trim levels, most of which are further divided into several subtrims.  Major trim levels include the <strong>SXT</strong>, <strong>GT</strong>, <strong>R/T</strong>,<strong> R/T 392</strong>,<strong> SRT 392, SRT Hellcat </strong>and<strong> SRT Demon. </strong>The SXT and GT Challenger  trims are powered by a V6; the others are driven by increasingly more powerful  V8s, culminating in the 840-hp Demon. </p>, <p>First  up is the <strong>SXT</strong>, powered by a  3.6-liter V6 engine (305 horsepower, 268 pound-feet of torque) matched to an  eight-speed automatic transmission. Standard features include 18-inch wheels,  automatic headlights, heated mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, dual-zone automatic climate control, a six-way  power-adjustable driver seat and 60/40-split folding rear seats. Tech features  include Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration, two USB ports and a six-speaker sound  system.</p>, <p>The <strong>GT</strong> employs the same V6 and is the  only Challenger with all-wheel drive. On top of the SXT features, it adds  19-inch wheels, foglights, rear parking sensors, upgraded brakes, heated front  seats, ventilated front seats, leather upholstery, a power-adjustable and  heated steering wheel, interior ambient lighting, an 8.4-inch touchscreen,  performance-related in-car apps, and satellite and HD radio. </p>, <p>The <strong>R/T</strong> is the least expensive way into  a V8 Challenger, offering a 5.7-liter engine paired to either a six-speed  manual transmission (375 hp, 410 lb-ft) or the eight-speed auto (372 hp, 400  lb-ft). In addition to the SXT features, you get 20-inch wheels, foglights,  upgraded brakes, a limited-slip differential and an active sport exhaust. </p>, <p>The <strong>R/T 392 </strong>gets an even larger  6.4-liter V8 (485 hp, 475 lb-ft) along with Brembo performance brakes  (four-piston front and rear), a sport-tuned  suspension, a rear spoiler, cloth sport seats, rear parking sensors, an  8.4-inch touchscreen with the newest version of Uconnect, performance-related  in-car apps and an Alpine audio system with HD/satellite radio. </p>, <p>The <strong>SRT 392</strong> model builds upon the R/T  392 offerings, adding xenon headlights, a special air intake, power-folding  mirrors, beefier front Brembo brakes (six-piston front), adaptive suspension  dampers, a power-adjustable and heated sport steering wheel, heated and  ventilated front seats, leather upholstery, configurable driving modes, an  18-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, navigation, and blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert. </p>, <p>There  are also variants of the above, such as the <strong>Plus</strong>, <strong>R/T T/A</strong>, <strong>R/T Scat Pack</strong> and <strong>R/T Shaker </strong>that add a few extra features. </p>, <p>The <strong>SRT Hellcat</strong> is all about raw speed,  evidenced by its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 (707 hp, 650 lb-ft). It's also  equipped with unique exterior styling, a sportier suspension, quad exhaust  tips, automatic high beams and automatic wipers. A new <strong>SRT Hellcat Widebody</strong> model gets some very prominent Demon-based  fender flares to accommodate wider tires that improve the car's handling and  grip.</p>, <p>The  new <strong>SRT Demon</strong> makes its mark as the  most powerful muscle car in history (840 hp, 770 lb-ft on 100-octane race fuel  or 808 hp, 717 lb-ft on premium unleaded). The eight-speed automatic is the  only transmission offered. With drag racing as its reason for being, the Demon  receives specialized equipment that includes numerous cooling systems,  street-legal drag slicks, a transbrake (for optimum engine power at launch), an  adaptive suspension with a drag mode, and launch control. It's also important  to point out what is eliminated: There's no front passenger seat, no rear seats  and no sound insulation. You can add back the seats for a mere $1. </p>, <p>In  terms of features, the Demon is similarly appointed as the Hellcat, but with  18-inch wheels, four-piston lightweight brakes, an active exhaust system, a  power-adjustable cloth sport driver seat, a navigation system, and a  two-speaker stereo with satellite and HD radio. </p>, <p>Most  of the features found on the upper trim levels can be added to the lower trims  as options. A sunroof is optional on all Challenger trims, and new SRT model  buyers get a one-day course at an <a href="http://www.drivesrt.com/srt-track-experience/">SRT Driving Experience school</a>.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Dodge Charger is a loud, "heck yeah!" salute to choice. You  don't have to get the most state-of-the-art, most fuel-efficient, most refined  or most boring silver car available. For that, you can turn to better options  from Buick, Kia or Toyota. Instead, you can get an unapologetic American  performance sedan with massive power, brash style and abundant ways to  customize. </p>, <p>The  Charger isn't exactly a sensible car for sensible drivers. Instead, it's for  drivers who want a car that looks cool, that makes cool noises, and that comes  in cool colors such as Go Mango, Maximum Steel and White Knuckle. It's a car  for drivers who crave power. A V6 engine is the default setting, but you can  get a Charger with a V8, an even bigger V8 or a V8 with so much power that it  might qualify for NASCAR duty. </p>, <p>Sensibility  aside, the Charger is still practical. Four doors, a roomy cabin and a raft of  safety features make it a legitimate choice for family duty. A broad range of  standard and optional creature comforts let you tailor the Charger to taste,  while the Uconnect tech interface is among the best around. The Charger is even  available with all-wheel drive if you often drive in slippery conditions. </p>, <p>Since  Chevrolet discontinued its SS sedan for 2018, the Charger stands alone as an  affordable American sedan that blends classic hot-rod performance with modern  sensibility.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Dodge Charger as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans">Best AWD Sedans</a>, and the 2018 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat as one of the <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Dodge Charger is a five-passenger, four-door sedan available in nearly a  dozen trim levels: <strong>SXT</strong>, <strong>SXT Plus</strong>, <strong>GT</strong>, <strong>GT Plus</strong>, <strong>R/T</strong>, <strong>Daytona</strong>, <strong>R/T Scat Pack,  Daytona 392, SRT 392</strong> and <strong>SRT Hellcat</strong>.  The SXT and GT trims come with the V6, while the others come with increasingly  powerful V8 engines culminating in the 707-horsepower Hellcat. Rear-wheel drive  is standard, and all-wheel drive is available on the GT trims. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>SXT</strong> starts with a 3.6-liter V6  engine (292 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) matched to an eight-speed automatic  transmission. From there, standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels,  keyless entry and ignition, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, a  power-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding back seat, Dodge's Uconnect  infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, voice controls, dual  USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a  six-speaker sound system with satellite radio. </p>, <p>An  optional Blacktop package adds 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a rear  spoiler and blacked-out styling elements. </p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>SXT Plus </strong>adds 18-inch wheels,  LED foglights, heated mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated  sport seats, upgraded cloth upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  Uconnect with an 8.4-inch touchscreen, HD radio and an upgraded six-speaker  sound system. </p>, <p>There  are several stand-alone options and packages for the SXT Plus, starting with  the Super Track Pak that bumps up engine power to (300 hp, 264 lb-ft) and adds  many of the performance-enhancing features available on the upper V8 trim  levels. Others include the Blacktop package, a sunroof, a navigation system and  a 10-speaker BeatsAudio sound system. </p>, <p>The  Technology Group package includes most of today's important driver assistance  features, including automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, automatic  wipers, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and lane  departure warning and intervention. </p>, <p>The <strong>GT</strong> models are equipped similarly to  SXT Plus trims, except with all-wheel drive. <strong>GT Plus </strong>trims add features such as xenon headlights, leather  upholstery, ventilated sport front seats, heated rear seats, blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. </p>, <p>The <strong>R/T </strong>is equipped similarly to the  SXT, but it comes with a 5.7-liter V8 engine (370 hp, 395 lb-ft), upgraded  brakes, a sport-tuned suspension, 20-inch wheels and transmission paddle  shifters. </p>, <p>The  R/T can be equipped with the Plus Group, which includes xenon headlights,  heated and ventilated sport seats, leather upholstery, heated rear seats, and a  heated steering wheel among other items. The optional Premium Group bundles  those items along with automatic wipers, a power-adjustable steering wheel,  safety features from the Technology Group package, navigation software added to  the Uconnect system, and a 10-speaker BeatsAudio sound system. </p>, <p>Going  with the Charger <strong>Daytona</strong> gets you  the R/T's special exterior styling elements and interior trim, a further  upgraded performance suspension, forged alloy wheels, leather and simulated  suede upholstery, and many features from the Plus Group and Premium Group.</p>, <p>The <strong>R/T Scat Pack</strong> adds to the R/T a  bigger 6.4-liter V8 engine (485 hp, 475 lb-ft), Brembo high-performance brakes,  more aggressive suspension settings, and eight-way power front seats. Leather  and simulated suede upholstery is optional, and with it you get the heated and  ventilated front seats and heated rear seats. </p>, <p>The <strong>Daytona 392</strong> essentially combines the  Daytona and R/T Scat Pack features, along with further upgraded brakes. </p>, <p>The <strong>SRT 392</strong> adds to the R/T Scat Pack an  adaptive suspension, forged alloy wheels, Pirelli high-performance tires, the  Daytona 392's upgraded brakes, xenon headlamps, the blind-spot monitoring and  rear cross-traffic alert systems, all-leather upholstery, a power-adjustable  steering column, a flat-bottomed steering wheel and the Uconnect navigation  system. The Technology Group is optional.</p>, <p>The <strong>SRT Hellcat</strong> takes the SRT 392  features and adds a more powerful supercharged V8 (707 hp, 650 lb-ft), upgraded  steering and suspension tuning, and all of the above options. You'll have to  adjust your own steering wheel angle, but you can get the power-adjustable  steering column back through the optional Power Convenience Group.</p>, <p>A  19-speaker Harman Kardon sound system is optional on select Charger trims.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Dodge Charger R/T Scat Pack </strong>(6.4-liter  V8 | 8-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Charger has received revisions that  include the availability of now-common driver safety aids and upgrades to the  Uconnect infotainment system. Our observations of performance, comfort and  utility, however, remain applicable to this year's Charger.</p>]

[<p>Dodge does things a little  differently from other automakers. While others make anonymous four-cylinder  family sedans, Dodge offers the Charger, a large family sedan inspired by  muscle cars of the past and powered by a V6 or a choice of three V8 engines. And  in an era when car companies refresh crossover SUVs at the speed of midterm  election cycles, Dodge carries on with an aging but proven formula for the 2018  Dodge Durango. </p>, <p>If  the Durango looks familiar, that's because you've seen this current generation  on the road since the 2011 model year. That's an eternity compared to a number  of its fresher rivals, but Dodge has kept this three-row crossover relevant,  most notably with a significant update for 2014 that added a satisfying  eight-speed automatic transmission and a revised interior with Chrysler's  excellent 8.4-inch touchscreen. </p>, <p>For  2018, there's even more to like, including a new high-performance SRT model  that cranks out 475 horsepower, accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds,  and can tow up to 8,600 pounds. No other non-luxury automaker offers anything  like it.</p>, <p>The  Durango's fundamentals — including extraordinary towing capacity,  available V8 power and adult-size space in the third row — are key to  its enduring appeal. And as one of the most muscular vehicles in its class, the  Durango is also one of the heaviest. That takes a toll on real-world fuel  economy and can also make the V6 engine feel anemic at times. It also bolsters  the argument for choosing the exuberant V8, gas bills notwithstanding. </p>, <p>If  you can find a powertrain that suits your needs, whether a V6 or a V6, there's  a lot to like. Even at this advanced stage in its life cycle, the Durango  remains one of the most capable and well-rounded three-row crossovers you can  buy.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Dodge Durango as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Dodge Durango is a  three-row crossover SUV available in five trim levels: <strong>SXT</strong>, <strong>GT</strong>, <strong>Citadel</strong>, <strong>R/T</strong> and <strong>SRT</strong>. </p>]

[<p>All  Durango models except the SRT are rear-wheel drive and offer optional all-wheel  drive. The SRT is only available with all-wheel drive. Seven-passenger seating  is standard, while second-row captain's chairs (reducing capacity to six) are  optional. If you need to prioritize cargo over passengers, you can order the  base SXT with just two rows of seats. The other trims are three-row only.</p>, <p>The  base <strong>SXT</strong> comes standard with a  3.6-liter V6 engine (293 hp, 260 pound-feet of torque) matched to an  eight-speed automatic transmission. Other standard features include 18-inch  alloy wheels, a load-leveling rear suspension, heated mirrors, a rearview  camera, keyless ignition and entry, three-zone climate control, a 60/40-split  folding and reclining second-row seat, a 50/50-split folding third-row seat  with power-folding headrests (or alternatively, an option to delete the  third-row seat) and cloth upholstery. Technology features include Bluetooth  phone connectivity, a 7-inch touchscreen interface, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto smartphone integration, dual USB ports and a six-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>The <strong>GT</strong> adds 20-inch wheels, a power  liftgate, rear parking sensors, remote start, heated front and second-row  seats, a heated steering wheel, power-adjustable front seats, leather and suede  upholstery, a 115-volt power outlet, driver-position memory settings and  satellite radio. </p>, <p>Going  with the <strong>Citadel</strong> gets you xenon  headlights, automatic high beams, automatic wipers, upgraded brakes, front  parking sensors, roof-rail crossbars, a sunroof, a cargo cover, upgraded  leather upholstery, additional leather trim, a power-adjustable steering  column, the Uconnect 8.4-inch touchscreen interface, a navigation system, a  power-adjustable passenger seat, ventilated front seats, and a nine-speaker  audio system with a subwoofer and HD radio. </p>, <p>An  optional Anodized Platinum appearance package adds upgraded leather upholstery  with silver accent stitching and special interior trim.</p>, <p>The <strong>R/T </strong>moves into high-performance  realms with the 5.7-liter V8 engine (360 hp, 390 lb-ft) as standard, an  upgraded steering system, a sport-tuned suspension, a performance hood design,  LED foglights, red accent stitching and a Beats audio system. The Citadel's  standard roof rails and sunroof are optional. The 5.7-liter V8 is also optional  for the Citadel. </p>, <p>Some  of the higher trims' standard features are also offered on lower trims as  options. A Technology Group package for the Citadel and R/T adds adaptive  cruise control, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a forward  collision warning system with automatic braking, lane departure warning and  lane keeping assist. Blind-spot monitoring is also offered on the GT via a  separate options package (Safety/Security and Convenience Group) that  additionally includes a handful of the Citadel's standard luxuries.</p>, <p>Optional  on the GT and R/T is a Brass Monkey appearance package that adds a gloss black  grille, black headlamp bezels, 20-inch bronze-painted wheels and extra  body-color trim. An optional Blacktop appearance package (also for the GT and  R/T) is similar and fits the Durango with 20-inch, black-painted wheels and a  variety of blackout exterior trim items. The Blacktop package also bumps engine  power up to 295 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. Other options include black running  boards and bright pedals (Mopar Running Board package); a second-row console  with armrest and storage (includes an in-console, 12-volt power outlet and a  USB charge port); a dual-screen rear entertainment system (with Blu-ray  compatibility); and a trailer-tow package.</p>, <p>Finally,  the new <strong>SRT</strong> trim level tops it off  with a 6.4-liter V8 engine (475 hp, 470 lb-ft), performance-tuned steering, an  adaptive suspension, electronically controlled limited-slip differential, SRT  Performance Pages (various configurable performance parameters), and a driver's  session at the SRT Track Experience driving school. </p>, <p>Options  include a sunroof, upgraded Laguna leather upholstery, the rear entertainment  system, the SRT Interior Appearance Group (includes carbon-fiber accents and  soft-touch headliner) and the Technology Group. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Dodge Durango Limited </strong>(3.6L  V6 | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Durango has received some revisions  to appearance packages and standard equipment at various trim levels. Our test  Durango's Limited trim is similar to today's GT. Otherwise, our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's Durango.</p>]

[<p>If prices for the latest and greatest  crop of minivans seem a little rich for your tastes, you're in luck. The 2018  Dodge Grand Caravan isn't the newest kid on the block, but its tempting offer  of safe family transportation at an affordable price might be enough to sway  you over its more expensive rivals. </p>, <p>Like other minivans, the Grand Caravan  enjoys superior third-row accommodations and cargo capacity compared to most  three-row SUVs. One of the Grand Caravan's defining features is its available  Stow 'n Go seating arrangement. As opposed to other minivans that require  removing the second-row seats to maximize cargo space, the Grand Caravan's  second-row captain's chairs fold neatly into storage bins below the  floorboards. With the third-row bench also stowed, this creates a nearly flat  load surface for carrying large items. Along with its flexible seating and  cargo situation, the Grand Caravan's value-oriented pricing structure will  undoubtedly win plenty of fans.</p>, <p>You will be paying a price, however, when  you pick the Grand Caravan over newer models. The Grand Caravan was last fully  redesigned in 2008, and it feels positively ancient from behind the wheel.  Low-quality plastics run rampant throughout the cabin, the touchscreen system  is tremendously outdated, and its powertrain and suspension tuning aren't as  refined as those on other minivans. Most importantly, the signature Stow 'n Go  seating uses fixed latch points on the floor, so the second row doesn't slide  for passenger comfort.</p>, <p>If a low price is the guiding factor in  your minivan-purchasing decision, you'll probably find the 2018 Dodge Grand  Caravan to be a satisfying choice. But if you have slightly deeper pockets, the  other vehicles in this segment are worth considering instead.</p>]

[<p>The budget-friendly, seven-passenger  Dodge Grand Caravan is sold in four trim levels: <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SE Plus</strong>, <strong>SXT</strong> and <strong>GT</strong>. All  Grand Caravans have a 3.6-liter V6 (283 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque)  paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>SE</strong>'s standard features list includes  17-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, remote locking and unlocking, tri-zone  climate control (with rear air-conditioning), cruise control, rearview camera,  a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with audio controls, a conversation  mirror, a second-row bench seat and full power accessories. Entertainment comes  in the form of a six-speaker audio system with a CD player and an auxiliary  audio jack, controlled via a 6.5-inch touchscreen display.</p>, <p>The  SE can be ordered with the Uconnect Hands-Free Group package, which adds an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter,  satellite radio, a USB port, and Bluetooth audio and phone connectivity.  Second-row captain's chairs are an optional upgrade and offer the Stow 'n Go  fold-into-the-floor feature.</p>, <p>The <strong>SE Plus</strong> comes with the above equipment  as standard (including the captain's chairs), plus 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, foglights, black exterior styling elements, remote engine  start, a front floor console and upgraded upholstery and trim<em>.</em></p>, <p>The  Grand Caravan <strong>SXT </strong>added features  such as chrome exterior trim, roof rails,<strong> </strong>power-sliding rear doors, a power liftgate, a larger floor console, leather  upholstery with suede inserts, and an eight-way power driver seat (with two-way  power lumbar adjustment). </p>, <p>The  SXT offers two notable options packages. The Blacktop package retains the SE's  black exterior trim and deletes the roof rack, while the considerably more  feature-rich Driver Convenience Group package adds a rear overhead console, an  overhead storage bin, automatic climate control, a heated steering wheel,  heated front seats, ambient lighting, and second- and third-row sunshades.</p>, <p>The  range-topping Grand Caravan is the <strong>GT</strong>.  It takes the standard content from the SXT with the Driver Convenience Group  (minus the chrome and roof rails)<strong> </strong>and  adds a body-colored grille,<strong> </strong>a  performance-tuned suspension, different wheels, black interior accents, a  driver information center, a 115-volt household-style outlet, full leather  seating, an eight-way power passenger seat, heated second-row seats,  navigation, voice controls and an upgraded nine-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>Different  trims also get access to special options packages. All models can be ordered  with a rear-seat entertainment system, which bundles the GT's touchscreen with  a 9-inch overhead display screen, an HDMI input, satellite radio, two USB  charging ports and a 115-volt power outlet. </p>, <p>The  GT-only Safety Sphere group adds rear parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring  and rear cross-traffic alert. The Trailer Tow Group, which adds a hitch, wiring  harness and load-leveling feature, is also GT-only.</p>]

[<p>The Dodge Journey could very well be the  car that time forgot. It debuted back in 2009 and has been pretty much the same  vehicle since. While this longevity is admirable and speaks to the inherent  goodness of the Journey's design concept, there's no denying that it's behind  the times in quite a few areas.</p>, <p>As in previous years, the 2018 version of  the Journey has three rows and a low price, but it lacks quite a few of the  safety features buyers might expect, even when fully optioned. Its base engine  is a truly underwhelming four-cylinder paired to an outdated four-speed  automatic, and the combo results in subpar fuel economy. A stronger V6 is  available, but even so equipped the Journey can't keep up with other three-row  SUVs. </p>, <p>It's not all bad news for the Journey. We  like the ride quality, and the seats are comfortable all around. The 8.4-inch  Uconnect infotainment system included on upper trims is also a solid system,  although it sadly has not been upgraded to the latest version that includes  Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration. </p>, <p>The Journey will get you where you're going,  and will do so for less money than many competitors. But overall we think  you'll be happier with vehicles such as the Kia Sorento, GMC Acadia or new  Volkswagen Tiguan. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Dodge Journey comes in four trim levels, with two engine options and either  front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The base SE and SXT are pretty bare  bones, lacking even bluetooth as a standard feature. Stepping up to the  Crossroad gets you many of the same standard features you expect from  entry-level trims on other vehicles. The range-topping GT gives you those  features plus leather and a standard V6.</p>]

[<p>All  four Journey trims come standard with front-wheel drive and, excluding the GT,  a 2.4-liter four-cylinder (173 hp, 166 lb-ft of torque) paired with a  four-speed automatic. Opting for all-wheel drive (or the front-wheel-drive  Journey GT) gets you a 3.6-liter V6 (283 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) and a  six-speed automatic transmission. The V6 is also available as a stand-alone  option for the SXT and Journey trims.</p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights for the Journey <strong>SE</strong> include 17-inch steel wheels, a height-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split  second-row seats (with slide and recline), dual-zone climate control, keyless  ignition and entry, and a six-speaker sound system with a 4.3-inch touchscreen  interface.</p>, <p>Options  packages include the Connectivity package (Bluetooth, satellite radio, a USB  port, voice commands and a leather-wrapped steering wheel), the Popular  Equipment package (three-zone temperature control with rear-seat vents, a  conversation mirror, overhead console storage, and a leather-wrapped steering  wheel) and the Comfort/Convenience package (a power-adjustable driver seat).</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>SXT</strong> adds 17-inch alloy  wheels and contents of the Connectivity and Popular Equipment packages. A  Uconnect 8.4-inch touchscreen package gets you the desirable 8.4-inch  touchscreen plus adds three-zone automatic climate control, aimable interior  lamps, overhead console storage, rear parking sensors and a rearview camera.  The SXT's Premium package adds satellite radio, a conversation mirror,  leather-wrapped steering wheel and the power-adjustable driver seat.</p>, <p>The  Dodge Journey <strong>Crossroad</strong> comes with  19-inch black-painted alloy wheels and the contents of the Uconnect 8.4-inch  touchscreen package. Further options include leather upholstery, heated front  seats, a rear-seat entertainment system, a premium six-speaker stereo system  with subwoofer, navigation, a sunroof and the Driver Convenience package (a  rearview camera, rear parking sensors, and a universal garage door opener).</p>, <p>The  range-topping <strong>GT </strong>trim gets 19-inch  alloys, remote start, a security alarm, leather upholstery, heated front seats  and steering wheel, and the premium stereo system. Additional options are  largely the same as for the Crossroad, but a Trailer Tow Prep package, which  adds a hitch and four-pin wiring connector, is also available. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our first drive of  the <strong>2014 Dodge Journey SXT Plus</strong> (3.6L V6 | 6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Dodge Journey has received some  revisions, including an improved infotainment interface and standard third-row  seating. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Dodge Journey,  however.</p>]

[<p>When  Fiat decided to revive its famous 124 Spider nameplate last year, the company  chose a partner known for making great modern roadsters: Mazda. Indeed, much of  the 124 Spider's underlying structure comes courtesy of the Mazda MX-5 Miata.  But the 124 is more than just a Mazda MX-5 in a costume. Fiat uses its own  engine, transmission and suspension tuning, which in turn give the 124 Spider a  distinct character all its own. </p>, <p>Like  the Miata, the 124's diminutive figure is both part of its appeal and the cause  of many of its shortcomings. Similarly, the small, turbocharged engine is  likewise a distinctive trait with its own appeals and pitfalls: It's punchy and  eager high in the rev range, but it's distinctly underpowered at low to medium  rpm.</p>, <p>The  Lusso and Classica express these traits very differently from the hot Abarth.  The former are softer, and in some ways more relaxed, while the latter pairs  exceptional handling with a ride that borders on harsh. Knowing what you want  from the 124 Spider is important in choosing the right trim.</p>, <p>Other  convertibles on the market come with fewer compromises. The Ford Mustang and  Chevrolet Camaro convertibles offer more interior space, more usable trunks and  back seats (small as they are), and they are available with significantly more  power. The VW Beetle convertible and Mini Cooper convertible have small-car  aesthetics and are easy to drive while asking for fewer sacrifices than the  124. But as generations of Miata owners (and owners of the old 124 Spider) will  tell you, driving is more about the connection you feel with your car rather  than how much you can fit in the trunk. And in that way, there's simply no  substitute for the 2018 Fiat 124 Spider. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Fiat 124 Spider is available in three trim levels: the relatively  bare-bones <strong>Classica</strong>, the more  comprehensively equipped <strong>Lusso</strong> and  the aggressive <strong>Abarth</strong>. All three  trims are powered by a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. It produces  160 horsepower in Classica and Lusso trims and 164 hp in the Abarth, and 184  pound-feet of torque in all three. Power goes to the rear wheels through either  a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed automatic. </p>]

[<p>The  Fiat's base <strong>Classica</strong> trim offers  little more than the necessities. Buyers get 16-inch wheels, air-conditioning,  a height-adjustable driver seat, cruise control, a manual tilt-adjustable  steering wheel, and a four-speaker stereo system with a 3-inch display screen  and Bluetooth phone connectivity. Pleasantly, the Classica also comes with  keyless entry, pushbutton start, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift  knob.</p>, <p>One  package is available for the Spider Classica: the Technology and SiriusXM Group  package. This adds a rearview camera, proximity entry, rear parking sensors,  and an upgraded infotainment system with a 7-inch screen, voice controls,  streaming music app integration, satellite radio and GPS capability. (GPS  navigation is a separate dealer add-on.)</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>Lusso</strong> trim gets you  17-inch wheels, automatic headlights, foglights, automatic windshield wipers, a  rearview camera, automatic climate control, and leather-upholstered and heated  seats, along with the 7-inch infotainment system and all its features. </p>, <p>Fiat  offers several packages for the Lusso. The Comfort and Convenience Group  includes heated auto-dimming mirrors, rear parking sensors, a security alarm,  universal garage door opener, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert. Opting for the Navigation and Sound Group adds navigation and a  nine-speaker Bose stereo system. The Visibility Group adds turn-swiveling LED  headlights and headlight washers. </p>, <p>There's  also the Lusso Red Top Edition, which comes with a red convertible top, 17-inch  wheels, Bose audio, the adaptive LED headlights and navigation. </p>, <p>The  Fiat 124 Spider <strong>Abarth</strong> gets a  performance-tuned suspension and a limited-slip differential, along with a  driving mode selector with Sport and Normal modes, leather and  microfiber-trimmed seats, and a handful of unique interior and exterior styling  cues. The most notable option is the upgrade to Brembo brakes.</p>, <p>The  Comfort and Convenience, Navigation and Sound, and Visibility packages are all  available, as are Recaro seats.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Fiat 124 Spider Lusso</strong> (turbo 1.4L inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 124 Spider has received some  revisions to the distribution of options in its packages. Our findings remain  applicable to this year's 124 Spider.</p>]

[<p>Compact crossover SUVs and wagons are all  about extracting the maximum amount of passenger and cargo room from an  inherently small package. Generally, style rarely plays a part in this price-  and utility-conscious class. The 2018 Fiat 500L bucks convention by wrapping  its roomy cabin in a body that looks like a supersize version of the Fiat 500  city car. The uniquely Italian design brings a bit of flair to this  conservative class, and 2018 model's new front and rear fascias give it an  updated look compared to previous model years.</p>, <p>Aside from the exterior design, however,  there's not much reason to buy the 500L over one of the other compelling  choices in its class. Significant drawbacks include a harsh ride quality,  uncomfortable seats, compromised outward visibility and overall poor build  quality.</p>, <p>Fiat offers another small crossover, the  500X, and it's the superior choice. The 500X doesn't offer as much interior  space, but it's more enjoyable to drive, has a more upscale interior and gives  you the option of all-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Though the 2018 Fiat 500L isn't a  terrible car in its own right, we suggest going with a competing wagon,  hatchback or crossover SUV instead.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Fiat 500L is a four-door compact  wagon that competes against a small group of like-minded wagons and hatchbacks,  as well as some compact crossovers. Fiat offers it in three trim levels: the  base <strong>Pop,</strong> the<strong> </strong>midlevel <strong>Trekking </strong>and  the loaded-up <strong>Lounge</strong>.</p>]

[<p>Every Fiat 500L is powered by a  turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine (160 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of  torque) that powers the front wheels through a six-speed automatic  transmission.</p>, <p>The base-level <strong>Pop </strong>comes with 16-inch alloy wheels, daytime running lights, heated  mirrors, tinted windows, remote locking and unlocking, a rearview camera, air  conditioning, cruise control, height-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 60/40-split folding rear seats that slide  fore and aft, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker audio system  with two USB ports (one is charge-only) and smartphone compatibility via Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto. </p>, <p>The Popular Equipment Group adds rear  parking sensors, dual-zone climate control, two-way power lumbar adjustment for  the driver (the Trekking also adds manual lumbar for the passenger) and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Pop's Premium Group includes those features  plus satellite radio, a navigation system and a seven-speaker BeatsAudio  system.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>Trekking </strong>level adds 17-inch wheels, foglights, unique body panels  and trim with a rugged theme, LED ambient interior lighting, leather  upholstery, heated front seats, a rear-seat armrest and the BeatsAudio system,  navigation and satellite radio from the Premium Group package. It is also  available with the Popular Equipment Group.</p>, <p>The top-trim <strong>Lounge</strong> equips the 500L with 17-inch alloy wheels with a painted  finish, chrome exterior mirrors and body accents, and the contents of the  Popular Equipment Group.</p>, <p>A panoramic sunroof, matte black finish  wheels, a spare tire, and color combinations that match the roof and exterior mirrors  are other available options, depending on trim level. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar.

[<p>When Fiat started selling cars again in  the United States just a few years ago, the company wasted no time  distinguishing itself. Its first car was the 500, a charismatic and stylish  alternative to other subcompact cars. More recently, Fiat has expanded its  lineup with the 500X. The 2018 500X is just as affordable as other pint-sized  crossovers, but its Fiat 500-inspired exterior design, high-quality interior  materials, and good use of interior space are enough to make this one of our  favorites in the class.</p>, <p>From a broad perspective, it might be  difficult to choose between the 500X and the other crossover in Fiat's lineup,  the 500L. That car is slightly larger than the 500X, offers more passenger and  cargo room, and costs about the same. However, the 500X is more versatile,  offers optional all-wheel drive, and can be had with a wealth of advanced  driver aids that aren't available for the 500L. The 500X's interior is  decidedly more attractive, and it feels more nimble while cornering. </p>, <p>There are a few downsides to the 500X,  such as lackluster fuel economy. But overall the 2018 Fiat 500X is a smart  pick, especially if you want an affordable small crossover with some flair.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Fiat 500X is a subcompact crossover SUV available in three trim levels: <strong>Pop</strong>, <strong>Trekking</strong> and <strong>Lounge</strong>. </p>]

[<p>The  Pop model comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission paired to a  turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine (160 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of  torque). Optional for the Pop and standard on the Trekking and Lounge is a  2.4-liter four-cylinder (180 hp, 175 lb-ft) mated to a nine-speed automatic.  Front-wheel drive is standard across the board, though all-wheel drive is  available on models equipped with the 2.4-liter engine.</p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the <strong>Pop </strong>trim includes  16-inch steel wheels, full power accessories, heated mirrors, remote locking  and unlocking, a rearview camera, cruise control, air conditioning, a driver  information display, height-adjustable front seats, a fold-flat front passenger  seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker sound system with a USB port  and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality. Remote engine start, a center  armrest, and keyless entry and ignition are included if the 2.4-liter engine is  ordered. All-wheel-drive models also get 17-inch alloy wheels and adjustable  driving modes.</p>, <p>Optional  for the Pop is the Popular Equipment package, which adds alloy wheels, rear  parking sensors, a leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel, front and  rear floor mats,a center armrest, a  six-speaker audio system, satellite radio and an additional USB port (charging  only).</p>, <p>The <strong>Trekking </strong>model gets the larger  engine and all of the above features (minus the parking sensors), along with  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, foglights, rear privacy glass, an  upgraded information display, adjustable drive modes, upgraded cloth upholstery  and a removable, height-adjustable cargo floor panel.</p>, <p>A  Popular Equipment package is also available for the Trekking, adding roof  rails, dual-zone climate control, ambient interior lighting, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat (with four-way power lumbar adjustment) and a  four-way power passenger seat. The Cold Weather package adds a windshield  de-icer, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. A navigation system is  available as a stand-alone option.</p>, <p>The  Lounge<strong> </strong>includes all of the above  options plus chrome exterior trim, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, an  eight-speaker audio system and a rear cargo cover.</p>, <p>Two  more packages are available on both Trekking and Lounge models. The Advanced  Safety package adds automatic high-beam control, automatic wipers, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a forward collision warning system  with automatic braking, rear parking sensors, and lane departure warning and  intervention. The Premium<strong> </strong>package  adds 18-inch wheels, a dual-pane sunroof and a nine-speaker Beats premium audio  system. You can also get leather seating for the Trekking and Lounge as a  stand-alone option.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our first drive of  the <strong>2016 Fiat 500X Lounge</strong> (2.4L  inline-4 | 9-speed automatic | FWD)</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 500X has received some revisions,  including this year's standard rearview camera, new touchscreen with an updated  interface, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality. Our findings  remain applicable to this year's 500X.</p>]

[<p>Born  from the size-sensitive European market, where even compacts must haul families  and cargo, the Ford C-Max packs plenty of capability into its small size. It  has a bit of a crossoverlike look to it, but it's more accurate to think of it  as a compact wagon or hatchback that's big enough for large tasks yet small and  easy to manage for around-town driving.</p>, <p>This generation C-Max has been around for a while, but there's still a lot to  like, including refined ride and handling and a comfortable interior done up in  high-quality materials. A 2.0-liter engine and electric motor combine to  produce 188 horsepower and about 40 mpg in combined city and highway driving.  You can also get a plug-in hybrid version with a larger battery called the  C-Max Energi.</p>, <p>It's  worth noting that the C-Max Hybrid's powertrain doesn't deliver fuel economy as  high as the mpg figures from some newer rivals. The latest Prius returns up to  56 mpg, for example, and the Hyundai Ioniq tops out at 58 mpg. Kia's new Niro,  which has a body design similar to the C-Max's, also bests it with a 50 mpg  rating. For most buyers, though, the 2018 Ford C-Max Hybrid should serve well  as a versatile and reasonably efficient vehicle.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford C-Max Hybrid is a five-passenger wagon available in two trim levels.  The <strong>SE </strong>is priced for the  budget-minded, but it's still very functional. <strong>Titanium</strong> models feature luxury accoutrements. A plug-in hybrid  version, the Ford C-Max Energi, is reviewed separately.</p>]

[<p>No  matter which C-Max variant you buy, it'll come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder  gasoline engine paired with an electric motor powered by a lithium-ion battery  pack. Combined output is 188 horsepower. Power is then sent to the front wheels  through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).</p>, <p>The <strong>SE</strong> model's list of standard  equipment includes 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, a  power-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a  leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a rearview camera, a  110-volt, household-style power outlet, Bluetooth, voice commands, a 4.2-inch  central display screen, smartphone app integration (including Pandora internet  radio), and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, a USB interface and  satellite radio.</p>, <p>Major  options are now grouped into packages, starting with the SE Driver Assist  package that bundles a power liftgate, rear parking sensors, and the Sync 3  interface with an 8-inch touchscreen, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and an extra  USB port. The SE Comfort package adds heated mirrors, leather seating  upholstery, a power-adjustable front passenger seat and heated front seats.  Alternately, go for the Cold Weather package for just the heated mirrors and  heated front seats. A panoramic glass roof, keyless entry keypad and a  navigation system are available as stand-alone options.</p>, <p>The <strong>Titanium </strong>model adds foglights,  automatic wipers, the heated mirrors and seats, leather upholstery, the  power-adjustable front passenger seat, keyless ignition and entry, remote  start, ambient lighting, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a premium Sony  audio system with nine speakers and HD radio.</p>, <p>The Titanium Driver Assist package includes front parking sensors, a hands-free  liftgate, a blind-spot monitoring system and automated parallel parking. The  panoramic glass roof, a keyless entry keypad and a voice-controlled navigation  system are offered as stand-alone options as well.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test  of the <strong>2013 Ford C-Max SEL Hybrid </strong>(2.0L  inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current C-Max has received some revisions  centered around the infotainment system with the addition of Sync 3. Our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's C-Max Hybrid.</p>]

[<p>Get ready for another crossover SUV in  Ford's lineup. Eyeing the burgeoning success of subcompacts such as the  Chevrolet Trax and the Honda HR-V, Ford has dipped into its global cache to  bring you the 2018 EcoSport.</p>, <p>Already on sale in other countries, the  EcoSport is indeed a small utility vehicle — it's nearly a  foot-and-a-half shorter than the Escape. Inside, you'll notice the difference  in cargo capacity. The Escape boasts 34 cubic feet of space behind the rear  seats, while the EcoSport makes do with just 20.9 cubic feet (about 2 cubes  fewer than a Focus hatchback). Among pint-size crossovers, though, the  EcoSport's cargo area is actually one of the largest in its class.</p>, <p>Ford has you covered if you're looking  for the latest entertainment technology. Almost all EcoSport trim levels are  equipped with a large central touchscreen powered by the excellent Sync 3  infotainment system featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.  Unfortunately, there's not as much a priority on advanced safety equipment  — a standard rearview camera and optional blind-spot monitor are the  only modern-day driver aids you'll find.</p>, <p>Another possible downside is the  EcoSport's available engines. A turbocharged three-cylinder with front-wheel  drive is standard, while a slightly more powerful four-cylinder is paired with  all-wheel drive. We've tested the three-cylinder in a Fiesta and Focus in the  past and, to be frank, it's slow. A Focus powered by this engine took a  lethargic 10.6 seconds to accelerate from a stop to 60 mph. It's going to be  even pokier in the larger, heavier EcoSport, especially if you have passengers  in tow. Performance gains with the four-cylinder might be a wash considering  the added weight of the AWD powertrain.</p>, <p>Overall, though, the EcoSport looks to be  a viable pick for a subcompact crossover SUV in 2018.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford EcoSport is a five-passenger subcompact crossover that slots below  the Escape in Ford's SUV lineup. The EcoSport <strong>S</strong> is pretty well equipped, with available all-wheel drive and most  basic amenities you will want from a modern car. The <strong>SE </strong>is quite a bit pricier, but its list of added features is  extensive. From there, buyers can go in one of two ways: the sport-themed <strong>SES </strong>— adding the EcoSport's  upgraded engine and standard all-wheel drive — or the luxurious  Titanium, with leather upholstery and a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium sound  system.</p>]

[<p>EcoSport  S, SE and Titanium models with front-wheel drive are powered by a turbocharged  1.0-liter three-cylinder engine (123 horsepower, 125 pound-feet of torque).  Optional for those models and standard on the SES is all-wheel drive and a  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (166 hp, 149 lb-ft). Both engines are paired to  a six-speed automatic transmission. </p>, <p>The  short list of standard equipment on the base <strong>S </strong>model is indicative of its modest price. Features include 16-inch  alloy wheels, automatic headlights, hill start assist, remote locking and  unlocking, full power accessories, a rearview camera, air conditioning, cruise  control, a driver information display, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  height-adjustable front seats, 60/40-split rear seats, a cargo cover, a  removable cargo floor panel, front floor mats, Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch central  display screen, and a six-speaker audio system with two USB ports.</p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>SE </strong>equips the EcoSport with LED  running lights, foglights, body-colored exterior accents, roof rails, rear  privacy glass, rear parking sensors, a sunroof, keyless entry and ignition,  dual-zone automatic climate control, an upgraded driver information display, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a six-way power-adjustable  driver seat (with manual lumbar), heated front seats, upgraded cloth  upholstery, rear floor mats, a 6.5-inch touchscreen with the Sync 3 interface,  satellite radio, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.  Seventeen-inch wheels are available as a stand-alone option.</p>, <p>The  SE's optional Convenience<strong> </strong>package  further adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, interior  ambient lighting, a navigation system, an 8-inch touchscreen, a seven-speaker  audio system and a 110-volt household-style power outlet.</p>, <p>The <strong>SES</strong> is the somewhat sporty variant.  It has the contents of the Convenience package and the 2.0-liter engine/AWD  combo, along with 17-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, black exterior  styling elements, automatic wipers, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, steering  wheel-mounted shift paddles, leather upholstery with cloth inserts, and  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The  luxe <strong>Titanium </strong>builds off the  contents of the SE with Convenience package, further adding 17-inch wheels,  body-colored bumpers, heated mirrors, automatic wipers, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, leather upholstery, blind-spot monitoring, and a 10-speaker  Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system with HD radio.</p>, <p>A  Cold Weather package is available on all trims except the S, adding the heated  mirrors, a heated steering wheel, a windshield wiper de-icer and floor mats. A  keyless entry keypad and remote engine start are stand-alone options on every  trim level.</p>]

[<p>Finding  a SUV that's great for family duty but is still easy to drive and pleasing to  own can be tough, but the 2018 Ford Edge may fit the bill. Though it might not  have the third row of a larger SUV, the Edge still has plenty of cargo space  and passenger space. It's also still relatively easy to park and gets superior  fuel economy compared to those larger models. </p>, <p>Three  engines are available: a base fuel-efficient, turbocharged EcoBoost  four-cylinder, a smooth V6 optional on the SEL and Titanium, and a muscular  twin-turbo V6 found on the Edge Sport. All-wheel drive is optional on all but  the Sport (where it's standard), and all trims feature the same six-speed  automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Inside,  the Edge can be fitted with all sorts of convenience and luxury-oriented  features. The optional Sync 3 infotainment system effortlessly integrates your  smartphone's mapping and communication capabilities to your car, and available  driver assist functions include adaptive steering and cruise control,  blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning and active park assist. </p>, <p>Along  with vehicles such as the GMC Acadia and Kia Sorento, we think the 2018 Ford  Edge is a smart pick for a midsize CUV.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford Edge is midsize crossover SUV that can seat five. It's offered in  four trims: <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong>, <strong>Titanium</strong> and <strong>Sport</strong>. </p>]

[<p>For  powertrains, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engine (245  horsepower, 275 pound-feet of torque) is standard on SE, SEL and Titanium  models, with a 3.5-liter V6 (280 hp, 250 lb-ft) option available on SEL and  Titanium trims. Both engines have a six-speed transmission and standard  front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional. The top-level Sport model gets  its own sporty turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 (315 hp, 350 lb-ft), a six-speed transmission  and AWDe.</p>, <p>Standard  features of the <strong>SE </strong>model include  18-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, rear privacy glass, remote locking  and unlocking, air-conditioning, 60/40-split folding and reclining rear  seatbacks, a 4.2-inch central display screen, a height-adjustable driver seat,  a rearview camera, Bluetooth, voice controls, and a six-speaker sound system  with a CD player and a USB port.</p>, <p>The <strong>SEL </strong>adds LED headlight accents,  heated exterior mirrors, rear parking sensors, an exterior keyless entry pad,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror, dual-zone automatic climate control, upgraded  cloth upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The SEL is available with Equipment Group 201A, which adds leather upholstery,  heated front seats, a nine-speaker audio system, and the Sync 3 infotainment  system with an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration, and an additional USB port.</p>, <p>The <strong>Titanium </strong>gets the above  equipment as standard plus 19-inch wheels, a hands-free liftgate,  noise-reducing front windows, upgraded interior trim, ambient interior  lighting, front sport seats, driver-seat memory settings, and a 12-speaker Sony  audio system with HD radio.</p>, <p>To the Titanium's equipment roster, the Edge <strong>Sport </strong>adds the aforementioned turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 engine,  20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, unique front and rear styling,  variable-ratio steering, a power-adjustable steering wheel, sport-themed  interior trim and perforated leather and simulated-suede upholstery.</p>, <p>Some of the fancier standard items are available on lower trim levels as  options. Depending on the trim level, other options (which may be bundled into  packages) to be on the lookout for include a navigation system, ventilated  front seats, a panoramic sunroof, xenon headlights, bigger wheels, a rear-seat  entertainment system and a 12-speaker sound system. The Edge can also be  equipped with extra safety features that include forward collision warning, a  lane departure warning and intervention system, blind-spot monitoring,  automatic wipers, second-row outboard inflatable seat belts, a 180-degree front  camera and an automated parking system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Ford Edge Titanium </strong>(turbo  2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Ford Edge has received some  revisions to the infotainment system.

[<p>Shopping for a small crossover presents a dizzying array of options, but the  Ford Escape is a smart choice among a crop of great contenders. It offers a  choice of three engines, an impressive voice-command interface, and cargo space  that ranks near the top of the class. After a thorough update last year, the  2018 Escape offers a new trim level that bridges the gap between standard and  luxury models. </p>, <p>The Escape offers optional all-wheel drive,  respectable fuel economy, cargo space that ranks near the top of the class  (only Toyota and Honda offer more) and an available hands-free power liftgate.  You can outfit the Escape from comfortable casual (SE trim with no options) to  rugged luxury (a loaded Titanium model that can breach $40,000). On the road,  its agility instills a level of driver confidence that's rare in this class. </p>, <p>After a more comprehensive update last year that  introduced a new four-cylinder engine and improved things such as smartphone  integration (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto were introduced) and small-item  storage (the lever-mounted parking brake was replaced with a button), the 2018  Escape now offers a SEL trim level that bridges the gap between the more  mainstream SE model and the luxury fixings of the Titanium. </p>, <p>Overall, the Escape excels in some areas and falls  short in others. With its turbo four-cylinder, quick (if twitchy) steering, and  tight suspension, the Escape is one of the more engaging compact SUVs to drive,  only outmatched by the Mazda CX-5. Large cargo space and an excellent tech  interface are other advantages. On the other hand, the Escape isn't quite as  refined as the Honda or Mazda, its "fun" engine is only available on  its top trim level, and that "fun" engine doesn't return particularly  impressive fuel economy. But generally we think the 2018 Escape's qualities  outweigh its flaws and deserves a close look from anyone interested in a  compact SUV. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Escape is a compact crossover SUV that comes in <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong> and <strong>Titanium</strong> trim levels. The <strong>S</strong> is fairly bare-bones, so we expect most buyers will want to start their search  with an <strong>SE</strong>, which offers an upgraded  engine, nicer wheels, a power-adjustable driver seat and more available  options. The new-for-2018 <strong>SEL</strong> trim  level adds more convenience features while the top-trim <strong>Titanium </strong>adds luxury touches and an even more powerful engine.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>S </strong>starts with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder  engine (168 horsepower, 170 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed automatic  transmission and front-wheel drive. Standard features include 17-inch steel  wheels, automatic headlights, MyKey parental controls, cruise control,  air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable  driver seat, a 60/40-split folding and reclining rear seat, a 4.2-inch central  display, a rearview camera, the Sync tech interface with <a href="//owner.ford.com/how-tos/sync-technology/sync/applink/sync-applink-overview.html" target="_blank">AppLink smartphone  integration</a>,  Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and a USB port. Note  that this model is generally aimed at business fleet buyers and may not be easy  to find on your local dealer's lot. </p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>SE</strong> adds 17-inch alloy wheels  (optional on the S), added chrome exterior trim, sound-reducing window glass, a  turbocharged 1.5-liter engine (179 hp, 177 lb-ft), roof rails, foglights, a  keyless entry keypad, rear privacy glass, dual-zone automatic climate control,  steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, rear air vents, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat (with power lumbar adjustment), heated front  seats, upgraded cloth upholstery, a rear center armrest and satellite radio. </p>, <p>Optional  on the <strong>SE </strong>is all-wheel drive and a  Sport Appearance package that adds black 19-inch wheels, black-painted exterior  trim, LED daytime running lights, paddle shifters, partial leather upholstery,  and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The optional Sync 3 tech  package includes an 8-inch touchscreen, enhanced voice controls, Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto, Sync Connect (includes remote app services and onboard Wi-Fi)  and a nine-speaker sound system with dual USB ports. A panoramic sunroof, roof  rail crossbars, a navigation system, and a tow package rated up to 2,000 pounds  are also optional. </p>, <p>The <strong>SEL </strong>bundles all SE equipment and adds a  power liftgate, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, leather  upholstery, power-adjustable side mirrors with heating, rear parking sensors  and the Sync 3 tech interface. Eighteen-inch wheels are optional on the SEL,  along with all of the options available for the SE trim. </p>, <p>At the top  of the lineup is the <strong>Titanium. </strong>It<strong> </strong>bundles all SEL features but adds a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (245 hp, 275 lb-ft), a six-speed  automatic transmission, 18-inch wheels, a hands-free power liftgate, keyless  entry and ignition, remote start, ambient interior lighting, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, xenon headlights, heated and 10-way power-adjustable front  seats, driver-seat memory settings, a 110-volt, household-style power outlet,  and additional 12-volt power outlets. Also standard are a navigation system, a  10-speaker Sony audio system with HD radio, front and rear parking sensors, and  an automated parallel and perpendicular parking feature (which includes front  and side parking sensors). </p>, <p>Titanium  options are similar to SEL options, with the exception of optional 19-inch  wheels and an uprated tow package capable of pulling up to 3,500 pounds.</p>, <p>A Safe and Smart package is available for the <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SEL </strong>and <strong>Titanium </strong>trims, and it includes  adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency  braking, automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert, lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic wipers.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our test of the 2013 Ford  Escape Titanium AWD (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current generation Escape has been updated  with new infotainment features and driver aids. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Escape, however. </p>]

[<p>More  rugged than a typical three-row crossover, the 2018 Ford Expedition, a  traditional truck-based SUV, is a top pick if you need a vehicle that can haul  families, toys or both. It seats up to eight people, has a powerful  turbocharged V6 engine and can tow more than 9,000 pounds.</p>, <p>Available  in three trim levels, each with multiple options, the Expedition can be  seasoned to taste and made as modern as any family sedan. Its expansive  interior gets a welcome update this year with more modern-looking vents, dials  and faceplates, addressing our earlier complaint about inferior trim elements  in an otherwise sharp setting. The cabin matches the relative serenity of the  Expedition's ride as well, which delivers a surprising amount of comfort and  stability. </p>, <p>The  Expedition's more powerful turbocharged V6 engine this year (375 horsepower, or  400 hp for the Platinum trim) also gives the SUV impressive gusto and makes it  one of the quickest in the class. We tested an earlier Expedition — a  four-wheel-drive, long-wheelbase model, no less — and clocked it from  zero to 60 mph in 7 seconds. And that was before this year's power increase.  Fuel economy estimates haven't been released yet, but last year's Expedition  returned between 16 and 18 mpg combined. The new 10-speed automatic  transmission should help elevate both fuel economy and acceleration. </p>, <p>There  aren't many traditional body-on-frame, full-size SUVs that compete with the  Expedition. The Chevrolet Suburban and its GMC Yukon mechanical twin are the  most obvious rivals. Both have lower towing capacity and less cargo space, but  they can seat nine passengers. </p>, <p>The Toyota  Sequoia is another strong candidate with similar fundamental capabilities, but  we've found the Sequoia simply isn't as well-equipped or modern as the Ford and  Chevy. The Nissan Armada is a dark horse, recently updated with a new V8 engine  and an impressive suite of safety features. </p>, <p>In the  end, if you need seven- or eight-passenger seating, a lot of towing capacity  and a lot of room, the 2018 Ford Expedition is a great choice. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Ford Expedition is available in three trim levels: <strong>XLT</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>. The <strong>XLT</strong> offers a balanced mix of comfort and utility, and plenty of  available options, while <strong>Limited</strong> models introduce premium elements such as leather upholstery, driver safety  aids and a Wi-Fi hotspot as standard equipment. The top-trim <strong>Platinum</strong> loads on the luxury with  features including 22-inch wheels, a panoramic sunroof, and a group of driver  assistance features such as adaptive cruise control and a self-parking system. </p>]

[<p>An  extended-wheelbase Expedition, which has a bigger cargo area, is called the <strong>Max. </strong>It's available for the XLT and  Limited.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLT </strong>starts with a turbocharged 3.5-liter  V6 engine (375 horsepower, 470 pound-feet of torque) paired to a 10-speed  automatic transmission and a choice of rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Standard  equipment includes seating for eight passengers, 18-inch alloy wheels, running  boards, roof rack rails, rear parking sensors, push-button ignition, a rearview  camera, rear parking sensors, heated side mirrors, air-conditioning, a six-way  power driver seat (with manual recline), power-adjustable pedals, a sliding and  reclining 40/20/40-split second-row seat, and a "one-touch"  60/40-split fold-flat third-row seat. </p>, <p>There's  also a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, Ford's Sync voice-control system, a 4.2-inch central display,  second-row USB charging ports, Bluetooth connectivity, and a nine-speaker sound  system with CD player, satellite radio, USB interface, auxiliary jack and rear  audio controls.</p>, <p>The XLT  offers two optional packages: 201A and 202A. The 201A package adds first- and  second-row leather upholstery, eight-way power-adjustable front seats (with  two-way power lumbar), and a power-folding third-row seat.</p>, <p>The 202A  package builds on those items with a hands-free power liftgate, chrome running  boards, keyless entry, remote engine start, power-folding mirrors (with a  driver-side auto-dimming mirror), heated and ventilated front seats,  driver-position memory settings, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a  heated steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient cabin  lighting, the Sync 3 tech interface with an 8-inch touchscreen, Sync Connect  (which includes a Wi-Fi hotspot and wireless phone charging), a 110-volt  household style outlet, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include 20-inch wheels, roof rail crossbars, a panoramic sunroof, a  navigation system, a heavy-duty trailer tow package, and a suite of driver  assistance features (adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and  intervention, forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, auto high  beams and automatic wipers). </p>, <p>An FX4 4x4  Off-Road package adds trail-ready components such as all-terrain tires,  off-road shocks, a 3.73 limited-slip rear axle and skid plates.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> trim bundles the features from  the 202A package and adds 20-inch wheels, front parking sensors, roof rack  rails, retractable running boards, heated second-row seats, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, and a premium Bang &amp; Olufsen 12-speaker audio system with  HD radio. </p>, <p>Like the  XLT, the Limited offers two optional packages, 301A and 302A. The former includes  the panoramic sunroof, navigation and the driver assistance features listed  above, while the latter tacks on 22-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers,  LED headlights and foglights, a 360-degree view parking camera, and an  automated parking system. </p>, <p>Many of  these features are available as stand-alone options, as are second-row leather  captain's chairs (reduces seating capacity to seven) and a rear-seat  entertainment system (with dual headrest-mounted displays). The new-for-2018  Special Edition package bundles the heavy-duty tow package, the self-parking  system, and the LED headlights and foglights. </p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Platinum</strong> trim builds on the  Limited and 302A features with interior wood accents, enhanced front seats with  massage function, upgraded leather for the steering wheel, leather door trim  and active noise cancellation. Options mirror those of the Limited. Notably,  the Platinum also offers increased horsepower (400 hp) and torque (480 lb-ft).</p>]

[<p>When Ford introduced the current generation of the Explorer back in 2011, it  switched from the Explorer's traditional body-on-frame construction to a more  carlike unibody. In so doing, the Explorer more fully (and smartly) embraced  its role as daily family transport, delivering better road manners and much  more refinement.</p>, <p>The  Explorer is now entering the eighth model year of its current generation, yet  it is still competitive. In the meantime, deciding on a three-row crossover SUV  has gotten even harder. Today, the Explorer doesn't have the biggest cargo  capacity in its class, and its third-row seat isn't tremendously spacious. </p>, <p>While  we give the Sport trim level a solid thumbs-up, other trim levels aren't quite  as impressive to drive, exhibiting more ponderous routine handling that makes  the Explorer feel bigger than it is. Under the hood is your choice of one of  three engines: a V6, a turbocharged four-cylinder or a turbocharged V6. Of the  three, we like the turbocharged V6 the most. It delivers terrific thrust, which  you'll like for highway passing and towing, but unfortunately it's only  available with the more expensive trim levels.</p>, <p>Overall,  though, the 2018 Ford Explorer gets most things right, and we see it as a  respectable choice for a three-row midsize SUV. </p>]

[<p>There are five different ways to configure your 2018 Ford  Explorer: the <strong>base</strong>, <strong>XLT</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong>, <strong>Sport </strong>and <strong>Platinum</strong> trim levels, which cover a  broad swath of features. The base, XLT and Limited models are available in  front-wheel or all-wheel drive, while the Sport and Platinum are offered solely  with all-wheel drive. Regardless of trim level, every Explorer is equipped with  a six-speed automatic transmission. For 2018, many driver assistance features  (adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane  departure warning and intervention, automatic wipers and automatic high beams)  have been grouped together into a single options package.</p>]

[<p><strong>Base </strong>models, predictably, sit at the very bottom of the  Explorer range. These models have 18-inch wheels, cloth upholstery and manually  adjustable front seats, though a rearview camera and Sync voice commands spruce  up things a bit.</p>, <p>The<strong> XLT </strong>trim level is one rung up the ladder, adding a few standard features  over the base trim level and desirable options that aren't available on base  variants at all. With its balance between features and value, a well-equipped  XLT will be a popular version of the Explorer. A non-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6  (290 horsepower, 255 pound-feet of torque) is standard on the base and XLT  variants, while a 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (280 hp, 310 lb-ft of  torque) is available as an option.<br> <strong> </strong><br>  Buyers  who want to amp things up will be attracted to the <strong>Limited</strong> model, which adds leather upholstery, heated and ventilated  front seats, power-adjustable pedals, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, premium audio and power-folding third-row seats. Note that the Limited  comes standard with the turbocharged four-cylinder engine, but you can still  get the regular V6 if you want.</br></br></p>, <p>While  those additional comfort items are desirable, we're partial to the <strong>Sport</strong> variant's more fundamental changes.  These models come with a powerful turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 (365 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque),  firmer suspension tuning and a towing package. </p>, <p>It's possible to get the turbocharged V6  paired to the softer suspension of non-Sport models by going for the top-of-the-line <strong>Platinum </strong>trim level. It comes with a  panoramic sunroof, an automated parking system, premium leather upholstery, a  premium audio system and more.</p>]

[<p>There  are typically multiple versions of each vehicle, although many aspects are  shared. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Ford Explorer Sport</strong> (turbo 3.5L V6  | 6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Explorer has received a new  infotainment system and minor revisions to feature availability. Our findings  remain applicable to this year's Explorer.</p>]

[<p>Today's  Ford F-150 offers the performance and power that personal and professional  truck buyers require. Under the hood, the F-150 offers a choice of four  different engine options, fuel economy of up to 22 mpg combined, and towing  capacity rated up to 10,800 pounds. The F-150 also boasts a refined, modern  touch with a well-crafted interior and helpful tech such as the Pro Trailer  Backup Assist system, which allows you to control trailer direction via a dial  on the dashboard. There's also the F-150's impressively quick Sync 3  infotainment system and amenities that range from utilitarian to luxury.  Aluminum body panels and an aluminum bed (rather than traditional steel) help  make the 2018 F-150 the lightest truck in its class, too. </p>, <p>With hundreds of available configurations, you'll  have an easy time finding a 2018 Ford F-150 that meets your needs. Overall it's a comprehensive package  that makes the F-150 one of our favorite trucks on the road. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Ford F-150 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Pickup Trucks">Best Pickup Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>There's a deep catalog of features, options,  packages, engines and bed configurations for the 2018 Ford F-150, starting with six main trim levels: base <strong>XL</strong>, <strong>XLT</strong>, <strong>Lariat</strong>, <strong>King Ranch</strong>, <strong>Platinum </strong>and <strong>Limited</strong>. There's also the  high-performance off-road <strong>Raptor </strong>variant  that exists outside the standard lineup. The XL with the 101A package makes for  a decent work truck, but upgrading to the XLT with the 301A package makes for a  more passenger-friendly pickup. The Lariat is the gateway to the luxury truck  you've been saving for.</p>]

[<p>The Ford  F-150 offers three cab styles — regular, SuperCab (extended) and  SuperCrew (crew cab) — and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.  A standard bed (6 feet 6 inches) or a long bed (8 feet) is available on regular  and SuperCab styles, while the SuperCrew offers either a short bed (5 feet 6  inches) or the standard bed. </p>, <p>Several  engines are also available, starting with a new 3.3-liter V6 engine that makes  290 horsepower and 265 pound-feet of torque. It pairs with a six-speed  automatic transmission. </p>, <p>A  turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 is next (325 hp, 400 lb-ft), followed by a 5.0-liter  V8 (395 hp, 400 lb-ft), then a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 (375 hp, 470 lb-ft)  available in two power grades: 375 hp and 470 lb-ft or 450 hp and 510 lb-ft.  These three engines all pair with a 10-speed automatic transmission. </p>, <p>Standard  features on the base <strong>XL </strong>trim level  include 17-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights, trailer sway control,  pre-wired trailer connections, manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring, a  cloth-upholstered 40/20/40-split front bench, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, a driver information display, air-conditioning, a 4.2-inch central  display screen and a four-speaker radio with an auxiliary jack. SuperCab and  SuperCrew models come with 60/40-split folding rear seats and two additional  speakers, and four-wheel-drive models get front tow hooks.</p>, <p>The  3.3-liter engine is standard on most XL configurations, but some RWD extended-  and crew-cab models require the 2.7-liter V6, and the V8 comes on 4WD versions  of those models.</p>, <p>An  optional 101A package adds power windows and locks (including the tailgate),  power mirrors, remote locking and unlocking, cruise control, Ford's <a href="//owner.ford.com/how-tos/vehicle-features/locks-and-security/mykey.html" target="_blank">MyKey</a> vehicle control feature, a larger  driver information screen, Sync voice controls, Bluetooth, smartphone app  integration, a USB port and a CD player.</p>, <p>   Other XL  add-ons include chrome and sport appearance packages, the FX4 Off-Road package,  side steps, a tailgate assist step, drop-in or spray-in bedliners, remote  vehicle tracking and trailer tow packages with Ford's <a href="//www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixi8K3gNXUAhVBz2MKHYqbAJcQtwIIJjAA&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyQlRR56t-o&amp;usg=AFQjCNHT5lgzyVghtUzG1rkIwv-DsmYLoA" target="_blank">Pro Trailer Backup Assist</a> system (essentially a self-steering  system to simplify backing up with a trailer).</p>, <p>   The <strong>XLT </strong>trim includes features from the XL's  optional 101A package along with alloy wheels, chrome bumpers and exterior  trim, foglights, a keypad entry system, rear privacy glass, carpeting, driver  and passenger seat lumbar adjustments, and additional interior storage bins and  pockets.</p>, <p>   There are  a few options for the XLT. The Mid 301A option package adds heated mirrors, an  auto-dimming driver-side and rearview mirror, a trailer hitch, a cargo management system with  four tie-down cleats, an  eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with power lumbar adjustment),  power-adjustable pedals, rear under-seat storage, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, a rearview camera, and a seven-speaker sound system with satellite  radio. </p>, <p>The Luxury  302A package builds on the above features with rear parking sensors, remote  ignition, heated and 10-way power-adjustable front seats (with power lumbar  adjustment), an 8-inch touchscreen (with Sync 3, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto) and an additional USB port. Notable stand-alone options include box side  steps, a regular sunroof (SuperCab), a panoramic sunroof (SuperCrew),  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, inflatable rear seat  belts, and a navigation system.</p>, <p>When you  step up to the F-150 <strong>Lariat</strong>, many of  the XLT's Luxury 302A features come standard, as do the turbocharged 2.7-liter  engine and 10-speed transmission. Also included are 18-inch wheels, keyless  entry and ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate  control, driver-seat memory settings, ambient lighting, leather upholstery and  ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>   In  addition to many of the options offered on the XLT, the Lariat also offers the  Mid 501A package and Luxury 502A packages. The Mid 501A package adds upgraded  mirrors, remote tailgate release and front-facing spotlights to the features  listed above in the XLT's Luxury 302A package. The Luxury 502A package,  meanwhile, adds LED headlights, automatic wipers, a heated and power-adjustable  steering wheel, front bucket seats, heated rear outboard seats (SuperCrew), a  navigation system, <a href="//owner.ford.com/how-tos/sync-technology/sync-3/sync-connect/sync-connect.html" target="_blank">Sync Connect</a> and an 11-speaker Bang &amp;  Olufsen audio system with HD radio. Other options include lane departure  warning, power-deployable running boards, a surround-view camera system, an  automated parallel parking system, and adaptive cruise control with forward  collision warning and mitigation.</p>, <p>The <strong>King Ranch</strong> trim is only offered as a  SuperCrew and builds on the Luxury 502A package with a Western styling theme  inside and out and with the 5.0-liter V8 underhood. With a bit more  conventional luxury equipment, the <strong>Platinum</strong> trim adds 20-inch wheels, power-deployable running boards, and wood and aluminum  interior trim. Essentially at the top of the range is the F-150 <strong>Limited</strong>, which comes with the  turbocharged 3.5-liter engine, 22-inch wheels, upgraded leather upholstery in  the front, unique styling details and many of the F-150's optional features as  standard.</p>, <p>   The  off-road-focused F-150 <strong>Raptor</strong> uses a  high-output version of the turbocharged 3.5-liter engine (450 hp, 510 lb-ft)  and shares many of the same features as the XLT, but it offers a  reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified long-travel  suspension, flared fenders, skid plates, 17-inch wheels with upgraded off-road  tires, and special interior trim with leather and cloth upholstery. The Raptor  offers many of the same options as the XLT and Lariat as well as a few exterior  styling packages, a Torsen limited-slip front differential and forged,  bead-lock capable wheels.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions,  although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Ford F-150 Lariat Crew Cab Short  Bed </strong>(5.0L V8 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD | 5-foot-6-inch bed).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Ford F-150 has received an upgraded  infotainment system, with Sync 3 replacing MyFord Touch in 2016. A 10-speed  automatic transmission is also now standard with the V8 engine. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's F-150, however.</p>]

[<p>While a standard pickup is good enough  for most people, commercial users and hardcore recreationalists need something  more substantial. The 2018 Ford F-250 Super Duty strikes the balance between  maximum hauling capability and a dose of civility.</p>, <p>The  2018 Ford F-250 Super Duty is the most affordable way to access Ford's Super  Duty trio that also includes the F-350 and F-450. Powered by either a tractable  and responsive gasoline engine or a stump-pulling turbodiesel, the F-250 sends  power to a six-speed automatic transmission and an available four-wheel-drive  drivetrain. </p>, <p>But  these days, a truck is more than just its frame and body, and the F-250  impresses with its available technology. A surround-view camera system allows  drivers to park with inch-perfect precision. There's also an available remote  camera so you can see what's behind a towed trailer. And the F-250's built-in  trailer memory saves individual trailer dimensions, brake gain setting, and  tire-pressure sensor information (if equipped) so frequent towers can swap  trailers with minimal reconfiguration of settings. </p>, <p>Combined  with advanced driver assist features such as adaptive cruise control, an  available leather interior that rivals those found on luxury cars, and Ford's  well-proven Sync 3 infotainment system, the 2018 F-250 is good for any  combination of day-to-day driving, hauling big loads or cruising across the  country.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Ford F-250 Super Duty (including the F-250 Super Duty Diesel) as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Pickup Trucks">Best Pickup Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

It can be configured as a regular cab, an extended cab  (aka SuperCab) or a crew cab with either a 6.8- or a 8.2-foot bed. A 6.2-liter  gasoline V8 produces 385 horsepower and 430 pound-feet of torque, and an  available turbocharged 6.7-liter diesel V8 puts out an impressive 450 hp and  935 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to six-speed automatic  transmissions to drive the rear wheels, though four-wheel drive is offered as  an option. </p>]

[<p>Base <strong>XL </strong>models come standard with  features that include 17-inch steel wheels, manual front locking hubs  (four-wheel-drive models), intermittent wipers, a rearview camera, manually  adjustable telescoping towing mirrors, a removable locking tailgate with  tailgate lift assist, a 2.5-inch trailer hitch receiver with a 2-inch insert.

The XLT also includes cruise control, an alarm system, the Sync  voice-controlled infotainment system, a 4.2-inch display, a USB port, and a CD  player and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Springing  for the midrange <strong>Lariat </strong>trim level  gets you an electronic shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system  (four-wheel-drive models only), power-folding and telescoping outside mirrors  plus driver-side auto-dimming and integrated spotlights, tubular side steps, a  power-sliding rear window, and rear parking sensors.

[<p>While a standard pickup is good enough  for most people, commercial users and recreationalists with heavy trailers need  something more substantial. The 2018 Ford F-350 Super Duty easily meets those  needs and adds a dose of civility as well.</p>, <p>Along  with the F-250 and the F-450 Super Duty trucks, the F-350 received a major  update last year. This new generation is more powerful, stronger and lighter,  and it features more technology and luxury features than before. But  fundamentally, the F-350's role as a heavy-duty truck that blends hauling and  towing prowess with long-distance comfort and utility hasn't changed. </p>, <p>The  frame is made from high-strength steel, while the body panels are lightweight  aluminum. Ford says they're more dent-resistant and hundreds of pounds lighter  than those of the outgoing version, which helps to offset the frame's added  mass. As a bonus, the F-350's cabs are longer than those of the previous  generation, which improves passenger space and comfort.</p>, <p>The  F-350 Super Duty moves down the road with either a 6.2-liter gasoline V8 or a  turbocharged 6.7-liter diesel V8.

[<p>On  paper, the advantage of the 2018 Ford F-450 Super Duty over its sibling, the  F-350, doesn't seem all that significant. In fact, depending on the  configuration, the F-450 can actually have a lower maximum payload weight  rating than an F-350. And that's OK because drivers who frequently tow heavy  loads know there's more to it than numbers.</p>, <p>The  F-450's wider front and rear track, nearly 5 inches up front and over a foot in  the rear, and standard long-bed and crew-cab configuration give this model a  long wheelbase and width to keep tall and bulky trailers at bay. The wider  front track also allows the F-450's front wheels to turn sharper, giving it  surprisingly more maneuverability. Its turning circle is close to that of a  short-wheelbase, regular-cab Super Duty.</p>, <p>In  the interior, the F-450 falls in line with the rest of the Super Duty line,  starting with cloth and benches, going all the way up to two-tone leather with  custom stitching in the new Limited trim. Technology options abound, many of  which are there to help you tow. For example, an updated blind-spot monitoring  system can be configured to cover the length of the trailer; a surround-view  system uses seven cameras to keep tabs on the truck's surroundings; and a  second rearview camera up on top of the cab greatly simplifies fifth-wheel and  gooseneck trailer hookup. Finally an integrated trailer tire-pressure  monitoring system and a backup camera can be affixed to the tail of the trailer  to monitor tire status and ease chores while backing up.</p>, <p>Although  there are other heavy-duty models on the market, the F-450 is the only 1.5-ton  truck that's available as a regular pickup for consumers. GM and Ram have  trucks with similar capabilities, but those are chassis cab-style trucks for  commercial use only. It's important to note that the F-450's capability comes  at a cost. Compared to the still quite capable F-350, for instance, the F-450  is more expensive, uses 19.5-inch commercial tires, and has a less comfortable  ride, especially when unladen. Still, if you've got a massive trailer to tow,  and you want the most capable pickup to pull it, the F-450 is the only game in  town. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a full-size, heavy-duty pickup available in six  trim levels: <strong>XL</strong>, <strong>XLT</strong>, <strong>Lariat</strong>, <strong>King Ranch</strong>, <strong>Platinum</strong>, and <strong>Limited</strong>. It is only available with a crew-cab body, an 8.2-foot bed  and a dual rear-wheel axle. The only available engine is a turbocharged 6.7-liter  diesel V8 that puts out an impressive 450 horsepower and 935 pound-feet of  torque. A six-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive are standard,  and four-wheel drive is optional. </p>]

[<p>Base <strong>XL </strong>models come standard with  19.5-inch commercial tires mounted on polished alloy wheels, black grille and  bumpers, front tow hooks, automatic headlights, LED roof marker lights,  intermittent wipers, manually telescoping towing mirrors, running boards, and a  removable locking tailgate with tailgate lift assist and a 3-inch trailer hitch  receiver (with 2- and 2.5-inch inserts). Inside are air conditioning, vinyl  upholstery, a 40/20/40-split front seat, a 60/40-split rear seat, vinyl floor  covering, manual windows and door locks, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  a dual glovebox, an overhead console with storage bins, a driver information  display, a rearview camera and a six-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>Step  up to the <strong>XLT</strong> and you get a chrome  grille and bumpers, power-adjustable and heated mirrors (they telescope manually),  four locking cleats in the bed, keyless entry, cloth upholstery and carpeting,  rear underseat lockable storage, power windows and locks, rear privacy glass,  cruise control, a rearview camera, the Sync voice-controlled infotainment  system, a 4.2-inch display, a USB charging port, a CD player and satellite  radio.</p>, <p>Springing  for the midrange <strong>Lariat </strong>trim level  gets you foglights, tubular side steps, a power-sliding rear window, rear  parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, and upgraded mirrors,  including power-folding and telescoping side mirrors, driver-side auto dimming,  and integrated LED spotlights. Also in the Lariat are leather upholstery,  power-adjustable front seats with a center console, power-adjustable pedals, a  rear-seat center armrest, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, an 8-inch center  touchscreen, the upgraded Sync 3 voice-controlled infotainment system, two  110-volt household-style power outlets, and a premium Sony 10-speaker audio  system with two additional USB ports.</p>, <p>The  Western-themed <strong>King Ranch </strong>model adds  a body-colored grille, accent-color bumpers and lower body trim, automatic high  beams, automatic wipers, LED box lighting, unique fender badges, keyless  ignition and entry, remote start, upgraded leather upholstery, heated and  ventilated front seats, driver-seat memory settings, an easy entry-and-exit  driver's seat, a power tilt-and-telescoping and heated steering wheel, and a  navigation system.</p>, <p><strong>Platinum </strong>models add adaptive steering, LED  headlights, LED foglights, a remote tailgate release, a built-in tailgate step,  LED taillights, a blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert,  illuminated door scuff plates, multicontour front seats with massage, and a  leather- and wood-trimmed heated steering wheel. </p>, <p>At  the top of the lineup is the new <strong>Limited</strong>.  It's four-wheel-drive only and comes with a surround-view and trailer-towing  camera system, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, a panoramic  sunroof, and a Limited-exclusive two-tone leather interior.</p>, <p>Many  standard features offered on upper trim levels are available as options on the  rest of the lineup. Other noteworthy add-ons include a fifth-wheel/gooseneck  hitch prep package, a separate rearview camera that can be mounted on a  customer's trailer, trailer tire-pressure monitoring and a spray-in bedliner. </p>]

[<p>Available  as a sedan or a hatchback, the 2018 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car worth  checking out. It handles well around corners, offers lots of available features  and, for driving enthusiasts, comes in a high-performance ST version that's a  blast to drive. </p>, <p>Ford  has been selling this generation of the Fiesta since 2011. That's a long time  in the automotive world to go without a full redesign, but the Fiesta's  inherent goodness has kept it in good standing. About the only significant  criticism we can level at it is its lack of space. The back seat is tight and  the cargo space is simply subpar, even for a subcompact. We're also a little  disappointed that Ford has discontinued the Fiesta's optional 1.0-liter,  three-cylinder EcoBoost engine. Previously, this engine offered a significant  boost in fuel economy (up 5 mpg combined from the standard engine). </p>, <p>Overall,  though, we think the 2018 Fiesta is a smart choice for a fun and inexpensive  car. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car offered in two body styles: a sedan and a  four-door hatchback. Both are available in <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>Titanium</strong> trim levels. The high-performance <strong>ST</strong> model is available only as a hatchback. The affordable base S is  modestly equipped, while the SE and Titanium trim levels offer more tech  features, such as the Sync 3 infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto. The high-performance ST comes with a six-speed manual, a sport-tuned  suspension and a strong, turbocharged engine. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>S</strong> starts off with a 1.6-liter  four-cylinder engine (120 horsepower, 112 pound-feet of torque), a five-speed  manual transmission (a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic is available as an  option), 15-inch steel wheels, power mirrors, a rear spoiler (hatchback only),  remote keyless entry, air-conditioning, a height-adjustable driver seat,  60/40-split folding rear seats, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, power  locks, manual windows, Bluetooth, Sync voice controls, a 4.2-inch center  display, a rearview camera, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and  a USB port.</p>, <p>The  Fiesta <strong>SE</strong> builds on the above with  15-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, upgraded cloth upholstery, a front  center console with armrest, power windows, cruise control, chrome interior  door handles, metallic-painted interior trim, multicolor ambient lighting, and  MyKey parental controls for teen drivers.</p>, <p>The  optional SE Appearance package adds 16-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a rear  spoiler (sedan), cloth sport upholstery, adjustable lumbar support for the  driver, a leather-wrapped shift knob (automatic only), the Sync 3 infotainment  interface with a 6.5-inch touchscreen, enhanced voice controls (including Sync  AppLink mobile app integration), satellite radio, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto connectivity, and dual USB ports. The Cold Weather package bundles heated  outside mirrors, heated front seats and automatic climate control.</p>, <p>The <strong>Titanium</strong> trim level incorporates the  contents of the SE Appearance and Comfort packages but wears a different set of  16-inch alloy wheels, further adds chrome exterior trim, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, a trip computer, a black grille and rear parking sensors. It  also has keyless entry and ignition, leather upholstery, a rearview camera, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror and an eight-speaker Sony sound system with HD  radio.</p>, <p>The  Fiesta <strong>ST</strong> hatchback also starts with  the SE's amenities plus the SE Appearance package, and then adds a turbocharged  1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (197 hp, 202 lb-ft), a six-speed manual  transmission, 17-inch wheels with summer performance tires, a sport-tuned  suspension, upgraded brakes, quicker steering, unique bodywork and dual-exhaust  tips. You also get keyless entry and ignition, ST-specific cloth sport seats  (with driver height adjustment), distinctive interior trim, and the Sony sound  system with HD radio. The ST Recaro package adds heated Recaro front sport  seats (including height adjustments), leather and cloth upholstery, and heated  mirrors. Also available are black 17-inch wheels with red brake calipers.</p>, <p>A  sunroof and a navigation system are stand-alone options on the SE, Titanium and  ST trims.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2014 Ford Fiesta Sedan SE </strong>(1.6L  inline-4 | 6-speed dual-clutch automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Ford Fiesta has received some  revisions, including some changes to standard and optional equipment, but  overall our findings from the 2014 model remain broadly applicable to this  year's Ford Fiesta. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Ford Flex is a large crossover/wagon that can seat either six or seven  passengers and is available in <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong> trim levels. The standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 (287  horsepower, 254 pound-feet of torque) that is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission that sends power to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is available  for the SEL and Limited trims. The Limited trim is also eligible for a  turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 (365 hp and 350 lb-ft) with standard all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights for the <strong>SE</strong> trim  include 17-inch wheels, rear parking sensors, heated side mirrors, rear privacy  glass, a keyless-entry keypad, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a six-way power  driver seat (with manual recline), 60/40-split folding second-row seats with an  auto-folding passenger side, 50/50-split folding third-row seats, a rearview  camera, Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch central display  screen, voice controls, and a six-speaker audio system with a CD player and a  USB port.</p>, <p>The <strong>SEL</strong> adds 18-inch wheels, upgraded  brakes, foglights, keyless entry and ignition, remote start, dual-zone  automatic climate control with manual rear controls, wood-appearance interior  trim, heated front seats, a 10-way power driver seat (with power lumbar  adjustment), a six-way power front passenger seat (with manual lumbar  adjustment), and the Sync 3 infotainment system with an 8-inch touchscreen,  satellite radio, a second USB port and smartphone integration via Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The<strong> SEL</strong> trim is eligible for the 202A  options package, which adds a power liftgate, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, power-adjustable pedals, driver-seat memory settings,  leather upholstery (vinyl for the third row), a 110-volt household power outlet  and an upgraded seven-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The  range-topping <strong>Limited</strong> trim includes  all of the above plus 19-inch wheels, xenon headlights, LED taillights,  power-folding mirrors, automatic wipers, additional metallic exterior trim,  upgraded wood interior trim, ambient interior lighting, a navigation system  (optional on SEL) and a 12-speaker Sony premium audio system with HD radio. The  Limited trim is eligible for the 301A package that adds an automatic parallel  parking system, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, a  power-adjustable and heated steering wheel, a 10-way power front passenger  seat, ventilated front seats and power-folding third-row seats.</p>, <p>Additional  options are dependent on trim and include 20-inch wheels, roof rails, a tow  package, a panoramic sunroof, black exterior and interior trim, upgraded  leather upholstery and inflatable second-row outboard seat belts.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford Focus is a well-rounded and competent small car. It's available in a  variety of flavors, including a no-frills commuter machine, a high-performance  hatchback and, yes, even as an EV. </p>, <p>The  core appeal of the 2018 Ford Focus, however, remains its comfortable ride along  with enjoyable handling and a quiet interior. We also like the the available  Sync 3 infotainment system. It's fast and powerful and supports Android Auto  and Apple CarPlay, ensuring your commute won't lack entertainment. </p>, <p>On  the downside, the Focus' rear seating is tighter than its competitors', and the  available 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine's power can seem inadequate when  you're accelerating to highway speeds or passing. Certain rivals best the 2018  Focus in these areas, but we think it's worth a look if you're shopping for a  small sedan or hatchback.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford Focus is a front-wheel-drive compact economy car that is available as  a sedan or hatchback. It comes in a variety of styles and trim levels. The core  starts with the bare-bones <strong>S</strong>, which  is followed by the budget-conscious <strong>SE</strong>,  the well-equipped <strong>SEL</strong> and the  top-of-the-line <strong>Titanium</strong>. Adjacent  to these trims is an electric variant that is called, simply, <strong>Electric</strong>. The performance-oriented <strong>ST</strong> and high-performance <strong>RS</strong>, which have more powerful engines  and aggressive suspension tuning, are reviewed separately. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>S </strong>trim is available only as a  sedan and employs a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (160 horsepower, 146  pound-feet of torque). A five-speed manual transmission is standard, and a  six-speed automatic is optional. </p>, <p>It  comes with 15-inch steel wheels, keyless entry, air-conditioning, a  height-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a rearview camera, a 4.2-inch central  display, power front windows (manual rear windows), power locks and mirrors,  Ford's MyKey (limits speed, audio volume, etc., for young drivers), voice  controls, Bluetooth, a four-speaker sound system and USB port. </p>, <p>One  step up is the <strong>SE</strong>, which is  available as a hatchback or sedan. The hatchback comes with the 2.0-liter  engine and six-speed automatic, while the sedan uses a turbocharged 1.0-liter  three-cylinder engine (123 hp, 125 lb-ft of torque) and a six-speed manual  transmission or a six-speed automatic. </p>, <p>Standard  SE equipment includes 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, power rear windows,  a trip computer, a front center armrest, rear air vents and a six-speaker sound  system. Available options include a Cold Weather package (adds heated mirrors  and heated front seats and steering wheel). SE trims equipped with the  1.0-liter engine have access to an Appearance package that adds different  16-inch wheels, daytime running lights, foglights and black exterior detail elements.  A 17-inch wheel upgrade is also available with this package. <br> <br>  The <strong>SEL </strong>trim is available as a sedan or  hatchback. Standard equipment includes 17-inch wheels, daytime running lights,  foglights, a sunroof, ambient interior lighting, dual-zone automatic climate  control, rear proximity sensors, an 8-inch entertainment screen with Sync 3  (includes Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support), two USB charging ports and a  10-speaker Sony stereo system. Options include the aforementioned Cold Weather  package and navigation with satellite radio.</br></br></p>, <p>The  Focus <strong>Titanium</strong> has the highest level  of standard equipment. Its exterior wears a different style of 17-inch wheel  and chrome exterior trim. The interior gets leather-trimmed seats, four-way  adjustable headrests, eight-way power-adjustable driver seat, a leather-wrapped  shift knob, rear center armrest, seatback map pockets and remote start. While  the Cold Weather package is standard, an optional Titanium Technology package  adds automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring with cross-traffic alert, and  lane departure warning. </p>, <p>As  you might guess, the hatchback-only Focus <strong>Electric </strong>is powered by an electric motor (143 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque) that runs  through a single-speed automatic transmission. EPA-estimated range is 115  miles. It's equipped similarly to the Titanium trim but boasts xenon headlights  and restyled taillights. Leather-trimmed seats are optional.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Ford Focus SE</strong> (turbo 1.0L inline-3  | 6-speed dual-clutch automatic | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Focus has received only minor  revisions.

[<p>The 2018  Ford Focus RS has everything you'd expect from a sports car, including a  high-output engine, super-sticky tires and stout brakes. Certainly, the RS is a  blast to drive. Yet this hatchback also delivers a decent amount of utility.</p>, <p>The Focus  RS fits squarely under the "hot hatch" category of cars, meaning it  combines the utility of a hatchback commuter car with serious performance. But  it also goes beyond more common hot hatches such as the Volkswagen GTI or  Ford's own Focus ST. The RS' turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four makes 350  horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque, while its all-wheel-drive system can  selectively bias power to individual wheels. It even has a drive setting that  allows a tail-out "drifting" style of cornering easier. </p>, <p>This year  marks the final run of this generation Focus RS. To send it off, Ford is  providing a run of only 1,500 cars for North America, each outfitted with  performance-enhancing options such as a front locking differential and  lightweight forged wheels. We suspect this RS is going to be prized by  enthusiasts for a long time to come.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Ford Focus RS is a high-performance hatchback that is available in one fully  loaded trim level. As this is the last year of its production, there are only a  handful of options to choose from. The RS<strong> </strong>employs a turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four (350 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque)  that is connected to a six-speed manual transmission. A torque-vectoring  all-wheel-drive system is standard.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features include keyless entry, 19-inch wheels wrapped in summer tires, a  Quaife limited-slip front differential, LED lights, RS badges throughout, a  high-mounted rear spoiler, carbon-fiber interior accents, dual-zone climate  control, heated front seats, a rearview camera, and Ford's Sync 3 infotainment  system. </p>, <p>Aside from  a moonroof, the Focus RS' options list mostly consists of tire options.  Available Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 2 tires dramatically improve tire grip at a  significant expense of tread life, while the Winter Wheel and Tire package  provides smaller diameter (18-inch) wheels shod with Michelin winter tires. </p>]

[<p>There's something to be said for power  and charisma. The 2018 Ford Focus ST may be just as old as the regular Focus,  sharing most of the same elements that have made that car lose much of its  appeal as newer competitors came along. It's certainly not the newest and  hottest thing around anymore. Yet the Focus ST remains just as much fun as  ever, delivering exactly the same mix of performance, practicality and pizzazz  that first drew us to it five years ago. It's a cool car and always will be.</p>, <p>First and foremost, its 252-horsepower  turbocharged four-cylinder engine continues to be a hoot, thrusting you into  the ST's Recaro sport seats to the tune of a deep warble. All that power goes  through the front wheels only, making it a bit unruly at times, but that's all  part of the fun. We also love the six-speed manual transmission, though  acknowledge that the availability of a dual-clutch automatic (such as  Volkswagen's DSG transmission) would widen its audience. Then there's the ST's  entertaining steering and handling. Yes, it's fun to go quickly in a straight  line, but the ST has corners licked, too. </p>, <p>As for downsides, the ST's relate mostly  to those inherent to the regular Focus' design. The rear seating is cramped,  and the base tech interface is behind the times. Cabin quality also isn't as  impressive as it once was and is overshadowed by the Volkswagen and Honda  competition. Those grippy Recaro seats may also be too confining for drivers of  above-average size. </p>, <p>In total, though, the 2018 Focus ST needs  to be on the shopping list for anyone looking for a powerful, charismatic car  with plenty of practicality at a reasonable price. It was great five years ago  and it's still great today. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Focus ST is a  performance-oriented version of the Focus four-door hatchback. There is no  sedan version. Both the regular Focus and the even hotter Focus RS are reviewed  separately. Every Focus ST comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder  engine (252 hp, 270 lb-ft of torque), a six-speed manual transmission and  front-wheel drive. There is no automatic variant available. There's only one  trim level, though a variety of equipment packages bolster the standard feature  content. </p>]

[<p>Standard equipment includes 18-inch alloy  wheels, summer tires, performance brakes, an electronic limited-slip  differential, hill start assist, automatic headlights, foglights, LED daytime  running lights, an integrated blind-spot mirror, keyless entry and ignition, air-conditioning,  cloth upholstery, front sport seats (with driver height adjustment),  60/40-split folding rear seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, MyKey  parental controls, a rearview camera, a 4.2-inch central display, Bluetooth,  Sync voice controls, and a six-speaker sound system with a USB port.</p>, <p>The ST2 package (aka the 401A Equipment Group) adds xenon headlights, a  sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, cloth and leather upholstery,  Recaro front sport seats, the Sync 3 infotainment interface with an 8-inch  touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone app integration, and a  10-speaker Sony sound system with HD radio, a CD player, satellite radio and  dual USB ports.</p>, <p>The ST3 package (aka the 402A Equipment Group) adds all ST2 items but also  tacks on heated mirrors, a keyless entry keypad, full leather upholstery,  heated front Recaro seats (with eight-way power adjustments for the driver), a  heated steering wheel, a rear center armrest, multicolor ambient interior  lighting, carbon-fiber interior accents and a navigation system.</p>, <p>Stand-alone options include dark gray 18-inch alloy wheels with red-painted  brake calipers, high-performance all-season tires and the navigation system  (requires the ST2 package).</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Ford Focus ST</strong> (turbo 2.0L  inline-4 | 6-speed manual | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Focus ST is now available with  Ford's latest Sync 3 infotainment system (replacing the old MyFord Touch  touchscreen), which we have sampled in other Ford vehicles. Our findings remain  applicable to this year's Focus ST.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Fusion hasn't changed  dramatically in the last few years, and that's a good thing. The Fusion is in a  highly competitive class of midsize sedans, but it continues to impress us with  its comfortable interior, user-friendly tech and great driving dynamics.</p>, <p>The 2018 Fusion would also be lost  in this class if it weren't for its high-quality interior and abundant  available safety equipment. Available items such as adaptive cruise control, an  automated parking system and forward collision mitigation should definitely  appeal to the safety-conscious, while Sync 3's excellent controls should  satisfy the tech crowd.</p>, <p>The Fusion has a few flaws, but most  of them are related to base versions of the car and they can be dealt with via  a few upgrades. For instance, the base 2.5-liter engine doesn't have much  power, but three available options offer improved performance. So while the  2018 Ford Fusion may look relatively similar on the outside to Fusions from  years past, the rest of this midsize sedan has been continually updated to  assure that it remains a top competitor in the class.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Ford Fusion as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans">Best AWD Sedans</a>, <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> and the 2018 Ford Fusion Sport as one of the <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Fusion is a four-door,  five-passenger midsize sedan available in five trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>Titanium</strong>, <strong>Platinum</strong> and <strong>V6 Sport</strong>.  The hybrid and plug-in hybrid (known as the Fusion Energi) are reviewed  separately. The base trim levels (S and SE) of the Fusion have a good amount of  standard equipment including features such as Bluetooth connectivity, power  front seats and satellite radio. On upper trim levels, there's a long list of  available comfort and convenience features such as ventilated seats, adaptive  cruise control and premium sound systems.</p>]

[<p>The base <strong>Fusion S</strong> comes standard with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine  (175 hp, 175 lb-ft), front-wheel drive, a six-speed automatic transmission,  16-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED taillights, a rearview camera,  cruise control, air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth  upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats,  audio and phone voice commands (Sync), Bluetooth connectivity, smartphone app  integration and a four-speaker sound system with a 4.2-inch center screen, a CD  player, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB port.</p>, <p>For a few more creature comforts,  the <strong>Fusion SE</strong> adds 17-inch wheels,  LED daytime running lights,<strong> </strong>exterior  keypad entry,<strong> </strong>an eight-way power  driver seat (with power lumbar), a six-way power passenger seat, rear heat  ducts, a rear center fold-down armrest and a six-speaker sound system with  satellite radio.</p>, <p>Optional for the S and SE is the <strong>Appearance package</strong>, which features  18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a rear spoiler, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel and special cloth upholstery. The SE is also available with the <strong>Luxury package</strong> (Equipment Group 202A),  which adds the turbocharged 1.5-liter engine (181 hp, 185 lb-ft) with automatic  engine stop-start to help save fuel, LED headlights and foglights, keyless  ignition and entry, remote ignition, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and  driver-side mirror, heated mirrors, leather upholstery, driver-seat memory  settings and heated front seats.</p>, <p>Opting for the SE's <strong>Technology package</strong> equips the Fusion  with rear parking sensors,<strong> </strong>dual-zone  automatic climate control, an 11-speaker sound system, the Sync 3 technology  interface (with an 8-inch central LCD touchscreen and two configurable gauge  cluster displays), enhanced voice controls and an additional USB charging port.</p>, <p>The <strong>Fusion Titanium</strong> gets all of the SE's optional features, plus it  comes standard with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (240 hp, 270 lb-ft),  18-inch wheels, LED taillights, a rear spoiler, ambient interior lighting,  sport front seats, eight-way power adjustment for the passenger seat, a premium  12-speaker Sony sound system and HD radio.</p>, <p>The Fusion SE (with the Technology  package selected) and Titanium can also be equipped with a navigation system,  an automated parking system for parallel and perpendicular parking, and  adaptive cruise control with frontal collision warning and stop-and-go traffic  capability. For the SE and Titanium, Ford additionally offers the <strong>Driver Assist package</strong>, which includes  automatic high-beam control, automatic wipers, a 110-volt power outlet, a  heated steering wheel, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a  lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist system. A sunroof is optional  for both the SE and Titanium, and the Titanium can be had with 19-inch wheels  and ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>The borderline luxury-level <strong>Platinum</strong> trim includes all of the above  features in addition to a unique grille insert, upgraded leather trim and a  power-adjustable steering wheel.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a sporty  version of the Fusion that still has some top-end features, the <strong>V6 Sport</strong> starts with features from the  SE with the Luxury package and adds a turbocharged V6 engine (325 hp, 380  lb-ft), all-wheel drive, a different grille, 19-inch wheels, quad exhaust tips,  a rear spoiler, adjustable suspension dampers, leather and simulated suede  upholstery, and a nine-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The V6 Sport <strong>Upgrade package</strong> (Equipment Group 401A) is about as high up as you  can go in a Fusion, and it includes most of the features from the Titanium  trim. It is also available with the Driver Assist package and the stand-alone  options listed above.</p>]

[<p>Plug-in hybrids are perfect for buyers who like the  idea of a fully electric car but don't want to worry about their typically  limited driving range. A well-known example is the 2018 Ford Fusion Energi.  Ford's been selling the Energi since 2013, and consumer reviews on Edmunds seem  to indicate that most owners are happy. The Energi pairs a bigger lithium-ion  battery pack with the regular Fusion Hybrid's gasoline-electric powertrain.  This allows the Energi to drive up to 21 miles on pure electric power before  the gas engine kicks on and delivers fuel economy comparable to the Fusion  Hybrid.</p>, <p>As much as we like the Fusion, though, it's  difficult to wholeheartedly recommend the Energi. It commands a hefty price  premium over a comparable Hybrid, one that might take a considerable amount of  time to recoup based on driving habits and electricity costs. The beefier  battery pack takes a significant chunk out of usable trunk space, making it  difficult to fit large pieces of luggage. The Energi's 21-mile range is also less  than what you get from other plug-in sedans and downright paltry compared to  the Chevrolet Volt's 53 miles. </p>, <p>Overall, we think the 2018 Ford Fusion Energi is  worth a look, but make sure to consider your options first.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Fusion Energi is one of the only  midsize plug-in hybrid sedans on the market and can be ordered in three trims: <strong>SE Luxury</strong>, <strong>Titanium </strong>and <strong>Platinum</strong>.  The SE Luxury is equipped with pretty much everything you'd want in a vehicle  in this price class, including leather upholstery, heated front seats and the  Sync 3 infotainment system. The Titanium is slightly more expensive and adds an  upgraded audio system and sport seats, among other upgrades. The Platinum is  considerably more expensive — it includes the Titanium's features,  nearly all of its options and upgraded leather upholstery. </p>]

[<p>Every Ford  Fusion Energi is driven by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired to an electric  motor powered by a lithium-ion battery pack (188 total system horsepower, but  can be temporarily boosted to 195 hp). This front-wheel-drive sedan can travel  up to 21 miles on electric power alone, at speeds up to 85 mph.</p>, <p>Standard  features on the Energi's base <strong>SE Luxury</strong> trim include 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED headlights and  taillights, heated mirrors, remote ignition, keyless entry and ignition, a  rearview camera, rear parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar  adjustment), a six-way power passenger seat, heated front seats, a 60/40-split  fold-down rear seat, driver-seat memory settings and leather upholstery.</p>, <p>Standard  tech features include voice controls, the  Sync 3 interface (with an 8-inch touchscreen and twin 4.2-inch configurable  screens in the instrument cluster), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth  and an 11-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite radio and two USB  ports.</p>, <p>The <strong>Titanium </strong>trim adds LED foglights, an  auto-dimming driver mirror, a rear spoiler, ambient interior lighting, front  sport seats, an eight-way power passenger seat, and an upgraded Sony audio  system with 12 speakers and HD radio.</p>, <p>Optional  on the SE Luxury and Titanium is the Driver Assist package, which bundles  automatic high-beam control, automatic wipers, a blind-spot monitoring system,  rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and intervention, and a heated  steering wheel. On the SE Luxury, this package also adds the auto-dimming  exterior mirror. </p>, <p>Selecting  the Driver Assist package allows you to add adaptive cruise control (includes  forward collision warning and mitigation). Also available are an automated  parallel and perpendicular parking feature (includes front and side parking  sensors), a sunroof and a navigation system. On the Titanium, you can also get  ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>The <strong>Platinum </strong>includes all above features,  in addition to upgraded leather upholstery, additional leather trim and a  power-adjustable steering wheel.</p>, <p>All trims  can be equipped with 18-inch wheels and inflatable rear seat belts.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2013 Ford Fusion Energi SE</strong> (2.0L  inline-4 plug-in hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Fusion Energi has received various  revisions, including additional standard and optional features throughout the  years, updated exterior and interior styling in 2017 and the replacement of the  MyFord Touch infotainment interface with the superior Sync 3 system (also in  2017). Still, our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Fusion  Energi.</p>]

[<p>Most mainstream automakers now offer hybrid versions  of their midsize sedans. That means there's plenty of choices, but it can also  make it hard to figure out which hybrid is going to be best for you. Ford might  just have what you're looking for with its 2018 Fusion Hybrid. We like the  standard Fusion for its sharp looks, surprisingly adept handling, spacious  trunk and excellent Sync 3 infotainment system. These positive traits carry  over to the hybrid version as well (yep, even the handling and cargo capacity)  to give it an edge over some rivals.</p>, <p>A well-sorted chassis and suspension setup prevent  the Fusion from rolling around too much when the road gets twisty. But even if  mountain roads aren't part of your normal commute, you'll still appreciate the  Fusion's space-efficient interior and trunk. As with other hybrid sedans, the  Fusion's battery pack occupies a good deal of the trunk's real estate. However,  its low profile means you can still lower the rear seats and access the trunk,  increasing usable storage space. This is a rare feature in this class.</p>, <p>Interior materials are also consistently high across  the trim levels. In the range-topping Fusion Platinum version, the quilted  leather upholstery might make you think you're riding in a luxury car. There  are compromises, of course. The Fusion Hybrid isn't the most fuel-efficient  vehicle in its class — it gets 42 mpg combined, compared to 48 mpg in  the Accord Hybrid — and it isn't the quickest. But overall we think  the Fusion's practicality and comfortable and well-trimmed cabin far outweigh  its performance deficiencies.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Fusion Hybrid midsize sedan is  available in four trims. Its base <strong>S </strong>trim  includes basic creature comforts like dual-zone automatic climate control,  cruise control and a rearview camera. We recommend starting with the next-level <strong>SE</strong>; the price bump is justified by  the added features and expanded list of optional features. Keep piling options  onto the SE, and you might actually find it economical to upgrade to the <strong>Titanium</strong>, as it includes several of the  SE's option packages. If you want the absolute best, the <strong>Platinum </strong>includes nearly every feature the Fusion Hybrid offers.</p>]

[<p>Like every  Ford Fusion Hybrid, the base <strong>S </strong>trim  is front-wheel drive and powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine matched to  an electric motor (188 total system horsepower). Standard features include  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED taillights, remote locking and  unlocking, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, rear air  vents, a height-adjustable driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  two configurable driver information displays, a 60/40-split fold-down rear  seat, audio and phone voice commands (Sync), Bluetooth connectivity, a 4.2-inch  central display screen, smartphone app integration, and a nine-speaker sound  system with a CD player and a USB port.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>SE</strong> adds exterior LED accent lights, exterior keypad entry, a digital compass, an  eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar adjustment), a six-way power  passenger seat, a rear-seat center armrest and satellite radio.</p>, <p>A few  option packages are available for the SE. The Appearance package (Equipment Group 601A) adds 18-inch wheels, a rear  spoiler, foglights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and contrasting interior  stitching. The Luxury package  (Equipment Group 602A) includes LED headlights, upgraded taillights, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated mirrors, chrome exterior trim, keyless  entry and ignition, remote engine start, leather upholstery, heated front seats  and driver-seat memory settings. Opting for the SE Technology package equips  the SE with rear parking sensors, the Sync 3 infotainment interface, an 8-inch  touchscreen, enhanced voice controls, an 11-speaker audio system, a 110-volt  power outlet, a second USB port, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The <strong>Titanium</strong> gets you the SE's optional  features listed above as standard, as well as LED foglights, sport front seats,  eight-way power adjustment for the passenger seat, ambient lighting and an  upgraded Sony 12-speaker audio system with HD radio.</p>, <p>The SE  (with Technology and Luxury packages selected) and Titanium offer the available  Luxury Driver Assist package, which includes automatic wipers, automatic  high-beam control, an auto-dimming driver mirror, a heated steering wheel,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and lane departure warning  and intervention. With the Driver's Assist package selected, the SE and  Titanium can also be equipped with adaptive cruise control with pedestrian  detection, a collision mitigation system and an automated parallel- and  perpendicular-parking system. </p>, <p>A sunroof  and a navigation system are optional for both the SE and Titanium, and the  Titanium can be had with ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>Springing  for the top-of-the-line Platinum gets you everything listed above as standard,  along with a power-adjustable steering wheel, premium floor mats, upgraded  leather upholstery and extended leather coverings.</p>, <p>All trim  levels can be equipped with inflatable rear seat belts.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid Platinum</strong> (2.0L  inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Fusion hasn't received significant  revisions.

[<p>If you've been away from the pony car  segment for a while, prepare yourself for a shock: The modern Mustang is  refined, rapid and rewarding. This generation's road manners took a big leap  forward when the entire 2015 Mustang lineup received — for the first  time in 50 years — an independent rear suspension. This change  facilitated the Mustang's transformation into a more sophisticated and  comfortable car while its performance capabilities reached new heights. </p>, <p>For 2018, Ford gives this generation of  Mustang a significant refresh. Some changes should help address prior  complaints we had about the car (a retuned suspension plus newly available  adaptive suspension dampers for a claimed improvement in ride quality), while  others are proverbial icing on the cake (more power for the Mustang's 5.0-liter  V8). The Mustang's new automatic transmission has an eyebrow-raising 10 speeds.  It might seem like overkill, but we've found this transmission in other  vehicles to be quick-shifting and very smooth.</p>, <p>These changes should keep the Mustang a  highly desirable pick for a pony car. Of course, it still has some primary  competition: the Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger. All three are genuinely  great cars, especially considering the price. If you're looking for the most  well-rounded one, though, the Mustang is the way to go. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Mustang is available in <strong>EcoBoost</strong>, <strong>EcoBoost Premium</strong>, <strong>GT </strong>and <strong>GT Premium</strong> trim levels for coupe (fastback) body styles.  Convertibles are available in all but the GT trim (the GT Premium is offered).  Say goodbye to the V6-powered Mustang — it has been dropped for 2018  — while a new 10-speed automatic transmission is optional on all models  and includes a remote-start function.</p>]

[<p>The  Mustang <strong>EcoBoost </strong>is the new  entry-level variant now. It is powered by a turbocharged 2.3-liter  four-cylinder engine that gains 20 pound-feet of torque this year for a total  of 310 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is  standard, and a new 10-speed automatic is optional.</p>, <p>Despite  representing the bottom rung of Mustangdom, EcoBoost models are equipped with a  surprising amount of racy hardware as standard: a limited-slip rear differential,  launch control (only with the manual gearbox) and an electronic line-lock to  facilitate burnouts (at the track only, of course). Standard creature comforts  are more pedestrian and include 17-inch wheels, manual cloth seats, keyless  entry and ignition, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 4.2-inch center display  screen, Bluetooth, two USB ports and a six-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>Notable  options packages include the <strong>Performance  package</strong>, a unique version of which is available for EcoBoost and GT models.  This includes larger brakes, 19-inch wheels and summer tires, a shorter  differential ratio, a bigger radiator, stiffer front springs and a larger rear  stabilizer bar. This package additionally allows access to new-for-2018  MagneRide adaptive suspension dampers.</p>, <p>The<strong> EcoBoost Premium</strong> keeps all the same  hardware but adds 18-inch wheels, leather upholstery, revised cabin trim, power  front seats, a nine-speaker audio system, dual-zone automatic climate control,  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and an 8-inch touchscreen with the Sync 3  infotainment system.</p>, <p><strong>GT </strong>models really step up the Mustang's  performance game. They come with a 5.0-liter V8 (460 hp, 420 lb-ft) that has  been revised for 2018 with the implementation of direct and port injection and  a host of other changes. The GT's six-speed manual gearbox gets revised gearing  this year, too. The 10-speed automatic is optional. The <strong>GT Premium</strong> adds the creature comforts of the EcoBoost Premium trim.</p>, <p>Notable  optional features for the Mustang include a digital gauge cluster, a heated  steering wheel, a navigation system, various exterior and interior styling  packages, Recaro front sport seats, a 12-speaker sound system, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Ford Mustang GT Premium Coupe</strong> (5.0L V8 | 6-speed manual | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Mustang has received some revisions  for 2018, including a retuned suspension, a new 10-speed automatic  transmission, a more powerful V8 and the deletion of the V6 model. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's Mustang, however.</p>]

[<p>This is likely the only year  you'll be able to argue that the Ford Shelby GT350 is inferior to the regular  Mustang. While the standard Mustang that it's based on gets a significant  update this year that includes new styling and features, the GT350 stays the  same. Luckily for us, we like the Shelby GT350 just the way it is. </p>, <p>The GT350 is a muscle car for the track day-obsessed. Yes, it shares some looks  and interior parts with the standard Mustang, but the key differences are  hidden from view. Under the hood is a non-turbocharged 5.2-liter V8. It revs up  to 8,200 rpm, punches out 526 horsepower, and even has a flat-plane crankshaft  that lends a distinctive warble to the engine's sound. From there, the GT350  has a race-tuned adaptive suspension, high-performance brakes, and all sorts of  supportive powertrain upgrades that set it apart. It'll lay down thick stripes  of rubber in a straight line, naturally, but the GT350 is most at home around a  complicated racetrack or a winding mountain road. </p>, <p>Despite  its focus on performance, the GT350 is comfortable and relatively quiet (when your  right foot isn't planted on the floor), and it could easily serve as a daily  driver. Well-rounded and massively entertaining, the GT350 is definitely our  idea of the ultimate Mustang. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford Shelby GT350 is a high-performance version of the Mustang coupe.  There are two trim levels: the <strong>base  GT350</strong> and the race-focused <strong>GT350R</strong>.  Essentially, the GT350 is the track-day version of a Mustang and, as such, it  has many performance features that you won't see on a standard rental Mustang. </p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment for the <strong>base GT350</strong> includes a 5.2-liter V8 (526 horsepower and 429 pound-feet of torque), a  six-speed manual transmission, 19-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers and  heavy-duty springs, Brembo brakes, a Torsen rear differential (with 3.73  gearing), a front-suspension tower brace, three powertrain coolers (oil,  differential and transmission), adjustable drive settings, xenon headlights, a  rear spoiler and diffuser, and keyless ignition and entry.</p>, <p>Inside,  you'll find manually adjustable Recaro front seats with simulated suede inserts,  a tilt-and-telescoping steering column, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch center display, Track Apps performance telemetry, a  rearview camera, phone and audio voice commands (Sync), smartphone app  integration, and a six-speaker sound system with two USB ports.</p>, <p>Opting  for the Electronics package equips the GT350 with dual-zone automatic climate  control, an 8-inch touchscreen with Sync 3 (with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  connectivity), a navigation system, and a nine-speaker audio system with  satellite radio. The Convenience package adds leather upholstery, driver-seat  memory settings, six-way power-adjustable sport front seats with power lumbar  for the driver, and heating and ventilation for the front seats.</p>, <p>The <strong>GT350R</strong> gets most of the GT350's  standard equipment, plus 19-inch carbon-fiber wheels (with special Michelin  tires), revised suspension tuning and aerodynamic body enhancements (front chin  splitter and carbon-fiber rear wing, most notably). The GT350R comes without  the air conditioning, sound system, floor mats, rear seat, rearview camera,  Sync system and tire inflation kit. To get those features back, Ford offers the  R-Electronics package, which puts almost all of it back in the car along with  the dual-zone climate control, nine-speaker sound system, and the previously  mentioned 8-inch touchscreen with Sync 3. </p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Ford Shelby GT350</strong> (5.2L V8 |  six-speed manual | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Ford Shelby GT350 has received only  minor revisions such as the addition of the track suspension as standard  equipment (our test car was equipped with that option) and the introduction of  some additional available options. Our findings remain applicable to this  year's Ford Shelby GT350.</p>]

[<p>Seemingly designed to conquer the  nation's endless stretches of highway, large sedans place a premium on  passenger room and comfort. The 2018 Ford Taurus is a competent member of this  class, but its hefty weight and dated cabin make rivals generally more  appealing.</p>, <p>Naturally, the Taurus offers ample leg-  and headroom throughout. It also boasts one of the largest trunks in this  class. The Taurus' composed ride transports passengers in comfort, whether  you're navigating broken city streets or cruising on the open road. It might  seem like the Taurus is the ultimate road trip vehicle, with plenty of space  and storage for four passengers and luggage. </p>, <p>However, pretty much any vehicle in this  class will do the same thing, and in a more upscale fashion. While it has  received numerous improvements over the years, this generation of the Taurus  has been on sale since 2010. Even with the addition of the Sync 3 infotainment  interface, the cabin looks plain compared to newer competitors. It feels clumsy  and bulky when you're driving around tight turns, and unless you're considering  the high-performance SHO model, the V6 is lethargic. It simply isn't powerful  enough to move this chunky sedan with authority. </p>, <p>Overall, we think the 2018 Ford Taurus  will adequately meet your needs. But if you shop around, you'll likely find  that the Taurus' large sedan rivals are more compelling overall.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ford Taurus is a large, five-passenger sedan sold in four trim levels. The  base <strong>SE </strong>is modestly equipped, which  is why buyers looking for 21st-century tech should strongly consider the next  level <strong>SEL</strong>.<strong> </strong>It counts rear parking sensors, dual-zone climate control and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror among its upgrades. The <strong>Limited </strong>is significantly more expensive, as it comes with items  that are optional for the SEL, plus additional luxury features. The <strong>SHO </strong>is a different beast entirely,  marrying most of the Limited's features with a high-performance V6 and sport  suspension. </p>]

[<p>For  power, the <strong>SE </strong>relies on a 3.5-liter  V6 engine (288 horsepower, 254 pound-feet of torque) paired to a six-speed  automatic transmission. Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, an exterior keyless-access keypad, six-way  power-adjustable front seats (with manual recline and lumbar adjustment),  60/40-split folding rear seatbacks, a driver information display, a rearview  camera, Sync voice controls, Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch central display, and a  six-speaker sound system with a CD player and two USB ports.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>SEL </strong>adds LED daytime  running lights, body-color heated mirrors with puddle lamps, rear parking  sensors, remote engine start, dual-zone automatic climate control, upgraded  cloth upholstery and interior trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift  knob, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and satellite radio (the latter is  optional on the SE). Leather upholstery paired with heated front seats is  available as a stand-alone option.</p>, <p>The  SEL can also be had with the <strong>Equipment  Group 201A</strong> options package, which adds keyless entry and ignition, an  additional center speaker for the audio system and the Sync 3 infotainment  system, which includes an 8-inch touchscreen and smartphone integration via  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. </p>, <p>The  more luxurious Taurus <strong>Limited </strong>gets  you all the Equipment Group 201A items, plus 19-inch alloy wheels, automatic  high-beam control, automatic wipers, an auto-dimming driver-side mirror,  power-adjustable pedals, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated 10-way power  front seats, driver-seat memory settings, heated second-row seats, a  power-adjustable heated steering wheel, ambient interior lighting, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and a premium Sony audio system with  HD radio.</p>, <p>Limited  models can also be had with the Driver Assist options package, which includes  adaptive cruise control, an automated parallel parking system, a forward  collision warning system, and lane departure warning and intervention.  Stand-alone options for both SEL and Limited include 20-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof,  a rear spoiler and a navigation system. </p>, <p>The  sporty <strong>SHO </strong>starts with most of the  Limited's standard equipment and adds all-wheel drive, a turbocharged 3.5-liter  V6 engine (365 horsepower, 350 pound-feet of torque), a sport-tuned suspension,  exclusive 20-inch wheels, xenon headlights, black exterior trim, a rear  spoiler, dual exhaust tips, unique leather upholstery and interior trim, and  steering wheel-mounted shift paddles.</p>, <p>Most  Limited options are also available for the SHO, along with a SHO Performance  package that adds a revised final-drive ratio for quicker acceleration, summer  performance tires, stiffer suspension tuning, upgraded brake pads, special  steering tuning, an enhanced stability control system with a Track mode, and  simulated suede trim on the steering wheel.</p>]

[<p>Commercial van buyers who operate in confined  urban areas or carry smaller loads should find the 2018 Ford Transit Connect to  be an affordable, practical alternative to a full-size van. It doesn't have the  room, payload and towing capacity of the larger models, but its four-cylinder  engine and car-based platform make it more economical to operate and easier to  maneuver.</p>, <p>The Transit  Connect is available in two body styles, three trim levels, two wheelbases, and  with a number of options that make it easy to customize for the job at hand.  The short-wheelbase passenger wagon can seat up to five, while the  long-wheelbase model can accommodate up to seven. The highest trim level is  comfortably outfitted with such features as leather seats,  dual-zone climate control with separate rear climate controls, and a  touchscreen infotainment system with navigation. </p>, <p>In addition  to economy, utility and practicality, this Euro-derived van features a  relatively stylish design that's a cut above some of its boxier competitors.  And the cabin provides a comfortable environment, with decently supportive  seats and a modern, well-organized dashboard. Shoppers looking for a small  people-hauler or a work van that delivers many of the capabilities of a larger  vehicle should consider taking a test drive in a 2018 Ford Transit Connect.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Transit Connect is a compact minivan offered  in Cargo Van and Wagon body styles, each with two different wheelbases. Three  trim levels are available: <strong>XL, XLT</strong> and the wagon-only <strong>Titanium</strong>. The XLT  and Titanium wagons seat five or seven, depending on which wheelbase you  select, while seven-passenger seating is standard on the XL. All versions have  dual sliding rear doors and give you a choice between swing-out back cargo  doors or an overhead liftgate. (The Titanium trim only comes with the  liftgate.)<br> <br>There's only  one engine available in the Transit Connect: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine  that delivers 169 horsepower and 171 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the  front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. </br></br></p>]

[<p>Base standard equipment on the <strong>XL Cargo Van</strong> includes 16-inch steel wheels, gray  grille/bumpers/side moldings, keyless entry, air conditioning, vinyl upholstery  and floor coverings, built-in cargo tie-down hooks, an overhead storage shelf,  a fold-flat front passenger seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, power  front windows, power door locks and a two-speaker sound system with an  auxiliary audio input jack. The <strong>XL Wagon</strong> version comes with the same standard equipment but adds rear parking sensors, driver  lumbar adjustment, second- and third-row seats, two rear speakers for the  stereo, rear climate controls and power second-row windows.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>XLT  Cargo Van</strong> gets you body-color bumpers, foglights, power-adjustable heated  mirrors, rear privacy glass, cloth upholstery, carpeted floor coverings, driver  lumbar adjustment, a passenger vanity mirror, a multifunction display, cruise  control and a CD player.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLT Wagon</strong> comes in short- and long-wheelbase models and mirrors the XLT cargo's equipment.  It also adds automatic headlights with configurable daytime running lamps, roof  rails, automatic wipers, a rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver seat, a conversation  mirror, a thicker acoustic windshield, four front speakers for the sound system  and voice controls. Ford's MyKey system is also included.</p>, <p>The top-of-the-line <strong>Titanium</strong> wagon adds 16-inch alloy wheels, adaptive cornering foglights, power-folding  mirrors, chrome exterior trim, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather  upholstery, heated front seats, a 6.5-inch touchscreen, navigation and the Sync  3 infotainment interface.</p>, <p>Some noteworthy options include 16-inch alloy wheels, a  compressed natural gas engine-prep package, a rearview camera, automatic  headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a towing package, a roof rack,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, satellite and HD radio,  and the Ford Sync 3 infotainment system with 6.5-inch touchscreen.</p>]

[<p>If this is your first time buying a  full-size work van in a while, prepare for a shock. Compared to the old Ford  E-Series or perhaps one of GM's vans, checking out the 2018 Ford Transit will  be like suddenly waking up 20 years in the future. It doesn't fly, but its ease  of use, interior versatility and fuel economy were no doubt hard-to-imagine  qualities back in the day.</p>, <p>Ford also offers a considerable amount of  variation within the Transit line. There are three roof heights, two wheelbases  (plus an extra-long version), three strong and efficient engine choices, and  plenty of optional equipment to fit your needs. There's even an impressive  amount of standard equipment available. </p>, <p>Downsides? It's honestly hard to come up  with any besides a relative lack of towing capability compared to its  old-school, truck-based competitors, but we're not sure how many businesses  really need that. Its rear-wheel-drive layout may also be challenging in snowy  climates where the Ram ProMaster's front-wheel-drive layout could be preferred.  Overall, though, you're going to be very pleased with the way this van from the  future meets your commercial van needs.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Transit is a full-size  cargo van. There are standard- and long-wheelbase models as well as low-,  medium- and high-roof body styles. There's also an extended-length body  available on the long wheelbase.</p>]

[<p>Depending on the configuration, the  Transit comes in <strong>150</strong>, <strong>250</strong> and <strong>350 </strong>versions that carry increasing gross vehicle weight ratings.  Engine choices include a standard 3.7-liter V6 (275 horsepower, 260 pound-feet  of torque), an optional turbocharged 3.2-liter diesel-powered inline  five-cylinder (185 hp, 350 lb-ft) and an optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6  (310 hp, 400 lb-ft). A six-speed transmission is standard on all Transits.</p>, <p>The single trim level comes standard with  16-inch steel wheels; a full-size spare tire; a 60/40-split hinged  passenger-side door (low roof) or a sliding passenger-side door (medium and  high roofs); cargo area tie-downs; full power accessories (windows, locks and  mirrors); keyless entry; a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel; front  air-conditioning; a rearview camera with trailer hitch assist; and a  four-speaker audio system with an auxiliary audio jack. </p>, <p>Options  can be ordered alone or come as part of packages. Highlights include long-arm  exterior mirrors, power-folding mirrors (long or short), various window  choices, different axle ratios, dual sliding rear cargo doors,  power-retractable running boards, cruise control, rear parking sensors, leather  upholstery, automatic headlights and wipers, a lane departure warning system,  remote engine start, rear air-conditioning and a spray-in liner for the cargo  area. Electronic options include <a href="https://www.telogis.com/ford">Ford Telematics</a>, a simple radio upgrade that includes Bluetooth, and  various six-speaker sound system upgrades that include combinations of a 4-inch  multifunction display, a CD player, a USB port, Sync (voice-activated media  player control along with Bluetooth phone and audio), HD radio and satellite  radio. You can also get the Sync 3 infotainment interface with navigation, a  6.5-inch touchscreen, and all of those audio upgrades. A heavy-duty trailering  package is also offered. </p>]

[<p>Shoppers with large families or commercial buyers who need a large shuttle  vehicle should check out the 2018 Ford Transit Wagon. It's a full-size van that  doesn't drive like a truck, and it can be configured to perform a wide range of  hauling chores. It also offers the choice of one of three engines to provide  the mix of power and fuel economy you desire.</p>, <p>With the Transit Wagon, flexibility is  the name of the game. It's available in various combinations of wheelbases,  body lengths, payload ratings and roof heights, allowing buyers to suit their  individual needs. Seating for eight is standard, but different configurations  let you accommodate 10, 12 or even 15 passengers, with room to spare for their  luggage.</p>, <p>Unlike Ford's old Econoline van, the  Transit Wagon delivers ride and handling more reminiscent of an SUV or a  minivan than a commercial vehicle. And available creature comforts, such as  leather-upholstered, heated front seats and the latest infotainment systems,  help ensure a pleasant on-road experience for both driver and passengers.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ford Transit Wagon is a  full-size passenger van offered in <strong>XL</strong> and <strong>XLT</strong> trims that are broadly  differentiated by some standard convenience features. There are standard- and  long-wheelbase models as well as low-, medium- and high-roof body styles. An  extended-length body can be had on the long-wheelbase chassis. The base Transit  Wagon is the 150, but there's also the heavy-duty Transit 350 with increased  payload capacities. The passenger capacity ranges from eight all the way up to  15, depending on the body style.</p>]

[<p>The  Transit Wagon's base engine is a 3.7-liter V6 good for 275 horsepower and 260  pound-feet of torque. For more power, the Transit can be fitted with a  turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that generates 310 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. Also  available is a turbocharged 3.2-liter diesel-powered inline five-cylinder rated  at 185 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque<strong>. </strong>A  CNG/Propane engine prep package is also available for the 3.7-liter V6. All Transits  come with a six-speed automatic transmission that sends the power to the rear  wheels. Payload and towing capacities vary depending on the model. When the  Transit Wagon is properly equipped, capacities can be as high as 4,560 pounds  for payload and 7,500 pounds for towing.</p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the <strong>XL</strong> trim includes a  rearview camera, 16-inch steel wheels, 60/40-split hinged passenger-side doors  on the low-roof body style, a sliding passenger door, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, full power accessories, front air conditioning, vinyl front  seats, and a six-speaker audio system with an input jack.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLT</strong> trim adds wheel covers,  automatic wipers, a chrome grille, cruise control, two additional front  speakers, a CD player with a 4-inch display, cruise control, full-length  carpeting, rear air conditioning, rear dome and map lights, and reclining rear  seatbacks.</p>, <p>Several  service prep packages are available for the 2018 Transit Wagon —  ranging from school bus packages to ambulance prep — as well as a  variety of choices for seating and colors.</p>, <p>Options  can be ordered alone or in packages. Highlights include various window  configurations, extended-length running boards, power-folding heated mirrors  with turn signals, different axle ratios, a heavy-duty towing package, leather  upholstery, rear parking sensors, a lane departure warning system, upgraded  audio systems, Ford Telematics, basic Sync voice controls (including a USB  port) or Ford's new Sync 3 infotainment system with navigation, upgraded  instrumentation, HD radio, satellite radio and a 6.5-inch touchscreen display. </p>, <p>A  Builders Prep package is available for both trim levels; it deletes the rear  seating and floor covering and adds dual heavy-duty batteries, a heavy-duty  alternator, a special wiring package, and (on the XL) the 4-inch display and CD  player. An RV Prep package available for the XLT trim mirrors the Builders Prep  package's modifications and adds privacy glass and other preparations for RV  upfitting.</p>]

[<p>Now in its  second year as a stand-alone brand, Genesis expands its luxury sedan lineup  with a new turbocharged G80 Sport model. If anyone wondered whether Hyundai,  the parent company from which Genesis is spun, intended to compete seriously in  the luxury segment, wonder no more.</p>, <p>For 2018,  the G80 adds a 3.3T Sport trim level. Powered by a turbocharged V6 and  underpinned by an adaptive, performance-oriented suspension, the 3.3T Sport  promises to infuse the lineup with a level of performance that's on par with  its European competitors. Up until now, we've found the G80 is an exceptionally  nice cruiser and commuter, but only just passable when trying to whip up a  frenzy in the twists and turns. </p>, <p>A  sprinkling of other new features, such as adaptive LED headlights and wireless  device charging, add to the G80's already impressive list of standard and  optional features, a list that fetches far more money when equipped on similar  luxury sedans. And therein lies the appeal of the G80, a car where your money  goes much further. </p>, <p>There is  some compromise, of course. Inside you'll find quality and craftsmanship on the  level of its European and Japanese peers, but rear-seat headroom is a little  tight for this class of car. We've also found the standard suspension doesn't  offer the same kind of tight and cushy sophistication of its rivals. And some  shoppers might balk at the Genesis G80 not having the panache or brand  recognition of its established rivals. From our standpoint, though, the G80's  price atones for these sins. It's a truly desirable midsize luxury sedan. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Genesis G80 is a midsize, five-passenger luxury sedan available in three trim  levels: <strong>3.8</strong>, <strong>3.3T Sport</strong> and <strong>5.0</strong>. The  number soup correlates to the size of engine underhood. For a base trim level,  the <strong>G80 3.8 </strong>is anything but basic,  with a wealth of standard features that equals or surpasses most in its class.  The <strong>G80 5.0</strong> adds larger wheels and  minor trim enhancements, but more notably more power from a V8 engine. The <strong>G80 3.3T Sport </strong>is more oriented to  performance driving with its turbo V6 engine and dynamic suspension. </p>]

[<p>The G80  3.8 starts with a 3.8-liter V6 engine (311 horsepower, 293 pound-feet), an  eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is  optional. </p>, <p>Standard  features include 18-inch alloy wheels, xenon headlights with automatic high  beams, LED daytime running lights, a rearview camera, heated auto-dimming side  mirrors, automatic wipers, traffic adapting cruise control, dual-zone automatic  climate control, keyless ignition and entry, and a hands-free auto-opening  trunklid. </p>, <p>Inside the  cabin are eight-way power front seats (with heating and four-way power lumbar  adjustment), leather upholstery, a power-adjustable steering wheel, driver-seat  memory settings and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Technology features  include an 8-inch touchscreen interface, navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto smartphone integration, the Genesis Connected Services telematics system,  two USB ports, and a seven-speaker audio system with a CD player and satellite  radio. </p>, <p>Blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and intervention,  and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection also come standard.  All-wheel-drive models also come with headlight washers, heated rear seats and  a heated steering wheel. </p>, <p>The G80  3.8 also offers two optional packages. The Premium package includes LED  foglights, front and rear parking sensors, a panoramic sunroof, ventilated  front seats, heated rear seats (on rear-wheel-drive models), rear and side  window shades, a wireless device charging pad, a Lexicon 14-speaker audio  system and an upgraded driver information display. </p>, <p>The Ultimate  package builds on the Premium package, adding turn-swiveling LED headlights, a  power trunklid, upgraded leather upholstery and driver seat adjustments, matte  wood and aluminum trim, a head-up display, a 9.2-inch touchscreen, a multiview  rearview/parking camera, a Lexicon 17-speaker audio system, and a  carbon-dioxide sensor for the climate control system. </p>, <p>The new  G80 <strong>3.3T Sport</strong> includes the Ultimate  package features (minus LED foglights) and further gains a turbocharged  3.3-liter V6 engine (365 hp and 376 lb-ft), 19-inch wheels, an adaptive  suspension, sport front seats, a simulated suede headliner, carbon-fiber  interior trim, and dark chrome exterior trim.</p>, <p>The G80  5.0 Ultimate comes equipped like the 3.3T Sport, but instead uses a 5.0-liter  V8 engine (420 hp, 383 lb-ft). When equipped with optional all-wheel drive, the  3.3T Sport and 5.0 also include a heated steering wheel. </p>]

[<p>Genesis'  flagship sedan carries over almost entirely unchanged from its debut last year  as the new company focuses its energy on expanding its product line. Though  that means the G90 retains a few faults, we think there are plenty of reasons  luxury sedan shoppers should give it a careful look. </p>, <p>The  2018 Genesis G90 delivers a spacious and luxurious interior that's backed up by  a blissfully hushed and smooth ride. Add a giant list of standard features that  will satisfy all but the most tech-obsessed buyer and the option of a robust V8  engine, and you have all the building blocks of a traditional luxury sedan.</p>, <p>As  noted, it's not all wine and roses. Although the interior makes a strong first  impression, most of what looks like metal is actually plastic, the genuine wood  trim looks a bit fake, and there are a few sharp edges to be found where the  generally impressive build quality slips just a little. Genesis also lags  behind most other dedicated luxury brands in terms of gadgets and gewgaws. </p>, <p>The  BMW 7 Series or Mercedes-Benz S Class, especially with a few options,  undoubtedly offer more upscale interiors with finer materials. But both are  significantly more expensive, and that price difference can easily more than  double with the addition of features such as adaptive cruise control and an  upgraded sound system. </p>, <p>Overall,  we highly recommend taking a look at the 2018 Genesis G90. It may not have a  premium badge, but in most of the ways that count, the G90 delivers a premium  experience at an significant discount.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Genesis G90 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans 2018">Best AWD Sedans for 2018</a>.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Genesis G90 is a large luxury sedan with seating for five. Other than  colors, shoppers have only two choices to make: V6 or V8 engine and rear- or  all-wheel-drive. The <strong>3.3T</strong> <strong>Premium</strong> model has a turbocharged  3.3-liter V6 (365 horsepower, 376 pound-feet of torque) under the hood, while  the <strong>5.0 Ultimate </strong>sports a 5.0-liter  V8 (420 hp, 383 lb-ft). Both engines use an eight-speed automatic transmission.  Rear-wheel drive is standard, and either model can be equipped with all-wheel  drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>3.3T Premium</strong> include 19-inch wheels, adaptive automatic LED headlights, LED running lights,  heated and power-folding mirrors, soft-close doors, a hands-free power  trunklid, adaptive suspension, adaptive cruise control, auto-dimming mirrors,  and keyless entry and ignition.</p>, <p>Inside,  you get a head-up display, leather upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate  control, heated and ventilated front seats, a 22-way power-adjustable driver  seat (16-way front passenger seat), memory functions for the front seats, a  power tilt-and-telescoping and heated steering wheel, a simulated suede  headliner, wood interior trim, adjustable interior ambient lighting, power  sunshades for the rear windows, rear seat climate and audio controls, a  wireless charging pad, and USB ports in front and back. Infotainment duties are  handled by a 12.3-inch screen and a knob mounted by the gearshift. This system  includes Bluetooth, navigation voice controls, satellite and HD radio, a CD/DVD  player in the glovebox and a 17-speaker Lexicon premium surround-sound system.</p>, <p>On  the safety front, the G90 comes with a multi- and surround-view camera system,  front and rear parking sensors, a forward collision warning and mitigation  system (with pedestrian detection), lane departure warning and intervention,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a drowsy driver monitoring  system and Genesis Connected telematics services.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the<strong> 5.0 Ultimate</strong> upgrades the  rear seats with power adjustments (14-way right rear seat and 12-way left rear  seat), ventilation and memory functions. New for 2018, a pair of 10.3-inch HD  screens have been added to the rear-seat entertainment system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Genesis G90 3.3T Premium</strong> (turbo 3.3L V6 | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Genesis G90 has received some minor  revisions but our findings remain applicable to this year's Genesis G90.</p>]

[<p>With a carlike ride and lighter  construction (which allows for downsized, more fuel-efficient engines), large  crossovers have largely supplanted traditional sport-utility vehicles. It was  only natural that GMC — then known for its pickups and truck-based  SUVs — was swept up in the craze just over a decade ago. The 2018  Acadia is the newest version of GMC's first car-based utility vehicle.</p>, <p>This three-row crossover was fully  redesigned last year, a transformation that made the 2017 Acadia smaller and  lighter than the previous model. Handling and fuel economy were improved at the  expense of passenger and cargo room, but you wouldn't notice the pinch unless  you habitually filled the third row with little ones. </p>, <p>For those in the first and second rows,  the Acadia is spacious all around, and both back rows fold flat at the pull of  a strap for maximum carrying capacity. The rest of the cabin is airy and  inviting, though the overall design is more focused on function than form. That  said, if you think competitors' interiors look a bit busy, you'll probably  enjoy the Acadia's more toned-down approach.</p>, <p>Though a four-cylinder engine is  available, we think it's outmatched by the sheer weight it's asked to move.  Better to upgrade to the optional V6, especially if you plan on frequently  ferrying friends and family.</p>, <p>Overall, we think the 2018 GMC Acadia is  a solid choice for a comfortable three-row crossover SUV. But it might also be  worth your time to look at a few other rival models, especially if expansive third-row  seat space and lots of cargo room are priorities for you.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 GMC Acadia is offered in <strong>SL</strong>, <strong>SLE</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong> and <strong>Denali</strong> trim levels. The <strong>SL </strong>model seems like a great deal, until you realize that it's a  custom-order model and you'll have to wait for it to be built. There are two levels of the  midgrade <strong>SLE</strong> trim: The SLE-1 is only  a minor upgrade over the SL (but you'll actually find it at a dealership),  while the<strong> </strong>SLE-2 adds a more  substantial level of upgrades. A well-equipped <strong>SLT</strong> trim is the next step up, and it, too, is split between SLT-1  and SLT-2 levels. The <strong>Denali</strong> trim  rounds out the lineup with several exclusive high-end features.</p>]

[<p>Depending on trim, the midsize Acadia is  offered in a two-row, five-passenger configuration or a three-row configuration  with seating for six (with second-row captain's chairs) or seven (with a  second-row bench). A 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (193 horsepower, 188  pound-feet of torque) is standard on SL, SLE and SLT-1 models. A 3.6-liter V6  (310 hp, 271 lb-ft) is standard on SLT-2 and Denali models and optional on  SLE-1 (with all-wheel drive), SLE-2 and SLT-1 trims. Both engines are paired to  a six-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Technically,  GMC sells an Acadia in the <strong>SL </strong>trim,  with a seven-passenger seating configuration and front-wheel drive. White and  silver exterior paint are really the only options on this trim. Its features  include17-inch alloy wheels, heated  mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, tri-zone automatic climate control, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, GMC's <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/teen-driver-technology">Teen Driver</a> system, Bluetooth, a 7-inch  touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone app integration, a  rearview camera, OnStar (with 4G LTE and a Wi-Fi hotspot), and a six-speaker  audio system with a USB port and auxiliary input.</p>, <p>It's  a built-to-order trim, however, so you're most likely going to see the next  level <strong>SLE-1 </strong>on dealer lots. The  SLE-1 trim adds only LED running lights and satellite radio, while the <strong>SLE-2</strong> steps it up with 18-inch wheels,  foglights, a power liftgate with programmable height stops, roof rails, remote  engine start, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat and heated front seats.  The SLE-2 and above trims come standard with middle-row captain's chairs that  reduce passenger capacity to six, but the second-row bench is available.</p>, <p>The  SLE-2's available <strong>Driver Alert I</strong> package adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and rear  parking sensors.</p>, <p>Opting  for the <strong>SLT-1</strong> trim adds the Driver  Alert I package, an auto-dimming driver-side and rearview mirror, an upgraded  driver information display, a household-style power outlet, leather upholstery,  power-adjustable front seats with lumbar adjustment, and an eight-speaker Bose  audio system with a subwoofer. </p>, <p>The <strong>SLT-2</strong> trim adds 20-inch wheels, the  V6 engine, a trailering package, driver-seat memory functions and heated  outboard middle-row seats. Also included is the <strong>Driver Alert II</strong> package that has all of the supporting Driver Alert  I features plus lane departure warning and mitigation, forward collision  warning (with pedestrian detection and automatic braking at low speeds),  automatic high beams, front parking sensors, and a safety-alert driver seat  that buzzes when alerts are triggered.</p>, <p>An  8-inch touchscreen is available on SLE-2, SLT-1 and SLT-2 models. It is paired  with the Bose audio system and upgraded driver info display on the SLE-2, and  it can be equipped with navigation on the SLT trims.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>Denali </strong>rounds out  the lineup with polished wheels, xenon headlights, a unique grille, a  hands-free liftgate, the 8-inch touchscreen with navigation, a configurable  virtual gauge display, ventilated front seats, and a heated and  power-adjustable steering wheel. The Denali is also eligible for the optional  Technology package that adds a 360-degree parking camera and adaptive cruise  control.</p>, <p>You  can get all-wheel drive on all Acadias except the base SL. A two-panel sunroof  is available on SLE-2 trims and above. An<strong> All Terrain package </strong>is also available on SLE-2 and SLT-1 trims and adds the  V6 engine, distinct exterior treatments, hill descent control, a more advanced  all-wheel-drive system and a cargo management system (SLT-1 only). If  five-passenger seating is specified, tri-zone climate control is replaced by  dual-zone control with rear air vents. Finally, a special suspension with  adaptive dampers is optional for AWD SLT-2 and Denali trims.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 GMC Acadia</strong> (3.6L V6 |  6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>]

[<p>While  midsize trucks aren't as robust as their full-size brethren, they still offer  an impressive amount of capability. They're also easier to park and typically  get better fuel economy. For a solid example of the breed, check out the 2018  GMC Canyon. </p>, <p>With  the Canyon, which is a marginally more upscale version of the Chevy Colorado  pickup, you get those midsize truck traits plus a comfortable highway ride and  a stout maximum tow rating of 7,700 pounds. The Colorado also offers a strong  308-horsepower V6 engine or a fuel-efficient four-cylinder diesel. Lots of  optional features, such as forward collision warning and an 8-inch infotainment  system, round out the Canyon's appeal.</p>, <p>The  Canyon does have some drawbacks, such as limited off-road ability and front seats  that can feel a little confining for some folks. Overall, though, we think  GMC's Canyon is a smart pick for a midsize truck.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 GMC Canyon Diesel as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Trucks">Best Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Canyon is a midsize pickup offered in two- and four-seat extended-cab  and five-seat crew-cab body styles. There are two bed lengths and five trim  levels to choose from: <strong>SL</strong>, <strong>base Canyon</strong>, <strong>SLE</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong> and the  top-of-the-line <strong>Denali</strong>. </p>]

[<p>Although  the GMC Canyon is a more upscale version of its Chevy Colorado sibling, there  is an entry-level trim called the <strong>SL</strong>.  The SL is offered only with the extended cab. It lacks rear seats and it comes  standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (200 horsepower and 191  pound-feet of torque), a six-speed manual transmission, 16-inch wheels,  air-conditioning, a four-way power driver seat (with manual recline), a  tilt-only steering wheel, power windows, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch  touchscreen, voice commands, a USB port and a six-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>The  next step up is the <strong>base </strong>Canyon  trim, which is available in both extended-cab and crew-cab body styles and adds  a six-speed automatic transmission (optional or standard, depending on the configuration)  and fold-up rear jump seats (extended-cab models only). A 3.6-liter V6 engine  (308 hp and 275 lb-ft) paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission is  also optional or standard here depending on the configuration. </p>, <p>Significantly,  the base Canyon can be ordered with some options packages that aren't available  on the SL. Notable features to look out for include remote keyless entry, an  easy-lift tailgate, cruise control and a trailering package. </p>, <p>Instead  of picking options packages for the base Canyon, you could just upgrade to the <strong>SLE</strong>. It gets you most of the above as  standard, plus 17-inch wheels, power side mirrors, upgraded interior trim  materials, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, an 8-inch touchscreen, satellite radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto,  OnStar connectivity (with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot) and three extra USB ports. </p>, <p>Much  like the base Canyon, the SLE gets most of its options in packages. The  All-Terrain package (essentially GMC's equivalent of the off-road-focused  Colorado Z71) bundles 17-inch dark-tinted alloy wheels and all-terrain tires,  an off-road-oriented suspension, a rear locking differential, hill descent  control, heated front seats, a four-way power passenger seat and distinctive  cloth upholstery. The optional SLE Convenience package includes automatic  climate control, remote start and a sliding rear window. </p>, <p>Even  with all those available options, a few things are still left on the table, and  right near the top, there's the <strong>SLT</strong> trim. It gets all the SLE's standard equipment plus the contents of the SLE  Convenience package. It also comes standard with the 3.6-liter V6 engine,  18-inch wheels, leather upholstery and the All-Terrain package's front seating  upgrades (power adjustments and heating). </p>, <p>Both  the SLE and SLT can be equipped with the optional Driver Alert package that  features forward collision warning and lane departure warning. Other optional  extras include the turbocharged 2.8-liter four-cylinder diesel engine (181 hp and  369 lb-ft) paired to a six-speed automatic. An upgraded seven-speaker Bose  audio system is also among the extras. </p>, <p>If  you want all the creature comforts GMC can throw at you, there's the Canyon <strong>Denali</strong>. The Denali gets the SLT's  equipment plus the contents of the Driver Alert package, the upgraded Bose  audio system, navigation, chrome 20-inch wheels, cargo lamps, a spray-in  bedliner, heated and ventilated front seats, wireless charging for compatible  cellphones and a heated steering wheel.</p>]

[<p>Full-size vans have a longer shelf life  than other vehicles, but even these utilitarian workhorses have an expiration  date. Case in point: the 2018 GMC Savana Cargo Van. Although it was heavily  refreshed for the 2003 model year, its bones date back to a time when voters  were still trying to decide between Clinton and Dole. While it's capable enough  on its own merits, business owners have the pick of several competing vans that  are more versatile and up-to-date.</p>, <p>The GMC Savana and its nearly identical  corporate cousin, the Chevrolet Express, are among the last of the truck-based,  body-on-frame cargos vans. Most in the segment have adopted a unibody  construction, giving rivals a more comfortable ride and less mass for their  smaller, more fuel-efficient engines to haul around. Nearly all offer a range  of cargo roof heights, so you can put in taller shelves or simply give yourself  more room to move around the cabin.</p>, <p>These competitors can't tow or haul as  much as the Savana, but unless you are packing the back to the top with  equipment, nearly every other cargo van is a better choice. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Savana Cargo is a full-size van with an expansive, boxy cargo area  behind two front seats. (Its Savana Passenger sibling fills this space with  additional rows of seating.) It's available in two load ratings: 2500 (max  payload: 3,353 pounds) and 3500 (max payload: 4,311 pounds). Each can be  ordered in an extended wheelbase, which increases cargo volume from 239.7 cubic  feet in the standard version to 284.4 cubic feet. Regardless of starting  configuration, the Savana only comes in the modestly equipped <strong>Work Van</strong> trim level. A few packages and  numerous stand-alone options are available.</p>]

[<p>By default, the rear-wheel-drive Savana  Cargo is powered by a 4.3-liter V6 (276 horsepower, 298 pound-feet of torque)  paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Alternate powertrains are available  if the standard V6 doesn't meet your requirements, including a 6.0-liter V8  (341 hp, 373 lb-ft) matched to a six-speed automatic and a 2.8-liter  four-cylinder diesel engine (181 hp, 369 lb-ft) with an eight-speed auto. </p>, <p>The <strong>Work  Van</strong>'s standard features include 16-inch steel wheels, 60/40-split opening  doors on the right side, a rearview camera, a driver information display, air  conditioning, power windows and locks, vinyl upholstery and floor covering, LED  cargo lighting, six D-ring cargo tie-downs, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, GM's OnStar emergency  communications, a 120-volt  outlet, and a two-speaker audio system with AM/FM radio and an auxiliary jack.</p>, <p>Major equipment packages include the  Convenience, which adds a tilt-adjustable steering wheel and cruise control;  the Chrome Appearance, which brings chrome bumpers and grille; the Cargo, which  adds the V8 engine and a spray-in bedliner; the Communications, which adds the  contents of the Convenience package, plus the V8 engine, leather-wrapped  steering wheel, Bluetooth, a CD player and satellite radio; and Safety, which  adds the contents of the Convenience package, plus the V8 engine,  power-adjustable mirrors, rear parking sensors with backup alarm and blind-spot  monitoring. There's also an Enhanced Convenience package that brings the V8,  remote locking and unlocking, remote engine start, heated and power-adjustable  mirrors, a trailer hitch and a seven-pin connector.</p>, <p>Packages aimed at commercial customers  include the Hotel Shuttle package, which adds the contents of the Chrome  Appearance and Driver Convenience packages, the V8, a sliding rear passenger  door, heated power mirrors, a second row of seating, tinted glass and rear  cargo windows, and the Ambulance package, which is available for the 3500 and  extended wheelbase only and adds the Chrome Appearance package, a heavy-duty  locking differential, and a more powerful battery and alternator. A separate  bundle adds a 6.5-inch touchscreen, navigation, Bluetooth, a CD player and a USB  port.</p>, <p>Some of the above features can be added  as stand-alone options. Other options include an engine block heater, cloth  upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, and rear air conditioning and heating. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 GMC Sierra 1500 doesn't  get any big changes this year, but it didn't really need any. The Sierra, which  shares its design with the Chevy Silverado, is highly capable when it comes to  towing and is an all-around impressive and luxurious truck.</p>, <p>Available  with three different engines and with multiple body and bed configurations, the  2018 GMC Sierra 1500 is as customizable as any full-size truck on the road  today. In the right configuration, it can tow more than 12,000 pounds. Yet the  Sierra is also available with a long list of luxury and safety features and is  very easy to live with on a daily basis. There are some drawbacks with the  Sierra, including the slightly underwhelming base powertrain (a 4.3-liter V6  that we recommend replacing with one of the optional V8s) and the somewhat  dated interior. But overall it's a strong offering from GMC in a highly  competitive class. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Sierra 1500 is available in four trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>SLE</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong> and <strong>Denali</strong>. They are available in various cab and bed configurations.  The <strong>base </strong>is relatively sparsely  equipped, though a few options are available. We recommend buyers look to the <strong>SLE </strong>trim level at a minimum because it  has features beyond what you'd find in a work-only truck. The version that  strikes the best balance between amenities and functionality is the <strong>SLT </strong>trim level, while the range-topping <strong>Denali</strong>'s luxury will appeal to  buyers who want it all.</p>]

[<p>Configurations  are as follows: Regular cabs are offered with a standard bed (6 feet 7 inches)  or an extended bed (8 feet); double cabs come only with the standard bed; and  crew cabs are available with a standard bed or a short bed (5 feet 9 inches).  Be aware that not all trim levels are available with all configurations. All  cab configurations are available with four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The <strong>base </strong>Sierra comes with a 4.3-liter  V6 (285 horsepower, 305 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed automatic  transmission, 17-inch steel wheels, automatic xenon headlamps, power locks, a  locking tailgate, power windows, air conditioning, cruise control, a rearview  camera, a tilt-only steering wheel, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen interface,  USB connectivity and a six-speaker sound system.<br> <br>  The Sierra Convenience package adds remote keyless entry, a remote-locking  tailgate, heated power mirrors, a 110-volt AC outlet and LED cargo box  lighting. The Elevation Edition includes those items plus special 20-inch black  alloy wheels, LED foglights, body-color exterior trim and OnStar communications  (with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot).</br></br></p>, <p>The <strong>SLE</strong> trim level adds 17-inch alloy  wheels, a damped tailgate, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an upgraded  8-inch touchscreen. </p>, <p>Many  more options are available on the SLE. The SLE's Convenience package adds rear  parking sensors, a rear window defogger, a sliding rear window and  power-adjustable pedals. The Preferred package adds remote start, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel (V8 only), an power-adjustable driver seat  and dual-zone automatic climate control. The SLE Value package adds the same  items plus trailering equipment and a rear locking differential. Other options  include leather upholstery, a full center console, a power-adjustable front  passenger seat and wireless smartphone charging.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>SLT,</strong> our trim level of  choice, nets you the 5.3-liter V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft), an eight-speed automatic  transmission, power-folding and heated mirrors, leather upholstery and heated  front seats. A 6.2-liter V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft) is optional. Other options for  the SLT include front and rear parking sensors, a power-sliding rear window, a  heated steering wheel, full LED headlights, a spray-in bedliner, navigation, a  sunroof and a seven-speaker Bose audio system. </p>, <p>GMC  offers an Enhanced Driver Alert package for the SLE and SLT. It includes driver  assistance features such as a forward collision warning system with low-speed  automatic emergency braking as well as lane departure warning and intervention. </p>, <p>Available  on the SLT crew and double cabs are two different off-road-focused packages  called the All-Terrain and All-Terrain X. The All-Terrain package adds a few  features mentioned above plus some exterior styling changes, an off-road  suspension featuring Rancho shocks and an underbody shield. The All-Terrain X  package is similar in theme but lacks the off-road suspension.</p>, <p>At  the top of the range is the<strong> Denali</strong>,  which comes with most of the features available on lower trim levels and has  all of the available driver assistance features. It adds exclusive adaptive  suspension dampers, 20-inch wheels and unique interior appointments.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects.<br>  The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2017 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali Crew Cab Short Bed</strong> (6.2L V8 | 8-speed  automatic | 4WD | 5-foot-9 bed).</br></p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current GMC Sierra 1500 has received some  very minor revisions, including the addition of optional upgraded brakes. Our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's GMC Sierra. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD is a highly capable heavy-duty truck with lots of  extras. It can tow over 14,000 pounds, seat six and it's wrapped up in an  attractive package. If you need more capability than the Sierra 1500 but don't  want the added expense or size of the 3500, the 2500 is the obvious choice. </p>, <p>For  2018, the Sierra 2500HD doesn't change much, and that's not necessarily a  negative. A previously optional 7-inch touchscreen (with Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto) is now standard but there are no updates to powertrains,  suspension or features availability. That means that the 2500HD is still  well-built and high-class and as utilitarian as it needs to be. It also means  you can still get tech items such as the user-friendly Intellilink infotainment  interface or the optional Driver Alert package, which adds parking sensors,  lane departure warning and forward collision warning.</p>, <p>Of  course, you'll also want to check out its corporate sibling, the Chevrolet  Silverado 2500. It's mechanically the same, but it's priced lower and with less  luxury equipment. For buyers who can do without the luxury gear, the Silverado  is certainly worth a closer look. On its own merits, though, the 2018 GMC  Sierra 2500HD is certainly a desirable truck with a lot to offer, even to the  most demanding of truck owners. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck available in four trim  levels. The <strong>base (Sierra) </strong>version  comes with basic equipment such as vinyl flooring and steel wheels, but you'll  get a lot more if you pick the <strong>SLE</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong> or the range-topping <strong>Denali</strong>. On upper trim levels, items  such as a remote-locking tailgate, leather upholstery and navigation become  available. There are three cab configurations: regular cab, double cab and crew  cab. All are available with two- or four-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>The  regular cab is available only with a long bed (8.2 feet), while the extended-  and crew-cab models can have a standard bed (6.5 feet) or a long bed. Unlike  its 3500HD big brother, the Sierra 2500HD is not available with a dual  rear-wheel (DRW, or dually) axle. The SLT trim is available only on the double  and crew cabs, and the Denali is available only as a crew cab.</p>, <p>The <strong>base Sierra </strong>comes standard with a  6.0-liter V8 engine (360 hp and 380 lb-ft), a six-speed automatic transmission,  17-inch steel wheels, an automatic locking rear differential, xenon headlights,  LED daytime running lights, air conditioning, a choice of cloth or vinyl  upholstery, a 40/20/40-split front bench with a fold-down center armrest, a  60/40-split folding rear seat, rubber floor covering, a rearview camera, power  door locks, cruise control, a tilt-only steering wheel, a 7-inch IntelliLink  touchscreen infotainment system and a six-speaker sound system with two USB  ports, an auxiliary audio input jack, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility,  Bluetooth phone and audio, Pandora radio, and voice controls. Optional tech  equipment on the base Sierra 2500HD includes <a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/home.html">OnStar</a><u>,</u> 4G LTE Wi-Fi and satellite radio.</p>, <p>From  the base Sierra on up, you have your choice of engine, too. A turbocharged  6.6-liter diesel V8 (445 hp and 910 lb-ft) is also available, and it is paired  to a different six-speed automatic. Buyers can also add a bi-fuel option to the  6.0-liter engine, allowing it to run on gasoline or compressed natural gas.</p>, <p>If  the base truck isn't your flavor, then step up to the <strong>SLE</strong>. It gets most of the base trim's optional tech features plus an  upgraded 8-inch central touchscreen, 17-inch alloy wheels, tinted rear windows,  a remote locking EZ Lift &amp; Lower tailgate, LED cargo box illumination,  remote keyless entry, carpeting, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, HD radio and  a CD player.</p>, <p>With  a few more luxury items, the<strong> SLT</strong> trim level feels a bit better equipped than our standard work truck. It adds  18-inch chrome alloy wheels, additional chrome trim, foglights, power-folding  mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, eight-way  power-adjustable and heated front seats (with power lumbar adjustment),  driver-seat memory settings, power-adjustable pedals, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, remote ignition and a 110-volt  household-style power outlet.</p>, <p>For  a plush and upscale vibe, choose the <strong>Denali</strong> trim. It will get you even more chrome on the outside, 20-inch wheels, chrome  side steps, a spray-in bedliner, a power-sliding rear window with defogger,  front and rear parking sensors, a navigation system, wireless phone charging, a  Bose audio system, a configurable 8-inch driver information display, upgraded  interior trim, ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>Most  of the upper trims' extra standard features can be added to the lower trim  levels as options. Other option highlights, depending on trim level, include  different axle ratios, a bed storage box, various tonneau covers, trailering  mirrors, a sunroof, a gooseneck/fifth-wheel trailering prep package, and a  rear-seat entertainment system. There's also a Driver Alert package, which  includes front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning, forward  collision warning and a safety-alert driver seat. The Z71 suspension package  adds hill descent control, skid plates, specially tuned shock absorbers and unique  styling tweaks. Also available (on SLT crew-cab models only) is the All Terrain  HD package, which includes off-road tires, the spray-in bedliner, a skid plate,  the Z71 suspension and a heated steering wheel.</p>]

[<p>All heavy-duty trucks are built to handle  rigorous towing and hauling needs, especially for professionals in construction  and agriculture trades. But they also come in handy for intrepid  trailer-travelers and those with a fondness for destroyer-class watercraft. The  2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD, however, adds another layer of comfort and luxury to  all these utility tasks, and it does so with rugged exterior design and cabin  comforts that you're more likely to find in high-end SUVs. If you want to bask  in comfort while breaking a sweat, this is the truck. </p>, <p>Available  with two powerful engines and in several cab configurations, the 3500HD can be  tailored to fit your priorities, whether interior space, cargo room or maximum  towing capacity. The optional diesel engine generates 910 pound-feet of torque  — about a third of what a 60-ton Abrams tank engine produces  — so there's not much beyond its capabilities before entering the  realm of commercial freight hauling.</p>, <p>Ford and Ram also make robust,  luxury-trimmed pickups for extreme towing duties, but you'll likely find the  2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD just as appealing.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD  heavy-duty pickup truck is available in four trim levels and three cab sizes:  regular cab, double cab and crew cab. All are available with two- or four-wheel  drive and in either single rear-wheel (SRW) or dual rear-wheel (DRW, or dually)  configuration. All 3500 Sierras come with a long bed (8 feet 1 inch) except the  crew cab, which in single rear-wheel form offers a choice of long bed or  shorter standard bed (6 feet 6 inches).</p>]

[<p>For  buyers interested in a basic heavy-duty truck, the<strong> base</strong> Sierra comes standard with a 6.0-liter V8 engine (360  horsepower and 380 pound-feet), a six-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch  steel wheels, an automatic locking rear differential, xenon headlights, air  conditioning, a choice of cloth or vinyl upholstery, a 40/20/40-split front  bench with a fold-down center armrest, power door locks, manual crank windows,  cruise control and a tilt-only steering wheel.</p>, <p>Also  standard are a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, a USB port, a  four- (regular cab) or six-speaker sound system, and Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto smartphone integration.</p>, <p>From  the base Sierra on up, you also have your choice of engine. A turbocharged  6.6-liter diesel V8 (445 hp and 910 lb-ft) is available, also paired to a  six-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Many  options are available for the base Sierra. Highlights include a remote locking  tailgate, LED bed lighting, a 110-volt power outlet, satellite radio, and  OnStar services with 4G LTE Wi-Fi.</p>, <p>For  a slightly less bare-bones experience, the <strong>SLE</strong> offers an 8-inch touchscreen, 18-inch alloy wheels (single-rear-wheel models  only), tinted rear windows, a remote-locking EZ-Lift tailgate, remote keyless  entry, carpeted floor, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, full power accessories,  a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a CD player, satellite and HD radio, and most  of the base Sierra's options. </p>, <p>Further  up the ladder is our recommendation, the <strong>SLT</strong>.  Building on the SLE's equipment, the SLT adds foglights, power-folding mirrors,  dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, power-adjustable and  heated front seats, driver-seat memory settings, power-adjustable pedals, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, remote  ignition, and a 110-volt household-style power outlet.</p>, <p>For  a luxurious take on your hard-working truck, go with the <strong>Denali</strong>. It adds a spray-in bedliner, a power-sliding rear window  with defogger, front and rear parking sensors, a navigation system, wireless  phone charging, a Bose audio system, an upgraded driver information display,  upgraded interior trim, ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>Many  of the standard features on upper trims can be added at lower trim levels in  grouped packages. Other optional highlights depend on trim level and include  different axle ratios, a bed storage box, tonneau covers, trailering mirrors, a  sunroof,  a gooseneck/fifth-wheel  trailering prep package, a rear-seat entertainment system, and a Driver Alert  package, which includes front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning,  forward collision warning and a safety-alert driver's seat. </p>, <p>Only  available on the SLT is the All Terrain HD package, which includes 18-inch  wheels, the Z71 off-road suspension, skid plates, front-and-rear parking  sensors and a heated steering wheel. A separate Suspension package (available  on the SLE and the SLT) offers hill descent control, skid plates, specially  tuned shock absorbers and unique styling treatments.</p>]

[<p>Although popular, the previous-generation  Terrain was falling short of the class standards for drivability, technology  and interior quality by the end of its run. Happily, the fully redesigned 2018  GMC Terrain addresses the problems the aging generation had and now represents  a more compelling choice for a small, five-passenger crossover SUV. </p>, <p>The new Terrain pulls off the impressive  trick of shrinking by just over 3 inches in length and 400 pounds in weight from  the previous generation without sacrificing more than an inch of head- or  legroom. Maximum cargo volume is nearly the same, too. That weight loss,  combined with new engines and transmissions, promises better performance and  fuel economy. However, the base engine struggles to deliver on its performance  or fuel economy in the real world. We highly recommend the optional engine  upgrades: The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder improves performance, while  the turbocharged 1.6-liter turbodiesel is pleasant to drive and is a fuel  economy champ — GMC estimates it will return 40 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>The Terrain (and its sibling, the Chevy  Equinox, which is nearly identical under the skin) is one of the nicest  vehicles in the segment to spend time in. It's comfortable and easy to drive  and comes standard with one of the best infotainment interfaces in the class.  There's plenty of headroom all around, and the back seats fold flat with the  pull of a lever. Aside from the disappointing base powertrain, downsides  include a slightly smaller cargo area than some rival crossovers and pricing  that's noticeably higher than other vehicles you might be cross-shopping. We  also had to ding the Terrain for its overly firm ride quality.</p>, <p>If what you're looking for is efficiency,  practicality and ease of use, the Honda CR-V with its 1.5-liter turbo engine is  an obvious choice. The Mazda CX-5 provides a better driving experience and an  interior that, in higher trims, feels even more upscale than the GMC's for less  money. If you're looking for off-road prowess, the Jeep Cherokee and the Subaru  Forester offer more capability. </p>]

[<p>Even the base <strong>SL</strong> trim of the 2018 Terrain comes with some desirable features, but  it has a very limited options menu. Moving up to the <strong>SLE</strong> gets you access to more options. The <strong>SLT</strong> adds more luxury features and access to a few higher-end  options. Finally, the top-trim <strong>Denali</strong> has features and options that put it in the near-luxury class, but it comes  with a near-luxury price.</p>]

[<p>The base <strong>SL</strong> trim can only be had with the turbocharged 1.5-liter  four-cylinder engine (170 hp, 203 lb-ft of torque) and a nine-speed automatic  transmission, driving the front wheels. Trailering equipment is the only major  optional upgrade available for the SL; beyond that it can't be upgraded. In  fact, only three paint colors are available, and only white doesn't come with  an added cost. </p>, <p>That said, the SL comes with a decent set  of standard features, including keyless ignition and entry, cruise control,  17-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a rearview camera, two  USB ports for the front seats, two charging-only USB ports for the rear, front  and rear 110-volt power outlets, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system,  Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and a six-speaker  sound system with satellite radio. GM's <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/teen-driver-technology">Teen  Driver</a> system and OnStar are also standard.</p>, <p>The <strong>SLE</strong> trim comes with largely the same standard equipment as the SL, adding an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, a compact spare tire and a handful of interior  trim-piece upgrades. However, the SLE also gets access to a host of options and  packages. </p>, <p>Packages include the Driver Convenience  package, which adds a power-adjustable driver seat, heated front seats,  dual-zone automatic climate control, roof rails and remote engine start. The  Infotainment I package adds an 8-inch touchscreen, a navigation system, a color  information display in the gauge cluster, an SD card reader, two extra USB  ports in the center console box, and a 110-volt outlet for the rear seat. The  Driver Alert I package adds heated mirrors, blind-spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors. Some of these add-ons can be had  individually, along with a panoramic sunroof and trailering equipment.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>SLT</strong> trim gets you leather upholstery and the Driver Convenience and  Infotainment I package (except for navigation). Upgrades for the SLT include  the Driver Alert I package and the Driver Alert II package, which adds  low-speed forward collision warning and mitigation with automatic braking, lane  departure warning with lane keeping assist, and automatic high beams. The  Infotainment II package adds navigation and a seven-speaker Bose stereo system.  Also available is the Preferred package, which includes a power liftgate,  driver-seat memory settings, a power passenger seat and a heated steering  wheel.</p>, <p>Two gas engines are available for the  Terrain. The 1.5-liter engine with front-wheel drive comes standard on both the  SLE and SLT trims, but both can be optioned with either a more powerful  gasoline engine or a more efficient diesel. The more powerful gas engine, a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (252 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), is  available and comes with dual exhaust tips and larger wheels. Also available is  a turbocharged 1.6-liter diesel-powered four-cylinder engine (137 hp, 240 lb-ft  of torque), paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. GMC estimates the  diesel will return 40 mpg highway. Equipping the diesel engine also adds the  Driver Convenience package for the SLE and the Preferred package for the SLT.</p>, <p>All three engines come standard with  front-wheel drive, but they can be optioned with all-wheel drive. A knob in AWD-equipped Terrains  allows drivers to switch between all-wheel drive and front-wheel drive on the  fly. </p>, <p>At the top of the Terrain range is the <strong>Denali</strong>, which can only be had with the  2.0-liter engine. The Denali receives unique styling cues and interior trim, as  well as Denali-specific 19-inch wheels and LED headlights. It bundles in the  Preferred package and Driver Alert I package, along with several other options  such as the panoramic sunroof. </p>, <p>Optional extras for the Terrain Denali  include the Driver Alert II package, along with the Advanced Safety package,  which adds a surround-view parking camera system and an automated parking  system. The Denali's Comfort package adds ventilated front seats and heated  rear seats, as well as a wireless phone charging pad.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 GMC Yukon occupies what little  space there is between the related Chevrolet Tahoe and the Cadillac Escalade.  Though less premium than the Escalade, it does offer a few more luxuries and  features than the Tahoe.</p>, <p>Like its siblings, the Yukon offers available  seating for nine and an impressive towing capacity. You also get plenty of  standard equipment. However, the Yukon's road manners and cargo utility aren't  up to par, and its elevated price point (compared to the Tahoe) pits it against  some more luxurious vehicles.</p>, <p>Buyers who demand the towing capacity of  a body-on-frame SUV should take a look at the all-new Ford Expedition and  Lincoln Navigator. Both promise impressive capability but with more utility and  comfort than the Yukon. </p>, <p>Those who need three rows but are willing  to sacrifice towing capacity have quite a few options. The Audi Q7 has  excellent driving dynamics and lots of advanced technology options. The Acura  MDX is similarly well-behaved on the road and offers plenty of luxury  trimmings. The price of the top trim Yukon Denali even makes a competitor of  the entry-level Mercedes-Benz GLS Class, which makes up what it lacks in  content with a much more upscale interior and refined driving experience. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV offered in <strong>SLE</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong> and <strong>Denali</strong> trim levels. Most Yukons seat  eight passengers, but an optional front bench seat on the SLE trim increases  the capacity to nine. Second-row bucket seats are available on the SLT trim and  standard on the Denali; they reduce passenger capacity to seven.</p>]

[<p>GMC  offers two different engines based on trim level. SLE and SLT models come with  a 5.3-liter V8 engine that produces 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of  torque. It is paired to a six-speed automatic transmission that sends power to  the rear wheels. Four-wheel drive is available with a single-speed transfer  case that is optional for all trims, and a two-speed transfer case with low-range  gearing is available. The Yukon Denali is powered by a 6.2-liter V8 that  produces 420 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with a new 10-speed  automatic and rear-wheel drive. The optional four-wheel drive includes a  standard two-speed transfer case.</p>, <p>Standard  features for the <strong>SLE</strong> trim include  18-inch wheels, heated mirrors, foglights, side steps, roof rails, front and  rear parking sensors, automatic wipers, cruise control, remote keyless entry  and ignition, and a trailer hitch receiver with a wiring harness.</p>, <p>On  the inside, you get tri-zone automatic climate control, front bucket seats  (with a 10-way power-adjustable driver seat), 60/40-split folding second- and  third-row seats, a tilt-only leather-wrapped steering wheel, a teen-driver  monitoring system, OnStar communications (including a 4G LTE connection and a  Wi-Fi hotspot), a 110-volt household power outlet, Bluetooth, an 8-inch  touchscreen, a rearview camera, five USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto,  and a Bose nine-speaker audio system with a CD player and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The  optional Enhanced Driver Alert package adds forward collision warning with  low-speed automatic braking, automatic high beams, and lane departure warning  and intervention. The Convenience package adds a power liftgate, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, power-adjustable pedals and a universal garage  door opener.</p>, <p>The <strong>SLT</strong> trim includes all of the above,  along with a hands-free liftgate, power-folding mirrors, an auto-dimming  driver-side mirror, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert,  keyless entry and ignition, leather upholstery, a heated and power  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 12-way power-adjustable front seats,  heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, power-folding second-  and third-row seats, driver-seat memory functions and a wireless charging pad.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>Denali</strong> trim adds the  larger engine and 10-speed transmission, 20-inch wheels, xenon headlights,  adaptive suspension dampers, a trailer brake controller, a head-up display,  active noise cancellation, second-row bucket seats, a navigation system and a  10-speaker surround-sound system. </p>, <p>Some  features on higher-trimmed models are available on supporting models at  additional cost. Optional features for SLE and SLT trims include 22-inch wheels  and an HD Trailering package (unique axle ratio, trailer brake controller and a  self-leveling suspension). The SLT and Denali are eligible for a sunroof,  adaptive cruise control with automatic braking, and a rear-seat entertainment  system. The Denali also offers power-retractable side steps and adaptive cruise  control.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Yukon XL's nine-passenger capacity and strong towing power make it  ideal for big families and recreational activities. But the Yukon's imposing  mass and traditional SUV design take a toll on maneuverability, fuel economy  and ride comfort.</p>, <p>You  expect as much in an SUV of this size. The utility is undeniable. Even with the  third-row seats deployed, it has 39.3 cubic feet of cargo space available. Fold  down the second and third rows, and you've got a whopping 121 cubic feet of  maximum cargo space at your disposal. If towing is your thing, the Yukon XL can  lug up to 8,300 pounds.</p>, <p>All  of this makes the Yukon XL a fairly mission-specific vehicle. Sure, for a big SUV, we've found  it easy to drive — as long as you're going straight. But navigating  tight parking lots and city streets requires caution, calculation and some  amount of faith in the space around the vehicle. </p>, <p>There's  also no escaping the Yukon XL's roots. The truck-based suspension can't deliver  the carlike ride comfort of a crossover. Nor is the Yukon a picture of  efficiency with an EPA-rated 18 mpg combined for a base four-wheel-drive  version. Finally, the price premium attached to GMC vehicles is a little hard  to justify given that the related Suburban has nearly all of the same features  at a lower price.</p>, <p>That  said, the Yukon XL's size, power and style will undoubtedly hit the mark for a  very specific buyer. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 GMC Yukon XL is a full-size SUV offered in <strong>SLE</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong> and <strong>Denali</strong> trim levels. The smaller <a href="/gmc/yukon/2018/suv/">Yukon</a> is covered in a separate review.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>SLE</strong> base trim starts with a  5.3-liter V8 engine (355 horsepower, 383 pound-feet of torque) paired to a  six-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard; four-wheel  drive is optional. </p>, <p>Standard  SLE features include 18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, side steps, roof rails,  front and rear parking sensors, automatic wipers and a trailer hitch receiver  with a wiring harness. Standard interior features include tri-zone automatic  climate control, power-adjustable front seats, and 60/40-split folding second-  and third-row seats. </p>, <p>Also  included is a 110-volt power outlet, an 8-inch touchscreen interface, a  rearview camera, Bluetooth, OnStar communications (with a 4G LTE connection and  Wi-Fi hotspot), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a nine-speaker Bose audio  system with CD player, satellite and HD radio and a USB input. GM's Teen Driver  monitoring system, which limits certain vehicle settings for young drivers,  also comes standard. </p>, <p>The  optional Enhanced Driver Alert package adds forward collision alert with  automatic low-speed emergency braking, a vibrating safety-alert driver seat,  automatic high beams, and lane departure warning and intervention. The  Convenience package adds a power-operated liftgate, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, power-adjustable pedals and a universal garage door opener.</p>, <p>The  SLE also offers an optional front bench seat that increases capacity to nine  passengers. </p>, <p>The <strong>SLT</strong> trim includes all of the  features listed above and adds a hands-free liftgate, blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert, keyless entry and ignition, leather upholstery,  a heated and power-adjustable steering wheel, heated and ventilated front  seats, heated second-row seats, power-folding second- and third-row seats, and  driver-seat memory functions.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>Denali</strong> trim adds a  more powerful 6.2-liter V8 engine (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), a 10-speed  automatic transmission, 20-inch wheels, xenon headlights, adaptive suspension  dampers, a trailer brake controller, a head-up instrument display, active noise  cancellation, second-row bucket seats, a navigation system, a wireless  smartphone charging pad and a 10-speaker surround-sound audio system.</p>, <p>The  new-for-2018 Denali Ultimate package bundles 22-inch wheels, a sunroof, power  side steps, adaptive cruise control, a rear seat entertainment system with DVD  player, and an extended satellite radio and traffic information subscription,  among other items. </p>, <p>Many  of the Denali's features are offered as options on SLT trims, while options for  SLE and SLT trims include 22-inch wheels and a heavy-duty trailering package  (unique axle ratio, trailer brake controller and a self-leveling suspension). </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in  multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this  review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015  GMC Yukon XL Denali </strong>(6.2L V8 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Yukon XL has received some  revisions, including a new 10-speed automatic transmission for 2018 Denali  trims. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Yukon XL. </p>]

[<p>Thanks  to the increasing popularity of crossovers, midsize sedans are no longer the  default vehicle of choice for small families. Automakers aren't giving up the  fight, however, with a number of traditionally popular models significantly  refreshed or fully redesigned this year. Headlining the list is the 2018 Honda  Accord, and its improvements are dramatic.</p>, <p>It  starts on the outside. The new Accord's fastback profile and pronounced styling  lines make it look more luxurious and European than the norm. Inside, Honda has  thoroughly reworked the interior, and it's now one of the nicest cabins in the  class. On the top Touring trim, there's a pleasing mix of soft-touch plastic,  leather upholstery, faux-leather door inserts, and convincing open-pore wood  trim on the dash. Even on lower levels such as the Sport, the cabin is decked  out with carbon-fiber-look trim and faux-leather-trimmed seats. </p>, <p>Front  and center is a new touchscreen that is much easier to use than the old system.  Unlike the last Accord — which featured a touchpad-only interface  that was slow and often maddening to use — the new screen is  thoughtfully laid out and uses physical buttons and knobs for tuning and  high-level navigational functions. The touchscreen, which is standard on all  but the base LX model, also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. </p>, <p>Pleasingly,  the Accord also offers plenty of advanced driving features. Adaptive cruise  control, forward collision warning with automatic braking, and lane departure  warning and mitigation are optional on other Hondas, but they are standard on  every Accord. Top-notch crash test safety scores give you added peace of mind,  too.</p>, <p>Overall,  the redesigned 2018 Honda Accord significantly moves the needle forward in the  midsize sedan segment. Its many strengths and lack of major drawbacks make it  an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a spacious, comfortable and  upscale four-door.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Honda Accord as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Honda Accord is sold in five trim levels. The <strong>LX </strong>is the most affordable model and is loaded with features,  including dual-zone climate control and advanced safety features. The <strong>Sport </strong>doesn't cost much more and comes  with some visual upgrades and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay compatibility. The <strong>EX </strong>gives up some of the Sport's flair  but counts a sunroof and heated front seats among its upgrades. The <strong>EX-L</strong> primarily adds leather upholstery,  while the top-trim <strong>Touring </strong>boasts every  feature available on the Accord, including adaptive dampers for an even cushier  ride.</p>]

[<p>A  direct-injected, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine (192 horsepower,  192 pound-feet of torque) is standard on all trim levels. It comes connected to  a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that helps achieve fuel  economy of up to 33 mpg combined with front-wheel drive (optional all-wheel  drive is curiously absent). If you're looking for a little more excitement, a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (252 hp, 273 lb-ft) is available on Sport,  EX-L and Touring models. A 10-speed traditional automatic is paired to this  engine. A six-speed manual transmission is a no-cost option on the Sport model  regardless of engine. </p>, <p>Standard  features on the base <strong>LX </strong>model  include 17-inch alloy wheels, LED exterior lighting (headlights, taillights and  running lights), automatic high-beam control, a rearview camera, push-button  ignition, a driver information display, dual-zone automatic climate control, a  height-adjustable driver seat, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, and a  four-speaker audio system with a USB port. Standard driver aids include lane  departure warning and intervention, adaptive cruise control, and forward  collision warning with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>Sport </strong>adds 19-inch wheels,  LED foglights, a rear spoiler, chrome exhaust tips, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with four-way power lumbar),  a 60/40-split rear bench, cloth and simulated leather upholstery, an 8-inch  touchscreen, and an eight-speaker audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto. </p>, <p>The <strong>EX </strong>builds off the LX model, adding  the Sport's interior upgrades (minus the Sport's unique upholstery and shift  paddles), 17-inch wheels, heated mirrors, a sunroof, keyless entry and  ignition, blind-spot monitoring, heated front seats, rear air vents, an  additional USB port, and satellite and HD radio. </p>, <p>The <strong>EX-L</strong> further adds an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, driver-seat memory settings, a four-way power passenger seat,  leather upholstery and a 10-speaker audio system. A navigation system is  optional. </p>, <p>At  the top of the ladder is the <strong>Touring </strong>trim,  which equips the Accord with 19-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers,  chrome exterior trim, illuminated door handles, automatic wipers, front and  rear parking sensors, adjustable driving modes, a head-up display, ventilated  front seats, heated rear seats, the navigation system, a Wi-Fi hotspot and a  wireless phone charger.</p>, <p>Models  with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine are essentially the same as their  1.5-liter counterparts, but the <strong>Sport  2.0T</strong> is equipped with keyless entry, heated front seats and blind-spot  monitoring.</p>]

[<p>The  Honda Accord Hybrid has been a class leader for some time thanks to its  excellent fuel economy, roomy interior, and above-average handling and  acceleration. For 2018, the Accord Hybrid gets even better. Like the regular  Accord, it's fully redesigned and has even more interior space, plus a sharp,  new look and new technology and safety features.</p>, <p>Now standard safety features such as adaptive cruise control, forward collision  mitigation, blind-spot monitoring and lane departure warning add quite a bit of  value to the base Accord Hybrid. The new Accord Hybrid also gets an upgrade to  cargo capacity thanks to a repackaged hybrid battery. Previously, the Accord  Hybrid's battery pack kept you from folding down the rear seat, but no more.  The Hybrid now gets the same 60/40-split folding rear seat and the same cargo  space as the standard Accord: 16.7 cubic feet. </p>, <p>Underneath  the hood, the 2018 Accord Hybrid has the same powertrain as last year's model:  a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a pair of electric motors. The hybrid system has lost a step  in the changeover, even if it is a tiny one, going from an EPA-estimated 48 mpg  combined in 2017 to 47 mpg combined this year. Still, it's an impressive number  for a car this size. </p>, <p>In  short, one of the best hybrid sedans just got better. If you're looking for a  practical hybrid with enough space in the back seat for adults, the 2018 Honda  Accord Hybrid should be at the top of your list. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Honda Accord Hybrid comes in five trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>EX</strong>, <strong>EX-L</strong>, <strong>EX-L w/Navi</strong> and <strong>Touring</strong>.  Powering every 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine  hitched up to a pair of electric motors that are fed by a lithium-ion battery  pack. Total system power is 212 horsepower.</p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment for the <strong>base </strong>Hybrid  includes 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED taillights, keyless  ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, a manually adjustable  driver's seat, a 7-inch central display, active noise cancellation, Bluetooth,  a rearview camera, and a four-speaker sound system with a USB port. Adaptive  cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic braking, lane  departure warning and lane keeping assist are also standard.</p>, <p>Going  with the <strong>EX</strong> gets you the above, plus  a sunroof, LED foglights, heated mirrors, heated front seats, a  power-adjustable driver's seat, an 8-inch touchscreen with upgraded smartphone  integration (via HondaLink, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), and an upgraded  sound system with eight speakers, satellite and HD radio and an additional USB  port. Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is also standard on  the EX.</p>, <p>Move  up to the <strong>EX-L</strong> for an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, driver memory settings, a power-adjustable front passenger  seat, leather upholstery, and a 10-speaker stereo. The <strong>EX-L w/Navi</strong> is equipped like an EX-L but with the added benefit of a  navigation system. </p>, <p>Lastly,  the <strong>Touring</strong> adds adaptive suspension  dampers, LED headlights with automatic high-beam control, front and rear  parking sensors, wireless smartphone charging, a driver head-up display,  ventilated front seats and heated rear seats.</p>]

[<p>It's hard to overstate how much we like the 2018 Honda Civic. Equipped with the  turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, it's one of the best cars in its  class for delivering both impressive acceleration and high fuel economy.  Inside, it has plenty of room for passengers, clever storage solutions and more  cargo space than most competitors in any body style. It also offers technology  features that put some other compact cars to shame and safety ratings that are  among the best. </p>, <p>Available as a sedan, coupe or hatchback,  in a variety of powertrains, the Civic has a version for every niche, and all  of them are good. Want more sauce? There's the sportier Civic Si, as well as  the absolutely bananas Civic Type R. Just as impressive, neither one sacrifices  the qualities we love about the standard variants. </p>, <p>The Civic does have some weaknesses. The  infotainment interface is far from the easiest system to use, and the available  forward collision alert system is prone to overreaction. Also, though cargo  volume is good, the sloping rear glass of the hatchback and deck of the sedan  mean that taller or bulkier items can sometimes be hard to fit. </p>, <p>There are competitors with specific  strengths that make them worth checking out. The Mazda 3 is engaging to drive  and, in higher trims, offers a near-luxury cabin. The Subaru Impreza, which  comes standard with all-wheel drive, and the value-packed Kia Forte also merit  consideration. Overall, though, the Civic wins the day with its multitude of  strengths.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Honda Civic Si as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Honda Civic is a compact car offered as a sedan, coupe or hatchback. The  sedan is available in six different trim levels: <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>EX</strong>, <strong>EX-T</strong>, <strong>EX-L</strong>, <strong>Touring </strong>and <strong>Si</strong>. There are also three  hatchback-specific trims — <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Sport Touring</strong> and <strong>Type R</strong> — and one  coupe-specific trim, <strong>LX-P</strong>.</p>]

[<p>Note  that the following trim level feature info primarily relates to the sedan. The  coupe and hatchback are similarly equipped but can vary slightly in certain  instances.</p>, <p>Though  it may be the base trim, the standard Civic <strong>LX </strong>sedan comes with a lot of equipment for the money. Standard  equipment highlights include a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (158 horsepower,  138 lb-ft of torque), a six-speed manual transmission (a continuously variable  automatic transmission is also available), front-wheel drive, 16-inch steel  wheels, LED running lights, 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks, automatic  climate control and a height-adjustable driver seat. Electronics features  include a 5-inch central display screen, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, and a  four-speaker sound system with a USB port.</p>, <p>Optional  for just about every Civic is the <strong>Honda  Sensing</strong> safety package. It includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure  warning and intervention, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>In  the Civic Hatchback, the LX trim comes with the turbocharged 1.5-liter engine  (174 horsepower, 167 lb-ft of torque), while the coupe-only <strong>LX-P</strong> trim comes standard with the  2.0-liter engine, the CVT automatic, a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, and  remote start.</p>, <p>The  hatchback-specific <strong>Sport</strong> comes with  the LX equipment plus a more powerful version of the turbocharged engine (180  hp, 177 lb-ft of torque), 18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a center-outlet dual  exhaust, aerodynamic bodywork, a rear center armrest with cupholders, and a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.</p>, <p>The  Honda Civic <strong>EX</strong> sedan builds off the  base LX, adding the CVT as standard along with a sunroof, alloy wheels, heated  side mirrors, a rear center armrest with cupholders, an eight-speaker audio  system with dual USB ports, Honda's LaneWatch blind-spot camera, dynamic  guidelines for the rearview camera, keyless ignition and entry with remote  start, and a 7-inch touchscreen interface with satellite radio, <a href="https://hondalink.honda.com/hondalink">HondaLink</a>, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration (including app-based navigation). </p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>EX-T</strong> sedan gets you the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder  engine. Thanks to impressive acceleration and big fuel economy numbers (up to  32 mpg city), the turbocharged four-cylinder is enough reason alone to buy an  EX-T Civic or above if you're opting for the sedan. But the EX-T also adds  17-inch wheels, foglights, dual-zone automatic climate control and heated front  seats. For  the coupe, the EX-T gets an upgraded 10-speaker stereo system. The EX hatchback  is equipped similarly to the EX-T sedan, lacking only the sedan's heated front  seats.</p>, <p>Right  near the top of the heap is the <strong>EX-L</strong> sedan, which gets leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver seat and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror. An integrated navigation system is available as  an option. </p>, <p>The  hatchback-only <strong>Sport Touring </strong>essentially  builds off the regular Sport trim and adds different 18-inch wheels, LED  headlights, automatic wipers, a four-way power passenger seat, heated rear  seats and a 12-speaker audio system. Also standard is the Honda Sensing safety  package. </p>, <p>The<strong> Touring</strong> trim level (for the sedan and coupe) essentially comes with the  same equipment as the Sport Touring hatchback noted above, but the stereo has  10 speakers instead of 12. </p>, <p>The <strong>Si</strong> is a midlevel performance version of the Civic that comes as a coupe or sedan,  both with a more powerful version of the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder  engine (205 hp, 192 pound-feet of torque). A six-speed manual is the only  transmission offered. Standard equipment is similar to what Honda has on the  EX-T trim, but you also get a sport-tuned multilink suspension with adaptive  dampers, bigger front brakes, a limited-slip front differential, a unique rear  spoiler, Si branded seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, the 10-speaker  stereo, and a unique instrument panel with faux carbon-fiber surfaces.</p>, <p>For detailed Civic Si information and  driving impressions, please read our <a href="/car-news/first-impressions/2017-honda-civic-si-first-drive.html">First Drive Si review</a>.</p>, <p>At the top of the performance ladder for  the Civic is the hatchback-only <strong>Type R</strong>.  It is equipped much like the Sport Touring trim level, but it gets a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (306 hp, 285 lb-ft). Like the Si,  it is only available with a six-speed manual transmission. Other additions  include 20-inch wheels with high-performance tires, bigger front and rear  brakes, a massive rear wing, a Type R-specific suspension with adaptive  dampers, and special interior and exterior styling enhancements.  </p>, <p>You can also learn more about the new  Type R in our <a href="/car-news/first-impressions/2017-honda-civic-type-r-first-drive.html">First Drive Type R review.</a></p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Honda Civic Touring Sedan</strong> (turbo 1.5L inline-4 | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Honda Civic has received some  revisions, including the introduction of performance-oriented trim levels and  minor adjustments to features. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's Honda Civic.<strong></strong></p>]

[<p>The 2018 Honda Clarity range now includes  plug-in hybrid and electric versions that join the Clarity Fuel Cell. All  versions of the Clarity share the same basic design — they are  front-wheel-drive, four-door sedans that are similar to an Accord in size. But  the three variants vary widely in their power sources and driving range. </p>, <p>The Clarity Fuel Cell debuted last year.  It's an electric car that, instead of being recharged by a plug, generates  electricity from compressed hydrogen stored on board. By combining the hydrogen  with oxygen from the air, the Fuel Cell emits water and electricity as  byproducts. </p>, <p>This setup allows the Clarity Fuel Cell  to be refueled in three to five minutes for travel up to 366 miles. These  figures far outshine the recharging time and range of any battery electric  vehicle in production today. Though the Honda Clarity Fuel Cell is an <a href="/car-awards/ces-techdriven/most-innovative-car-of-the-year-2018-honda-clarity.html">Edmunds CES Tech Driven Award</a> winner for its innovation, it relies on a fledgling hydrogen refueling  infrastructure and is sold only in California. </p>, <p>A more versatile and more widely  available model is the Clarity Electric, which went on sale late in the 2017 model year.  It's a battery electric  vehicle just like other EVs such as the Nissan Leaf. But its driving range of  just 89 miles is disappointing, and we recommend you look elsewhere first if  you're shopping for an electric vehicle.</p>, <p>That leaves us with the Clarity Plug-In  Hybrid, the newly introduced and final piece of the Clarity triad. Comparable  to vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt or the Toyota Prius Prime, the PHEV is a  plug-in hybrid that can recharge at home and drive an EPA-estimated 48 miles on  pure electric power before it switches over to regular hybrid gasoline power. </p>, <p>Of the three Clarity versions, the  Plug-In Hybrid is the most convincing and has the broadest appeal to consumers.  It's comfortable, has a solid amount of electric range, and should serve you well  as a frugal and well-equipped hybrid. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Honda Clarity is offered in  three distinct versions that differ in how they provide propulsion —<strong> </strong><strong>Electric, Fuel Cell </strong>and<strong> Plug-In Hybrid</strong>. Honda offers the  Electric and Fuel Cell in just one trim level, but the Plug-In Hybrid comes in  two trims.</p>]

[<p>The Clarity <strong>Plug-In Hybrid</strong> starts you off in either base<strong> </strong>or Touring<strong> </strong>trim. Both  come with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine paired to an electric motor  hybrid system (total system: 212 hp, 232 lb-ft), along with a 17-kWh  lithium-ion battery. The electric-only range is estimated at 47 miles, and fuel  economy for regular hybrid operation is 42 mpg.</p>, <p>The base trim features include keyless  entry and start, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, an  8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, two USB ports, an  eight-speaker sound system, and the Honda Sensing suite of driver assistance  features. The Touring trim adds power-adjustable front seats, leather  upholstery, a navigation system, and remote climate-control preconditioning. </p>, <p>The Clarity <strong>Fuel Cell</strong> is a single-trim model generously equipped with pretty  much all of the above features, though it has a premium 12-speaker sound  system. All Clarity Fuel Cell models are powered by an electric motor (174 hp,  221 lb-ft) that drives the front wheels. The tanks hold enough compressed  hydrogen for an EPA-estimated 366 miles of emission-free motoring.</p>, <p>If you prefer a simpler Clarity, the Clarity <strong>Electric</strong> is for you. With an electric motor (161 hp, 221 lb-ft)  driving the front wheels and a relatively small (25.5-kWh) lithium-ion battery  under the back seat, the Clarity Electric is the lightest Clarity of them all.  But its EPA-estimated range of 89 miles puts it near the bottom of the EV pack.  Otherwise, it's a well-equipped and fine-driving car. Like the Fuel Cell, it's  available in a single trim level. </p>]

[<p>The Honda CR-V was redesigned last year  and, frankly, we were surprised by how deep the changes went. Rather than phone  in some superficial tweaks to a top-selling model, Honda gave it a ground-up  overhaul that decisively parted ways with its predecessor. The 2018 Honda CR-V  sets a new pace for its rivals to follow. </p>, <p>Among the tricks up this fifth-generation  CR-V's sleeve is a turbocharged engine that comes on all trims except for the  base LX. With ample low-end torque and a fuel-sipping design — fuel  economy climbs as high as 34 mpg highway, according to EPA estimates  — the turbo engine is a natural fit in the CR-V. </p>, <p>The 2018 Honda CR-V also benefits from an  overhauled suspension that reduces body roll in corners without compromising  its historically compliant ride. The wheelbase is longer, the front and rear  tracks are wider, and there's even an extra 1.5 inches of ground clearance for  those who found that the previous CR-V scraped its stomach too often in  light-duty off-roading. All-wheel drive remains an option for those mild  excursions into the dirt, as well as for increased stability in wet weather. </p>, <p>Inside, the CR-V follows the latest  Civic's lead with a modernized dashboard, a digitally enhanced instrument  cluster, and an updated touchscreen that thankfully includes a physical volume  knob. There's also more rear legroom than in earlier models and an exceptional  75.8 cubic feet of maximum cargo space that makes the supposedly compact CR-V a  legitimate alternative to midsize SUVs. </p>, <p>Add it all up and the CR-V is a strong  contender for best-in-class honors, despite tough competition from crossover  rivals such as the more rugged Subaru Forester and the more athletic Nissan  Rogue.</p>, <p>Notably,  we picked the 2018 Honda CR-V as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-family-suv/">Best Family SUVs</a> and <a href="/suv/articles/best-small-suvs/">Best Small SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Honda CR-V is offered in four trim levels:<strong> LX, EX, EX-L and Touring</strong>. The <strong>LX</strong> isn't exactly bare-bones, but it  does have a less powerful engine along with a 5-inch display screen and no  sunroof. Step up to the <strong>EX</strong> and you  get a standard sunroof plus a 7-inch touchscreen, a power driver seat and a  more powerful, turbocharged engine. The <strong>EX-L </strong>tacks on items such as leather, premium audio and a power liftgate, while  the <strong>Touring </strong>goes all in with LED  headlights, a subwoofer and more.</p>]

[<p>Opt for the base <strong>LX </strong>and you'll get a decent roster of equipment, including a  2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (184 horsepower, 180 pound-feet of torque)  paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission and front-wheel drive,  an electronic parking brake, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED running lights,  automatic climate control, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  5-inch color LCD dashboard display, and a four-speaker audio system with  Bluetooth and USB connectivity. Honda's various advanced safety technologies  are not offered on the LX, although all-wheel drive is optional as on all  trims.</p>, <p>The <strong>EX </strong>ups the ante with a more powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine (190  hp, 179 lb-ft), remote start, 18-inch wheels, foglights, heated mirrors,  body-colored door handles and spoiler, rear privacy glass, a retractable cargo  cover, keyless entry and start, an upgraded driver information center, a  sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver's seat, and heated  front seats. </p>, <p>Infotainment features include a 7-inch  touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Audio phone integration, satellite  radio, an upgraded rearview camera with dynamic guidelines, numerous advanced  safety features (automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and intervention, adaptive cruise  control, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking) and  second-row USB charging ports.</p>, <p>The <strong>EX-L</strong>'s  upgrades include a programmable-height power liftgate, driver-seat memory  settings, leather upholstery, a power passenger seat (though it lacks a height  adjustment), a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, and an eight-speaker audio system with HD radio. A navigation  system is optional on the EX-L but not on the lesser trims.</p>, <p>The top-of-the-line <strong>Touring </strong>boasts LED headlights, dual chrome exhaust tips, roof  rails, automatic wipers, hands-free functionality for the power liftgate,  ambient interior lighting, a navigation system and a subwoofer for the audio  system.</p>, <p>Aside from the EX-L's optional navigation  system, there are no factory options for the 2018 CR-V, so the only question is  which trim level is right for you.</p>]

[<p>It's been a little bit more than a decade  now that Honda has been selling its subcompact Fit hatchback. It's been a  favorite of ours since day one, thanks to its impressive roominess, standout  utility and frugal fuel economy. For 2018, the Fit receives a host of  improvements that make it an even more appealing choice.</p>, <p>Inside, you'll find an upgraded  infotainment interface that now supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay  smartphone integration. Honda has also added new active safety technology that  includes adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning and intervention.  The Fit's mechanical bits are largely unchanged, but Honda has added more noise  insulation and improved the Fit's suspension and steering for quicker  responses. That means the Fit is a better daily driver and a nicer place to  spend time — areas where it was already beating much of its  competition.</p>, <p>This quieter, more technologically  relevant Fits retains all the other qualities that made it a solid choice. The  Magic Seat rear bench seat is still here, and it allows for quite a few storage  and seating arrangements. Parking remains a breeze, too, thanks to the car's  small footprint, nimble handling, and short doors that allow easy ingress and  egress even in tight spaces.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Fit isn't the only choice  for a small hatchback, of course. The Kia Soul has even more cargo space than  the Fit, but it is also heavier and less efficient, and the Kia Rio hatchback  is all-new for 2018. Then there's the Toyota Yaris iA, which is surprisingly  engaging to drive, but, as a sedan, can't match the Fit for practicality.  Buyers for whom range anxiety isn't an issue might consider the all-electric  Chevrolet Bolt, which makes for an excellent commuter car or city runabout  within its 238-mile range.</p>]

[<p>For  2018, the Honda Fit comes in four trim levels: <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>EX</strong> and <strong>EX-L</strong>. All Fits have a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that drives  the front wheels. A standard six-speed manual or optional CVT automatic is  available on all but the EX-L trim, which only comes with the automatic. With  the manual transmission, the engine is rated at 130 horsepower and 114  pound-feet of torque. Those numbers drop slightly to 128 hp and 113 lb-ft with  the CVT.</p>]

[<p>The  Fit <strong>LX</strong> gets you 15-inch steel  wheels, a rearview camera, remote entry, air-conditioning, cruise control, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and driver-seat height adjustment.  Infotainment duties are handled by a 5-inch display screen with Bluetooth and a  four-speaker stereo. Of course, you also get the Fit's 60/40-split folding rear  Magic Seat. These seats can be positioned in a number of configurations, making  the Fit able to handle more types of cargo than other typical hatchbacks. </p>, <p>If  you opt for the CVT automatic, you'll also get forward collision warning with  emergency automatic braking, lane departure warning and intervention, and  adaptive cruise control. </p>, <p>The  new-for-2018 <strong>Sport</strong> trim adds some  sporty styling highlights, as well as 16-inch alloy wheels, foglights, and a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The Sport's infotainment system  is a 7-inch touchscreen interface that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  It also includes a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio. </p>, <p>In <strong>EX</strong> guise, the Fit receives a  sunroof, proximity entry with push-button start, and extendable sun visors.  Both manual and CVT-equipped cars get Honda Sensing, which on the EX also  includes LaneWatch —  a camera mounted to the passenger-side mirror that gives a clear view of the  adjoining lane when the right turn signal is activated.</p>, <p>At  the top of the Fit range, the <strong>EX-L</strong> adds heated side mirrors, heated front seats and leather upholstery. Navigation  is a stand-alone option for the EX-L.</p>, <p>Also  new for 2018 is a Honda Factory Performance (HFP) kit that features both  aesthetic and functional upgrades. This dealer add-on includes a unique shift  knob, floor mats, spoiler and black wheels, along with a unique suspension that  improves handling without hurting ride comfort.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Honda Fit EX</strong> (1.5L inline-4  | CVT automatic | FWD) as well as a first drive of a <strong>2018 Honda Fit EX-L </strong>(1.5L inline-4 | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since the 2015 test was conducted, the current Honda Fit has received some  revisions, including new safety and technology features, driver aids, more  sound insulation, and updates to suspension and steering. Our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's Honda Fit, however.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Honda HR-V is a master of versatility and a strong contender in the  subcompact SUV segment. Despite its small size, it'll accommodate adults just  fine up front or in back, and there's plenty of flexible cargo space options. </p>, <p>Just  like the Honda Fit, the HR-V employs one of Honda's clever innovations called  the Magic Seat. You can lift and flip up the rear-seat bottoms to create a  cargo area from the floor to ceiling, which is perfect for transporting taller  items like a flat-screen TV or a bicycle. With all the seats in place, the  space is surprisingly suitable for average-size adults, too.</p>, <p>Another  advantage to the HR-V's diminutive engine is its fuel efficiency. It can be  paired with a six-speed manual transmission, but the continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT) is more efficient overall, and it's required if  you want all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>On  the downside, the HR-V's efficient engine delivers lackluster acceleration, and  the touchscreen infotainment system demands more of your attention to use  compared to some competitors. The HR-V also feels somewhat unrefined because of  the amount of cabin noise present, which is a little unusual for Honda.  Shortcomings aside, though, the HR-V is still one of the better picks for a  subcompact vehicle, and it offers decent value overall.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Honda HR-V as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-small-suvs/" title="Best Small SUVs">Best Small SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 HR-V is the least expensive crossover in Honda's stable, but thanks to the number of features offered, it doesn't have to feel like an econobox special.  There are three trim levels available: <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>EX</strong> and <strong>EX-L Navi</strong>. All three models are powered by a 1.8-liter  four-cylinder engine (141 horsepower, 127 pound-feet of torque) and either  paired with a six-speed manual (with front-wheel drive only) or a CVT automatic  (front- or all-wheel drive). </p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights for the <strong>LX</strong> include 17-inch wheels, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat with Honda's  Magic Seat feature, a 5-inch central display screen, a rearview camera,  Bluetooth, and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player and a USB port.</p>, <p>The <strong>EX</strong> trim adds a sunroof, rear privacy  glass, automatic headlights, foglights, heated mirrors, keyless entry and  ignition, heated front seats, automatic climate control, dynamic guidelines for  the rearview camera, a passenger-side blind-spot camera (Honda's LaneWatch), a  7-inch touchscreen display, a six-speaker sound system (with an additional USB  port), and HondaLink smartphone apps and integration.</p>, <p>Lastly,  the range-topping <strong>EX-L Navi</strong> comes  with roof rails, leather upholstery, a navigation system with voice  recognition, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and satellite and HD radio.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Honda HR-V EX-L</strong> w/Navigation (1.8L  inline-4 | CVT automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>Note:  Since this test was conducted, the HR-V has not received any significant  revisions. Our findings remain applicable to this year's model.</p>]

[<p>It's the "R" word: responsibility. Once upon a  time, your life was fun and carefree. You only had to worry about yourself. You  could stay out late, take impromptu trips to the lake with friends or hang out  at sun-drenched cafes on Sunday mornings sipping flat whites and gossiping  about the friends you just went to the lake with. But that was then. Now you  have kids. You look at these miracles of life you're responsible for (and the  insane pile of stuff that you need to schlep along with them) and you think,  "I'm gonna need a bigger and safer car." Enter the 2018 Honda  Odyssey.</p>, <p>Honda's been selling the Odyssey since 1995, and the fully  redesigned 2018 represents the van's fifth generation. There have been a lot of  evolutionary improvements along the way, but the basic functionality remains.  The Odyssey has three rows of seating, sliding rear doors and more room for  cargo than just about anything short of a full-size van. For 2018, the  Odyssey's upgrades include improved performance and some truly useful upgrades  such as the enhanced sliding of the second-row seats and the cabin-monitoring  camera system. You can read more about these features in our <a href="/car-news/first-impressions/2018-honda-odyssey-first-drive.html">2018 Honda Odyssey First Drive</a>. </p>, <p>Overall, we're fond of this Odyssey and think it's a wise  choice, particularly if you're a new parent or if you're looking to own  something with that same driving spirit found in other Honda automobiles. It  makes that whole responsibility thing a little easier to swallow, too.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Odyssey comes in six trim levels: <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>EX</strong>, <strong>EX-L</strong>, <strong>EX-L with Navi and RES</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong> and <strong>Elite</strong>. In typical Honda fashion, there aren't any packages or  stand-alone options offered so finding the Odyssey you want largely comes down  to picking a trim that matches your desired features and budget. All Odysseys  come with a 3.5-liter V6 (280 horsepower, 262 pound-feet of torque) and  front-wheel drive. The first four trim levels come with a nine-speed automatic  and the Touring and Elite have a 10-speed automatic. There's seating for seven  passengers in the LX and eight passengers in everything else. </p>]

[<p>The Odyssey <strong>LX</strong> starts you off with features such as 18-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera,  automatic climate control, power front seats, a 60/40-split folding third-row  seat, a 5-inch central display screen, Bluetooth, a USB charging port, and a  seven-speaker sound system with a USB interface.</p>, <p>Next up is the <strong>EX</strong>,  and it's here that you get features that really start to make your life easier.  These include power-sliding rear doors, keyless ignition and entry, remote  engine start, three-zone automatic climate control, driver-seat power lumbar  adjustment, heated front seats, enhanced sliding functionality for the second-row  outboard seats, a removable center seat and second-row window sunshades. The EX  also has more modern tech with its 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration and satellite and HD radio. But, wait,  there's more! Honda also fits this trim level with extra driver safety aids  that include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and mitigation,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and lane departure warning  and intervention. </p>, <p>Honda starts to crank up the luxury with the <strong>EX-L. </strong>You get a sunroof, a  noise-reducing windshield, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a power liftgate,  leather upholstery, driver-seat memory settings and two charging USB ports for  the second row. </p>, <p>The <strong>EX-L with  Navigation and Rear Entertainment System</strong> is similar but adds, as its name  implies, a navigation system and a rear-seat entertainment system. The latter  includes a 10.2-inch overhead display, a Blu-ray player and an HDMI input. This  version of the EX-L also has a 110-volt power outlet and a cabin intercom  system (broadcasts the driver's/front passenger's voice to the rear seating  areas). </p>, <p>Moving up to the Odyssey <strong>Touring</strong> gets you the above plus front and rear parking sensors, LED  headlights, automatic engine stop-start, a hands-free liftgate, an integrated  vacuum cleaner, a rear cabin camera monitoring system and an onboard 4G LTE  connection with a Wi-Fi hotspot and HondaLink services. </p>, <p>Finally, the <strong>Elite</strong> tops off the Odyssey range with 19-inch wheels, power-folding mirrors, noise-reducing  glass for the front and rear windows, ventilated front seats, an 11-speaker  premium audio system and a wireless phone charger.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Honda Pilot SUV has a lot to offer shoppers in the market for a family  hauler. It has almost as much interior room as a minivan but provides a lot  more capability. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel-drive configurations,  the Pilot comes standard with a strong V6 engine that helps it tow up to 5,000  pounds and is built tough enough for some light off-roading. At the same time,  its comfortable and feature-packed cabin provides a near-luxury experience for  as many as eight passengers. And, unlike some competitors, there's enough room  behind the third-row seat for their luggage and other belongings.</p>, <p>Although the Pilot remains a top choice  in this class, there are a few minor issues that potential buyers should  consider. Some of the active safety features, such as adaptive cruise control,  are set up to err on the side of caution, making them seem oversensitive. We're  not particularly fond of the way the optional nine-speed transmission shifts  either. But despite these quibbles, we highly recommend a test drive in a Honda  Pilot if you're looking for a roomy, comfortable, reliable three-row family  vehicle.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Honda Pilot as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> and <a href="/suv/articles/best-family-suv/" title="Best Family SUVs">Best Family SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Honda Pilot is a three-row crossover SUV that provides a good  alternative to a minivan. It is offered in <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>EX</strong>, <strong>EX-L</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong> and the <strong>Elite</strong> trim levels. All seat eight  people, with the exception of the Elite, which has second-row captain's chairs  that reduce capacity to seven. </p>]

[<p>For basic family transportation, the base <strong>LX</strong> Pilot makes a lot of sense. It  might be the entry-level trim, but it definitely isn't bare-bones. Standard  features include a 3.5-liter V6 engine (280 horsepower, 262 pound-feet of  torque), a six-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch alloy wheels, air  conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and a 60/40-split folding  third-row seat. Technology features include a 5-inch central display screen, a  seven-speaker sound system, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, an auxiliary audio  jack and a USB port.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a few more tech and  safety features, then you should probably step up to the <strong>EX</strong>. It adds automatic headlights, foglights, LED running lights,  heated mirrors, remote engine start, the Honda LaneWatch blind-spot camera,  dynamic guidelines for the rearview camera, three-zone automatic climate  control and a power-adjustable driver seat. </p>, <p>Also included with the EX is an  Intelligent Traction Management system (adds a Snow mode for the  front-wheel-drive version and Snow/Sand/Mud modes with AWD), an 8-inch  touchscreen interface, HondaLink smartphone-enabled features, and an upgraded  seven-speaker sound system with two additional higher-powered USB ports,  satellite radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and Pandora  internet radio control. </p>, <p>Although much of its equipment is the  same as in the EX, the <strong>EX-L</strong> gets  several creature comforts that make it worth a closer look. It adds a sunroof,  a power tailgate, a noise-reducing windshield, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, leather upholstery, one-touch sliding second-row seats, a  power-adjustable front passenger seat, heated front seats and an auto-dimming  rearview mirror. It also keeps the six-speed transmission, which is a big part  of why we recommend this trim level.</p>, <p>For some added safety, the EX and EX-L  trim levels both offer the optional <strong>Honda  Sensing</strong> package. It adds adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning  and mitigation (with automatic braking), road departure intervention, and lane  departure warning and intervention. The EX-L can also be equipped with a  navigation system <em>or</em> a rear entertainment  system that includes a Blu-ray player with a single overhead screen, HDMI and  RCA ports, two additional USB ports for the second row, second-row sunshades  and a 115-volt power outlet. Note that these EX-L options cannot be combined  with each other.</p>, <p>Near the top of the Pilot lineup is the <strong>Touring</strong> model, which has all of the  EX-L's standard and optional equipment plus roof rails, 20-inch wheels, a  nine-speed automatic transmission, automatic engine stop-start, additional  noise-reducing acoustic glass for the windows, front and rear parking sensors,  driver-seat memory settings, ambient interior lighting and a 10-speaker sound  system. The Touring is appealing, sure, and much of the equipment is useful,  but the nine-speed transmission isn't as easy to live with as the six-speed.</p>, <p>Swinging for the fences, the  top-of-the-line <strong>Elite </strong>model adds LED  headlights, automatic high-beam headlight control, a full blind-spot monitoring  system with rear cross-traffic alert (which replaces LaneWatch), automatic  windshield wipers, a panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats,  heated second-row captain's chairs (which reduce maximum seating to seven  people), a heated steering wheel and HD radio.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Honda Pilot Touring w/Navigation and  Rear Entertainment System</strong> (3.5L V6 | 9-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the Honda Pilot received some minor revisions,  such as the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility in 2017.  Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's 2018 Honda Pilot,  however.</p>]

[<p>Here's  all you really need to know: The 2018 Honda Ridgeline is the most well-rounded  midsize truck on the market today. Sure, its 5,000-pound tow rating doesn't  look as impressive on paper as some competitors', and it can't crawl over  desert rock formations as easily as some specially tuned models. But it's  comfortable and versatile and offers most of the utility you're looking for. It  also avoids most of the drawbacks associated with pickup ownership.</p>, <p>Redesigned  and reintroduced just a year ago, the Ridgeline is different than its main  midsize competitors. The Ridgeline is built on a unibody design rather than a  more traditional body-on-frame setup, plus it gets independent suspension all  around. This translates to a better ride quality and handling that's more like  a car's than a truck's. It also has a highly versatile cargo bed. There's a big  in-bed trunk that you can use to store various items, and the bed can hold full  4-by-8-foot sheets of plywood down flat. Inside the cabin, the Ridgeline has  plenty of room for you and your passengers.</p>, <p>While  the Ridgeline doesn't have the tough styling or image of other trucks, we think  it's the smarter choice for the vast majority of owners. It will get all your truck  tasks done, and then some. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Honda Ridgeline as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Pickup Trucks">Best Pickup Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Honda Ridgeline is a  four-door, crew-cab-only midsize pickup that is offered in six trim levels: <strong>RT</strong>, <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>RTL</strong>, <strong>RTL-T</strong>, <strong>RTL-E</strong> and the <strong>Black Edition</strong>.  The RT is available with front-wheel drive only, while the Sport and RTL are  available with front- or all-wheel drive. The RTL-E and Black Edition are AWD  only. All come with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (280 horsepower, 262 pound-feet of  torque) and a six-speed automatic transmission. </p>]

[<p>The  base trim level <strong>RT</strong> has a decent  amount of standard equipment, including 18-inch alloy wheels, a tow hitch,  cruise control, air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  push-button start, and a power lock system that includes the dual-action  tailgate. There's a 4.2-inch information screen between the gauges, Bluetooth  connectivity, and a seven-speaker sound system that includes a USB port and a  5-inch screen interface that also displays the rearview camera.</p>, <p>Step  up to the <strong>Sport </strong>and you'll get  foglights, gray-painted alloy wheels, body-color door and tailgate handles,  keyless entry, remote engine start, tri-zone automatic climate control and the  HomeLink remote system. </p>, <p>Next  up is the <strong>RTL</strong>, which has leather  seating. The front seats are heated, with an armrest and eight-way power  adjustments for the driver and four-way power adjustments for the passenger.  All-wheel-drive versions have heated outside mirrors and a noise-reducing  windshield.</p>, <p>Our  pick is the <strong>RTL-T</strong>, which adds LED  daytime running lights and Honda's LaneWatch blind-spot camera system. It also  upgrades to the 8-inch touchscreen audio system that brings along a more  powerful seven-speaker audio system, navigation, HD radio, satellite radio,  three more USB ports, and Apple CarPlay and Android Audio smartphone  integration.</p>, <p>Move  up to the <strong>RTL-E</strong> if you want advanced  safety gear such as adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with  automated emergency braking, lane departure warning and intervention,  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. Functional differences  include a sunroof, LED headlights, driver-seat memory settings, a heated  steering wheel, front passenger armrest, a power-sliding rear window, parking  sensors, and a two-prong power outlet and LED cargo lights in the bed. It also  has an upgraded sound system with a unique truck-bed speaker system. </p>, <p>Finally  there's the <strong>Black Edition</strong>, which is  essentially an RTL-E with black paint, black-painted wheels, black trim, a  black headliner and red-accented black leather seats.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. All Ridgelines use the same engine, transmission, suspension and  tires, so the differences boil down to interior features and trim. The ratings  in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2017 Honda Ridgeline RTL-E Crew Cab</strong> (3.5L V6 | 6-speed automatic |  AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the Ridgeline has received no significant  changes. Our findings remain applicable to this year's 2018 Honda Ridgeline.</p>]

[<p>Freshly  overhauled, the 2018 Hyundai Accent sedan is roomier, safer and more  fuel-efficient than before. That's the good news. The bad news? The versatile  hatchback is gone, a victim of Americans' lack of interest. The sedan is good  enough to make you forget, though. It's a sensible and stylish choice.</p>, <p>For  2018, Hyundai made the Accent a little longer and wider. The interior is now a  bit roomier, with more front and rear legroom and more space between the driver  and front passenger. Cargo space hasn't changed but remains among the best in  the class. The Accent's updated four-cylinder engine makes less maximum power  (7 horsepower less), but Hyundai says it makes more usable low-end torque and  yields better fuel economy. With an automatic transmission, the Accent returns  a very good 32 mpg in combined city/highway driving. </p>, <p>This is a handsome car that will endure  the daily grind with minimal fuss. Passenger space is generous and promises to  be even better with the 2018 model's roomier size. It should be one of the  quicker cars in its class, which you'll appreciate with every merge into  freeway traffic. What's more, the Accent is surprisingly quiet and comfortable  on the road; even people with longer commutes won't regret choosing this Accent  over a larger, more expensive car. </p>, <p>Although today's new cars and SUVs are  getting bigger every year, there's still a place for a smartly packaged small  car that can perform tricks like its larger brethren. The 2018 Hyundai Accent  is a top choice in this category thanks to a satisfying combination of  performance, utility, comfort and style. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Hyundai Accent is a four-door  sedan that straddles the line between subcompact and compact. It's offered in  base <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong> trim  levels. The SE covers the basics, while the SEL adds more style (alloy wheels)  and functionality (7-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto). Limited  trims add conveniences including a sunroof, heated front seats and advanced  safety features. </p>]

[<p>All Accent models use a 1.6-liter  four-cylinder engine (130 horsepower, 119 pound-feet of torque) and either a six-speed manual or  automatic transmission. The Accent is front-wheel-drive. </p>, <p>The  SE sedan comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission, 15-inch steel  wheels, air conditioning, power accessories, a tilt-adjustable steering wheel,  cruise control, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, Bluetooth, a rearview camera,  a 5-inch touchscreen display, and a four-speaker sound system with a CD and  USB/auxiliary inputs. The six-speed automatic transmission is optional. </p>, <p>The  SEL adds 15-inch alloy wheels, rear disc brakes, automatic headlights, heated  side mirrors, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a center-console storage  box with a sliding armrest console, dual USB charging ports, Bluetooth with  voice commands, a 7-inch touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay-Android Auto  smartphone integration, and an upgraded six-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the Limited brings 17-inch wheels, foglights, projector-beam headlights  with LED accents, side mirror-integrated turn signals, a sunroof, a hands-free  trunk, keyless entry, push-button start, automatic climate control, heated  front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and a three-year  subscription to Hyundai Blue Link Connected Services. (It includes features  such as app-based remote start and locking and unlocking, vehicle diagnostics,  and emergency collision notification.) The Limited also features forward  collision warning and automatic emergency braking, which aren't available on  the two lower trims. </p>]

[<p>Last year's full redesign gave the  Hyundai Elantra a new look, a more refined interior and an improved ride  quality. The changes have made the Elantra downright pleasant to live with, and  all but the base trim come with extensive technology upgrades. Take a look at  the aptly named Value Edition trim level, for instance. For a reasonable price  it comes with all sorts of desirable features, such as a 7-inch touchscreen  infotainment system, a sunroof, heated seats, and keyless entry and ignition.</p>, <p>If the Elantra has a downside, it's  performance. The 2.0-liter engine that most Elantras come with isn't as  powerful as those in some other top small sedans. Hyundai does offer two  optional turbocharged engines, which might have added appeal, but the  dual-clutch automatic transmission that they come with doesn't have the  smoothest-shifting characteristics. </p>, <p>During your search, there are some other  top sedans to take a look at. The Honda Civic is unquestionably the benchmark  for the class given its mix of power, features and wide range of available trim  levels. We also like the Mazda 3 and the Volkswagen Golf hatchback for their  engaging driving experiences and upscale interiors. Overall, though, the  Elantra has a lot to offer, and it is particularly worth checking out if you're  looking for a comfortable sedan that has a lot of features for an agreeable  price. </p>]

[<p>There are six trim levels for the 2018  Hyundai Elantra, with three engines and three transmissions shared among them.  The base <strong>SE </strong>has a pretty limited  equipment list, but moving up to the <strong>SEL</strong>,  the<strong> Value Edition </strong>and finally the <strong>Limited</strong> nets quite a few improvements.  The <strong>Eco</strong> offers a more fuel-efficient  engine with midlevel equipment, and the <strong>Sport</strong> comes with a strong turbocharged engine.</p>]

[<p>The base engine, and the only option for  the SE, SEL, Value Edition and Limited trims, is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder (147  horsepower, 132 pound-feet of torque). The SE trim comes standard with a  six-speed manual transmission but can be upgraded to a six-speed automatic. The  other four trims all use the automatic transmission. </p>, <p>The <strong>SE</strong> trim is somewhat minimally equipped, with 15-inch steel wheels, front disc and  rear drum brakes, power mirrors, a height-adjustable driver seat,  air-conditioning, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, and a six-speaker sound  system with a 3.5-inch display and a USB port. Adding the optional automatic transmission  also adds cruise control, steering-wheel audio controls and Bluetooth phone  connectivity.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>SEL</strong> trim adds 16-inch alloy wheels, rear disc brakes, automatic  headlights, heated side mirrors, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, and a rearview camera, keyless entry with push-button start, dual-zone  automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and rear seat  cupholders. Rounding out the SEL's upgrades are keyless entry with push-button  start, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment display, Bluetooth audio streaming,  Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration, satellite radio and  — a special treasure for those who live in sunny climates —  sun visor extensions.</p>, <p>From there, the <strong>Value Edition</strong> adds a sunroof, LED daytime running lights,  door-handle approach lights, and hands-free trunk release. Inside, the Value  Edition gets heated front seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>, <p>As its name suggests, the <strong>Eco</strong> gets a more fuel-efficient engine:  a turbocharged 1.4-liter four cylinder (128 hp, 156 lb-ft of torque) paired  with a seven-speed automatic transmission. It's equipped similarly to the Value  Edition, but it doesn't get the sunroof or the auto-dimming rearview mirror and  rolls on 15-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Compared  to the Value Edition, the Elantra <strong>Limited</strong> moves up to 17-inch alloy wheels, LED taillights and unique appearance tweaks.  It gets a power driver seat and leather upholstery, but it keeps the sunroof  for its solitary option package. It also comes with three USB ports and  Hyundai's Blue Link system. Blue Link connects your car to an app that allows  you to control some basic functions such as locking and unlocking, receive diagnostic  information, and search for destinations with Google.</p>, <p>Only  one option package is available for the Limited trim, the Limited Ultimate  package. This package ups the infotainment screen to 8 inches and adds  navigation and a premium eight-speaker stereo system. You also get the sunroof,  driver-seat memory settings, heated rear seats, a larger gauge cluster  information screen, the sunroof, and a full set of active driver aids: adaptive  cruise control, lane departure warning and intervention, and forward collision  warning with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The  2018 Elantra <strong>Sport</strong>, whether you get  it with an automatic or manual, is equipped largely like the Limited. (It loses  the dual-zone automatic climate control but it comes with the sunroof.) There  also also quite a few sport-oriented changes, including a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (201  hp and 195 lb-ft of torque, with either the six-speed manual or a seven-speed  automatic), a more sophisticated rear suspension with firmer tuning,  18-inch alloy wheels with grippier tires, stronger brakes, an appearance  package and xenon headlights. Inside, the sporty theme continues with a  flat-bottomed steering wheel, special gauge cluster and leather-upholstered,  heated front sport seats.</p>, <p>One  package is available for the Sport trim: the Sport Premium package. It includes  the 8-inch touchscreen with navigation, 8-speaker premium sound system, Blue  Link telematics, dual-zone climate control and auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions, although trim levels share many aspects.

[<p>The Elantra GT is completely redesigned  for 2018 and shares many of the same mechanical components as last year's  redesigned Elantra sedan. From there, however, the sedan and hatchback differ  since the GT is effectively the European-market Elantra. As such, it has  distinctive exterior styling and a considerably different interior design. The  interior is not only divergent from the sedan's but from interiors of the rest  of Hyundai's lineup as well. It's a good look — better than the  rather conservative sedan's, we think — yet it maintains the brand's  user-friendly controls. We also like that an 8-inch touchscreen is standard  equipment, along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>There are two flavors of the GT  available. The base version has more standard power than the Elantra sedan, but  its fuel economy is worse, which might limit its appeal if fuel economy is a  priority for you. The GT Sport has an ample 201 horsepower from its  turbocharged engine, and it actually gets better fuel economy (with an  automatic transmission) than the base version. The superior fuel economy and  power, plus its improved handling capabilities, make the Sport the more  desirable and competitive choice. </p>, <p>No matter the version, though, you'll  like the Elantra GT's mix of space, performance and style. Along with models  such as the Honda Civic, Mazda 3, Subaru Impreza and Volkswagen Golf, the new  2018 Elantra GT is worth a look if you're shopping for a hatchback. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT hatchback is  available in <strong>base</strong> and <strong>Sport</strong> trim levels. The base GT comes  with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (161 horsepower, 150 pound-feet of  torque) that drives the front wheels through either a six-speed manual  transmission or a six-speed automatic. The GT Sport upgrades to a turbocharged  1.6-liter four-cylinder (201 hp, 195 lb-ft) and either the manual transmission  or a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic. </p>]

[<p>Standard features on the <strong>base </strong>Elantra GT include 17-inch alloy  wheels, a rearview camera, LED running lights, a height-adjustable driver seat,  60/40-split folding rear seats, Bluetooth, an 8-inch touchscreen interface,  Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, a USB port and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Getting the base trim's optional Style  package is likely worth the cost. It adds blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver seat and heated front  seats.</p>, <p>The <strong>GT  Sport </strong>has the contents of the Style package as standard plus the more powerful  engine, bigger brakes, 18-inch wheels, a more sophisticated sport-tuned  suspension, LED headlights, an electronic parking brake, upgraded gauges and  leather upholstery.</p>, <p>The base GT can also be had with the Tech  package, which includes the Sport's bigger brakes, electronic parking brake and  LED headlights plus a panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, Blue Link  communications, a navigation system, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a  wireless smartphone charging pad and a seven-speaker Infinity audio system.</p>, <p>If the GT Sport doesn't have them  already, the above features are included in the GT Sport's Tech package. It  also includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and automatic  braking, lane departure warning and intervention, automatic high beams and a  driver inattention warning system. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Hyundai Ioniq Electric is a  tremendous value for an electric car, both in terms of cost of entry and  efficiency. It also offers all the user-friendly tech we expect from Hyundai.  But it falls short of class leaders in terms of comfort and driving distance. </p>, <p>Hyundai's Ioniq Electric currently wears  the crown for being the most efficient 2018 electric car. According to the EPA,  it uses just 25 kWh of electricity per 100 miles driven. Some rival EVs are  close behind, but the Ioniq's advantage is still something to brag to your  neighbors about.</p>, <p>You can also brag about its affordable  pricing and appealing list of features. A full suite of advanced driver safety  aids is available, and the car is packed with easy-to-use technology features.  It's smooth and quiet on the road, and it comes with the peace of mind of  Hyundai's 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. </p>, <p>There are some downsides. The Chevrolet  Bolt has almost double the Ioniq Electric's 124-mile estimated driving range on  a full battery charge, for instance. No thorns without roses and all that.  Plus, the Ioniq's rear bench is a bit hard, and there's not much rear passenger  room. Visibility to the sides and the rear is impeded by thick pillars and a  split rear window.</p>, <p>Overall, we like the Ioniq, but it'll  also be worth your time to compare it to other top EVs such as the BMW i3, the  Chevy Bolt, the Nissan Leaf, the Tesla Model 3 and the Volkswagen e-Golf.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Hyundai Ioniq Electric as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/" title="Best Electric Cars">Best Electric Cars</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  Ioniq Electric is available in just two trims: <strong>base</strong>, which comes pretty well equipped, and the more generously  optioned <strong>Limited</strong>. Both trims are  propelled by the same 88-kW electric motor (118 horsepower, 215 pound-feet)  with a 28-kWh lithium-ion battery pack providing the energy for 124 miles of  range.</p>]

[<p>If  you can live without the latest high-tech driving aids, then the <strong>base</strong> trim should suit you well.  Standard features include 16-inch wheels, automatic headlights, LED daytime  running lights and taillights, a rearview camera, heated side mirrors, keyless  ignition and entry, a leather-wrapped tilting-and-telescoping steering wheel, heated  height-adjustable adjustable front seats and a 60/40-split folding rear  seatback. You also get a 7-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration, Hyundai's Blue Link telematics system, and  an audio system with satellite radio and HD radio, and USB and auxiliary input  jacks. An SAE combo DC fast charger is also included and can operate at up to  100 kilowatts. </p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> trim comes with everything  above but swaps in xenon headlights and adds power-folding side mirrors,  leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver seat, driver-seat memory  settings, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a sunroof, interior ambient  lighting, and rear air vents. Infotainment upgrades include wireless device  charging, a larger 8-inch touchscreen with navigation, and an eight-speaker  Infinity audio system.</p>, <p>The  Limited also comes standard with active safety features and driver aids,  including automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control with stop-start, and lane  departure warning with lane keeping assist.</p>]

[<p>Two decades in, the Toyota Prius still  dominates the small hybrid market. Other automakers have introduced competing  models — notably the Honda Insight, Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid and  Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid — but none put a significant dent in the  Toyota's runaway sales success. Hyundai thinks it's finally cracked the Prius  code. Now in its second year of production, the Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid is the  Prius' closest rival, with plenty of tech and safety features, quicker  acceleration and a lower price point.</p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid is a  compact hatchback that earns the distinction as the most fuel-efficient  non-plug-in hybrid on the market. In the EPA's combined cycle, the Ioniq Hybrid  earns estimates of 55-58 mpg compared to the Prius' 52-56 mpg. Keep in mind,  however, that incremental fuel gains at this level are not very significant.  Even Ioniq drivers who put a ton of miles on their cars would see monetary  savings in the tens of dollars each year.</p>, <p>More relevant is the Ioniq Hybrid's  price, which is quite a bit less than that of a comparable Prius. The Ioniq's  traditional exterior and interior design will also appeal to those turned off  by the Prius' more adventurous styling, while techies will appreciate standard  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. (The Toyota offers neither.)</p>, <p>Alas, the Ioniq Hybrid stumbles in  several critical areas that the Toyota doesn't. Rather than a continuously  variable automatic transmission (CVT) that most hybrids use, the Ioniq uses a  six-speed, dual-clutch automatic. On top of harsh shift quality, the  transmission has a difficult time figuring out which gear it wants to be in,  especially after heavy braking.</p>, <p>Speaking of the brakes, every hybrid uses  regenerative brakes to recharge the battery before handing it off to the  mechanical brakes that bring the car to a full stop. In the Ioniq, this handoff  isn't smooth. Combine this with the jerky downshifts, and passengers might  question your experience driving cars. We also aren't fans of the Ioniq's busy  ride and unsupportive seats. </p>, <p>While the 2018 Ioniq's price and fuel  economy are obvious advantages, we suggest giving the Ioniq a thorough test  drive before you choose it over the more established Prius.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid is a compact hatchback with a hybrid powertrain and  seating for five. The base <strong>Blue </strong>model  is the most fuel-efficient of the group, with an EPA rating of 58 mpg combined  compared to the other models' 55 mpg estimate. It's equipped with a few  desirable features, including keyless entry and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  The <strong>SEL </strong>doesn't cost much more and  includes heated front seats and blind-spot monitoring among its upgrades. The  top-trim <strong>Limited</strong> is a bit pricier  but adds a ton of features, such as a sunroof, leather upholstery and xenon  headlights. </p>]

[<p>Powering  the Ioniq Hybrid is a 1.6-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine and a six-speed,  dual-clutch automatic transmission. It's augmented by a electric motor fed by a  lithium-ion battery pack. Total system output is 139 horsepower. <strong> </strong></p>, <p>Standard  features on <strong>Blue </strong>trims include  15-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone  automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, selectable  driving modes, a driver information display, height-adjustable front seats,  60/40-split folding rear seats, a rearview camera, a 7-inch touchscreen  interface, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, Bluetooth, a  USB port, and satellite and HD radio. </p>, <p><strong>SEL </strong>trims add LED daytime running lights  and taillights, heated side mirrors, an upgraded driver information display,  steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, heated front seats, a power driver seat  (with two-way power lumbar), a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a charge-only  USB port, a rear center armrest, and chrome interior and exterior accents.  Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are also included. An  optional Tech package for the SEL adds adaptive cruise control, automatic  emergency braking, and a lane departure and mitigation system. </p>, <p>On  top of the SEL's features, the <strong>Limited </strong>trim  adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, xenon headlights, leather upholstery, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, LED cabin lighting and Hyundai's Blue Link  telematics features. An optional Ultimate package includes the SEL's Tech  package features as well as adaptive headlights, rear parking sensors,  driver-seat memory settings, rear air vents, a cargo cover, wireless device  charging, an Infinity eight-speaker sound system, navigation and an 8-inch  touchscreen. </p>]

[<p>When  most buyers think hybrid, Toyota's almighty Prius is generally the first car to  pop into mind. But with most manufacturers offering a hybrid vehicle in their  lineups, that's slowly changing. With the 2018 Ioniq, Hyundai is offering three  variants of the same car: a traditional hybrid, an electric-only model, and the  all-new 2018 Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid.</p>, <p>The  Plug-In is just like the regular Ioniq Hybrid, but it has a bigger battery to  allow for much greater electric-only operation — up to 29 miles of  driving — and the ability to plug it in to recharge the battery. If  you're looking for a vehicle that can give you some electric mobility but  aren't ready to commit to a pure electric, the Ioniq Plug-In could work out  well. It also boasts a large cargo area, an easy-to-use interior, and Hyundai's  generous warranty coverage as other good reasons to consider this plug-in  hybrid. </p>, <p>But  there are a few downsides. The seats are unsupportive and the ride is  disconnected with lots of body motion. Road noise may also be a problem,  especially considering how quiet it can be in electric mode. The Plug-In  features slightly less cargo volume than the standard Hybrid (23 cubic feet  versus 26.5). And even with Sport mode engaged and your foot buried to the  floor, the Ioniq accelerates tepidly. Overall, we think the Ioniq Plug-In is  worth a look, but you'll still want to check out the Prius Prime as well as the  Chevrolet Volt and the new Honda Clarity Plug-In.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Hyundai Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid is a compact four-door hatchback that can  seat five. It shares its basic hybrid powertrain and six-speed automatic  transmission with the regular Ioniq Hybrid, but the Plug-In comes with a  bigger, 8.9-kWh battery allowing it to go up to 29 miles in electric mode. The  Plug-In is available in two trims: the standard but well-equipped <strong>Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid </strong>and the <strong>Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid Limited</strong>, which  includes more luxury and technology features. </p>]

[<p>The  Ioniq Plug-In<strong> </strong>uses a 1.6-liter  four-cylinder engine combined with an electric motor to make a total of 139  horsepower. Standard feature highlights include 16-inch wheels, heated side  mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry with push-button  starting, heated front seats, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, Bluetooth, a  7-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, a USB port and  satellite radio.</p>, <p>The  Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid <strong>Limited</strong> adds  LED headlights, a power-adjustable driver's seat with memory settings, leather  seating surfaces, a bigger driver information display, and blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>An  available Ultimate package is available for Limited models. It includes  turn-adaptive headlights, a sunroof, a larger 8-inch touchscreen display with  Hyundai Blue Link connected services, a navigation system, LED interior  lighting, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping  assist, rear parking sensors, a wireless phone charging pad, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, and an Infinity Premium eight-speaker audio system.</p>]

[<p>The  subcompact crossover SUV class is gaining in popularity and the latest entrant,  the 2018 Hyundai Kona, has a lot of potential to take the lead. Its exterior  style may be somewhat polarizing, but it drives better than the competition. It  also delivers a lot for the money and checks all of the boxes that shoppers  want in this type of vehicle.</p>, <p>The  Kona sets itself apart from the rest of the class with a powerful turbocharged  1.6-liter engine that Hyundai offers on the top two trim levels. The Kona also  gets high marks for the features you get for the price as well as Hyundai's  strong warranty coverage. For these reasons, you should place it high on your  must-drive list if you're in the market for a crossover in this class.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Hyundai Kona is a five-passenger subcompact crossover SUV that is  available in four trim levels: <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong> and <strong>Ultimate</strong>.  The SE and SEL models are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (147  horsepower, 132 pound-feet of torque) that is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission that drives the front wheels. The Limited and Ultimate trims get a  1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (175 hp, 195 lb-ft) that's mated to a  seven-speed automated dual-clutch transmission. </p>]

[<p>All-wheel  drive is available as an option for all Konas. It comes bundled with a more  sophisticated rear suspension design and a lockable center differential. The  latter enhances off-road traction.</p>, <p>Standard  features for the <strong>SE</strong> trim include  16-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, remote keyless entry, air  conditioning, a telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver's seat,  60/40-split folding rear seats and a split-level cargo area. Tech features  include a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen, a USB  port, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a six-speaker  audio system.</p>, <p>The <strong>SEL</strong> trim adds 17-inch wheels, heated  side mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and  shift knob, heated front seats, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, and satellite radio. A sunroof and a power-adjustable driver's seat are  available as options.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>Limited</strong> trim gets you all  of the above plus 18-inch wheels, LED taillights and leather upholstery. </p>, <p>At  the top of the lineup is the <strong>Ultimate</strong> trim. It comes loaded up with automatic wipers, Hyundai's Blue Link communications,  a head-up display, an 8-inch touchscreen, a navigation system, a wireless  charging pad, and an Infinity premium audio system.</p>, <p>The  Hyundai Smart Sense suite of advanced safety features, with forward collision  warning and mitigation, lane keeping assist, a driver attention monitor and  automatic high beams, is standard on this trim and available as an option only  on the SEL trim (minus the automatic high beams).</p>]

[<p>Ideally,  a three-row crossover SUV should serve every member of the family well. The  2018 Hyundai Santa Fe largely succeeds. It offers an appealing mix of features  for an affordable price and is comfortable and easy to drive. </p>, <p>Though  it's a little thirsty, the Santa Fe's standard V6 supplies enough passing  power. Higher trim levels provide lots of interior amenities, such as keyless  ignition and entry, heated front and second-row seats, rear window sunshades  and a six-passenger configuration with second-row captain's chairs. When it  comes to hauling, the Santa Fe's cargo capacity falls a little short of  competitors, though there's still 80 cubic feet available behind the front  seats.</p>, <p>While  we wouldn't put it at the front of the pack, the 2018 Santa Fe's mixture of  capability and available features at an attractive price make it worthy of  consideration for your next family hauler. </p>]

[<p>The  Santa Fe is a six- or seven-passenger midsize SUV that's available in three  trim levels and front- or all-wheel drive. No matter the trim, each Santa Fe  comes with a 3.3-liter V6 (290 horsepower, 252 pound-feet of torque) and  six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on all trim  levels, while all-wheel drive is optional and includes a windshield wiper  de-icer. </p>]

[<p>The  Santa Fe <strong>SE </strong>starts you off with LED  running lights, heated side mirrors, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a 40/20/40-split folding second-row bench seat and a  power-adjustable driver seat. Electronic features include a 7-inch infotainment  display, a rearview camera, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone  integration, Hyundai's Blue Link communications and a six-speaker sound system  with satellite radio. </p>, <p>You  can tell the <strong>SE Ultimate</strong> apart by  its standard 19-inch wheels and LED fog lights. Additional standard features  include a sunroof, leather seating, heated front and second-row seats, a heated  steering wheel, ventilated front seats and a power-adjustable front passenger  seat. The 8-inch touchscreen has navigation and an upgraded 12-speaker audio  system. Occupants in the third row gain access to a USB port, while a 115-volt  outlet is added to the cargo area. Convenience amenities include a proximity  key with push-button start, a hands-free liftgate and rear side window  sunshades. Safety upgrades consist of blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert, rear parking sensors and a multiview parking camera system. </p>, <p>Aside  from some slight exterior differences, like LED taillights and silver painted  accents, the <strong>Limited Ultimate</strong> is  equipped the same as the SE Ultimate except for one key difference: The second  row has captain's chairs instead of a bench. This seating arrangement reduces  passenger capacity to six. </p>, <p>A  Tech Package available for the SE Ultimate and Limited Ultimate adds a suite of  advanced safety features that includes adaptive cruise control, forward  collision warning and mitigation, lane departure warning and xenon headlights  with automatic high beams.</p>]

[<p>From its name, you might surmise that the 2018  Hyundai Santa Fe Sport bears the mantle of performance in the compact crossover  class. But the truth is that Hyundai uses the Sport moniker to differentiate  this two-row small crossover from its big brother, the three-row Santa Fe. A  budget-friendly Porsche Macan it's not. But as an easy-to-drive urban runabout,  the Santa Fe Sport should satisfy. </p>, <p>In  its lower trim levels, the Sport's base price is not too far removed from the  pricing of popular small crossovers from Honda and Toyota. And yet it's a  little bigger than those models. Four adults will find the interior genuinely  spacious and well appointed, and a third adult in the rear is within the realm  of possibility. You can also get a lot of features on the Santa Fe Sport,  equipping it to luxurylike levels if you choose.</p>, <p>On  the downside, the front  seats aren't comfortable enough for everyday driving, the ride is pretty firm,  and neither of the two available engines is particularly powerful nor  fuel-efficient. Hyundai also limits the availability of some of the vehicle's  driver safety aids to the most expensive trim level. Overall, we view the 2018  Santa Fe Sport as a decent choice for a small crossover but think you could  very well be happier with one of its more accomplished rivals.</p>]

[<p>If it were  our money, we'd go with the base <strong>Sport </strong>model.  Its non-turbocharged four-cylinder isn't as peppy as the 2.0T's turbocharged  unit, but it's also far less expensive. We think this year's Value package is a  good deal since it bundles plenty of desirable features (such as heated front  seats, a touchscreen and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto functionality) and doesn't  add too much to the sticker price. That said, if you're also thinking of adding  the Premium Equipment package, you might as well step up to the 2.0T; it  includes that package, and the fuel economy drop is meager.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Santa  Fe Sport compact crossover is Hyundai's entry in one of the most hotly  contested segments in the U.S. (The similarly named Santa Fe has three rows and  is reviewed separately.) Its reasonably priced base <strong>Sport </strong>model is powered by a four-cylinder engine and includes a  modest number of standard features; several option packages are available to  raise the luxury factor. The <strong>2.0T</strong> and <strong>2.0T Ultimate</strong> are pricey  upgrades, but the turbocharged engine underhood is considerably more powerful.  Some of the base model's packages are standard on the 2.0T models, narrowing  the price gap.</p>]

[<p>The Santa  Fe Sport is sold in three trims. The base Sport is powered by a 2.4-liter  four-cylinder (185 horsepower, 178 pound-feet of torque), while the 2.0T and  2.0T Ultimate are driven by a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (240 hp, 260  lb-ft). A six-speed automatic transmission is standard across the board, and  any model can be specified with front- or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Notable  standard features for the <strong>base </strong>trim  include 17-inch alloy wheels, rear privacy glass, air-conditioning, a rearview  camera, a 40/20/40-split rear seat, Bluetooth connectivity, a 5-inch display  screen, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and<strong> </strong>a USB port.</p>, <p>The new <strong>Value </strong>package bundles LED daytime  running lights, foglights, heated mirrors, roof rails, keyless entry and  ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver seat with lumbar  adjustment, heated front seats, a 7-inch display screen, Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay functionality, <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/bluelink/">Hyundai Blue Link</a> services and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Selecting  the <strong>Premium Equipment </strong>package adds  those features, along with a hands-free power liftgate, a color driver  information screen, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather upholstery, a  power front passenger seat, slide and recline functionality for the rear seats,  rear side window sunshades, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert.</p>, <p>The <strong>Tech </strong>package includes the contents of  the Premium Equipment package along with a panoramic sunroof, a top-down  parking camera system, rear parking sensors, driver-seat memory settings, a  heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, an 8-inch  touchscreen, navigation and a 12-speaker Infinity premium audio system.</p>, <p>Step up to  the <strong>2.0T</strong> and you get a more powerful  turbocharged engine, 18-inch alloy wheels, dual exhaust tips and the contents  of the Premium Equipment package. </p>, <p>There's  one more package available if you want to go whole hog: the 2.0T Ultimate's <strong>Tech </strong>package. It adds adaptive  headlights with automatic high-beam control, adaptive cruise control, automatic  emergency braking, lane departure warning, and an electronic parking brake with  auto hold.</p>, <p>Finally,  the top-of-the-line<strong> 2.0T Ultimate </strong>adds  19-inch alloy wheels, xenon headlights, LED taillights and the contents of the  Tech package.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2015 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</strong> (turbo 2.0L  inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Santa Fe Sport has received some  revisions, including a refresh in 2017 that brought revised exterior styling,  interior trim modifications and an increased number of available advanced  safety systems. Additionally, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto became available  in most models, and both engines saw a reduction in power. Our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's Santa Fe Sport, however.</p>]

[<p>The  current-generation Sonata is already one of Edmunds' highest-rated midsize  sedans, so the updates it receives for 2018 will only help fortify its position  alongside the all-new Toyota Camry and Honda Accord at the top of the class.</p>, <p>While  we feel the new models will pose some stiff competition, it's understandable  why Hyundai hasn't fully overhauled the Sonata. The cabin is still very  comfortable and spacious by today's measures, and it looks even more upscale  with the design changes to the center console and transition to a three-spoke  steering wheel. The Sonata's smooth ride quality and large trunk (16.3 cubic  feet) also make it pleasantly practical for both weekend and daily duty.</p>, <p>The  Sonata also has highly flexible configurations — seven trim levels to  be exact — ranging from a value-driven SE to a fully loaded Limited  2.0T that comes with just about every convenience you can imagine. We aren't  huge fans of the base four-cylinder engine that comes in the SE, and would  recommend any of the turbocharged engine options, but rest assured even the SE  trim packs in a generous number of features. You really can't go wrong.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Hyundai Sonata as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Hyundai Sonata is a midsize sedan available in <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>Eco</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong>, <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong>, <strong>Sport 2.0T</strong> and <strong>Limited 2.0T</strong> trim levels. There are three four-cylinder engines  available: a base 2.4-liter (185 hp, 178 lb-ft) paired with a six-speed  automatic transmission that powers the SE, SEL, Sport and Limited trims; a  turbocharged 2.0-liter (245 hp, 260 lb-ft) that features a new eight-speed  automatic powering the two aptly named 2.0T trims; and a turbocharged 1.6-liter  (178 hp, 195 lb-ft) with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic that's specific  to the Eco trim.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>SE</strong>, which was a step up from the  base trim last year, is the new entry-level trim, yet it still undercuts the  segment with the exception of the Chevy Malibu. Its list of standard equipment  includes automatic headlights, power-folding front mirrors, power windows and  door locks, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, a  60/40-split folding rear seat, a 7-inch touchscreen display, a six-speaker  sound system with Bluetooth and USB/auxiliary jacks, Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay compatibility, a rearview camera, and blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert. The price jump to the <strong>Eco</strong> model is just $600, which comes identically equipped save for the engine. </p>, <p>The  next trim up is the <strong>SEL</strong>, which is a  new addition to the Sonata line and an attractive trim if you don't mind the  base engine. It adds larger 17-inch wheels, keyless entry and ignition, LED  daytime running lights, hands-free smart trunk access, heated side mirrors, a  10-way power-adjustable driver seat, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, a 4.2-inch color trip computer, satellite and HD radio, and a  rear USB port. Also included is Hyundai's subscription-based Blue Link  telematics system with three years of complimentary service. You can also add  advanced driver aids such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency  braking and lane keeping assist with the optional <strong>Tech package</strong>. </p>, <p>Following  the SEL is the <strong>Sport</strong> trim, which  isn't available with the SEL's Tech package but does come with unique Sport  styling front and rear, including a front grille, rear diffuser, chrome rocker  panels and a chrome-tipped dual exhaust. Inside, you get a power sunroof, which  is smaller and lighter than last year's panoramic unit, a flat-bottom steering  wheel with paddle shifters, a leather-wrapped shift knob, leather sport seats  with cloth inserts, and Sport-specific interior trim. </p>, <p>You  don't get any of the Sport-specific items stepping up to the <strong>Limited</strong> trim, though the sunroof remains  and you gain dynamic LED headlights, LED taillights, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, full leather seats, a six-way power passenger seat, driver-seat memory  settings, front-seat ventilation, dual climate control and woodgrain appearance  trim. You also have the option of upgrading to the <strong>Ultimate package</strong>, which adds helpful driver aids such as automatic  emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane keeping assist, adaptive  cruise control with stop-start capability, automatic high beams, an electronic parking  brake with auto hold, and rear parking sensors. It also adds comfort items such  as a heated steering wheel, rear side window shades, an 8-inch touchscreen  navigation system, wireless smartphone charging, a premium audio system, HD  real-time traffic, a trial subscription to SiriusXM Travel link (weather data,  fuel prices, sports, etc.), and a three-year subscription to Blue Link  multimedia/map updates.</p>, <p>The <strong>Sport 2.0T</strong> model is configured very  similarly to the regular Sport trim, but it includes the more powerful engine  and the eight-speed transmission, as well as a sport-tuned suspension,  sport-tuned steering, larger front brakes and 18-inch wheels. </p>, <p>Topping  out the Sonata line is the <strong>Limited 2.0T</strong> model, which includes everything from the Sport 2.0T model and everything else  that is standard and available on all other models. Yes, you get everything  with this model.</p>]

[<p>There's a lot to like about the 2018  Hyundai Tucson. First and foremost is value. You get a ton of features for the  money in the Tucson. A power driver seat, heated front seats, and a 7-inch  touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also standard on all but  the base trim, for instance. The Tucson's top trim level, the Limited, includes  features such as a panoramic sunroof, leather upholstery, ventilated seats, LED  headlights and a navigation system, all for a price that's thousands less than  what you'll pay for some comparably equipped rival crossovers. </p>, <p>Another top attribute for the Tucson is  its cabin space. Though it doesn't have as much cargo room as a Honda CR-V or  other more family-focused SUVs, it does have a comparable amount of backseat space  for adults. Indeed, the Tucson is a pretty good choice for single folks or  young couples looking for a little SUV that doesn't scream  "Parenting!" It could also be a good choice for those on the opposite  end of child-raising years.</p>, <p>On the downside, the 2018 Tucson comes up  a little short in the "going the extra mile" department. It's a bit  bland to drive, especially with the base engine, and the interior design isn't  as luxurious as that of some rivals. Overall, though, we think the Tucson is a  smart pick for a small crossover SUV. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Hyundai Tucson is a five-passenger compact crossover SUV. It is available in <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong>, <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>SEL Plus</strong>, <strong>Value</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong> trim levels. The SE, SEL and SEL Plus come standard with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (164 horsepower, 151 pound-feet of torque). The Sport is exclusively powered by a 2.4-liter engine (181 hp, 175 lb-ft). Both engines are paired to a six-speed automatic. The Value and Limited have a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder (175 hp, 195 lb-ft) and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on all trims, and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>]

[<p>The Tucson <strong>SE</strong> comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights,  a windshield wiper de-icer (AWD only), heated mirrors, an integrated blind-spot  mirror, privacy glass, a rearview camera, a height-adjustable driver seat,  stain-resistant cloth upholstery, a 60/40-split folding back seat, Bluetooth,  one USB port, a 5-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD  player.</p>, <p>The <strong>SEL</strong> adds LED running lights, foglights, roof rails, a power-adjustable driver seat,  heated front seats, a 7-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and  satellite radio. </p>, <p>Under the hood of the <strong>Sport</strong> is a 2.4-liter engine unique to this trim. Also included are 19-inch wheels, exterior styling enhancements, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, lane keeping assist, keyless entry and ignition, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control and rear air vents.</p>, <p>The <strong>SEL Plus</strong> retains many of the Sport's upgrades though it reverts to the SEL's engine and wheels. The SEL Plus also adds a power-adjustable passenger seat, a sliding front center armrest, leather upholstery, upgraded door trim, Hyundai's Blue Link connected services, an 8-inch touchscreen, integrated navigation and an eight-speaker Infinity sound system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Value</strong> adds the turbocharged engine plus 19-inch wheels, a hands-free liftgate, a  panoramic sunroof and different exterior trim. However, it reverts to the  stain-resistant cloth upholstery and 7-inch touchscreen, and it does not  include the power passenger seat, the integrated navigation system or the  Infinity sound system. </p>, <p>Those items are included on the top <strong>Limited</strong> trim, which also tacks on LED  headlights and taillights, chrome exterior trim, leather upholstery and the  8-inch touchscreen. The panoramic sunroof is not standard. The Tucson's only  factory options are included in the Limited Ultimate package, which adds  adaptive xenon headlights (in place of the fixed LED headlights), lane  departure warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear  parking sensors, the panoramic sunroof, an upgraded driver information display,  ventilated front seats and heated rear seats.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited </strong>(turbo  1.6L inline-4 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the Tucson Limited has only gained some extra  equipment, so our impressions remain the same. </p>]

[<p>Strong performance, plenty of premium features and a competitive price give the  2018 Infiniti Q50 a well-earned seat at the table with other refined and  accomplished luxury sport sedans. </p>, <p>The Q50's interior design continues to  age gracefully, but age it does. It's the same basic design used since 2014,  and it feels a bit behind the more modern, elegant environments in Audi and  Mercedes rivals. But don't let that end your consideration. The Q50 is still a  joy to drive. If you're looking for power, consider one of the Q50's  turbocharged V6 engines. They deliver a jolt of pony car-esque thrill each time  you dig into the pedal, especially in the Red Sport top trim. Infiniti also  packs in plenty of standard features for you money.</p>, <p>Overall, the 2018 Infiniti Q50 isn't  quite as polished as some rival sedans, but it stands as a desirable and  stylish alternative to the status quo. </p>]

[<p>The  Infiniti Q50 luxury sport sedan is available in five main trim levels: <strong>2.0t</strong>, <strong>3.0t, Red Sport 400</strong> and <strong>Q50  Hybrid </strong>trim levels. Infiniti also offers three subtrims, <strong>Luxe</strong>, <strong>Pure</strong> and <strong>Sport</strong>.</p>]

[<p>The  Q50 <strong>2.0t </strong>starts with a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (208 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque)  paired to a seven-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel  drive is optional. From there, the <strong>2.0t  Pure</strong> come with 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and foglights,  automatic wipers, selectable drive modes, keyless entry and ignition,  power-adjustable front seats, simulated leather upholstery, automatic dual-zone  climate control, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, dual touchscreen displays  (8-inch upper and 7-inch lower), and a six-speaker CD player with two USB ports  and satellite radio. The <strong>2.0t Luxe</strong> variant adds 18-inch wheels, a sunroof and maple wood interior accents. </p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>3.0t</strong> brings a turbocharged  3.0-liter V6 (300 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque). all-wheel drive is again optional.  The <strong>3.0t Luxe</strong> is equipped similarly  to the 2.0t Luxe trim while the <strong>3.0t  Sport</strong> adds 19-inch wheels, performance tires, leather upholstery and  additional front seat adjustments. </p>, <p>The <strong>Red Sport 400 </strong>picks up where the  3.0t leaves off and adds a more powerful V6 (400 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque),  unique 19-inch wheels (slightly wider in the rear), adjustable suspension  settings, transmission paddle shifters, quilted leather upholstery, dark chrome  and red stitching interior accents, heated front seats, a heated steering  wheel, remote engine start, a 60/40-split folding rear seat and a navigation  system. The Red Sport 400 also offers a host of driver aids, including a  top-down parking camera system, front and rear parking sensors, blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and automatic  emergency braking.</p>, <p>The <strong>Q50 Hybrid Luxe </strong>comes in one trim  level similarly equipped to the 3.0t Luxe, but it also borrows from the Sport  and Red Sport 400 features. Some extra features, including adaptive cruise  control and a premium Bose audio system, are also standard on the Hybrid. </p>, <p>Many  of the extra features found on the Red Sport are available as options on the  lower trims. Depending on the trim level, other key options an adjustable  suspension, additional driver aids and a premium audio system.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Infiniti Q60 can trace its roots  back to the G35 (remember that car?), one of several vehicles built on Nissan's  then-new FM platform. Though many changes have been phased in along the way,  today's Q60 is still built on the FM platform. It has served Nissan and  Infiniti well, spawning a host of SUVs, a sports car, sedans and coupes. </p>, <p>Today, the Q60 still manages to feel  contemporary, though the interior betrays its older roots. The two screens in  the center stack are from different eras, and the map graphics are dated.  Still, this coupe's plentiful soft touch points show attention to detail, even  if the theme could stand to be overhauled.</p>, <p>The Q60's top version is the Red Sport  400. Though it isn't as focused as German high-performance offerings, its  twin-turbo V6 provides legitimate 400-horsepower thrust. There's also strong  value to be found in the lower trim levels if your performance expectations are  more relaxed.</p>, <p>Overall, we think the Q60 is a respectable  choice for a luxury coupe. But given that it doesn't shine in any particular  area, you might find fresher rivals such as the Audi A5/S5 and Mercedes-Benz  C-Class coupe more appealing.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Infiniti Q60 is a two-door luxury coupe that seats four people. There  are five trim levels: <strong>2.0t Pure</strong>, <strong>2.0t Luxe</strong>, <strong>3.0t Luxe</strong>, <strong>3.0t Sport</strong> and <strong>Red Sport 400</strong>. The numbers  reference what engine the Q60 gets, while Pure, Luxe and Sport versions deliver  different feature seats. All Q60s are equipped with a seven-speed automatic  transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional.</p>]

[<p>The base <strong>2.0t Pure</strong> is equipped with  a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (208 horsepower, 258 pound-feet  of torque) and comes pretty well-equipped. Highlights include 19-inch alloy  wheels, LED headlights and foglights, heated mirrors, keyless ignition and  entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats,  simulated leather upholstery, Bluetooth, a dual-touchscreen infotainment  interface (8-inch upper screen, 7-inch lower), two USB ports, and a six-speaker  sound system with a CD player and satellite radio. A sunroof is optional.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>2.0t Luxe</strong> adds  the sunroof plus a 13-speaker Bose audio system that includes HD radio. The <strong>3.0t Luxe</strong>, the starting point for  six-cylinder models, differs only through the substitution of the four-cylinder  with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine (300 hp, 295 lb-ft) and larger brakes.</p>, <p>While Luxe models don't bestow much additional standard equipment, they grant  access to options not available on the base model. The Sensory package adds  auto-dimming outside mirrors, a power-adjustable and heated steering wheel,  heated front seats, driver-seat memory settings, and Infiniti InTouch emergency  communications services and navigation system.</p>, <p>The Leather Seating package adds leather  upholstery and power-adjustable front seat side bolsters. The ProAssist package  adds front and rear parking sensors, a 360-degree parking camera system,  blind-spot monitoring, reverse automatic braking, and a forward collision  warning and automatic braking system.</p>, <p>The 3.0t Luxe is available with the ProActive package (requires all other  available packages), which adds adaptive headlights with automatic high beams,  adaptive cruise control, blind-spot intervention (it steers for you if you  don't heed its warnings), a lane departure warning and intervention system, an  air filtration system and Infiniti's Direct Adaptive Steering system.</p>, <p>There's also the <strong>3.0t Sport</strong>, which  comes with 19-inch forged alloy wheels, two-mode variable suspension dampers, the auto-dimming outside  mirrors, leather upholstery, the power-adjustable driver seat bolsters and  steering wheel, and driver-seat memory functions. Its Sensory package is  essentially the same as the 3.0t Luxe version apart from those items already  standard. It too can be equipped with the ProAssist and ProActive packages.</p>, <p>The <strong>Red Sport 400</strong> sits atop the Q60  lineup and delivers the most potent performance of any Q60 variant. It's  equipped similarly to the 3.0t Sport but has a more powerful 3.0-liter V6  engine (400 hp, 350 lb-ft) and 20-inch wheels with staggered summer tires.</p>]

[<p>This  luxury sedan has a comfortable interior and comes in a variety of  configurations. It can also be entertaining to drive. But the 2018 Infiniti  Q70's shortcomings are pretty obvious. </p>, <p>This  generation of the Q70 dates back to 2011, back when Infiniti called it the M56.  There have been some updates over the years, but this is a very long time in  the luxury sedan segment to go without a full redesign. Though spacious, the  interior comes up short on storage and aesthetic appeal, and the touchscreen  entertainment system feels ancient compared to the standard set by current  luxury offerings. </p>, <p>We  do like the Q70's V8 engine, and the availability of a long-wheelbase version  and even a hybrid help broaden the car's appeal. But, ultimately, no Q70  variant truly stands out in the crowd. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Infiniti Q70 is available in two main trim levels: <strong>3.7 Luxe </strong>and <strong>5.6 Luxe</strong>.The numbers indicate what type of  engine is under the hood. A long-wheelbase <strong>Q70L </strong>is available with either engine and similar equipment. There's also a  hybrid version (appropriately named <strong>Q70  Hybrid Luxe</strong>). Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional  on non-hybrid models. A seven-speed automatic is the sole transmission  available, while a variety of optional packages provide for a degree of  customization.</p>]

[<p>The  base Q70 <strong>3.7 Luxe</strong> receives motivation  from a 3.7-liter V6 (330 hp, 270 lb-ft of torque). Standard features include a  sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, and power adjustable and heated  front seats. A no-cost Essential package (which you can expect to be equipped)  further adds a heated steering wheel, parking sensors, a heated steering wheel,  a top-down parking camera system, leather upholstery, an 8-inch touchscreen  display, a navigation system, and a 10-speaker Bose premium audio system.</p>, <p>The  optional Premium Select package for the 3.7 Luxe adds dark exterior trim, a  rear spoiler, 20-inch wheels, upgraded brakes, a suede-like headliner, and  premium leather upholstery. </p>, <p>The <strong>Q70 Hybrid Luxe</strong> uses a 3.5-liter V6  and a hybrid system (360 hp), and its features largely mirror the 3.7 Luxe. The  EPA pegs the Hybrid at 30 mpg in combined driving.</p>, <p>Q70s  bearing the <strong>5.6 Luxe</strong> badge pack a  5.6-liter V8 (420 hp, 417 lb-ft of torque). These models include all the items  of the 3.7 Luxe equipped with the no-cost Essential package. </p>, <p>Long-wheelbase  variants are differentiated by the <strong>Q70L</strong> name. These longer models offer an extra 5.5 inches of rear legroom, a rear  12-volt outlet and heated rear seats. </p>, <p>For  all Q70s, the ProActive package adds advanced safety features including forward  collision warning, front and rear collision mitigation with automatic braking,  blind-spot monitoring and intervention, lane departure warning and  intervention, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The  Sport package is available on all standard-wheelbase Q70s. It adds 20-inch  wheels, a different fascia, upgraded brakes, a firmer suspension, a 16-speaker  Bose stereo, a power rear sunshade and magnesium paddle shifters.  Long-wheelbase variants can opt for the Performance Tire and Wheel package,  which includes 20-inch wheels and larger, more capable brakes.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Infiniti Q70 5.6 w/Premium Select  Edition package </strong>(5.6L V8 | 7-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Q70 has received only minor  revisions related to trim level offerings. Our findings remain applicable to  this year's Q70.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Infiniti QX30 is an interesting amalgamation of coupe, hatchback and crossover,  and the way it straddles these body types results in advantages and drawbacks.  Those who like a sporty drive experience will appreciate the QX30's athleticism  over a more traditional SUV. Its rear hatchback design increases the cargo  capacity over a comparably sized sedan, while the option of all-wheel drive and  a raised suspension make it better suited to handle foul weather conditions or  light off-highway exploration. </p>, <p>So what  are the trade-offs? The QX30's aggressive coupelike styling helps it look the  part, but it also doesn't make for the roomiest or ergonomically optimized cabin.  Its sporty suspension doesn't exactly excel in the ride comfort department  either, and rear visibility can be an issue if you don't have the electronic  aid of the optional Technology package.</p>, <p>With a  base price of just over $30,000, the QX30 is the lowest point of entry into the  Infiniti line and is slightly more affordable than most other subcompact luxury  SUVs, including the Mercedes-Benz GLA, from which it borrows heavily.</p>]

[<p>In  the beginning of the 2018 model year, the Infiniti QX30 subcompact luxury  crossover was available in four trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Luxury</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Sport</strong>. Later, those first three trims were renamed <strong>Pure</strong>, <strong>Luxe</strong> and <strong>Essential. </strong>Some  option packages were also renamed. All QX30s are propelled by a turbocharged  2.0-liter inline-four (208 hp, 258 lb-ft) that sends power to either the front  or all four wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.  All-wheel drive is only available on the Luxury/Luxe and Premium/Essential  trims.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features on the <strong>base/Pure </strong>QX30  include 18-inch alloy wheels, all-season run-flat tires, LED running lights,  auto-dimming driver-side and rearview mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a tilt-and-telescoping steering column,  eight-way manual front seats with four-way power lumbar, dual-zone climate  control, 60/40-split fold rear seatbacks and simulated leather upholstery. Some  of the standard technology features include a rearview camera, a 7-inch  Infiniti InTouch infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity, voice controls,  and a six-speaker sound system with HD and satellite radio, two USB ports and  an auxiliary audio jack.</p>, <p>The <strong>Luxury/Luxe</strong> trim comes with  everything from the base trim and adds leather upholstery, eight-way power  front seats, heated front seats, a rear-seat armrest, a rear-seat pass-through,  driver-seat memory settings and a stitched-leather dash insert. Aside from  all-wheel drive, there are no options available on Luxury or base trims.</p>, <p>One  step up from Luxury is the <strong>Premium/Essential</strong> trim, which adds LED foglights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, roof rails, a  panoramic sunroof and a premium 10-speaker Bose audio system. If you opt for an  all-wheel-drive Luxury or Premium QX30, these models come with a ride height  raised 1.2 inches versus that of the front-wheel-drive models.</p>, <p>A  number of packages are available at the Premium trim level. The <strong>Navigation package</strong> includes navigation,  Infiniti InTouch services and apps, front and rear parking sensors, satellite  traffic and weather, and a color center display in the gauge cluster. The <strong>LED package</strong> includes adaptive LED  headlights and interior LED ambient lighting. </p>, <p>The <strong>Technology/ProAssist package</strong> is one  we recommend due to the QX30's natural blind spots. It comes with a 360-degree  camera system, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, automatic  emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams and park  assist. The <strong>Gallery White Theme package</strong> features a white premium leather interior with red accents and contrast  stitching, a synthetic suede headliner and unique 18-inch wheels. The <strong>Dark Wood package</strong> adds real wood trim  and a suede headliner. A 19-inch wheel option is also offered that includes  run-flat summer tires (from the Sport model).</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>Sport</strong> trim models  are front-wheel-drive only and come with a sport-tuned suspension that rides  0.6 inch lower than all of the other front-drive models. It has 19-inch alloy  wheels with run-flat summer tires, front and rear parking sensors, black  exterior mirror housings, specific front and rear lower fascias, body-color  side sill panels, a black-colored grille, front sport seats with synthetic  suede and faux leather upholstery, a 360-degree camera system, an automated  parking system and a flat-bottom steering wheel.</p>, <p>Options  for the Sport trim include a no-cost Navigation package; the Technology  package, which adds in the other driver aids that don't come standard; a <strong>Sport Leather package</strong> that adds premium  leather, heated front seats, footwell lights and a synthetic suede headliner;  and the LED package previously mentioned.</p>, <p>Some  features have been shuffled between new and old package names. Most notably,  the 360-degree camera has been moved to the Navigation package, the blind-spot  monitor is now standard on the Essential trim and above, and the automatic  emergency braking is standard throughout the lineup.</p>]

[<p>With three-row seating, a plush interior  and a strong V6 engine, the 2018 Infiniti QX60 is a smart way to move a family  down the road. Ride comfort and easy third-row access remain this crossover  SUV's strong suits, and recent performance upgrades make it as quick as it is  comfortable. </p>, <p>It's tempting to think of the QX60 as a  tall wagon or even a minivan equipped with conventional doors, and it's a worthy  alternative for the minivan-averse. Easy access to a roomy third row (even with  a child's car seat installed), thanks to the tilt-and-slide function of the  second-row seats, makes the QX60 ideal for families on the go, while its fluid  styling and a classy interior will never look out of place at finer functions. </p>, <p>A robust V6 engine paired with a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) gives the Infiniti  respectable power and refinement. Since CVTs don't have predetermined shift  points, acceleration is always on tap. With that power and its cushioned ride  and quiet cockpit, the QX60 has the right ingredients for long interstate  drives as well as for daily short trips to work and play. </p>, <p>Infiniti makes smaller, sportier SUVs,  but this isn't one of them. The QX60 is a people mover through and through. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Infiniti QX60 is available in one trim level,  with or without all-wheel drive. A hybrid version is also available (reviewed  separately). A variety of option packages are available, however, to tailor the  QX60 to suit your sensibilities and budget.</p>]

[<p>The  front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants are powered by a 3.5-liter V6  (295 horsepower, 270 pound-feet of torque) paired to a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT). We're fans of the CVT, which makes the most of  the V6's power.</p>, <p>Standard  features include 18-inch  wheels, automatic xenon headlights, LED foglights, heated side mirrors, a  sunroof, a power liftgate, keyless entry and ignition, leather upholstery,  tri-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable and heated front seats, a  60/40-split folding second row, a 50/50-split folding third row, Bluetooth  connectivity, a 7-inch central touchscreen display, a rearview camera, and a  six-speaker sound system with satellite radio, a CD player and a USB port. V6  models get three additional charge-only USB ports.</p>, <p>When  considering a QX60, the bulk of the decision-making comes down to option  packages. They include Premium, Premium Plus, Driver Assistance, Theater,  Deluxe Technology, and the 20-inch Wheel and Tire packages. </p>, <p>The  Premium package includes roof rails, remote ignition, driver-seat memory settings, a heated steering wheel, a  13-speaker Bose sound system, and an enhanced keyless entry and ignition system  that can remember the most recent driver's audio, climate and navigation preferences. </p>, <p>The Premium Plus package includes front  and rear parking sensors, a 360-degree parking camera system, automatic wipers,  an 8-inch touchscreen display, a navigation system, voice controls, Bluetooth  audio connectivity, and the Infiniti InTouch electronics interface with the  brand's Connection telematics service. </p>, <p>The  Driver Assistance package includes adaptive cruise control, a forward collision  warning system with automatic braking, a rear cross-traffic alert and backup  collision intervention system (automatically applies the brakes if the driver  doesn't take action), a blind-spot monitoring system, Active Trace Control  (automatically adjusts engine output and braking to enhance cornering feel) and  the Eco Pedal (the accelerator pedal automatically pushes back if the driver is  driving in a fuel-wasting fashion).</p>, <p>The Theater package adds a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system as well  as a 120-volt power outlet.</p>, <p>The Deluxe Technology package bundles the contents of the Driver Assistance package  and adds automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, and lane departure  warning/lane keeping assist. Other upgrades include 20-inch wheels, a panoramic  sunroof, ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, a powered third-row  seat, upgraded climate control with air filtration, and a 15-speaker Bose  surround-sound audio system.</p>, <p>Twenty-inch  wheels and tires and an in-car Wi-Fi package are available separately.</p>]

[<p>For  shoppers looking for a rugged, do-it-all people mover that's also comfortable  and upscale, a traditional three-row luxury SUV like the 2018 Infiniti QX80 is  an obvious choice. With available four-wheel drive, genuine towing capability,  a feature-rich interior, and no shortage of upgrades to select from, the QX80  is built to handle just about any situation.</p>, <p>What's  readily noticeable about the 2018 QX80 is its updated exterior design. It's  sleek, modern and much more befitting a member of the luxury class. Beneath the  new skin is essentially the same mechanical components from last year. A  powerful V8 engine helps the QX80 pull 8,500 pounds, and when equipped with  four-wheel drive, the QX80 can take you pretty far off the beaten path. </p>, <p>Not  much has changed on the inside either, and that's the biggest letdown to the  2018 QX80. The infotainment system isn't as advanced as those in rival luxury  SUVs, for instance, and the overall look and feel of the cabin aren't as  classy. The QX80 has enough pros to keep it relevant in 2018, but shopping  around some before settling on this Infiniti is a wise idea.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Infiniti QX80 is a full-size  luxury SUV that provides seating for up to eight passengers. It's offered in a  single, well-equipped trim, powered by a 5.6-liter V8 (400 horsepower, 413  pound-feet of torque) with a seven-speed automatic and a choice of rear- or  four-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>There are quite a few standard features  on the QX80, including 20-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights and  foglights, automatic high-beam control, a sunroof, roof rails, power-folding  and auto-dimming mirrors, a power-adjustable steering wheel with heating, a  power liftgate, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and ignition and  automatic tri-zone climate control. Also standard are leather upholstery, a  heated eight-way power driver seat and six-way power passenger seat (both with  two-way power lumbar adjustment), driver-seat memory settings, second-row  captain's chairs, and a power-folding 60/40-split third-row seat. For the  second row, a three-passenger, 60/40-split bench seat is available as a no-cost  option. </p>, <p>Standard technology features include a  360-degree parking camera, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, an 8-inch  touchscreen display, a navigation system, voice controls, and a 13-speaker Bose  sound system with a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a  total of four USB ports.</p>, <p>Most of the QX80 add-ons come in the form  of packages, with very few stand-alone options. If you're a fan of advanced  safety features, as we typically are, the <strong>Driver  Assistance package</strong> is a good value, bundling adaptive cruise control,  blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning and intervention, forward  collision warning (with pedestrian detection), stolen-vehicle notification, and  secondary driver services such as geofencing and maximum speed notifications.  All other available packages require that you equip your QX80 with the Driver  Assistance package.</p>, <p>To better keep your backseat occupants  comfortable and entertained, the Theater package includes a dual-screen rear  entertainment system, a 120-volt power outlet, and heated second-row seats with  a power tip-up feature for easier third-row access. </p>, <p>The  Deluxe Technology package requires that you opt into both packages above and  upgrade to larger 22-inch wheels. But doing so gets you adaptive front  lighting, headlight washers, the Hydraulic Body Motion Control suspension  (provides greater stability during cornering), upgraded climate control,  upgraded leather upholstery, special wood trim, ventilated front seats and a  15-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system.</p>, <p>Finally,  onboard 4G Wi-Fi that connects up to five devices (monthly data plan required)  and a 22-inch wheel and tire package are available as stand-alone options. </p>]

[<p>Jaguar's  first crossover SUV, the F-Pace, has been a big success for the company thanks  to its sharp-looking style and athletic performance. Now the company is  doubling down on its success with the new 2018 Jaguar E-Pace.</p>, <p>The  E-Pace's name could be confusing since a lot of automakers use an "E"  to refer to electric power. But the E-Pace is just a smaller SUV, similar to  how the Jaguar XE sedan is smaller compared to the XF sedan. In terms of size  and price, the E-Pace is a bit bigger and more expensive than established  subcompact SUVs such as the Audi Q3 and BMW X1. </p>, <p>Power  comes from one of two available turbocharged four-cylinder engines: one that  makes 246 horsepower and another that puts out 296 hp. All E-Paces are equipped  with a nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The higher-output  engine's all-wheel-drive system is more advanced and helps improve the E-Pace's  handling when going around turns.</p>, <p>Overall,  we're excited about the 2018 E-Pace. It's more expensive than some rival SUVs  you might compare it to, but in return it delivers plenty of style, performance  and features. It's quite possibly the best-equipped subcompact SUV available  this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Jaguar E-Pace is offered in two main trims primarily distinguished by  engine output: the base <strong>P250</strong> and the <strong>P300 R-Dynamic</strong>. Additional features  are broken out into four subtrims: <strong>Standard</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>HSE</strong>. The base  E-Pace P250 is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (246 horsepower, 269  pound-feet of torque) while the E-Pace R-Dynamic gets a similar but more  powerful version (296 hp, 295 lb-ft). A nine-speed automatic transmission and  all-wheel drive are standard across the board.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>P250  Standard</strong> comes with 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, selectable drive modes,  heated mirrors, automatic wipers, front and rear parking sensors, push-button  start, dual-zone automatic climate control, 60/40-split folding rear seats, a  10-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, and a six-speaker sound system. Lane  keeping assist and forward collision warning and mitigation with low-speed  automatic braking are also included.</p>, <p>The <strong>S</strong> upgrade adds 18-inch wheels, LED running lights, leather upholstery, 10-way  power-adjustable front seats, a navigation system, a Wi-Fi hotspot, additional  smartphone integration, an automated parking system and a surround-view camera  system.</p>, <p>The <strong>SE</strong> trim equips the E-Pace with 19-inch wheels, automatic high beams, a power  liftgate, 14-way power-adjustable front seats, an 11-speaker premium audio  system, a blind-spot monitoring system and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The top <strong>HSE</strong> is only offered with the higher-output R-Dynamic P300 models  and adds 20-inch wheels, a hands-free liftgate, keyless entry, 18-way power  seats with memory settings, premium leather upholstery and a full-digital  instrument panel.</p>, <p>In addition to the power increase, E-Pace <strong>R-Dynamic P300</strong> models (beginning  with S trims and up) are also equipped with a performance-enhancing rear  differential, special exterior and interior styling details, front foglights,  and sport front seats with contrast stitching.</p>, <p>Most of the extra features from the  higher trim levels are available as options on the S and SE. Other notable  upgrades include a Climate Control package (adds heating for the front seats,  steering wheel and windshield), a Drive package (additional safety features  including adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and upgraded forward  collision mitigation), a Meridian surround-sound system, a surround-view  parking camera system, and adaptive suspension dampers.</p>, <p>A limited run of <strong>First Edition </strong>models will also be available. In addition to much of  the R-Dynamic content (except the more powerful engine), it comes with  exclusive red paint, a black leather interior with red contrast stitching, and  special 20-inch wheels. And just about all of the E-Pace's optional features  are included as standard.</p>]

[<p>Though  it's a relative newcomer to the luxury crossover scene, the Jaguar F-Pace has  already made favorable impressions with us as well as the buying public. Coming  off its debut year in 2017, the 2018 Jaguar F-Pace is indeed an attractive  package. It's elegant, fun to drive, spacious, and even potentially  fuel-efficient, depending on your choice of engine and how much fun you want to  have. </p>, <p>We  happen to prefer the engine sitting at the high end of the power curve, a  supercharged 3.0-liter V6 making 380 horsepower in the S model and 340 hp for  all 35t trim variants. Jaguar has added a new turbocharged inline-four this  year, though. It's good for 247 hp or 296 hp and at a more affordable price.  And still available diesel engine returns an impressive 29 mpg in combined  driving. </p>, <p>The  2018 Jaguar F-Pace occupies a unique space in the luxury crossover SUV  spectrum, splitting the size difference between the small and midsize classes.  However, you'll likely be cross-shopping it against smaller crossovers because  it lines up with the rest of the class offerings in terms of price and power.  Though the F-Pace has some drawbacks, overall we think you'll find it an  alluring choice. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Jaguar F-Pace is a compact luxury SUV that seats five. There are six main  trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Prestige</strong>, <strong>R-Sport</strong>, <strong>S </strong>and<strong> Portfolio</strong>. Jaguar also uses four engine designations: <strong>25t</strong>, <strong>30t</strong>, <strong>35t</strong> and <strong>20d</strong>. The 25t features the new  turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four good for 247 hp and 269 lb-ft of torque, and  the 30t version of this engine makes 296 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. The 35t  has a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 (340 or 380 hp, and 332 lb-ft of torque). The  20d and its turbocharged 2.0-liter diesel (180 hp, 318 lb-ft) offer maximum  fuel economy. </p>]

[<p>Engine  availability varies by trim level, but all F-Paces come equipped with an  eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Note that Jaguar  discontinued the 340-hp version of the supercharged V6 engine midway through  the model year.</p>, <p>The <strong>base</strong> F-Pace starts you off with  18-inch wheels, a power liftgate, rear privacy glass, LED running lights,  automatic wipers, keyless ignition, a panoramic sunroof, selectable drive  modes, dual-zone automatic climate control, power front seats, a 40/20/40-split  folding rear seat, simulated leather (LuxTec) upholstery and an auto-dimming  rearview mirror. For technology, there's Jaguar's InControl Protect emergency  communication services, the InControl 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system,  Bluetooth, and an 11-speaker Meridian sound system with a USB port, an  auxiliary audio jack and a CD player. A rearview camera can be added  separately.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium</strong> trim adds 19-inch wheels, a  rearview camera, power-folding and auto-dimming side mirrors and driver-seat  memory functions. The Vision package available at the Premium level adds  adaptive xenon headlamps with auto-leveling and washers, front and rear parking  sensors, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and a blind-spot  monitoring system. The Black package adds a gloss black finish to the exterior  side vents, window surrounds and front grille. </p>, <p>Both  base and Premium F-Pace models can be optioned with a Cold Climate package that  adds heated front and rear seats, a heated windshield, heated washer jets and a  heated steering wheel. They can also be equipped with a navigation system  integrated into the InControl Touch system.</p>, <p>The  F-Pace <strong>Prestige</strong> includes most of the  above equipment plus keyless entry, leather upholstery, a power-adjustable  steering wheel, a folding rear armrest, voice controls and smartphone apps. The  only things that aren't standard above are the Black package and active safety  aids, which come with the Prestige Vision package (which also has adaptive LED  headlights in place of the xenon units). At the Prestige level you also can  specify the Adaptive Dynamics package, which adds an adaptive suspension as  well as a special drive mode to optimize grip in challenging road conditions.</p>, <p>The  next level up is the <strong>R-Sport</strong>. This  version gets you 20-inch wheels, special R-Sport bumpers and styling elements,  foglights, more aggressively bolstered front seats with power-adjustable thigh  support, and a simulated leather-trimmed instrument panel. This is in addition  to everything above with the exception of the Adaptive Dynamics and Black  packages.</p>, <p>The <strong>S</strong> trim is similarly equipped to the  R-Sport but comes with 40 extra horsepower (for a total of 380 hp) and unique S  body styling. It also includes the features from the Adaptive Dynamics package.</p>, <p>The  Prestige, R-Sport and S can be equipped with the Comfort &amp; Convenience  package, which adds ventilated front seats, power-reclining rear seats, a remote  release for the folding rear seats and a hands-free, gesture-activated  liftgate. There is also a Technology package, which adds a fully digital  instrument cluster, 3G onboard Wi-Fi, a 17-speaker Meridian surround-sound  audio system, and a different, upgraded InControl Pro 10-inch touchscreen  interface with configurable menu screens and quicker response. Available as  stand-alone options are a head-up display, roof rails and an Activity Key, a  waterproof bracelet that allows you to unlock the car with the key still  inside.</p>, <p>Only  R-Sport and S can be equipped with the<strong> </strong>Luxury  Interior and Driver Assistance<strong> </strong>packages.  The former includes four-zone automatic climate control with an air quality  sensor, additional rear-seat air vents and power sockets, upgraded carpets and  headliner, 10-color interior ambient lighting and a cooled glove compartment.  The Driver Assistance package adds adaptive cruise control, forward collision  warning, speed limit notification, a surround-view camera system and an  automatic parking system (parallel, perpendicular and exit). The R-Sport and S  can also be equipped with 22-inch wheels, though we would advise against  getting them in the interest of ride quality.</p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Portfolio </strong>sits at the top in  price, and is available only as a 35t model. It comes with everything from the  Prestige trim, plus 20-inch wheels, all features in the Comfort &amp;  Convenience and Luxury Interior packages, and premium leather upholstery and  upgraded trim. The Adaptive Dynamics package is optional. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Jaguar F-Pace S</strong> (supercharged 3.0L V6 | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Jaguar F-Pace has received some  revisions, including a new turbocharged inline-four engine and a couple new  active safety aids. But our findings remain applicable to this year's Jaguar  F-Pace with the V6 engine.</p>]

[<p>Loud, raucous and not exceptionally practical, the  Jaguar F-Type remains one of our favorite sports car indulgences. Its gorgeous  shape and proportions are among the best on the road and belie the precise,  aggressive tendencies lurking underneath. The 2018 Jaguar F-Type gives us  further cause to rejoice with a more modern, streamlined media-navigation  interface replacing the dated tech in earlier models. </p>, <p>You can get the F-Type as a convertible or coupe,  with a four-cylinder or a supercharged V6 or V8 engine, with a manual or  paddle-shifted automatic transmission and in rear- or all-wheel-drive  configuration. That's a surprising amount of variation, and it befits the kind  of tailored class of cars to which it belongs. Drivers who seek maximum  exhilaration need only consider the two 500-plus-horsepower V8, which is brash,  loud and blisteringly fast. The V6, available in 340-hp and 380-hp versions, or  the new four-cylinder addition should suit everyone else just fine. </p>, <p>New safety systems are available this year to help  you avoid incidents on your daily commute, plus the new ReRun InControl app, a  smartphone app that can download video from a mounted GoPro camera and overlay  performance data on the image. It should be a fun toy for track-day heroes.</p>, <p>Though our favorite versions of the F-Type aren't  inexpensive, they're still a relative bargain compared to some German and  Japanese rivals. This is a sports car that's worth every penny.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Jaguar F-Type is a two-seat luxury sports car available as a coupe or  convertible. It comes in <strong>Base</strong>, <strong>R</strong> and <strong>SVR</strong> trim levels with subvariations in between. The base models can  be optioned up handsomely, but power hounds will want the preternatural V8  performance of the <strong>R</strong> and <strong>SVR</strong> trims. A new four-cylinder <strong>Base</strong> model is perfect for getting your  feet wet with a new Jag. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>Base </strong>F-Type starts with a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (296 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque) paired  with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. This is the  only configuration available with the four-cylinder. </p>, <p>Features  include 18-inch alloy wheels, an active sport exhaust, LED headlights and  taillights, automatic wipers, power-folding and heated side mirrors, and rear  parking sensors. Inside you'll find push-button ignition, leather and simulated  suede upholstery, power seats with memory settings and a power-adjustable  steering wheel (with attached paddle shifters for automatic transmission  models). You also get a rearview camera, Bluetooth, an 8-inch touchscreen,  Jaguar's Touch Pro infotainment interface, a navigation system and a Meridian  sound system with a USB interface and satellite radio. Automatic emergency  braking and lane departure warning are included on models sold in the second  half of 2017. </p>, <p>A <strong>340HP</strong> base model upgrades to a  supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine (340 horsepower, 332 lb-ft of torque) paired to a choice of the six-speed manual or the eight-speed automatic. A <strong>380HP</strong> version offers a higher-output  engine (380 hp, 339 lb-ft), optional all-wheel drive, 19-inch wheels, an  adaptive suspension, a limited-slip differential and upgraded brakes. </p>, <p>A step up  from that is the <strong>Dynamic</strong>, which adds  a driver-selectable active exhaust and various gloss black exterior trim  pieces. A <strong>400 Sport</strong> derivative  rounds out the subtrims, boosting engine power to 400 hp and adding full  leather seats and panel upholstery, a heated steering wheel and customizable  ambient interior lighting, and assorted cosmetic details. The 400 Sport is only  available with the automatic transmission and aluminum shift paddles. </p>, <p>The <strong>R </strong>trim is a significant leap upward,  substituting a 5.0-liter supercharged V8 engine (550 hp, 502 lb-ft) paired to  the automatic and all-wheel drive. Additional features include 20-inch wheels,  upgraded brakes, gloss black exterior trim, auto-dimming side mirrors, keyless  entry, premium leather upholstery and sport seats. </p>, <p>The  top-trim <strong>SVR </strong>uses a higher-output V8  (575 hp, 516 lb-ft) and adds front parking sensors, a carbon-fiber rear  spoiler, upgraded interior trim and a heated steering wheel. </p>, <p>The  options list is long, but highlights include the carbon-ceramic brake package,  which adds larger brakes, yellow calipers and 20-inch wheels (it's only  available for automatic-transmission models). A duo of climate packages offers  dual-zone climate control, a heated windshield, heated and ventilated seats,  and a heated steering wheel. Driver assistance features such as blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and  intervention, traffic sign recognition, a drowsy driver warning system, and a  self-parking system are available across the board. </p>, <p>A  carbon-fiber roof or fixed panoramic sunroof and power liftgate are available  for all coupe models. There are also various leather upholstery packages for  base, base variations and R trims that include leather or suede-wrapped  headliners, front pillars and sun visors. </p>, <p>Other stand-alone  options include keyless entry, sport seats, ambient interior lighting,  automatic high beams and a Meridian surround-sound system. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of both the <strong>2016</strong> <strong>Jaguar F-Type S Coupe </strong>(supercharged 3.0L V6 | 6-speed manual | RWD)  and a <strong>2016 F-Type R Coupe </strong>(supercharged  5.0L V8 | 8-speed automatic | AWD). Note that our star ratings reflect the S  Coupe's rating, while observations about the R Coupe are integrated into  comments.</p>, <p>Also note  that since this test was conducted, the current F-Type has received revisions,  including upgrades to its media and infotainment systems. Our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's F-Type, and we've commented on the sections  where the 2018 model might be different.</p>]

[<p>Jaguar has a storied pedigree, of course. Yet its  efforts at building a competitive small luxury sedan have largely floundered  until now. The 2018 Jaguar XE muscles its way into garages that once hosted  other European stalwarts, doing it through a combination of style, performance  and modern technology. </p>, <p>Key to this success is a varied engine lineup.  There's a punchy four-cylinder gas engine, a fuel-sipping diesel four-cylinder,  and a supercharged V6 available in 340-horsepower and 380-hp configurations.  Pair any of these with the XE's exemplary handling and steering, and you have a  clear formula for a fun-to-drive small luxury sport sedan. </p>, <p>There's more to this Jag than high-octane antics,  though. The XE also offers much of the latest in-car tech and connectivity  (including a large touchscreen interface, a digital instrument/gauge cluster  and smartphone app integration) as well as a full suite of driver assistance  and aids. </p>, <p>About the only disappointment we can level at the XE  is the mediocre quality of its cabin materials and its relatively cramped  backseat. But if you can live with an interior that's subpar for the class yet  still pretty nice, and you don't plan to shuttle around too many friends, the  XE is among the most fun and responsive sedans you can find in this group.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Jaguar XE is available in base (<strong>XE)</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Prestige</strong>, <strong>Portfolio</strong>, <strong>R-Sport</strong>, and <strong>S</strong> trim levels. The first three trims introduce increasing degrees  of luxury, sport and convenience, while the Portfolio is a technology showcase.  The R-Sport and S models are high-performance centerpieces. Three engines are  available across the lineup, all paired with an eight-speed automatic  transmission. All are also available in rear- or all-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>Base <strong>XE </strong>models start with a choice of a  2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine (the <strong>25t</strong>) or a turbocharged 2.0-liter, diesel-fueled four-cylinder  engine (the <strong>20d</strong>). The gas engine  makes 247 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque, while the diesel is good for  180 hp and 318 lb-ft of torque. Standard features on the base XE model include  17-inch wheels, a sunroof, power front seats, dual-zone climate control,  simulated leather (Luxtec) upholstery, Bluetooth and an 8-inch touchscreen  media interface. The base XE also features driver-selectable drive modes suited  for rain, ice and snow conditions. </p>, <p><strong>Premium</strong> trims are available with either  four-cylinder engine or an optional supercharged 3.0-liter V6 (340 hp, 332  lb-ft of torque) and build on the base XE features with auto-dimming side  mirrors, driver seat and mirror memory settings, a 40/20/40-split folding rear  seat, a rearview camera, and an upgraded 11-speaker Meridian sound system. </p>, <p><strong>Prestige</strong> and <strong>R-Sport</strong> trims also get the choice of four-cylinder gas/diesel or V6  engines. <strong>Prestige</strong> upgrades include  18- or 19-inch wheels (depending on engine selection), keyless entry, leather  upholstery, heated front seats with additional adjustment, power-adjustable  steering column and heated steering wheel, ambient interior lighting, a  navigation system, and Jaguar's InControl apps, which enables control of  various smartphone apps through the touchscreen interface. </p>, <p>Moving up  to the <strong>R-Sport</strong> includes features  such as unique 19- or 20-inch wheels and exterior trim, adaptive xenon  headlights (with LED accent lights), automatic high beams, upgraded leather  upholstery and panel trim, and satellite radio. A host of driver assistance  aids are also standard, including blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert, lane departure warning and intervention, automatic emergency braking,  and front and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>The <strong>S</strong> trim is equipped similarly to the  R-Sport but only offers the supercharged V6 engine (with power increased to 380  hp) and all-wheel drive. Specific features include 19-inch wheels, upgraded  front seats, enhanced leather upholstery, and upgraded aluminum and metal cabin  accents.</p>, <p>The limited-run <strong>Portfolio</strong> model is equipped  similarly to the S trim; it comes in only a tan interior-white exterior color  combination and showcases Jaguar's technology offerings. Standard features  include a navigation system, a 10-inch touchscreen interface, a 12.3-inch  digital instrument/gauge display, a 3G Wi-Fi connection, a head-up display, a  Meridian surround-sound system, customizable ambient interior lighting and a  hands-free opening trunk. Heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats  and the R-Sport's driver assistance features are also standard. </p>, <p>Many of  the additional features found on the upper trim levels can be ordered as  options on the lower trims. A Driver Assistance package, available for R-Sport  and S trims, enhances the standard driver aids with adaptive cruise control  with traffic sign recognition and adaptive speed limiter, forward collision  alert, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, a 360-degree parking  camera system and an automated parking system. Certain XE variants can also be  ordered with an adaptive suspension.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Jaguar XF is a midsize luxury vehicle that is a refreshingly different  option among the popular and ubiquitous German staples of the class. It may not  generate world-beating performance, but its lightweight all-aluminum chassis  and suspension give the XF great road feel. It's available in six trim levels,  two body styles, with four engine choices, and either rear- or all-wheel-drive  drivetrains, so you can dial in the exact experience you're looking for.</p>, <p>Compared  to your typical luxury sedan, the XF has more charisma and pomp. Its shift  selector rises from the center console when you fire up the engine, and its  interior materials and colors are all generally warm and inviting. Styling is  top-notch and punches above the XF's price bracket. And in terms of size, it's  on par in interior volume, but the sedan edges out others when it comes to  trunk volume.</p>, <p>If  we had to point out any weaknesses, it would be its infotainment system  — more specifically, its poor smartphone integration — and  build quality that falls short of the standards set by the class. But all in  all, the XF is a good package: stylish, roomy and enjoyable to drive. </p>]

[<p>The  Jaguar XF sedan is available in six trim levels: <strong>base</strong>,<strong> Premium</strong>,<strong> Prestige, R-Sport, Portfolio </strong>and <strong>S. </strong>The Sportbrake comes only in the S  version. The <strong>Premium </strong>and <strong>Prestige</strong> trims build on the <strong>base </strong>trim with additional standard  features and more available options. The <strong>R-Sport</strong> adds even more luxury features as well as an R-Sport specific body kit. At the  top, you can go one of two ways: The luxurious <strong>Portfolio</strong> comes with almost every option as standard, while the <strong>S</strong> maximizes performance with a  high-output engine. A number of different engines and powertrains are available  for most trims.</p>]

[<p>As  a performance-oriented car, even the <strong>base</strong> XF comes with JaguarDrive Control, a feature that allows drivers to select  various modes altering the steering, throttle response and transmission shift  characteristics to best suit the current road conditions. The base XF also  comes with a 380-watt Meridian surround-sound system and an 8-inch Jaguar Touch  infotainment system. The <strong>Premium</strong> trim adds driver-seat memory settings, a 40/20/40-split folding rear seat, a  power-adjustable steering column and power-folding mirrors. <strong>Prestige</strong> models are upgraded to 19-inch  wheels, a navigation system, keyless entry, heated front seats, a heated  steering wheel, front and rear park assist, and leather seats with four-way  lumbar adjustment. </p>, <p>Further  up is the<strong> R-Sport</strong>. It adds adaptive  headlights, contrasting seat stitching, blind-spot monitoring and satellite  radio. But the real reason to get the R-Sport is its unique visual touches such  as the two-tone interior package and body kit, which includes a unique front  bumper, blacked-out grille with satin chrome trim, extended rocker sills, satin  chrome side vents and a trunk spoiler.</p>, <p>At  the top end are two distinct choices: the luxurious <strong>Portfolio</strong> or the performance-oriented <strong>S</strong>. The Portfolio features 18-way power-adjustable seats with  four-way lumbar support, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a  configurable ambient lighting system, a head-up display, and a larger 10.2-inch  touchscreen and an 825-watt Meridian surround-sound system. </p>, <p>The <strong>S</strong> trim comes with 20-inch wheels and  an S-specific body kit, which includes front and rear bumpers with gloss black  accents, gloss black side sills, a trunklid spoiler and badging. Also standard  are both Adaptive and Configurable Dynamics systems, which includes a  suspension that adjusts on the fly and allows you to configure vehicle systems  individually. For example, you could combine the most dynamic  engine-transmission setting with the softest suspension mode. The centerpiece  of the S trim is the high-output 380-hp supercharged V6, the most powerful  engine offered in the XF.</p>, <p>The  XF S Sportbrake is largely the same as its sedan counterpart, though it also  includes a load-leveling air suspension, a panoramic glass roof, roof rails and  a hands-free tailgate.</p>, <p>   All  trims can be had in either rear- or all-wheel drive, except the Sportbrake,  which features standard AWD. Base through Portfolio trims can be equipped with  either a 2.0-liter turbodiesel (180 hp, 318 lb-ft) or a 2.0-liter turbocharged  gasoline (247 hp, 269 lb-ft). Premium trims and up also offer the 3.0-liter  supercharged V6 (340 hp, 332 lb-ft) engine, while the higher-output V6 (380 hp,  332 lb-ft) is exclusive to the S.</p>, <p>A  few optional packages that are available on most trim levels include the <strong>Vision Assist package,</strong> which has  adaptive LED headlights with auto high-beam assist (this automatically dips the  high beams when it senses oncoming traffic), front and rear parking sensors,  front collision mitigation, blind-spot warning, and lane departure warning. The  available <strong>Technology package</strong> upgrades you from the 8-inch standard screen to one measuring 10.2 inches, adds  navigation and the 825-watt Meridian surround-sound system, and replaces the  driver's analog instrument panel with a large 12.3-inch digital display. And  lastly, a <strong>Cold Climate package</strong> is  also available that includes heaters for the front and rear seats, steering  wheel, windshield and washer jets.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Jaguar XJ isn't likely to be the first model that comes to mind when  people think of flagship luxury sedans, but that's part of the appeal. Quiet,  comfortable and quick in any form, there's much to love about this quintessentially  British sedan.</p>, <p>All  XJs, including the base R-Sport trim, come nicely equipped. Features such as an  adaptive suspension and heated and cooled seats are standard across the board,  as are a number of active driver's aids. Planning to spend most of your time in  the back seat? The long-wheelbase XJL models offer 5 more inches of legroom and  can be outfitted with massaging and reclining rear seats, rear footrests, and a  dual-screen rear entertainment system. As far as powertrains go, the XJ offers up  a base supercharged V6 that provides more than adequate thrust for daily use,  with two levels of supercharged V8s if sports car acceleration is also a  requirement. </p>, <p>There  are a few downsides to the 2018 XJ, though. Its infotainment interface, though  updated for this year, isn't the easiest to use. The XJ also lacks some of the  latest technology and ultra-luxury features found in more recently updated  rivals such as the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. But even if  the XJ isn't a class leader, there's palpable liveliness from behind the wheel,  and Jaguar's designs always seem to age slower than most. It's worth checking  out.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Jaguar XJ is a sporty full-size luxury sedan that seats up to five and is  available in regular <strong>XJ </strong>and  long-wheelbase <strong>XJL</strong> models. Trims  consist of the <strong>R-Sport</strong> and the <strong>Supercharged</strong> for XJ cars and the <strong>Portfolio</strong>, Supercharged and the new <strong>XJR575</strong> for XJL. All models have  supercharged engines and eight-speed automatic transmissions and come standard  with rear-wheel drive. The R-Sport and Portfolio share a 3.0-liter V6 (340  horsepower, 332 pound-feet) and can be equipped with all-wheel drive. The  Supercharged trim gets a 5.0-liter V8 (470 hp, 424 lb-ft) and the XJR575 a  higher-output V8 (575 hp, 517 lb-ft). </p>]

[<p>It  may be the base model, but the <strong>R-Sport</strong> comes very well equipped with standard 19-inch wheels, an adaptive and  self-leveling suspension, adjustable drive modes, front and rear parking  sensors, a rearview camera, automatic wipers, adaptive LED headlights with  automatic high beams, a panoramic sunroof, power soft-close doors, a power  trunklid, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure  warning with lane keeping assist, driver condition monitoring (RWD models  only), auto-dimming mirrors, and keyless ignition and entry.</p>, <p>Inside  the R-Sport you'll find leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate  control, heated and ventilated seats, driver-seat memory settings, and a  power-adjustable and heated steering wheel. A new larger 10-inch touchscreen  anchors the infotainment system featuring navigation, Bluetooth, voice  controls, Jaguar's InControl app suite, a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, and a 14-speaker  Meridian audio system with a satellite and HD radio, a CD player, digital music  storage and a USB connection.</p>, <p>Options  and packages available for the R-Sport include the Comfort package that adds  upgraded front seats with massage functions, front passenger-seat memory  settings, four-zone climate control and power rear sunshade. Other notable  options include a surround-view camera, 360-degree parking sensors, an  automatic parking system (RWD models only), adaptive cruise control, an  upgraded Meridian sound system, and a heated wood-and-leather steering wheel.</p>, <p>The <strong>Portfolio</strong> model is the equivalent  base trim of the long-wheelbase XJL. In addition to the 5 inches of rear  legroom gained, you'll get the features from the Comfort package as standard.  The options list for the Portfolio is similar to the R-Sport, with the addition  of a Premium Rear Seat package that includes reclining rear seats with  footrests as well as massage and memory functions, extra-cushy winged headrests  for all seats, power rear side-window sunscreens, fold-down tray tables and a  rear-seat entertainment system.</p>, <p>The  V8-powered <strong>Supercharged</strong> trim, again  available in both the regular and long wheelbase, includes the Portfolio  model's standard equipment, along with unique exterior trim, an active locking  rear differential, tauter suspension tuning, 20-inch wheels with performance  tires, and larger brakes. All of the R-Sport and Portfolio options are also  available on the Supercharged model.</p>, <p>Topping  the range is the fire-breathing <strong>XJR575</strong> models with 25 more horsepower on tap compared to last year's XJR model. If  that isn't enough to get excited, you also receive exclusive 20-inch wheels,  XJR575-specific exterior and interior body details, a carbon-fiber engine  cover, premium paint colors (an extra-cost option on lesser XJs), R-specific  suspension tuning, an active exhaust system (varying the amount of exhaust  noise), sport seats, aluminum paddle shifters, a heated steering wheel, a suede  headliner and unique carbon-fiber interior trim. But due to the XJR's  performance focus, you unfortunately lose the massaging seats, and the Premium  Rear Seating package and the upgraded Meridian stereo are not available.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our First Drive of the<strong> 2016 Jaguar XJL Portfolio AWD</strong> (supercharged 3.0L V6 | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current XJ has received some revisions,  including an updated infotainment system and more standard active safety  features for rear-drive models. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's XJ.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Jeep Cherokee stands out from the competitive small crossover segment  thanks to its exceptional off-road ability. That's what Jeeps are known for,  particularly in Jeep's Trail Rated Trailhawk trim. Ordered as such, the  Cherokee can handle trails better than any other rival. But most shoppers are  just looking for a comfortable vehicle to drive every day, and the Cherokee is  effective on this front as well. With a supple suspension and a strong V6  engine option, plus an easy-to-use 8.4-inch touchscreen inside, the 2018  Cherokee is prepared for the daily grind.</p>, <p>There  are a few downsides, including lackluster acceleration from the Cherokee's  standard four-cylinder engine and a lack of cargo space. But if you want an  affordable crossover SUV that can comfortably get you to work during the week  and then hit the trail on the weekend, there's no better choice than the 2018  Cherokee. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a five-passenger midsize SUV that comes in seven  trim levels: <strong>Laredo</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong>, <strong>Trailhawk</strong>, <strong>Overland</strong>, <strong>Summit,</strong> <strong>SRT</strong> and <strong>Trackhawk</strong>. </p>]

[<p>Most  Grand Cherokees are available with rear-wheel drive (2WD) or four-wheel drive  (4WD), Trailhawk is 4WD only and the SRT and Trackhawk get specialized  all-wheel-drive systems. All Grand Cherokees are reasonably well equipped but  certain upgrades are offered only on higher trims, including the 8.4-inch  touchscreen and the optional V8 engines.</p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights for the base <strong>Laredo </strong>include  a 3.6-liter V6 engine (295 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque), an  eight-speed automatic transmission, 17-inch wheels, heated mirrors, a rearview  camera, rear parking sensors, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic  climate control, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay support, and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio and two  USB ports.</p>, <p>The  Laredo E package adds a power-adjustable driver's seat, a few visual tweaks and  the further option to add 18-inch wheels, the upgraded 8.4-inch touchscreen  with navigation, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel, a power  liftgate and remote start.</p>, <p>The  Upland<strong> </strong>is a further optional Laredo  package and comes standard with Jeep's Quadra-Trac I full-time 4WD system  (similar to what's on the Trailhawk, but without a low-range gearbox). You also  get 20-inch wheels, a blacked-out appearance package, heated seats and steering  wheel, and the option to add a power sunroof and the 8.4-inch touchscreen with  navigation.</p>, <p>The  Altitude package for the Laredo trim keeps the blacked-out exterior trim but  skips the standard 4WD. The Altitude comes standard with heated front seats and  a heated steering wheel, leather seats with simulated suede inserts, a power  liftgate, remote start, and the 8.4-inch touchscreen with navigation. The  higher trim levels' nine-speaker stereo is an optional upgrade, as is a  sunroof.</p>, <p>If  you're looking for more creature comforts, then check out the <strong>Limited</strong> trim level. On Limited and  above, you can go with the standard V6 or you can opt for the optional  turbocharged 3.0-liter diesel-powered V6 (240  hp, 420 lb-ft of torque). The 5.7-liter V8 (360 hp, 390 lb-ft) is available but  only with 4WD.  </p>, <p>Other  standard equipment on the Limited includes 18-inch wheels, remote start,  auto-dimming driver-side and rearview mirrors, a power liftgate, a 115-volt  power outlet, a heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, leather  upholstery, power front seats and driver-seat memory settings.</p>, <p>Available  options include a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment package, a suite of  driver aids (adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, lane departure warning, parking assist, and automatic  wipers), and the Luxury Group II package, which adds the nine-speaker stereo,  xenon headlights and automatic high beams, a dual-pane sunroof, ventilated  front seats, a power-adjustable steering wheel, and the 8.4-inch touchscreen  with navigation. </p>, <p>Most  of the Trailhawk's off-road gear can be added to the 4WD Limited with the  Off-Road Adventure II package. The Limited can also be equipped with the Trailer  Tow package, which adds a Class IV hitch receiver, 7- and 4- pin wiring  harness, a full-size spare tire, load-leveling suspension, and additional  engine cooling. This towing equipment is standard on higher-trim 4WD Grand  Cherokee variants.</p>, <p>The  Sterling Edition package is a variant of the Limited meant to celebrate the  Grand Cherokee's 25th anniversary. It adds quite a bit of chrome exterior trim,  some special Sterling Edition badging, 20-inch wheels, and on the inside unique  leather upholstery and extended leather trim. The 8.4-inch touchscreen,  nine-speaker stereo, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert are  also standard with the Sterling Edition.</p>, <p>The  off-road-oriented <strong>Trailhawk </strong>trim  level is our choice for the Grand Cherokee. Without a doubt, it's one of the  most capable off-road SUVs in its class. On top of the Limited trim, it adds  unique exterior styling flourishes, different 18-inch wheels with off-road  tires, four-wheel drive with low-range gearing (Quadra-Trac II) and an  electronic rear differential that works with a terrain-selectable traction  control system (Quadra-Drive II).</p>, <p>The  Trailhawk also has an adjustable air suspension (Quadra-Lift) with increased  suspension travel and other Trailhawk-specific tuning, hill ascent and descent  control, underbody skid plates, trim-specific interior styling, and an upgraded  instrument cluster display with exclusive off-road features, power-folding  mirrors, ventilated front seats, an 8.4-inch touchscreen interface, a  navigation system and a nine-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Next  in the Grand Cherokee lineup is the <strong>Overland</strong>.  It has a few more luxury options and shares the Trailhawk's latter four  standard features as well as a mainstream version of its air suspension. It's  also equipped with 20-inch wheels, automatic wipers, xenon headlights with auto  high-beam control, LED daytime running lights and foglights, a dual-pane  panoramic sunroof, a navigation system, a power-adjustable steering wheel and  extended leather upholstery. The Off-Road Adventure II package is available, as  is the rear-seat entertainment package, the active safety feature suite, and  the Trailhawk's Quadra-Drive II system.</p>, <p>The  High Altitude package adds blacked-out trim, the suite of driver aids, and a  dual-pane sunroof to the Overland. Quadra-Drive II and rear-seat entertainment  are available options for High Altitude-equipped Overlands, along with a  19-speaker stereo system.</p>, <p>If  you want most of the creature comforts that the Grand Cherokee has to offer,  definitely consider the <strong>Summit</strong> trim.  It includes the Overland's standard equipment, plus polished 20-inch wheels,  headlight washers, front parking sensors, a self-parking system (both parallel  and perpendicular), additional noise-reducing window glass, active  noise-canceling technology, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring with  rear cross-traffic alert, a forward collision mitigation system with automatic  emergency braking, lane departure warning, upgraded leather upholstery with  diamond-quilted accents, and a 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system. (A full  leather interior with even more coverage is an extra-cost option.) Most of the  Summit's safety equipment is also available on the Overland trim level via the  High Altitude package. </p>, <p>A  bit out of the standard structure is the high-horsepower <strong>SRT</strong> trim level. It is broadly equipped like the Summit trim level  with a few distinctions. Unique standard equipment includes a 6.4-liter V8 (475  hp, 470 lb-ft), a specialized all-wheel-drive system (tuned more for  high-performance driving than off-road use), 20-inch wheels with performance  tires, an adaptive sport-tuned suspension, sport-tuned steering and brakes, a  sport body kit, a limited-slip rear differential and selectable performance  modes.</p>, <p>Options for the SRT include a dual-pane panoramic sunroof,  two different 20-inch wheel styles (carbon black or lightweight), upgraded  brakes, extended and upgraded leather upholstery, the 19-speaker audio system,  and a towing package.</p>, <p>Even  further down the high-performance rabbit hole, there's the Grand Cherokee <strong>Trackhawk</strong>. The Trackhawk gets most of  the SRT's standard equipment plus the supercharged 6.2-liter V8 (707 hp, 645  lb-ft), an upgraded eight-speed transmission, an upgraded adaptive suspension  and Brembo brakes, more aggressive-looking bodywork, and lightweight 20-inch  wheels with high-performance tires. There are also some unique interior design  cues and upgraded upholstery to set the Trackhawk apart from the group. </p>, <p>Many  of the higher trims' standard features are offered on lesser models as options.  The dual-screen rear entertainment system with Blu-ray capability is also  optional for the Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit and SRT. Quite a few  aesthetic upgrades are available as well, depending on trim level.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects.<br>   The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit </strong>(turbo 3.0L V6 diesel | 8-speed  automatic | 4WD). </br></p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Grand Cherokee has received some  revisions, including a new gearshift lever, the addition of electric-assist  power steering and a weight reduction courtesy of some aluminum suspension  components. Other findings remain applicable to this year's Grand Cherokee.</p>]

[<p>Compared to the previous-generation Jeep Compass, the 2018  Compass is vastly improved. Introduced midway through the 2017 model year, the  newest Compass is more comfortable to drive and can be fitted with Jeep's  latest in-car technology features such as the easy-to-operate Uconnect  infotainment system. </p>, <p>The Compass occupies an interesting spot in Jeep's lineup.  It's smaller and more affordable than Jeep's Cherokee crossover SUV but bigger  and more capable than the Renegade. This could be the sweet spot for a lot of  shoppers. The Compass offers a decent 27 cubic feet of rear luggage space. Fold  down the 60/40-split rear seats to reveal almost 60 cubic feet of space. Room  in the second row is enough to keep even tall passengers comfortable. </p>, <p>Most Compasses will be purchased with front-wheel drive, but  it wouldn't be a Jeep unless it could handle off-road trails. And while most  owners will never need the off-roading hardware available on the Trailhawk trim,  it's nice to know it's there if you want to do some overlanding, just get down  a muddy road, or climb out of a snowed-in parking lot. </p>, <p>Overall, we like the Compass. If you're looking for a  comfortable and affordable crossover SUV that can also get you out and into  nature, the new Compass works well.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Compass is available in four trim levels: Sport,  Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk. All come with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine  (180 horsepower, 175 pound-feet of torque). A six-speed manual transmission is  standard on the Sport, and a six-speed (FWD) or a nine-speed (AWD) automatic  transmission is optional. All other Compass trims have the automatic as  standard equipment. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is  optional on all Compasses except the Trailhawk, which comes standard with AWD.</p>]

[<p>Starting things out is the <strong>Sport </strong>trim. Standard equipment highlights include 16-inch wheels,  air-conditioning, the smaller Uconnect system (with 5-inch touchscreen  display), Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port and a six-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Compared to the Sport, the Compass <strong>Latitude</strong> has larger wheels, upgraded cloth and simulated leather  seat upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless ignition and entry,  and more choices for options packages. </p>, <p>The Compass <strong>Limited</strong> is the most comprehensively equipped. Standout features include 18-inch wheels,  remote start, upgraded exterior trim, a 8.5-inch Uconnect touchscreen (with  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration), satellite radio,  automatic dual-zone climate control, an upgraded driver information display, a  power driver seat, heated front seats and leather upholstery. </p>, <p>Though the <strong>Trailhawk</strong> sits below the Limited in price, it differs greatly in function and features.  Only available in AWD with the nine-speed automatic, it rides on 17-inch wheels  with off-road-oriented tires, a raised suspension, and a unique front fascia to  maximize approach and breakover angles. Further mechanical changes include its  own Selec-Terrain system to help it crawl over steep climbs and rocky surfaces.  Red tow hooks front and rear and a matte-black hood accent further  differentiate the Trailhawk from the rest of the Compass line, while a hidden  set of underbody protection shields keep the engine, oil pan and gas tank from  harm's way.</p>, <p>Other popular options, depending on the trim level, include  a navigation system, a sunroof, a premium Beats audio system, a power liftgate,  a Cold Weather package, and an Advanced Safety and Lighting package that  includes xenon headlights, forward collision warning and mitigation, and lane  departure warning and intervention.</p>]

[<p>Whatever  you're looking for in an SUV, the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee likely offers it.  Depending on how you equip it, it can be well-rounded and luxurious, an  off-road specialist or a hot-rod SUV. It's one of our favorites in the midsize  SUV class.</p>, <p>Since it's a Jeep, you'd expect that the Grand Cherokee will offer  class-leading off-road abilities, and it delivers. With special  four-wheel-drive systems, available skid plates and multiple drive modes for  varying surfaces, it goes much further off-road than the average SUV. But what  you might not expect is the the Grand Cherokee's performance side. On top of  the decently powerful standard V6 engine, the Grand Cherokee offers three V8  engine options, including a 475-horsepower V8 under the hood of the SRT model  and the truly bonkers 707-hp Trackhawk model.</p>, <p>Stack  up all the unique features, add them to the Grand Cherokee's inherent utility  and you've got an SUV with something for just about everyone. </p>]

On Limited and above, you can go with the standard V6 or you can opt for the optional 5.7-liter V8 (360 hp, 390 lb-ft). The Grand Cherokee's turbocharged 3.0-liter diesel-powered V6 (240 hp, 420 lb-ft of torque) could also be optional for 2018, though its availability is delayed and questionable at the time of this review's publication. Regardless, these engines come standard with an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The off-road-oriented <strong>Trailhawk </strong>trim level is our choice for the Grand Cherokee. Without a doubt, it's one of the most capable off-road SUVs in its class. On top of the Limited trim, it adds unique exterior styling flourishes, different 18-inch wheels with off-road tires, four-wheel drive with low-range gearing (Quadra-Drive II), an adjustable air suspension (Quadra-Lift) with increased suspension travel and other Trailhawk-specific tuning, hill ascent and descent control, an electronic limited-slip rear differential, underbody skid plates, trim-specific interior styling, and an upgraded instrument cluster display with exclusive off-road features.

[<p>Think about any SUV TV commercial from  two decades ago. Chances are it featured a blocky truck tearing through muddy  puddles along a wooded trail while promising go-anywhere capability. However,  most people don't traipse through underbrush on their way to work, and  automakers have increasingly favored the on-road experience. But all is not  lost for weekend adventurers. The 2018 Jeep Renegade proves you can have  comfort and genuine off-road performance in a single, relatively affordable  small SUV package.</p>, <p>The Renegade's off-road abilities make it  unique in the rapidly growing subcompact SUV class, especially in Trailhawk  guise. Its all-terrain tires, increased ride height and low-range four-wheel  drive make it the gem in the lineup if you're ready to get a little dirty. Even  the trims that aren't trail-rated — from the fire sale-priced Sport  to the luxe Limited — can venture off the beaten path more  comfortably than rivals.</p>, <p>But the Renegade isn't just for those  looking to conquer the great outdoors. With the exception of the Trailhawk (its  tires make the ride quite bumpy), the smallest Jeep is downright pleasurable to  drive on the road. We think it's one of the standouts in the segment, whether  you're keeping the tires on asphalt or trudging through mud.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Jeep Renegade as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-small-suvs/" title="Best Small SUVs">Best Small SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Jeep Renegade is a subcompact  crossover with greater off-road abilities than any other vehicle in the class.  It's sold in four trims: base <strong>Sport, </strong>the  better-equipped <strong>Latitude</strong>, the  trail-conquering <strong>Trailhawk</strong> and the  luxurious <strong>Limited</strong>. Front-wheel drive  is standard, and four-wheel drive is optional on all trims except the  Trailhawk, which is the only model outfitted with 4WD with a low-range setting. </p>]

[<p>The  entry-level <strong>Sport </strong>model is powered  by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (160 horsepower, 184  pound-feet of torque) paired exclusively to a six-speed manual transmission.  Standard equipment includes 16-inch steel wheels, manually adjustable mirrors,  remote locking and unlocking, push-button ignition, power windows and locks, a  rearview camera, a height-adjustable driver seat, a fold-flat front passenger  seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, cloth upholstery, a removable cargo  floor panel, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a driver information  display, Bluetooth, a 5-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker sound system with a  USB port. </p>, <p>There  are three primary features packages for the Renegade Sport. A Sport Appearance  package adds alloy wheels, roof rails and privacy glass. The Power &amp; Air  Group package adds heated, power-adjustable outside mirrors, cruise control and  air conditioning. Finally, the Uconnect 7.0 Group includes dual-zone automatic  climate control, satellite radio, a 7-inch touchscreen, and smartphone  integration via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The <strong>Latitude </strong>comes standard with those  three packages, plus foglights, automatic headlights, body-colored door handles  and mirrors, ambient LED lighting, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an  additional USB port. The <strong>Altitude </strong>package  adds black exterior styling elements, 18-inch wheels, upgraded cloth upholstery  and vinyl door trim.</p>, <p>Optional  for both models is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder (180 hp, 175 lb-ft) paired to a  nine-speed automatic transmission. </p>, <p>The  2.4-liter engine comes standard on the <strong>Limited. </strong>The Limited also adds dual exhaust tips, automatic wipers, a windshield  wiper de-icer, silver roof rails, keyless ignition and entry (with remote  engine start), vinyl door trim, an upgraded driver information display, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, remote engine start, a 115-volt household-style  power outlet, leather upholstery, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat  (with four-way power lumbar), heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a  leather-wrapped shift knob, and a 40/20/40-split folding rear seat with a  center pass-through.</p>, <p>The  off-road-themed <strong>Trailhawk </strong>builds off  the Latitude's feature set, with the 2.4-liter engine, 17-inch wheels with  all-terrain tires, four-wheel drive with low-range settings, hill descent  control, a raised suspension, tow hooks, underbody skid plates, a full-size  spare, unique exterior and interior accents, all-season floor mats and upgraded  cloth upholstery. It also includes some of the Limited's upgrades, including  automatic wipers, vinyl door trim, an upgraded driver information display, the  115-volt outlet and a leather-wrapped shift knob.</p>, <p>Many  features on the upper trims are available on lower models in a variety of  option packages. Other notable packages include the Safety &amp; Security Group  (Latitude and above; adds xenon headlights, automatic wipers, and blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert), Advanced Technology Group (Latitude  and Limited only; adds automatic high-beam control, rear parking sensors, lane  departure warning and mitigation, and forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking) and Uconnect 8.4 NAV Group (Latitude and above; adds a  navigation system, an 8.4-inch touchscreen, HD radio and the contents of the Uconnect  7.0 package).</p>, <p>Manually  removable My Sky sunroofs can be ordered on all Renegades. Except on the Sport  model, the front sunroof can also be power-operated. You can also get a  nine-speaker Beats premium audio system on Renegades except the Sport model. A  tow package is also available for Latitude models and above, providing you opt  for four-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Jeep Renegade Latitude</strong> (2.4L inline-4 | 9-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Jeep Renegade has received some  revisions, including the addition of a few features that were not originally  available, such as 2017's xenon headlights and automatic high-beam control. The  7- and 8.4-inch displays are also new for 2018. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Jeep Renegade.</p>]

[<p>Redesigned  for 2018, the Jeep Wrangler is more than just a dominating force off-road.  Updated with refreshed styling, new engines, and a roomier and higher-quality  interior, this year's Wrangler is a more practical SUV that can still go  anywhere. </p>, <p>Jeep  shoppers should note that two Wrangler models are on sale for 2018. Jeep is  selling this new generation Wrangler alongside the old Wrangler. The new one  might be referred to as the JL, while the old Wrangler is the JK. (These  acronyms relate to Jeep's model designations for its Wranglers.) If you're  shopping for 2018 Wranglers, you'll want to make sure you're aware of the  difference.</p>, <p>The  new Wrangler is now longer, wider and taller. It has the previous 3.6-liter V6  under the hood, but it can now be mated to an optional eight-speed automatic  transmission that vastly improves the Wrangler's drivability. A six-speed  manual is still standard. A new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is  on the way later this year, and it adds even more appeal to the mix. </p>, <p>A  big jump in comfort, the addition of several modern safety features, and more  interior space make the 2018 Jeep Wrangler a serious competitor in the midsize  SUV class. Of course, it still has unrivaled off-road prowess and aftermarket  parts support, too. Overall, we're impressed with the new Wrangler. You can  also read a more in-depth look about it in our Wrangler First Drive.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Jeep Wrangler is  available in a pair of body styles: the two-door and four-door Unlimited. The  two-door is available in <strong>Sport, Sport S </strong>and <strong>Rubicon</strong> trims, while the four-door  is available in <strong>Sport, Sport S, Sahara </strong>and <strong>Rubicon </strong>trims. Both are available  with a soft-top convertible or a hardtop.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>Sport</strong> trim level, while somewhat  basic, has much more equipment than previous Wranglers. Standard equipment  includes the 3.6-liter V6 (285 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque) paired to  a six-speed manual transmission (an eight-speed automatic is optional), 17-inch  steel wheels, a full-size spare tire, skid plates and tow hooks. It also has  foglights, keyless entry, removable full metal doors with crank windows, a  fold-down windshield, manual mirrors and locks, cruise control, air  conditioning (optional on the two-door Sport), a height-adjustable driver's  seat (with two-way lumbar adjustment), cloth upholstery, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, and a one-piece folding rear seat.</p>, <p>Also  included on the Sport are a 5-inch Uconnect touchscreen display, Bluetooth, a  rearview camera, an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, a USB port and  an auxiliary audio jack. Besides its two extra doors, the Unlimited version  also has a bigger gas tank, air conditioning, and a 60/40-split folding rear  seat.</p>, <p>On  top of the base Sport equipment, the <strong>Sport  S</strong> adds 17-inch alloy wheels, air conditioning, automatic headlights,  keyless entry, heated power mirrors, power windows and locks, an alarm, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, and sun visors with vanity mirrors. </p>, <p>The  midlevel <strong>Sahara</strong> is only available in  the four-door configuration and adds to the Sport S with 18-inch alloy wheels,  painted exterior body panels and trim, automatic LED headlights, LED foglights,  automatic climate control and a 115-volt outlet. It also comes with a bigger  driver information display, an additional USB port, and an upgraded version of  Uconnect with a 7-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone  integration, and satellite radio. </p>, <p>The  most off-road capable of the Wranglers is the <strong>Rubicon</strong>. It gets the basic Sport equipment plus 17-inch alloy  wheels, special off-road tires, a heavy-duty Dana M210 front axle and a M220  rear axle, shorter 4.10 axle gearing (the Sport and Sahara come with a 3.45  ratio), 4.0-to-1 low-range gearing, electronic front and rear locking  differentials, an electronically disconnecting front roll bar, rock rails and  an additional USB port. </p>, <p>Much  of the upper-level equipment is available in groups or as stand-alone options  for lower trim levels. Other options include remote start, heated seats, a  heated steering wheel, leather upholstery, an 8.4-inch Uconnect system with  navigation, blind-spot monitoring, and a nine-speaker Alpine sound system. All  trims are also available with a higher-quality soft top as well as a black or a  body-colored hardtop. </p>, <p>Jeep  says it will offer a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a  mild-hybrid eTorque system as an option in the Wrangler later in the model  year. A 3.0-liter diesel engine is on the horizon for 2019.</p>]
---http://edmunds.com/jeep/wrangler-jk/2018/review
[<p>You  might have heard there's a new Wrangler for 2018. This is not it. The Wrangler  JK — the JK part refers to Jeep's name for this Wrangler generation  — carries over from the previous year unchanged. But it should appeal  to the Jeep purists who lust after the old Wrangler in all its authentic and  impractical glory.</p>, <p>Ignoring  the more modern and redesigned 2018 Jeep Wrangler, the Wrangler JK makes a good  case for itself as an entertaining off-road vehicle. It's more capable than any  other SUV, and its relatively low price is hard to beat. It has, however,  sacrificed modernity along the way. The Wrangler JK isn't very comfortable, its  safety scores are worryingly low, and most modern tech that is standard on  other cars isn't available on the Wrangler JK.</p>, <p>You'll  likely be interested in the 2018 Wrangler JK if you're dissatisfied with the  new Wrangler design or if you value off-road capability above all else and  you're willing to sacrifice creature comforts for a price discount.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Jeep Wrangler JK is an off-road-focused SUV available in a pair of body  styles: the two-door, four-passenger Wrangler and the four-door, five-passenger  Wrangler Unlimited. Each is available in three core trim levels: <strong>Sport, Sahara </strong>and <strong>Rubicon</strong>. A vinyl convertible roof is standard on both, and a  hardtop with easily removable front panels above is available. All Wrangler JKs  are powered by a 3.6-liter V6 engine (285 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of  torque) and come with four-wheel drive as standard. A six-speed manual  transmission is standard, and a five-speed automatic is optional.</p>]

[<p>Other  than a few work trucks out there, it doesn't get much more basic than the base  Wrangler <strong>Sport </strong>trim level. The  two-door Sport includes 16-inch steel wheels, on- and off-road tires, a  full-size spare tire, skid plates, tow hooks, foglights, removable doors, a  fold-down windshield, manual mirrors and locks, full metal doors with manually  operated windows, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver's seat, cloth  upholstery, a tilt-only steering wheel, a one-piece folding, tumble-forward  back seat, and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary  audio jack. The Unlimited (four-door) version gets a bigger gas tank, air  conditioning and a 60/40-split folding, tumble-forward rear seat as standard.</p>, <p>The  Power Convenience Group adds power windows and locks, keyless entry, heated  power exterior mirrors, an alarm and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Cold  Weather package adds the Power Convenience Group's equipment plus remote start  and heated seats. Also available for the Sport are 17-inch alloy wheels, air  conditioning (for the two-door) and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>, <p>The <strong>Sahara</strong> adds the Power Convenience  Group items, 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, LED foglights,  additional painted exterior body panels and trim, hood insulation for reduced  noise, air conditioning, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and satellite radio.  The Sahara Unlimited differs only with tubular side steps and grab handles for  rear passengers.</p>, <p>The  Rubicon Wrangler leads the pack with a host of off-road goodies. It starts with  the basic Sport equipment and adds 17-inch alloy wheels, special tires, a  heavy-duty Dana 44 front axle (matching the standard-spec Dana 44 rear axle),  shorter 4.10 axle gearing (standard with the manual transmission; optional with  the automatic), an extra-low crawl ratio, electronic front and rear locking  differentials, an electronically disconnecting front anti-roll bar, rock rails,  automatic LED headlamps and the underhood insulation. Inside, you get standard  air conditioning plus the leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a  115-volt outlet and satellite radio. The above-mentioned Power Convenience  Group is an optional extra on the two-door Rubicon, but it's standard on the  Rubicon Unlimited.</p>, <p>Even  though you can only get the 4.10 gearing with a Rubicon, the Sport and the  Sahara are eligible for an upgrade to a 3.73 ratio, which gets you much of the  way there. The standard ratio is a modest 3.21. Also optional on the Sport and  the Sahara is a limited-slip rear differential, and the Sport and the Rubicon  can be equipped with half doors that include plastic side windows and manual  locks. </p>, <p>Optional  on every Wrangler is a nine-speaker Alpine sound system and the Connectivity  Group, which adds a tire-pressure monitor display, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, Bluetooth phone connectivity, a trip computer, and an upgraded version  of the Uconnect touchscreen that includes a USB port, media player interface  and navigation. All trims are also available with a higher-quality soft top as  well as a black or a body-colored hardtop.</p>, <p>On  top of all the optional equipment to sort through, there are several  special-edition packages (Willys Wheeler, Golden Eagle, Freedom Edition,  Altitude, etc.) that include items such as the limited-slip rear differential,  various wheel and exterior trim choices, unique badging, privacy glass, mud  terrain tires, rock rails, varying crawl ratios and specialized seat  embroidery. Even before you include the vast suite of available aftermarket  parts in the equation, the Wrangler is one of the most customizable vehicles on  the road today.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited</strong> (3.6L V6 |  5-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Jeep Wrangler has been completely  redesigned and is now referred to as the Jeep Wrangler JL. This test, however,  refers to the Jeep Wrangler JK, which is still on sale as a new model but is  essentially the same as the 2017 model. As a result, our findings remain  applicable to the 2018 Jeep Wrangler JK.</p>]

[<p>Sedan sales have been eroded by the popularity of crossover SUVs of late, but  there are shoppers who don't require the cargo solutions or tall seating  position they provide. If you're one of them, a large sedan such as the 2018  Kia Cadenza is simply a more suitable choice.</p>, <p>Among large sedans, the Kia Cadenza skews  heavily toward comfort and space for its passengers. The Cadenza made a big  leap forward in its ride comfort and the quality of the cabin materials when it  was redesigned in 2017, and it carries into 2018 unchanged. Its interior has a  premium vibe — especially considering the car's reasonable price  — and legroom is plentiful for all occupants. Its acceleration and  handling won't quicken your pulse, so if you're a driving enthusiast you might  be left wanting for more. Otherwise, the 2018 Cadenza's intersection of value,  space and luxury makes it worthy of your attention.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Kia Cadenza is a large  sedan that offers an abundance of room for all its occupants. Even in its base <strong>Premium </strong>form, the Cadenza is  well-equipped for what we think is a very reasonable price. Its available <strong>Luxury</strong> package is incorporated into the <strong>Technology</strong> trim, along with a few other desirable additions. And  the top-trim <strong>Limited </strong>just might fool  your passengers into thinking they're riding in a Lexus. There's one powertrain  available: a 3.3-liter V6 (290 horsepower, 253 pound-feet of torque) that's  matched to an eight-speed automatic and front-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>The base <strong>Premium</strong> trim is loaded with features, including 18-inch wheels,  foglights, heated mirrors, hands-free trunk opening, keyless entry and  ignition, a rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, dual-zone  automatic climate control, leather upholstery, eight-way power-adjustable and  heated front seats (with driver two-way lumbar adjustment), a 7-inch  touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth, and an eight-speaker  audio system with HD and satellite radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>The Premium is available with the Luxury package, which adds a panoramic  sunroof, power-folding mirrors, LED cabin lighting, an 8-inch touchscreen with  navigation, and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system. This package  also includes rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking sensors and advanced  blind-spot monitoring.</p>, <p>The <strong>Technology</strong> is one level up,  adding the contents of the <strong>Luxury</strong> package, along with 19-inch wheels, LED headlights  and foglights, automatic wipers, a power-adjustable and heated steering wheel  with paddle shifters, a 10-way driver's seat (with four-way lumbar adjustment),  two-way lumbar adjustment for the front passenger, ventilated front seats,  driver-seat memory settings and wireless phone charging. The Technology also  gets you forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane  departure warning and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>You can't go any higher than the <strong>Limited</strong> trim, which has all of the Technology trim's equipment plus a power-operated  trunklid, a head-up display, side rear sunshades, a power rear sunshade,  upgraded leather upholstery and heated rear seats.</p>]

[<p>Last year's refresh has helped keep the  2018 Kia Forte competitive in a class with much newer rivals. Kia made updates  to the Forte's interior quality, infotainment system, active safety features  and horsepower. All complemented the Forte's existing strengths: spacious  seating and cargo space and tons of value.</p>, <p>It's true that newer compact cars have  made gains in acceleration, fuel efficiency, interior space, handling and  technology features. That means the Forte isn't the standout it once was. But  the Forte's long list of available features, competitive price and outstanding  warranty coverage continue to make it a compelling choice for a compact sedan  or hatchback. It even offers a sporty SX hatchback trim level with an engine  making more than 200 horsepower, putting it in a league with only a few other  compacts. </p>, <p>If the Forte isn't quite for you, you  might want to check out the Honda Civic. It offers an excellent driving  experience and rivals the Forte for passenger space and technology features.  There's also the snazzy Mazda 3 and the capable Subaru Impreza to consider. But  even with such strong competition, we think the Forte is worth a test drive if  you're in the market for a well-equipped compact car </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Kia Forte is available as a sedan in <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>S</strong> and <strong>EX</strong> trim levels, while the hatchback (the Forte5) is offered in <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>EX</strong> and <strong>SX</strong> trims. The  base LX trim is reasonably equipped, while the EX has a more extensive list of  equipment. The S sedan and EX and SX hatchback offer some sporty touches, and  the SX even comes with a powerful turbocharged engine. </p>]

[<p>The  Forte LX and S sedans are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 147  horsepower and 132 pound-feet of torque. For most trims, power runs to the  front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. The base LX comes  standard with a six-speed manual, with the automatic available as an optional  upgrade.</p>, <p>Standard  features on the <strong>LX</strong> sedan include  15-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, air conditioning, full power accessories,  a trip computer, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable  driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, Bluetooth, and a four-speaker  sound system with a CD player, satellite radio, USB connectivity and an  auxiliary audio jack. </p>, <p>Optional  for the LX (but only with the automatic transmission) is the Popular package,  which includes automatic headlights, cruise control, upgraded interior  upholstery and trim, a sliding front armrest, a rear seat armrest, a rearview  camera, a 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, Kia's Uvo  telematics service and a six-speaker stereo. There's also the Popular Plus  package, which adds LED taillights, special alloy wheels and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel.</p>, <p>The <strong>S</strong> sedan starts with most of those  items and upgrades to a sport-tuned suspension, 16-inch alloy wheels, LED  running lights, a rear spoiler, a chrome exhaust outlet, adjustable drive modes  (including steering effort), unique black cloth upholstery with white contrast  stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and the 7-inch  touchscreen system.</p>, <p>The  S sedan's Technology package adds foglights, a sunroof, LED taillights, and  keyless entry and ignition plus a few safety technologies (lane departure  warning and prevention, blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking).</p>, <p>The <strong>EX</strong> sedan drops the sport-themed  extras but adds a 2.0-liter four-cylinder generating 164 hp and 151 lb-ft of  torque, a six-speed automatic, foglights, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED turn signal  indicators on the mirror housings (and puddle lamps underneath), LED  taillights, keyless entry and ignition, ambient interior lighting, leather  upholstery, heated front seats and dual-zone automatic temperature control with  rear vents. For 2018 the EX also receives some active safety features as  standard equipment, including blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert.</p>, <p>For  the EX, there's an optional Premium Plus package that adds a sunroof, a  power-adjustable driver seat, adaptive xenon headlights, a navigation system,  ventilated front seats and driver-seat memory settings. Forward collision alert  and automatic emergency braking are also part of this package.</p>, <p>From  a features standpoint, the hatchback's LX and EX trims largely mirror the  sedan's, with minor differences. </p>, <p>The <strong>SX</strong> hatchback adds a turbocharged  1.6-liter four-cylinder rated at 201 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with  either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.  It comes standard with 18-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, dual exhaust  tips, and sporty front and rear styling. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Kia Niro should be considered a hatchback even though it's officially  classified as a hybrid SUV. Crossovers and SUVs typically have extra ground  clearance and can be equipped with all-wheel drive for inclement weather  driving or even light off-roading. The Niro doesn't check either of these  boxes. </p>, <p>The  Niro's main appeal comes from a modern exterior design that doesn't shout  "hybrid," as well as a relatively peppy powertrain that makes it both  capable of outrunning a Toyota Prius and returning up to 50 mpg in combined  city and highway driving, according to EPA estimates.</p>, <p>One  thing to be aware of with the Niro is how it allocates interior space. Compared  to its mechanical sibling, the Hyundai Ioniq, the Niro has a significantly  smaller cargo area behind the rear seats. That said, rear passengers in the  Niro will enjoy slightly more legroom and headroom, and much of that space can  be converted to cargo room when the rear seatbacks are folded.</p>, <p>Like  many vehicles from Kia, the Niro offers a healthy number of features for the  money, especially at the higher trim levels. But if you genuinely need  crossover capability in your hybrid, we'd suggest checking out the Toyota RAV4  Hybrid.</p>]

[<p>The  Kia Niro is available in five trims beginning with the most fuel-efficient <strong>FE </strong>trim, with features added  incrementally moving up to the <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>EX</strong>, <strong>Touring Graphite Edition </strong>and <strong>Touring</strong> trims. All models come with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder hybrid-electric  powertrain (139 hp, 195 lb-ft total output) that sends power to the front  wheels through a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. The FE comes  surprisingly well-equipped for a base model, while the fully loaded Touring  trim comes with nearly every modern comfort feature standard. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>FE</strong> comes with 16-inch alloy  wheels, automatic headlights, six-way manually adjustable front seats, a  60/40-split folding rear seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, selectable  drive modes, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration, a rearview camera, Uvo eServices app  suite, Bluetooth, and a four-speaker sound system with a USB port.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>LX</strong> trim adds rear LED  taillights, roof rails, keyless ignition and entry, an underfloor storage tray  for the rear cargo area, and a rear center armrest with cupholders. Kia did  away with all the stand-alone options from 2017 and instead offers the <strong>Advanced Technology package</strong>, which  bundles forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian  detection, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and a few upper trim  items such as front foglights, LED daytime running lights, and a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob.</p>, <p>The <strong>EX</strong> trim comes with all the LX trim  items plus power-folding and heated side mirrors, a high-gloss black upper console,  cloth and leather upholstery, heated front seats, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, rear air-conditioning vents, an additional USB charge port, and a  blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert. Like the LX trim,  all EX options are now bundled into packages. The Advance Technology package  includes the same active safety features as the LX but also adds a 10-way power  driver's seat. The non-safety items from the LX package are already included in  the EX trim.</p>, <p>A  new<strong> Premium package</strong> for the EX trim  adds nearly all the Touring trim content, including xenon headlights, a gloss  black front grille with chrome trim, a sunroof, leather upholstery, ventilated  front seats, driver-seat memory function, a heated steering wheel, an 8-inch  touchscreen display, navigation, an eight-speaker premium Harmon Kardon sound  system, LED map lights, front and rear parking system, wireless phone charging  and a 110-volt power outlet. The only thing the package doesn't add is the  Touring trim's 18-inch wheels, which affords better fuel economy and a slightly  cheaper price tag.</p>, <p>The <strong>Touring</strong> trim comes with everything  standard this year including the active safety aids from the Advanced  Technology package on lower trim models. The only choices you have are colors  and smaller accessories. So if you plan to check all the boxes, and you don't  mind 18-inch wheels instead of the EX's 16-inchers, you're best off beelining  it to the Touring trim.</p>, <p>Similar to the Touring Launch model from  last year, the <strong>Touring Graphite Edition</strong> is priced in between the EX and top Touring trims. In terms of features, it's  closer to the EX trim but adds the 10-way power driver's seat, 8-inch  touchscreen with navigation, and a premium Harman Kardon audio system. It also  features a trim exclusive Platinum Graphite paint, glossy black 18-inch wheels,  glossy black roof rails and a metallic-colored front grille. The only caveat is  none of the EX trim's packages are available with this trim.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid is a new addition to Kia's Niro lineup. It's just  like the regular Niro Hybrid, but it comes with a bigger rechargeable battery  pack that allows you to drive an estimated 26 miles on pure electric power before  the vehicle switches over to normal hybrid operation. At that point you're  looking at a still frugal 46 mpg. And it costs less than most rival plug-in  hybrids.</p>, <p>Kia  describes its Niro as a crossover SUV. But without an available all-wheel-drive  system and only 1 more inch of ground clearance than Kia's own Optima sedan,  it's better to think of the Niro as a four-door hatchback rather than a true SUV.  Also, take note of how the Niro allocates interior space. Compared to its  mechanical sibling, the Hyundai Ioniq, the Niro has a significantly smaller  cargo area behind the rear seats. In return, though, the Niro has slightly more  legroom and headroom in back, and much of that space can be converted to cargo  room when the rear seatbacks are folded.</p>, <p>The  2018 Niro Plug-In Hybrid joins a growing selection of plug-in hybrids this year  that includes the Chevrolet Volt, the Honda Clarity Plug-In Hybrid and the  Toyota Prius Prime. If you want an easy-to-drive and efficient car with  understated SUV-like styling, you'll find a lot to like in the Niro.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid is available in three trims. It starts off with  the <strong>LX</strong>, which comes with a nice set  of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen display and many advanced driver  safety aids. The <strong>EX </strong>provides more  convenience-oriented and safety features, while the top <strong>EX Premium</strong> adds luxury items such as leather upholstery and premium  audio. All three trims are powered by the same 1.6-liter four-cylinder hybrid  electric powertrain (139 horsepower, 195 pound-feet combined output) that sends  power to the front wheels through a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.  Note that the regular 2018 Niro Hybrid is reviewed separately. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>LX</strong> comes standard with 16-inch  wheels, dual-zone climate control, 60/40-split folding rear seats, keyless  entry and push-button start, a 7-inch infotainment display, Android Auto and  Apple CarPlay connectivity, two USB ports, and a four-speaker sound system with  satellite radio. Also standard are a rearview camera, front collision warning  and mitigation with automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist and  adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>Niro  Plug-In Hybrids in the <strong>EX</strong> trim level add blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, rear air vents, leather and cloth  upholstery, a power-adjustable driver's seat and heated front seats. The <strong>EX Premium</strong> also has LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, a bigger driver  information display, an 8-inch touchscreen with navigation, a Harman Kardon  eight-speaker surround sound system, a wireless phone charger and ventilated  front seats.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Optima has always offered a  strong value proposition, but the current-generation model takes it a step  further with a upscale cabin and all the latest driver aids and luxury features  a buyer can expect from a midsize sedan. Competitive pricing, a host of newly  standard features and a robust warranty keep the Optima in the running for  top-of-class honors even as Honda and Toyota are coming out with redesigned  models of the Accord and Camry this year.</p>, <p>Navigating last year's numerous trim  levels and packages required a sextant and star chart, though Kia has wisely  consolidated selections for this year. Pricing on the base LX model has barely  changed, but a touchscreen, rear parking sensors and blind-spot monitoring have  all been added to the standard features list. In fact, most trims received an  additional feature or two for 2018. There are even enhancements for the  top-trim SX model; it now counts a panoramic sunroof and ventilated seats among  the included upgrades.</p>, <p>As value-rich as the Optima is, there are  a few drawbacks. Headroom is tight all the way around because of the car's  sleekly styled roofline, and passengers will feel the pinch even more with the  sunroof specified. Visibility out the back is compromised by the roof, and  non-SX models aren't much fun to drive. That said, we wouldn't hesitate to  recommend the 2018 Kia Optima to anyone looking for an affordable, roomy family  sedan with eye-catching good looks and a ton of features.</p>]

[<p>Kia has simplified the trims and features  list for 2018, making it easier for buyers to find the right model. The base <strong>LX </strong>is loaded with goodies such as Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto, which were optional on last year's Optima. Even  better, the price increase is negligible. The <strong>LX 1.6T</strong> adds a bit more, but its unique powertrain combination is  tough to live with. The <strong>S </strong>is a  sport-themed version of the LX, while the <strong>EX </strong>doubles down on luxury items. These models are all relatively close in  price. The <strong>SX </strong>is more expensive, but  its powerful turbocharged engine and additional features are enticing.</p>]

[<p>Under  the hood of the front-wheel-drive Optima in its base <strong>LX </strong>form is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (185 horsepower, 178  pound-feet of torque) matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. Standard  features include 16-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, heated mirrors,  remote locking and unlocking, cruise control, a driver information display, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, height-adjustable front seats (with  two-way power lumbar adjustment for the driver) and a 60/40-split rear seat.</p>, <p>Also  standard for the LX are Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen and a six-speaker audio  system with a USB port, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and HD and satellite radio.  Standard advanced safety equipment includes a rearview camera, rear parking  sensors, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The  optional Convenience package adds noise-reducing front window glass and a  10-way power-adjustable driver seat (with two-way power lumbar).</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>LX 1.6T</strong> adds a  turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (178 hp, 195 lb-ft) paired to a  seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. This powertrain is unique to  the LX 1.6T. Additional features include unique wheels, the contents of the  Convenience package, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. </p>, <p>The <strong>S </strong>combines the features of the LX  1.6T with the engine and transmission of the LX. You also get 17-inch wheels,  foglights, LED taillights, a rear spoiler, and cloth and leather upholstery.  The optional Panoramic Sunroof package includes a panoramic sunroof and gloss  black exterior accents, with the Panoramic Sport package consisting of these  features, plus 18-inch wheels and larger front brakes.</p>, <p>The <strong>EX </strong>does without the foglights and  spoiler, but it adds LED daytime running lights, power-folding mirrors, illuminated  door handles, keyless entry and ignition, a hands-free unlocking trunk,  dual-zone automatic climate control, rear air vents, heated front seats,  four-way power lumbar for the driver, driver-seat memory settings, interior  chrome accents, leather upholstery and two charge-only rear USB ports.</p>, <p>Two  packages are available on the EX. The Premium package adds an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, a 10-way passenger seat (with two-way power lumbar),  ventilated front seats and the panoramic sunroof. The Technology package builds  on top of the Premium pack with a sport body kit, LED foglights, larger front  brakes, an electronic parking brake, adaptive cruise control, an 8-inch  touchscreen, navigation and a 10-speaker Harman Kardon audio system. A lane  departure warning system and forward collision warning with automatic emergency  braking are also included.</p>, <p>The  range-topping <strong>SX </strong>is powered by a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (245 hp, 260 lb-ft). It is equipped  similarly to the EX with Premium package, with upgrades that include 18-inch  wheels, adaptive LED headlights, LED foglights, a rear spoiler, dual exhaust  tips, a sport-tuned suspension, a flat-bottom steering wheel with wheel-mounted  shift paddles, and a larger driver information display. It also adds a  temporary spare tire compared to the tire repair kit on other trims. </p>, <p>The  SX is available with a Technology package that closely mirrors the EX's  Technology package, but it also includes automatic high-beam control. Selecting  this package opens the door to the Limited package, which adds chrome wheels  and exterior trim, a premium headliner, a heated steering wheel, heated rear  seats, upgraded leather upholstery, rear window sunshades and a 360-degree  parking camera system.</p>]

[<p>We like the Kia Optima sedan for offering lots of features for the money, along  with a well-designed interior and a quiet ride. Adding a hybrid powertrain  that's both more powerful and significantly more fuel-efficient than the  standard gasoline engine seems like a no-brainer.</p>, <p>The biggest trade-off for the hybrid  powertrain is the loss of some cargo space, which drops by 2.5 cubic feet. The  available 60/40-split folding rear seats do mean that extra space is available.  The Optima Hybrid is also limited to higher trim levels, so if you're looking  for a basic hybrid, this might not be the car for you. </p>, <p>The Optima Hybrid certainly makes a case  for itself in the segment, too. While we like the driving experience of the  Ford Fusion Hybrid, it's an older model than the Optima and in need of a  refresh. The new Toyota Camry Hybrid is very efficient but offers fewer  features and a less usable infotainment interface. The biggest wild card might  be the Honda Accord Hybrid, due out later this year: It's based on our current  favorite midsize sedan, and it loses no cargo space in the electrification  process.</p>]

[<p>The front-wheel-drive 2018 Kia Optima  Hybrid is well-equipped no matter which version you choose. The entry-level <strong>Premium </strong>comes with dual-zone climate  control, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and keyless entry and ignition. The  Premium's Convenience package offers a good value for the extra features you  get, while the <strong>EX </strong>takes that and  adds goodies such as leather upholstery and a kicking Harman Kardon sound  system. An electric motor and a 2.0-liter engine combine to produce 192 hp.  Most hybrids have a continuously variable automatic transmission, but the  Optima Hybrid sticks with a six-speed automatic transmission that gives a more  traditional shifting feel.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>Premium </strong>trim comes with many standard features,  including 16-inch wheels, heated mirrors, a rearview camera, keyless entry and  ignition, a driver information display, dual-zone automatic climate control,  Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, a 7-inch touchscreen,  and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio.</p>, <p>The  available Convenience package adds power-folding mirrors, laminated front  windows to help noise reduction, a power driver seat with memory settings, rear  air vents, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking  sensors and extra USB ports.</p>, <p>The <strong>EX </strong>has the Convenience package as standard  (minus the parking sensors and blind-spot monitoring) and adds 17-inch wheels,  LED daytime running lights, a heated steering wheel, heated front seats,  leather upholstery, 60/40-split folding rear seats, an 8-inch touchscreen,  navigation, and a 10-speaker Harman Kardon audio system with HD radio. </p>, <p>You  can't get a more luxurious Optima Hybrid than the EX equipped with the Technology  package, which adds LED adaptive headlights, automatic high-beam control, a  panoramic sunroof, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, adaptive cruise control, a  power passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rear  side-window sunshades, lane departure warning, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring and rear parking sensors.</p>]

[<p>We like the current Kia Optima for its stylish design, spacious interior, and user-friendly controls and infotainment system. It also comes with an extensive features list and the strongest standard warranty on the market. Starting with this sedan, Kia added a fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain to make the Optima Hybrid, then added a larger, rechargeable battery pack for the Optima Plug-In Hybrid.</p>, <p>Twenty-nine miles of all-electric range may not seem like much, but buyers who can charge at home or at work will see a major reduction in their gas use. Of course, that larger battery pack makes for a lot less trunk space: just 9.9 cubic feet. The Plug-In Hybrid is also only available in one thoroughly equipped trim level, so it won't appeal to buyers looking for something basic but efficient.</p>, <p>There aren't a lot of mainstream plug-in hybrid options, but the market is growing. The Ford Fusion Energi is one of the few electrified sedans, but it's less feature-rich than the Optima. The Chevrolet Volt is a hatchback with more electric range but less passenger space and fewer features. There's the ultra-efficient Toyota Prius Prime, which sports idiosyncratic design elements that might turn off some buyers. Honda's Clarity Plug-In Hybrid also offers a lot of range and an upscale interior, but it has a much clunkier infotainment system. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Kia Optima Plug-In Hybrid is a five-passenger sedan available in a single <strong>EX </strong>trim level with an optional Technology package that adds extra comfort features and several collision avoidance technologies and driver aids. A hybrid powertrain with 29 miles of all-electric range is standard.</p>]

[<p>The Optima Plug-In Hybrid pairs a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor to produce a system total of 202 horsepower and 296 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive are also standard.</p>, <p>Outside, you'll find 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights with LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, heated side mirrors, keyless entry and a hands-free trunk opening. Inside, the Plug-In comes with push-button ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a rearview camera, a heated and leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power driver seat, a navigation system, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment display, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connections, Kia Uvo services, and a 10-speaker Harman Kardon sound system with satellite radio.</p>, <p>The optional Technology package adds adaptive LED headlights, automatic high beams, a panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a power passenger seat and a host of collision avoidance technologies, including adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and rear parking sensors. </p>]

[<p>Available  as a hatchback or sedan and in three, easy-to-understand trim levels, the  redesigned 2018 Kia Rio is a subcompact car that is simple yet sophisticated.  On the outside, it has an all-new look that is grown-up and stylish. On the  inside, the Rio is well-assembled and is relatively spacious considering its  size. </p>, <p>Under  the hood, the Rio gets a reworked version of Kia's 1.6-liter four-cylinder  engine. It has slightly less power compared to last year (130 horsepower versus  last year's 138), but Kia says it decided to trade peak power for more usable power, meaning that the Rio  feels stronger at the lower engine speeds drivers encounter most often.</p>, <p>The inside also has been upgraded, and  while hard plastics still abound, it feels very solidly built. The redesigned  dash and gauge cluster manage to look upscale as well, so even though the Rio  is a budget-priced car, it doesn't feel cheap. We think the interior presents  itself better than those of cars costing thousands more.</p>, <p>Overall,  we're impressed with this little Kia. If you're in the market for a subcompact  sedan or hatchback, the 2018 Kia Rio is absolutely worth checking out. </p>]

[<p>The  subcompact 2018 Kia Rio is available as either a sedan or a four-door  hatchback. Both the hatchback and sedan are sold in three different trim  levels: base <strong>LX</strong>, midlevel <strong>S</strong> and top-level <strong>EX</strong>. </p>]

[<p>For  the base <strong>LX</strong>, standard features  include a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (130 horsepower, 119 pound-feet of  torque), a six-speed manual transmission (a six-speed automatic is an available  option), 15-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights, air conditioning, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a tilt-only steering wheel, a trip computer, a  rearview camera, and a four-speaker sound system with a 5-inch display,  satellite radio, a USB port and an auxiliary audio input jack. </p>, <p>The  midlevel <strong>Rio S</strong> adds to the standard  equipment with keyless entry, heated power mirrors, power windows, cruise  control, map lights, a sliding center console armrest and storage area, a  60/40-split folding rear seat, an extra USB port (charging only), a rearview  camera, Bluetooth connectivity and a six-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>EX </strong>includes the Rio  S' standard equipment and adds 15-inch alloy wheels, a chrome grille surround,  foglights, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel and shift knob, a forward collision warning system with automatic  braking, upgraded cloth upholstery, dual illuminated vanity mirrors and an  upgraded 7-inch center display with Kia's Uvo infotainment system (which  includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto). The EX's Launch Edition package adds  red interior trim and partial leather accents. </p>]

[<p>Considering that most minivan  manufacturers have spent decades perfecting their spacious people movers (the  Dodge Grand Caravan traces its roots back to the mid-1980s, for instance), the  Kia Sedona is practically the new kid on the block. But since its debut in  2002, the Sedona has grown from being an inexpensive also-ran to a high-tech  cruiser capable of taking the fight to the establishment. It's still one of the  most affordable vehicles in the class, but its roomy interior, high-quality  cabin materials and flexible seating arrangements deliver plenty of appeal  beyond just value.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Sedona does all the standard  minivan stuff well. It can transport seven or eight passengers effortlessly  thanks to its strong V6 engine, and the deep cargo well accepts plenty of  luggage, so it's perfect for a family road trip. There are a few surprises  here, too. On the SX Limited model, the second-row captain's chairs offer  deployable thigh rests and airline-style headrests with folding wings. The  seats are so comfortable you'll be counting down the days until the oldest can  get a learner's permit. </p>, <p>There are a few disappointments, chief of  which is the V6's uncompetitive fuel economy scores. The Sedona SX Limited  earns a full 6 mpg less than the new Honda Odyssey in the EPA's highway test,  for example. In addition, the second-row seats aren't removable, so you can't  turn the Sedona into a cargo van on the fly as you can with the Chrysler  Pacifica. On the whole, though, the Sedona is a solid entry in this segment,  whether you consider it the budget-friendly alternative to mainstream minivans  or an executive seven-seater with a first-class middle row.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Kia Sedona is a seven- or  eight-passenger minivan sold in five trim levels. The base <strong>L </strong>model is very reasonably priced, with a light features list that  includes a rearview camera and a USB input for the audio system. The <strong>LX </strong>doesn't cost much more, and its  power-sliding doors and other features are worth the modest price bump. The <strong>EX </strong>is quite a bit more, but we find its  power tailgate, 7-inch touchscreen and leather upholstery to be irresistible.  The <strong>SX </strong>doubles down on the luxury,  safety and tech features, and even more are added when you select the  range-topping <strong>SX Limited</strong>. </p>]

[<p>Like every Sedona, the base <strong>L </strong>model is powered by a 3.3-liter V6  engine (276 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque) that sends power to the  front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. Standard feature  highlights include 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat,  Slide-N-Stow forward-collapsing second-row captain's chairs (reducing seating  capacity to seven), stain-resistant cloth upholstery, a 60/40-split reclining  and folding third-row bench seat, dual-zone climate control (with front and  rear controls), Bluetooth, a 5-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, and a  four-speaker sound system with a CD player and a USB port.</p>, <p>The <strong>LX </strong>trim adds power-folding mirrors, power-sliding doors, rear privacy glass, a  second-row bench seat (increasing passenger capacity to eight), an eight-way  power driver seat (with two-way power lumbar) and a six-speaker audio system. </p>, <p>The <strong>EX </strong>hits what we think is the sweet spot of the Sedona lineup. This trim adds  18-inch wheels, foglights, LED daytime running lights, a windshield wiper de-icer,  heated mirrors, roof rails, a height-adjustable power tailgate, front and rear  parking sensors, upgraded shock absorbers, keyless ignition and entry, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  tri-zone automatic climate control, a driver information display, leather  upholstery, heated front seats, sunshades for the second and third rows, a  cooled glovebox, a portable flashlight, a 7-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration, Uvo3 eServices emergency telematics and  additional USB charge ports.</p>, <p>The <strong>SX </strong>trim reverts back to the seven-passenger configuration with second-row  captain's chairs (the bench is available as an option) and adds LED taillights,  driver-seat memory functions, four-way lumbar adjustment for the driver, an  eight-way power front passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated second-row  seats, an 8-inch touchscreen, a navigation system and an eight-speaker Infinity  premium audio system. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic  alert is also included.</p>, <p>The range-topping eight-passenger <strong>SX Limited</strong> trim adds 19-inch wheels,  adaptive xenon headlights with automatic high-beam control, upgraded foglights,  a sound-reducing windshield, chrome door handles, adaptive cruise control, a  heated steering wheel and a household-style power outlet. Even more advanced  safety features come with the SX Limited, including forward collision warning  and mitigation (with automatic emergency braking), a lane departure warning system  and a surround-view camera system.</p>, <p>Many features on the higher trims are  available as options on the lower trims. A dual-panel sunroof; first-class,  lounge-style seating for the second row (without Slide-N-Stow); and premium  leather upholstery are available solely on the SX Limited trim via the Prestige  package. A rear-seat entertainment system is offered on all models.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the<strong> 2015 Kia Sedona SX Limited Minivan</strong> (3.3L V6 | 6-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Sedona has received some revisions,  including a few more standard and optional features, and the addition of Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto last year. Our findings remain broadly applicable to  this year's Sedona.</p>]

[<p>Kudos to Kia for offering something a  little different. Designed to be bigger than the typical five-passenger midsize  crossover SUV but not as large as a seven-row family hauler, the 2018 Kia  Sorento has distinctive appeal for shoppers not satisfied with more common  offerings.</p>, <p>Available in five- and seven-passenger  configurations, the Sorento offers more space and practicality than its  five-seat rivals yet is less expensive and less cumbersome to drive than the  big boys. At the same time, it gives up nothing in terms of interior quality  and feature content. Indeed, these are reasons why the Sorento is worth a look  regardless of which seating configuration you're considering. There's actually  even more standard feature content for 2018, and, since it's a Kia, you still  get its tremendous five-year limited and 10-year powertrain warranties. </p>, <p>The Sorento isn't for everyone. After  all, its middle-of-the-road approach means it's ultimately more expensive than  a typical four-cylinder, five-passenger crossover and not as commodious as a  large three-row crossover SUV. But if you like the idea of owning a vehicle  that does a little bit of both, we think the 2018 Sorento is a great choice. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Kia Sorento is available in five  trim levels: <strong>L</strong>, <strong>LX</strong>, <strong>EX</strong>, <strong>SX </strong>and <strong>SX Limited</strong>. There are also three engines available. The L and LX  come standard with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (185 horsepower, 178  pound-feet of torque). Only the EX comes standard with the 2.0T turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder (240 hp, 260 lb-ft). A 3.3-liter V6 (290 hp, 252 lb-ft)  is optional on the LX and EX, and it comes standard on the SX and SX Limited. </p>]

[<p>Every engine comes equipped with a  six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all but  the L can be ordered with all-wheel drive. A third-row seat comes standard on  V6-powered Sorentos and the all-wheel-drive LX; it's optional on the  front-wheel-drive LX. </p>, <p>Standard feature highlights for the base <strong>L</strong> include 17-inch alloy wheels, a  rearview camera, selectable drive modes, a height-adjustable driver seat,  Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio, a CD player and  a USB port.</p>, <p>The<strong> LX</strong> adds a noise-reducing windshield, roof rails and two extra USB ports.  With all-wheel drive, it comes with seven seats and a windshield de-icer. </p>, <p>The LX's optional Convenience package  pads on rear parking sensors, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with  lumbar adjustment), heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  dual-zone automatic climate control and a 7-inch Uvo touchscreen interface that  includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. The Cool and  Connected package is similar but adds just the climate control and Uvo system.  The LX V6 can be equipped with the Advanced Technology package that adds a  forward collision warning system, automatic emergency braking, lane departure  warning, blind-spot monitoring, rear-cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise  control and an electronic parking brake.</p>, <p>The <strong>EX</strong> gets the content of the Convenience package as standard and further adds the  turbocharged four-cylinder engine, 18-inch wheels, foglights, a hands-free  liftgate, power-folding mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, noise-reducing  front side windows, an eight-way power-adjustable passenger seat, leather  upholstery, second-row retractable sunshades and an auto-dimming rearview  mirror. The Advance Touring package (standard with EX V6) includes a panoramic  sunroof, LED interior lighting, a 110-volt household style outlet and  everything from the Advanced Technology package.</p>, <p>The <strong>SX</strong> comes standard with the V6 and includes upgraded steering, 19-inch wheels, LED  running lights, upgraded exterior trim, automatic wipers, the panoramic  sunroof, a 10-way power driver seat (with four-way lumbar adjustment),  driver-seat memory settings, an 8-inch touchscreen, a navigation system, and a  10-speaker Infinity sound system. It can also be equipped with an Advanced  Technology package, which is comparable to the LX V6 version but adds xenon  headlights, ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel. </p>, <p>The <strong>SX  Limited </strong>comes with 19-inch chrome-clad wheels, upgraded leather upholstery,  heated second-row seats, a wood-trim steering wheel and the SX's Advanced  Technology package. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of  the <strong>2016 Kia Sorento SX </strong>(3.3L V6 |  8-speed automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Sorento has received only minor  revisions.

[<p>When it debuted for the 2010 model year,  the Kia Soul was difficult to classify. Was it a hatchback, a wagon or  something else entirely? In recent years there has been a growing number of  so-called subcompact crossover SUVs that provide the elevated seating height  and enhanced cargo capacity of larger models but with a lower price tag.  Really, they're an awful lot like the Soul in concept. Maybe we can add  "trendsetter" to the Soul's list of attributes.</p>, <p>Yet, the 2018 Kia Soul is more appealing  than its newfound competitors in a few ways. It has a roomier interior, with  greater cargo and backseat space than the often-cramped competition that  deserves the name "subcompact." Its crash scores are exemplary. It's  also available with more power than its rivals — and not just the  201-horsepower turbocharged engine found in the range-topping Exclaim (!) trim  level. The midgrade engine has a better-than-most 161 horsepower, too. And then  there's the Soul's list of comfort, convenience and infotainment items at a  price that undercuts those little SUVs considerably. You can get a lot more for  your money by opting for the Soul. </p>, <p>Unfortunately, one thing you can't get is  all-wheel drive, which is something those subcompact SUVs typically offer. Its  fuel economy, regardless of engine, also disappoints. That should be of  particular concern if you're looking at the Soul as more of a compact car  alternative. On the whole, however, the Soul is an attractive little (insert  vehicle type of your choice here) that should be a fashionable yet value-rich  addition to your garage.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Kia Soul is available in three  trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Plus (+)</strong> and <strong>Exclaim (!)</strong>. Each comes with a different engine. An automatic  transmission is standard on the Plus and Exclaim and optional on the base Soul,  which comes with a six-speed manual. </p>]

[<p>The<strong> base </strong>trim comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (130  horsepower, 118 pound-feet of torque), 16-inch alloy wheels, rear privacy  glass, air conditioning, a height-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding  rear seats, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a USB port and  satellite radio. The Convenience package (automatic transmission only) adds  automatic headlights, automatic climate control, a rearview camera, and the Uvo  tech interface that includes a 7-inch touchscreen and Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay smartphone integration.</p>, <p>The <strong>Soul</strong> <strong>Plus </strong>includes the Convenience  package content and adds a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (161 hp, 150 lb-ft),  a six-speed automatic transmission, 17-inch wheels, foglights, heated mirrors,  keyless entry, selectable drive modes, upgrade cloth upholstery, a rear center  armrest and a cargo cover. </p>, <p>The<strong> Soul Exclaim</strong> adds a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (201 hp, 195  lb-ft), a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, 18-inch wheels,  upgraded exterior trim (gloss black and red accents), upgraded gauges and  interior trim, a mix of cloth and leather seat upholstery, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, and keyless ignition and entry.</p>, <p>The Plus is available with a number of  optional packages. The Audio package includes an 8-inch touchscreen, navigation,  the Exclaim trim's upgraded interior materials, keyless ignition and entry, two  USB ports, LED speaker lights and a Harman Kardon premium sound system. The  Designer's package adds 18-inch wheels, the leather-wrapped steering wheel and  a two-tone roof treatment. </p>, <p>You can also get the Plus with a Primo  package that adds a panoramic sunroof, power-folding mirrors, the Exclaim  trim's upgraded gauges, heated and ventilated eight-way power-adjustable front  seats (with driver lumbar adjustment), heated rear seats, a heated steering  wheel, leather upholstery, and a suite of driver assistance systems that  includes adaptive cruise control, blind-spot and lane departure warning, and a  forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking. To all of  that, the Primo Lit package tacks on xenon headlights and LED running lights. </p>, <p>The Soul Exclaim is available with a  Technology package that effectively includes everything it doesn't already have  from the Plus' Primo Lit package. The exceptions are the panoramic sunroof,  which can be added separately, and leather upholstery, which isn't available at  all. </p>]

[<p>If you're a current or potential EV  buyer, chances are that getting a lot of electric range is important. Nobody  wants to suffer from range anxiety, and every extra mile an electric car can eke  out represents another mile you can go without burning gasoline in your second  car, taking public transit or getting an emergency recharge. Well, the 2018 Kia  Soul EV can go a few extra miles this year with the debut of a more energy-rich  battery, bringing with it a new maximum of 111 miles. That's up from 93 miles. </p>, <p>That's great news for the  range-conscious, but it falls a bit short of the range of other EVs such as the  VW e-Golf and the Hyundai Ioniq Electric. And, much like every other EV not  named Tesla, the Soul has less than half of the Chevrolet Bolt's estimated 238  miles of all-electric range. For many, that will make their EV choice obvious.</p>, <p>Still, if you're planning to stay within  the city confines, own a second car, or quite simply don't plan on going very  far, the Kia Soul EV offers a lot to like. For starters, it arguably has far  more character and style than the Bolt and most other EVs. Like the gasoline  Kia Soul upon which it's based, it boasts a handsome-if-quirky exterior, a  stylish cabin, and a body style that's pretty reminiscent of a small SUV. It's  certainly a more convincing crossover substitute than the Bolt. You also get  lots of passenger and cargo space, plus an abundance of features for your  money. </p>, <p>Basically, the same things that make the  regular Soul so appealing also apply to the EV, and if range isn't everything,  we think it's most definitely worth a look. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Kia Soul EV as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/" title="Best Electric Cars">Best Electric Cars</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Kia Soul EV is, as the name  suggests, the all-electric version of the Soul. Though not marketed as such,  that car is similar in size and concept to subcompact SUVs. So is the EV. There  are three trim levels:<strong> EV-e</strong>, the base <strong>EV</strong> and <strong>EV Plus (+)</strong>. All come with generous standard equipment, though the  top trim's luxurious extras could be worth the extra bucks. All use the same  30-kWh lithium-ion polymer battery pack and 375-volt electric motor that  produces 109 horsepower and 210 pound-feet of torque. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>EV-e</strong> is sold only in California. It comes standard with a DC fast-charging port,  16-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED running lights, heated mirror,  rear privacy glass, keyless ignition and entry, automatic climate control, a  pedestrian warning system, multiple steering modes (Normal, Comfort and Sport),  a height-adjustable driver seat, two-level heated front seats, cloth  upholstery, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, a 60/40-split folding back  seat, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, one USB port, and a six-speaker sound  system with a 5-inch color display, a media player interface, an auxiliary  audio jack and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The base <strong>EV</strong> is the starting point for those Soul EV shoppers outside  California. It adds better-looking 16-inch wheels, mirror turn-signal  indicators, HD radio and an 8-inch touchscreen interface that brings with it  integrated navigation, 3G Wi-Fi and Uvo Eco services, which includes an app  that allows you to monitor the car's charge, find a charging station, lock and  unlock doors, and adjust the in-car climate before you leave.</p>, <p>The <strong>EV  Plus (+)</strong> adds front and rear parking sensors, foglights, power-folding  mirrors, a faux-leather-trimmed dash, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a cargo  cover, three-level heated and ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear  seats and leather upholstery. Exclusive to the Plus is the Sun and Fun package,  which adds a panoramic sunroof, LED interior lighting and speaker lights. A  battery-heating system is also available in Oregon, Washington and eastern  states that sell the Soul EV.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the<strong>2015 Kia Soul EV Plus (+)</strong>.</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Soul EV has received some revisions,  including an increase in range, and the addition of a standard 5-inch center  screen and an available panoramic sunroof. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Kia Soul EV.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Sportage has typically been an  "alternative" choice for a compact crossover SUV. Prior versions  weren't as well-rounded as other, more popular crossovers, but a lower price,  plentiful standard features and lengthy warranty helped get people into the  driver's seat. Well, those value-oriented attributes are still present, but the  2018 Kia Sportage, coming off last year's full redesign, is improved to the  point that it deserves to be among those SUVs you consider first rather than  the one you settle on after looking at the price tag. </p>, <p>For starters, it's a more refined and comfortable  vehicle than previous versions. Its ride quality is impressively comfortable,  even with bigger wheels, and its cabin stays nice and quiet on the highway.  Interior quality is also better than most, and it looks good, too. Other  advantages include a big back seat and large doors that make it easy to get in  and out. </p>, <p>If  you are looking for lots of utility, the Sportage probably isn't the right  choice. You get 30.7 cubic  feet of space behind the rear seatbacks, which trails class leaders by about 4  to 6 cubic feet, while folding down those seatbacks opens up a similarly modest  60.1 cubic feet. The Sportage's fuel economy is also disappointing  compared to rival SUVs. </p>, <p>Still,  you don't need to spend a lot of money to get an appealing Sportage. Even the  base trim level is well equipped, and unlike some rivals, you don't have to  step up to an upper trim to get desirable things such as advanced safety tech  and Apple or Android smartphone control. So, yes, the Sportage is just as much  of a value-packed alternative as always, but it's also good enough now to be in  the big leagues.  </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Kia Sportage is a five-passenger  compact crossover SUV available in LX, EX and SX Turbo trim levels. Front-wheel  drive is standard on all of them, but all-wheel drive is an option. The LX and  EX have a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 181 horsepower and 175  pound-feet of torque. The SX Turbo has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder  that produces 240 hp (237 hp with all-wheel drive) and 260 lb-ft of torque.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the <strong>LX</strong> includes 17-inch alloy wheels,  automatic headlights, rear privacy glass, driver-selectable driving modes, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding and reclining back seat, a  rearview camera, a 5-inch touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker  sound system with satellite radio, a CD player and one USB port. The LX's  Popular package adds roof rails, UV-reducing glass for the front windows and  windshield, a windshield wiper de-icer, dual-zone automatic climate control, an  eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with power lumbar), heated front seats,  and Kia's 7-inch Uvo touchscreen interface that includes Android Auto, Apple  CarPlay, and Kia's eServices remote and emergency services. </p>, <p>The <strong>EX</strong> includes all of the above items plus 18-inch wheels, foglights, heated mirrors,  upgraded exterior and interior trim, keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, leather upholstery and a rear USB  charging port. The EX's Premium package adds a panoramic sunroof, a heated  steering wheel and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Sport Appearance  package adds LED foglights, special exterior trim and a flat-bottom steering  wheel. It is not available with the Premium or Technology (see below) packages. </p>, <p>The LX Technology package adds forward  collision warning and automatic braking, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic warning  systems, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam control and power-folding  mirrors. The EX Technology package adds those items plus a hands-free liftgate,  front and rear parking sensors, a spare tire, an eight-way power-adjustable  passenger seat, an 8-inch touchscreen, a navigation system and an eight-speaker  Harman Kardon sound system. This package includes heated rear seats with  all-wheel-drive Sportages.</p>, <p>The <strong>SX</strong> gets a more powerful engine plus a sport-tuned suspension, 19-inch wheels,  xenon headlights, LED foglights, an electronic parking brake, special exterior  trim, the flat-bottom steering wheel, a larger gauge display, and the contents  of the EX Technology and Premium packages. </p>]

[<p>As stylish as the latest Kias have  become, they typically haven't had the performance and handling to match. That  all changes with the all-new Kia Stinger. </p>, <p>The Stinger represents a significant step  forward for the South Korean manufacturer. Its aggressive yet graceful design  stands out among the relatively anonymous sedans with similar pricing. Even  better, the Stinger performs on a level that is well above our expectations for  its modest price. It's about the same size as Kia's Optima sedan but is lower,  sleeker and more powerful. In the top-spec GT trim, the Stinger boasts 365  horsepower, available all-wheel drive, and a refined and comfortable interior. </p>, <p>Whether it's by numbers or appearance,  Kia's Stinger impressively challenges similar luxury-branded vehicles. Yet  there are still going to be some traditional Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz  shoppers who won't bother with the Stinger because it lacks enough prestige.  That's their loss. The Stinger isn't just good for a Kia — it's good compared to anything at or well above its price.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Kia Stinger as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans">Best AWD Sedans</a>, and the 2018 Kia Stinger GT as one of the <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Kia Stinger is a four-door sedan with a fastback-like hatch that is  available in five trim levels. The base rear-wheel-drive Stinger is powered by  a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (255 horsepower, 260 pound-feet  of torque) and is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel  drive is available on all models as an option.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>base</strong> Stinger  include 18-inch wheels, automatic headlights, LED running lights, heated and  power-folding mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and  ignition, selectable drive modes, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate  control, leather upholstery, heated and power-adjustable front seats,  60/40-split folding rear seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a rearview  camera, a 7-inch touchscreen, three USB ports, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay-Android  Auto, and a six-speaker audio system with satellite radio. All-wheel-drive  models also include a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium</strong> trim adds LED headlights, a  sunroof, a power-adjustable steering wheel, a larger driver information  display, a universal garage door opener, driver memory functions, an 8-inch  touchscreen and a 15-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.</p>, <p>The  Kia Stinger <strong>GT</strong> employs a  turbocharged 3.3-liter V6 (365 hp, 376 lb-ft). Feature content is similar to  the base Stinger but upgrades to 19-inch wheels, Brembo brakes, adaptive  suspension dampers, a launch control system, variable steering ratios, a few  exterior embellishments, aluminum pedals and scuff plates, a flat-bottom  steering wheel and a nine-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The <strong>GT1</strong> trim adds the Premium features  along with auto-dimming exterior mirrors and additional performance meters. At  the top of the lineup is the <strong>GT2</strong> trim that finishes it off with a limited-slip differential, a hands-free  trunklid, a head-up display, premium leather upholstery, and upgraded front  seats with ventilation. Automatic wipers are also available as an option for  all Stingers.</p>, <p>The  GT2 also comes with these advanced safety features that are optional on  supporting trims: adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and intervention, a driver  attention monitor, automatic high-beams, and blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert.</p>]

[<p>Reintroduced  last year as a redesigned and renamed LR4, the 2018 Land Rover Discovery has an  appealing combination of luxury and off-road capability. Few vehicles on the  road can match this specific blend, and even fewer do it as well as the  Discovery does. It surrounds passengers in a premium cabin, turns other  motorists' heads with its sleek styling, and makes molehills out of mountains  thanks to its capable four-wheel-drive system. </p>, <p>For  a vehicle that is as large as the Discovery, it steers and handles remarkably  well, has prodigious thrust, and boasts very respectable maximum tow ratings  north of 8,000 pounds. It's quiet and comfortable, and it has a commanding  presence on the road yet is nimble enough to navigate busy city streets. </p>, <p>It  isn't one attribute or virtue that makes the 2018 Land Rover Discovery stand  out from the crowd — rather it's a combination of all its likable  features wrapped up in one attractive and modern package. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Land Rover Discovery is a midsize luxury SUV available in three trim  levels: <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>HSE</strong> and <strong>HSE Luxury</strong>. A  supercharged 3.0-liter V6 (340 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque) is  standard, and a turbocharged diesel V6 (254 hp and 443 lb-ft) is optional. Both  engines are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel  drive. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>SE</strong> trim comes standard as a  two-row, five-passenger SUV. A third row of seats is optional, increasing  passenger capacity to seven. Standard feature highlights include 19-inch  wheels, a hands-free liftgate, power-folding mirrors, rear parking sensors,  automatic wipers, a fixed panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and ignition,  dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, power front seats, and  40/20/40-split sliding, reclining and folding rear seats. </p>, <p>On  the technology front, the Disco has a rearview camera, forward collision  mitigation with emergency braking, a 10-inch touchscreen (Land Rover's  InControl Touch Pro infotainment system with navigation), compatibility with  the InControl remote smartphone app, a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, and a 10-speaker audio  system with USB input.</p>, <p>The <strong>HSE</strong> trim adds features such as  20-inch wheels, LED headlights, front parking sensors, a powered inner  tailgate, upgraded taillights, a power-sliding front sunroof, tri-zone climate  control, wood interior trim, additional interior storage features, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, driver-seat memory functions, a digital driver  display, USB ports for the second-row seats, and an upgraded Meridian audio  system with satellite and HD radio. </p>, <p>Going  with the <strong>HSE Luxury</strong> gets you the  third row of seats, which increases capacity to seven. It also includes an air  suspension, a two-speed transfer case with low-range gearing, power-folding  third-row seats, configurable ambient interior lighting, premium leather  upholstery, additional leather trim, upgraded power front seats with winged  headrests, heated front and second-row seats, power-sliding and -reclining  second-row seats, a heated steering wheel, and a 14-speaker Meridian premium  surround-sound system.</p>, <p>Many  features on higher-trimmed Discovery models are available on supporting trims  at additional cost. Other options for HSE and HSE Lux models include the <strong>Vision Assist package</strong>, which adds adaptive  headlights, LED running lights, automatic high beams, a surround-view camera  system and auto-dimming exterior mirrors. The <strong>Drive package </strong>brings blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, a drowsy driver warning system, a speed limiter and a traffic sign  reader. And the <strong>Drive Pro package</strong> includes the features from the Drive package plus adaptive cruise control,  reverse traffic detection and lane departure intervention.</p>, <p>Other  Discovery add-ons include 21- or 22-inch wheels, roof rails, a heated  windshield, an automated parking system, a trailer hitch with electrical  connections, an advanced towing system with reverse trailer steering, a head-up  display, a waterproof activity key bracelet, four-zone climate control,  massaging front seats, and a cooler box in the front center console.</p>]

[<p>The cumulative changes to the Discovery  Sport over the last two years are significant. This year brings a new engine  that comes in two different power-output levels, along with revisions to the  front seats. Add those updates to last year's changes to the infotainment  system and the addition of an optional adaptive suspension, and the Discovery  Sport has changed quite a bit.</p>, <p>In the past we knocked the Discovery  Sport for its relatively slow acceleration, below-average fuel economy, brittle  ride, overly firm seats and high cost, especially considering how much more  luxurious competitors can be. The new, optional 286-horsepower turbocharged  four-cylinder adds a turn of speed but is a pricey extra, and fuel economy  remains the same. The optional adaptive suspension, which should improve ride  quality, is a stand-alone option. As far as cost goes, the market seems to have  caught up — while the Discovery Sport gets pricey quickly when you  start checking options boxes, so do its European competitors. At least  the revisions to the seats come standard.</p>, <p>Still, if the Disco Sport's optional  third-row seat or trick traction control that allows for more off-road and  inclement-weather capability isn't at the top of your list of priorities, there  are a lot of great compact luxury SUVs to choose from. The redesigned 2018  Volvo XC60 is luxurious, modern and capable. The Audi Q5 has lots of excellent  available technology and outstanding road manners. Top-tier Discovery Sports  also compete with more entry-level trims of the Porsche Macan, which is a bit  tight on the inside but is also one of the best-driving SUVs on the road. And  that's not to mention offerings from Acura, BMW, Jaguar, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz  and even Alfa Romeo. This is a crowded segment, and Land Rover has pinned its  appeal on a few very specific strengths.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport is a compact luxury SUV that comes standard  with five seats, though an optional two-person third row raises capacity to  seven. There are three trim levels: <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>HSE</strong> and <strong>HSE Luxury</strong>. A more powerful engine is available for the HSE and HSE  Luxury trims.</p>]

[<p>The  Discovery Sport's powertrain also includes Land Rover's All-Terrain Progress  Control (a low-speed off-road cruise control), hill descent control and the  driver-adjustable Terrain Response system. The latter technology has four  settings (General, Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud/Ruts and Sand) that adapt accelerator  and steering response, gear selection, center differential engagement, and  braking and stability control systems to optimize performance in a variety of  difficult driving scenarios. Unlike with other Land Rovers, there are no  locking differentials, low-range gearing or adjustable suspension height.</p>, <p>The  base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 237 horsepower  and 251 pound-feet of torque. A more powerful version of this engine is  available for the HSE and HSE Luxury trims and makes 286 hp and 295 lb-ft of  torque. A nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard. </p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the <strong>SE</strong> includes  automatic headlamps and wipers, power-folding and heated mirrors, a rearview  camera, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, rear parking  sensors, rear privacy glass, 18-inch wheels, and the Land Rover Terrain  Response system, which changes vehicle settings to match various surfaces. Also  standard are 10-way power front seats, partial leather upholstery, a  60/40-split rear seat (folding, reclining, sliding), an 8-inch touchscreen  interface, four USB charging ports (two front, two rear) and a 10-speaker sound  system with a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB media player  interface. </p>, <p>Some  options are unique to the SE: The Convenience package adds proximity entry, a  hands-free liftgate and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The SE Vision Assist  package adds foglights and xenon headlights with LED daytime running lights.  Twelve-way power-adjustable front seats and navigation are available as  stand-alone options.</p>, <p>The <strong>HSE</strong> includes the contents of the  Convenience and SE Vision packages and adds a fixed panoramic roof, front  parking sensors, full leather upholstery, and 12-way power front seats with  memory functions. </p>, <p>Both  the SE and HSE can be upgraded with the Audio Upgrade package, which adds an  11-speaker Meridian stereo and satellite radio. Smartphone-connection apps and  satellite radio are available for both as stand-alone options. </p>, <p>The <strong>HSE Luxury</strong> adds the Audio Upgrade  package, 19-inch wheels, fancier exterior trim, multicolor interior ambient  lighting, upgraded leather upholstery and navigation functionality. </p>, <p>The  HSE trims are available with a number of option packages. The Vision Assist  package includes blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems,  adaptive headlights, automatic high beams and a surround-view camera system.  The Driver Assist Plus package adds the navigation functionality, lane  departure warning and automatic emergency braking. The HUD &amp; Park Assist  package brings a head-up display and an automatic parking system that can  handle perpendicular and parallel parking duties. The Intelligent Dynamics Pack  adds an active all-wheel-drive system, which switches between front- and  all-wheel drive based on conditions to save fuel, and an adaptive magnetic  suspension. The Entertainment Pack adds a 17-speaker Meridian sound system and  the upgraded 10-inch InControl Touch Pro touchscreen interface that includes  onboard Wi-Fi and its own upgraded navigation system. Finally, the Dynamic  Design package adds a variety of special exterior and trim pieces, including gloss-black  20-inch wheels. </p>, <p>All  trims can be equipped with the Climate Comfort package, which includes a  variety of heated items: windshield, steering wheel, and front and rear seats.  Also available as stand-alone options are different wheels (19- or 20-inch),  contrasting roof color choices, the head-up display, automatic high beams, a  cargo cover and onboard Wi-Fi. For 2018, blind-spot monitoring and adaptive  cruise control have both been made available as stand-alone options. </p>]

[<p>What's big, powerful, luxurious, capable,  high-tech and has a price range that starts with "sticker shock" and  ends in "VH1 <em>Behind the Music </em>spending  habits"? That would be the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover. It's a go-anywhere  SUV luxury that can be specced to meet the most demanding standards.</p>, <p>Luxury and capability are the two big  watchwords for the Range Rover. The interior will swaddle you in leather, wood  and high-resolution displays. Meanwhile, a host of available off-road upgrades  — including a trick traction control system — means this  SUV can tackle terrain most drivers prefer to enjoy from the safety of a scenic  overlook. There are a few weaknesses, such as a lackluster base engine and  oversize wheels that don't help the ride quality, but considering all the  vehicle's strengths it's easy to understand the cachet the Range Rover has  earned.</p>, <p>In some ways, the Range Rover is in a  class of one, but there are competitors worth considering. The Mercedes-Benz  GLS offers a similarly potent combination of luxury and performance, though not  the same level of off-road capability. The Lexus LX 570, meanwhile, is capable  off-road but comes up short in on-road comfort. Of course, if you're looking at  the top-tier Range Rover SVAutobiography Long Wheelbase, you might also  consider the Bentley Bentayga.</p>, <p>Yet part of the Range Rover's enduring  appeal is its ability to be anything from a school taxi to a limousine that can  crawl a respectable distance up Mount Kilimanjaro to something that can  embarrass some sports cars in a straight line. It all depends on how deep your  pockets are. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover<strong> </strong>comes in five main versions: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>HSE</strong>, <strong>Supercharged</strong>, <strong>Autobiography</strong> and <strong>SVAutobiography Dynamic</strong>. While the base Range Rover<strong> </strong>comes well-equipped, the <strong>HSE</strong> gives you more standard features.  The Supercharged is similarly equipped but has a supercharged V8. Next, the  Autobiography adds more luxury options and driver assist systems, and the  SVAutobiography Dynamic adds more power and sportier suspension tuning. The  long-wheelbase versions of the Supercharged and Autobiography add more than 7  inches of rear legroom.<strong><u> </u></strong></p>]

[<p>The Range Rover's <strong>base</strong> version comes with your choice of a supercharged 3.0-liter V6  (340 horsepower, 332 pound-feet of torque) or the <strong>Td6</strong> version that has a turbocharged, diesel-powered 3.0-liter V6  (254 hp, 443 lb-ft). An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive  are standard.</p>, <p>Unlike other variants, there is no  optional upgraded seat package, and a panoramic roof is only available as an  option in this standard trim. Even still, LED headlights, front and rear  parking sensors, three-zone climate control, and a 13-speaker Meridian sound  system are standard. So is Land Rover's InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment  system with a 10.2-inch infotainment touchscreen and a second touchscreen to  handle other cabin controls such as climate and seating adjustment.</p>, <p>Plus, many options are available to get  your base Range Rover equipped nicely, including active safety features and  driver aids, an upgraded stereo, a rear-seat entertainment package with two  8-inch screens, and a towing package. </p>, <p>Next up is the <strong>Range Rover HSE</strong> that includes a few more standard features such as  20-inch wheels, a power liftgate, soft-close doors, upgraded 20-way  power-adjustable front seats, and access to a greater catalog of options. You  can get the HSE with either the Td6 diesel V6 from the standard model or a powered-up  version of the turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (380 hp, 332 lb-ft). </p>, <p>Next is the <strong>Range Rover Supercharged</strong>, which is powered by a supercharged  5.0-liter V8 (518 hp, 461 lb-ft). The Supercharged variant comes with 21-inch  wheels, a more capable Terrain Response 2 system and All-Terrain Progress  Control, which is basically the off-road version of cruise control. These  off-road systems are available as optional extras on the lower trim levels.</p>, <p>The next rung up is the <strong>Range Rover Autobiography</strong>. The Autobiography  packs the same supercharged V8 as the Supercharged, and it features  significantly more content, such as a surround-view camera system, a 29-speaker  Meridian sound system, 24-way power-adjustable heated and ventilated front  seats, and heated and ventilated rear seats with remote power-folding. It also  includes a gesture-operated sunblind for the panoramic sunroof and standard  driver assist systems such as blind-spot monitoring and lane departure  intervention.</p>, <p>If you want the sportiest Range Rover, go  with the <strong>Range Rover SVAutobiography  Dynamic</strong>.<strong> </strong>It uses an uprated  version of the 5.0-liter supercharged V8 gasoline engine and produces 557 hp  and 502 lb-ft of torque. The Dynamic variant also features a lowered ride  height and a more aggressive on-road suspension calibration.</p>, <p>The long-wheelbase models all share the  same extended chassis. The Range Rover's wheelbase is lengthened by 7.8 inches,  and rear-seat legroom grows by slightly more than 7 inches. Otherwise, they  feature similar setups as their short-wheelbase twins. As the top dog, the <strong>SVAutobiography LWB</strong> comes with  reclining executive-class seats, which includes deployable tables, a center  console cooler with glasses, and a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our road test of  the<strong> 2016 Land Rover Range Rover HSE TD6 </strong>(turbo  3.0L V6 diesel | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 2018 Land Rover Range Rover has  received some revisions, including a revised InControl Touch Pro Duo navigation  and entertainment system and the new Terrain Response 2, an automated driving  mode system. Our findings, however, remain broadly applicable to this year's  Range Rover.</p>]
---http://edmunds.com/land-rover/range-rover-evoque/2018/review
[<p>The  2018 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a subcompact and all-wheel-drive premium  SUV that packs an option you won't find in any of its competition: a  convertible top. While we're sure most people will opt for the more traditional  four-door variant and its fixed roof, the availability of a two-door  convertible speaks to the Evoque's fashionable intentions. </p>, <p>The  emphasis on style brings about a few sacrifices in traditional SUV traits. Its  storage space and visibility fall on the smaller side of the spectrum, and its  interior is more difficult to climb in and out of — doubly true for  the convertible. Still, the Evoque remains a Land Rover, and it comes with the  brand's off-road tech, including a low-speed cruise control. </p>, <p>It  isn't the design alone that makes the Evoque a unique offering. Though it's the  size of a subcompact, the Evoque's price falls closer to that of a bigger  luxury SUV, so direct comparisons are tricky. But if you find the look and feel  appealing, comparisons against the Evoque won't be necessary. </p>]

[<p>For  the four-door Evoque, the base <strong>SE </strong>comes  with a decent set of features, such as navigation, a backup camera and  proximity sensors, while the <strong>SE Premium</strong> adds more flair in the form of xenon headlights and a panoramic roof. The <strong>Landmark Edition</strong> uses the previous trim  as a base and adds an array of visual upgrades. The midgrade <strong>HSE </strong>gains more standard features, from  heated seats to blind-spot monitoring, while the <strong>HSE Dynamic</strong> upgrade adds aggressive bodywork. The range-topping <strong>Autobiography </strong>comes loaded with style  and comfort features, including massaging front seats. The Convertible is  available in two trims — <strong>SE  Dynamic</strong> and <strong>HSE Dynamic</strong> — that match the four-door's similarly named trims. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>SE</strong> comes with a 2.0-liter  turbocharged inline four-cylinder (237 hp, 251 lb-ft of torque) and a nine-speed  automatic. Standard exterior equipment includes five-spoke 18-inch wheels, a  heated rear windshield, halogen headlights, LED taillights, rain-sensing  windshield wipers, and heated power side mirrors. Inside you'll find 12-way  power-adjusting leather seats, a 60/40-split rear seat, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, and dual-zone climate control. You also get technology  features such as an 8-inch touchscreen with navigation, an 80-watt stereo with  eight speakers, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry, and a rearview  camera with trailer hitch guidance. The SE boasts Land Rover's suite of  off-road technology features, which includes hill descent control; All-Terrain  Progress Control, which acts like a low-speed cruise control; and the Terrain  Response system, which adjusts how the vehicle behaves for preset settings  (Gravel, Snow, and Mud and Ruts, for example). </p>, <p>One  step up is the <strong>SE Premium</strong>, which  adds seven-spoke 18-inch wheels, xenon headlights with LED accents, a panoramic  sunroof, hands-free tailgate access, and memory settings for the front seat. </p>, <p>Think  of the <strong>Landmark Edition</strong> as a variant  of the SE Premium that prioritizes style. It comes with seven-spoke 19-inch  wheels and the more aggressive exterior design from costlier trim levels, along  with a different style of interior layout. </p>, <p>You  can tell an <strong>HSE</strong> apart by its  10-spoke 19-inch wheels and other subtle differences in its exterior trimmings.  The interior receives a higher grade of leather, heated front seats,  configurable mood lighting, an upgraded stereo (380 watts, 11 speakers), and  blind-spot monitoring. </p>, <p>The <strong>HSE Dynamic</strong> comes with aggressive  bodywork and seven-spoke 19-inch wheels. Interior changes include a perforated  leather steering wheel and illuminated doorsills. </p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>Autobiography</strong> rolls  on 20-inch wheels and boasts adaptive LED headlights and a heated windshield.  The 14-way power-adjusting front seats come with massage, heating and  ventilation functions. There are other perks like a heated rear seat, heated  steering wheel, illuminated doorsills, and another stereo upgrade (825 watts,  17 speakers). The Autobiography also boasts automatic parking (parallel and  perpendicular), a surround-view camera, lane keeping assist, and collision  mitigation. </p>, <p>A  high-output variant of the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four) is available  only on the four-door HSE Dynamic and Autobiography. Models equipped with this  engine gain a different, more aggressive front bumper. </p>, <p>The  Convertible's two trim levels mirror those of the four-door's with a few  exceptions. The <strong>SE Dynamic</strong> is  largely the same as the four-door SE. Differences include seven-spoke 18-inch  wheels, 12-way power-adjusting front seats with memory function, a wind  deflector, and a 10.2-inch touchscreen with the 11-speaker stereo system. The <strong>HSE Dynamic</strong> matches the upgrades fitted  to the four-door HSE Dynamic with negligible differences.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2017 Land Rover  Range Rover Evoque Convertible (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 9-speed automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Range Rover Evoque has received some  revisions, including a new, less powerful base engine and a more powerful  optional engine. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Range  Rover Evoque.</p>]

[<p>Like its bigger sibling — that grande dame of luxury SUVs, the  regular Range Rover — the Range Rover Sport combines a quiet and  luxurious interior with rugged off-road ability. But as its Sport moniker indicates,  it also offers sporty handling and on-road performance that can challenge some  sport sedans. It can even be equipped with third-row seats to carry a few extra  passengers. </p>, <p>The Range Rover Sport does everything in  a way that few vehicles can, but it still competes in a crowded segment full of  excellent options — depending on your needs. If you can forgo a third  row, there's the back-road-blasting Porsche Cayenne, which is in a class of its  own when it comes to on-road performance. Like the Sport, quite a few  competitors have the option of a third row. Of those, the Volvo XC90 also  offers a gorgeously modern cabin and massive cargo space, along with a more  generous third row. There's even the body-on-frame Lexus GX, which is in need  of a redesign but boasts impressive off-road ability. That's not even to  mention the traditional competition from the BMW X5 and the Mercedes-Benz GLE. </p>, <p>Still, if you want to combine luxury,  sportiness, and rugged off-road performance, nothing quite competes with the  2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a midsize luxury SUV offered in six main  trim levels: <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>HSE</strong>, <strong>HSE Dynamic</strong>, <strong>Supercharged</strong>, <strong>Autobiography</strong> and <strong>SVR</strong>. Five-passenger seating is  standard, and a power-folding third row that boosts capacity to seven  passengers is available on all trims except the SVR. A range engines with  varying power outputs are also available.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport <strong>SE</strong> comes standard with supercharged  3.0-liter V6 (340 horsepower, 332 pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed  automatic transmission and four-wheel drive. Available as an option —  the <strong>SE Td6</strong> — is a  turbocharged 3.0-liter diesel-powered V6 (254 hp, 443 lb-ft of torque).</p>, <p>Standard features on the <strong>SE</strong> trim include 19-inch wheels, a  self-leveling air suspension with automatic height adjustment for loading and  unloading, LED headlights, power-folding heated mirrors, a hands-free liftgate,  front and rear parking sensors, and keyless ignition and entry.</p>, <p>Within the cabin, you'll find dual-zone  climate control, leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, 60/40-split  second-row folding rear seatbacks, driver-seat memory settings and a  power-adjustable steering wheel. Also standard are a navigation system and an  eight-speaker sound system with satellite and HD radio and USB connectivity.  The new Touch Pro Duo system combines a 10.2-inch touchscreen infotainment  system with a secondary screen for various cabin and vehicle controls where the  climate knobs used to be. </p>, <p>To all this standard equipment, the<strong> HSE</strong> adds 20-inch wheels, foglights,  power-folding side mirrors, a fixed panoramic sunroof, perforated leather  upholstery, an 11-speaker stereo system, 360-degree parking sensors, 16-way  power-adjustable front seats with heating, and upgraded interior trim. There  are also added safety features such as blind-spot monitoring, a  driver-condition monitoring system, and traffic sign recognition. You can opt  for the diesel engine in HSE trim, making it the <strong>HSE Td6</strong>.</p>, <p>Extra off-road capability is optional at  these trim levels via the Off-Road package that adds a low range transfer case.  It also provides a suite of software upgrades to the traction control system  along with selectable terrain modes. This package is standard equipment on all  higher trim levels. </p>, <p>Opt for the <strong>HSE Dynamic </strong>and you get 40 more hp from the supercharged V6, along  with some sporty visual upgrades, 21-inch wheels, steering-wheel-mounted  shifter paddles, upgraded interior trim, even better front seats (with 22  adjustments plus ventilation) and a power-sliding sunroof.</p>, <p>The <strong>Supercharged </strong>trim level adds a supercharged 5.0-liter V8 (518 hp, 461 lb-ft of torque)  in place of the standard V6. However, it loses some features compared to the  HSE Dynamic, going back to most of the HSE's features while keeping the extra  traction control systems and power sunroof. A <strong>Supercharged Dynamic</strong> is available, which adds the 21-inch wheels,  trim upgrades and paddle shifters. </p>, <p>The <strong>Autobiography </strong>adds flashy 21-inch wheels, turn-adaptive headlights with automatic high  beams, various other exterior styling enhancements, soft-close doors, tri-zone  climate control, premium leather upholstery, heated rear seats, a heated  steering wheel, 22-way adjustable heated and cooled front seats, a configurable  digital instrument cluster, a cooler box in the front console, a surround-view  camera system, and a 19-speaker Meridian sound system.</p>, <p>The high-performance <strong>SVR </strong>provides most of the Autobiography's features, adding or  substituting SVR-specific 21-inch wheels, more power from the V8 (575 hp, 516  lb-ft), sport-tuned suspension and steering, sportier transmission programming,  special interior and exterior styling and trim details, and sport seats.</p>, <p>Many of the standard features on the  higher trims are available as options on lower trims. Other options include  22-inch wheels, quad-zone climate control, a refrigerated storage box in the  front console, a 23-speaker Meridian audio system, a heated windshield, and a  rear-seat video entertainment system. The Drive Pro and Park Pro packages add  adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist and a self-parking system (with  both parallel and perpendicular capability, plus automatic space exit), along  with features such as blind-spot monitoring and a 360-degree parking sensor on  lower trims. A Towing package adds a full-size spare tire and towing hardware  along with a system to help you control a trailer's direction while reversing. </p>]

[<p>The Range Rover name is a special thing  for Land Rover, such that there hasn't been a new variant since the subcompact  Evoque was introduced in 2012. So there's some significance to the arrival of  the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Velar. It's a relatively affordable Land Rover  SUV — at least compared to the regular Range Rover — that  also happens to be the most attractive model in the lineup. </p>, <p>Much as how it's positioned between the  subcompact Evoque and midsize Sport, the Velar's size sits somewhere between  traditional compact and midsize premium SUVs. Its design also departs from  tradition, making the most dramatic visual update to the brand's iconic look  both inside and out.</p>, <p>Though it looks and drives differently,  the Velar is based on the Jaguar F-Pace, sharing its drivetrain options and  underlying structure. It is available with one of three engines: two  turbocharged inline four-cylinders (one gas and one diesel) or a supercharged  3.0-liter V6.</p>, <p>Also differentiating the Velar is its  available off-road equipment, which ranges from height-adjusting air springs, a  mechanical locking rear differential, and a low-speed cruise control. Serious  off-road enthusiasts should still look elsewhere — the Velar is suited  more for boulevards than boulders — but it has enough off-road  capability to make you feel as if you can, even if you never will.</p>, <p>Overall, the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover  Velar is an interesting model to consider if you're shopping for a luxury  crossover SUV. It's larger and more expensive than SUVs such as the BMW X4 and  the Porsche Macan but smaller and less utilitarian than the midsize models  (think BMW X5 and Mercedes GLE) its price can bump against. It's arguably the  most stylish of the bunch, though. If you find the Land Rover brand appealing,  the new Velar should be a great choice. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Velar is  available in five different trim levels, each with a greater number of standard  features throughout. The undesignated base trim <strong>Velar</strong> is only available with one engine choice, but it has  dual-zone climate control and adaptive suspension dampers. The <strong>S</strong> offers two optional engine choices  along with more comfort and utility features. The <strong>R-Dynamic SE</strong> and the <strong>R-Dynamic  HSE</strong> don more stylish bodywork and bigger wheels. Lastly, the <strong>First Edition</strong> is essentially an HSE  with most of the Velar's options as standard equipment. </p>]

[<p>The base <strong>Velar</strong> starts with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (247  horsepower, 269 pound-feet of torque) that's connected to an eight-speed  automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Standard feature highlights include  adaptive suspension dampers, 18-inch wheels, a panoramic sunroof, automatic  wipers and LED headlights. Inside you'll find dual-zone climate control, faux  leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, a 40/20/40-split rear seat,  two 10-inch infotainment touchscreens, two USB ports and an eight-speaker sound  system. </p>, <p>Standard driver assistance systems  include a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, lane departure warning, hill  start assist, automatic emergency braking, and driver-adjustable drive settings  for different surfaces including mud, sand and rocks. </p>, <p>The <strong>S</strong> adds two engine choices to the mix — a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 (380  hp, 332 lb-ft of torque) or a turbocharged 2.0-liter diesel-powered  four-cylinder (180 hp, 317 lb-ft of torque). The S also includes 19-inch  five-spoke wheels, a power tailgate with hands-free opening, auto-dimming side  mirrors, leather upholstery, power-reclining rear seats, an 11-speaker Meridian  sound system navigation, and Jaguar InControl smartphone app integration. </p>, <p>Along with 20-inch wheels, the <strong>R-Dynamic SE </strong>receives more  aggressive-looking bodywork and special exterior trim. The interior features  perforated leather with microfiber-suede seat material along with trim-specific  finishes. Entertainment upgrades consist of a full-digital gauge cluster and a  17-speaker Meridian sound system. Driver assistance additions include  blind-spot monitoring, a driver attention monitor, traffic sign recognition,  and front and rear parking sensors. </p>, <p>The <strong>R-Dynamic  HSE</strong> looks similar to the SE, but it rides on 21-inch wheels. The interior  gains extended leather trimming and upgraded front seats (with massage, heating  and ventilation functions). Adaptive cruise and lane keeping assist are  standard as well. </p>, <p>Think of the <strong>First Edition </strong>as an HSE with most of the options as standard  equipment. It is only available with the supercharged 3.0-liter V6, and it  includes some mechanical upgrades (air springs, a rear locking differential and  larger front brakes) plus a low-speed cruise control intended for off-roading.  Other standard features include 22-inch wheels, a black roof, a heated  windshield, upgraded interior trim, a heated steering wheel, configurable  ambient interior lighting, a head-up display, a surround-view camera system,  two extra USB ports for the second row, and a 23-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>Most of the extra standard features of  the higher trim levels are offered as options on the lower trims.</p>]

[<p>What do you do when you're attracted to  the fuel efficiency offered by a typical hybrid but want more room and an  upscale cabin? A large luxury hybrid that doesn't cost a fortune might seem  like an impossibility, but the 2018 Lexus ES 300h delivers on all fronts.</p>, <p>This comfortable cruiser provides  spacious transport for up to five passengers, all while returning fuel economy  around 40 mpg. You definitely get a lot of car for your money with the ES 300h.  It costs just a bit more than the related Toyota Avalon Hybrid, but the Lexus  is undeniably the more luxurious of the two.</p>, <p>That doesn't mean the ES 300h is perfect  — you do give up some functionality when you upgrade. We're  specifically referring to the Lexus' Remote Touch infotainment controller,  which is frustrating to use even for seasoned tech veterans. Overall, though,  the 2018 Lexus ES 300h should easily satisfy shoppers who want a fuel-efficient  and roomy luxury sedan.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus ES 300h luxury sedan comes with a four-cylinder hybrid powertrain,  allowing it to achieve better fuel economy than its V6-powered <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/lexus/es-350/2018/sedan/">ES 350</a> sibling. It's sold in a single,  well-equipped trim level, with a number of available feature packages and  stand-alone options. Note that some options and configurations may be limited  depending on where the car is purchased. </p>]

[<p>The  hybrid powertrain has a four-cylinder engine and electric motor with a combined  output of 200 horsepower. The combo sends power to the front wheels via a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).</p>, <p>Standard  equipment includes 17-inch alloy wheels, LED lighting (headlights, taillights,  running lights and foglights), automatic high beams, automatic wipers, a  sunroof, heated mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, adaptive cruise control, a  forward collision warning system with automatic braking, and lane departure  warning and mitigation. Also standard are dual-zone automatic climate control,  eight-way power front seats (with two-way power lumbar), simulated leather  upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a rearview camera, Lexus Enform  Remote (allows for smartphone control of some vehicle functions) and Lexus  Safety Connect emergency communications. </p>, <p>On  the infotainment front, the ES 300h comes with a driver information display, an  8-inch central display screen, Siri Eyes Free (iPhone voice control  integration) and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite  radio, HD radio and a USB port. </p>, <p>There  are a few notable packages available for the Lexus ES 300h, starting with the <strong>Navigation </strong>package. It includes the  mouselike Remote Touch interface, a navigation system, voice controls, a second  USB port, and the Enform suite of smartphone-connected apps and concierge  services. A 15-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound audio system can be added  to this package. </p>, <p>The <strong>Premium </strong>package adds a  power-adjustable steering wheel, driver-seat memory settings and several wood  trim choices. The <strong>Luxury </strong>package  includes the Premium package and tacks on leather upholstery and heated and  ventilated front seats. It also requires the addition of several stand-alone  options, including front and rear parking sensors, a steering wheel trimmed in leather  and wood, a power rear sunshade, upgraded headlights, and blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Ultra Luxury</strong> package includes  everything from the Luxury package plus a driver seat-cushion extender,  passenger-seat memory settings, upgraded leather upholstery, manual rear side  sunshades and ambient lighting.  </p>]

[<p>While other manufacturers have branched  out and built cars to satisfy the latest fads and trends, Lexus has not ignored  shoppers simply searching for a roomy luxury sedan. The 2018 Lexus ES 350 is  just that vehicle. </p>, <p>While  the ES 350's pricing is similar to that of other entry-level luxury sedans, it  offers more room and more features than the norm. Top-notch build quality, a  smooth V6 and a plush ride continue to be ES hallmarks as well. </p>, <p>Having  said that, the ES isn't a car to excite drivers. Handling is not on par with  that of more nimble competitors. The ES also lags behind rivals in the  infotainment category. But if you're mainly interested in getting a traditional  luxury sedan experience that prioritizes interior space and a quiet cabin above  all else, the 2018 ES 350 will be a great choice.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus ES 350 sedan comes in a single trim level. While there are a few  stand-alone options, buyers need only pick colors and packages. A 3.5-liter V6  engine (268 horsepower, 248 pound-feet of torque) sends its power to the front  wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment includes 17-inch wheels, LED headlights (low-beam setting only),  automatic wipers, a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic  climate control, power-adjustable front seats, simulated leather upholstery and  an auto-dimming rearview mirror. </p>, <p>Also  standard is the Display Audio interface (includes an 8-inch touchscreen and  multipurpose control knob), Bluetooth, Scout GPS Link (smartphone navigation),  a USB port, and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player and satellite  radio. Standard safety features include a rearview camera, Safety Connect  emergency communications, a forward collision warning and mitigation system,  adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, and a lane departure warning and  intervention system. </p>, <p>Many  options and packages are available, but there are certain package  prerequisites, and availability can vary depending on where you live.</p>, <p>The  Premier package adds driver-seat memory settings, a power tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, wood trim, and heated and ventilated front seats. The Luxury  package includes the above plus leather upholstery. The Ultra Luxury package  adds the Premium and Luxury packages' equipment plus a panoramic sunroof,  manual rear door sunshades, ambient interior lighting, a power driver-seat  cushion extender and passenger-seat memory functions. </p>, <p>Other  notable options include a navigation system, a 15-speaker Mark Levinson sound  system, a power rear window sunshade, a wood steering wheel (with heating, if  desired), bi-LED headlights, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, and a power-opening trunk.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus GS 300 is an affordable  luxury sedan that represents the starting point of the Lexus GS range. Priced below the more powerful GS  350, the GS 300 has a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine good for 241 horsepower.  It's a sufficient, though hardly exciting, amount of power. The upside is the  GS 300's lower price and higher fuel economy.</p>, <p>The  rest of the GS 300's qualities are familiar. Equipped with the optional F Sport  package, it's one of the more enjoyable midsize luxury sedans to drive thanks  to its sporty suspension and steering. Inside, you'll find a high-quality cabin  fitted with a decent number of standard features. Additional features are  available to keep the entry-level GS 300 competitive with pricier luxury  machines.</p>, <p>As  is the case with the rest of the GS range, the 300's main drawback is its  infotainment interface. It requires too much driver attention to operate it  properly, and tech-savvy drivers might not enjoy using Lexus' native smartphone  integration system. Overall, though, the 2018 GS 300's value keeps this sedan  in positive territory. It's worth a look if you're shopping for a reasonably  priced luxury sedan.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Lexus GS as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Luxury Sedan">Best Midsize Luxury Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus <strong>GS 300</strong> comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (241 hp,  258 pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive.  Feature highlights include 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, keyless ignition and  entry, simulated leather upholstery, a sunroof, power-adjustable and heated  front seats, driver-seat memory settings, and an automatic climate control  system. </p>]

[<p>Technology  features include Lexus' Remote Touch infotainment interface, a navigation  system, voice controls, smartphone app integration, a 12.3-inch display screen  and a 12-speaker sound system. A broad range of driver safety aids (blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and the Lexus Safety System+ suite of  advanced active safety features) are also included.</p>, <p>Heated  and ventilated front seats, automatic wipers and a power rear sunshade are  optional by way of the Premium package, and the available 18-inch wheel upgrade  offers a same-cost choice between all-season and stickier three-season summer  performance tires.</p>, <p>The  optional <strong>F Sport</strong> version ups the  ante on the handling front by adding 19-inch wheels with performance tires, a  sport-tuned adaptive suspension, bigger front brakes, more aggressive front and  rear styling, and a rear trunklid spoiler. Inside you'll find leather  upholstery, power sport seats, all of the Premium Package content, and  different interior trim pieces.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions, although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test and an extended yearlong test of the <strong>2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport </strong>(3.5L V6 | 6-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  The GS 300 and its 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine and eight-speed  transmission didn't exist when this test was conducted. But the car itself and  its features and options are largely identical, apart from one or two upgrades  such as LED headlights. Except for these factors, our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's GS 300.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus GS 350 is a multitalented  luxury sedan that artfully blends comfort, sophistication and performance.  Despite its advancing age — the current generation has been around  for five years — the GS still makes a compelling choice with a  well-appointed interior, eager powertrain, sure handling and a smooth ride.  All-wheel drive is available for those who often drive in wet weather, and  there's even an F Sport model that ratchets up the sporting quotient without  sacrificing much comfort.</p>, <p>The heart of the GS 350 is a  311-horsepower V6 engine. It lacks the dominating thrust found in rival sedans  with turbocharged or supercharged six-cylinder engines but nonetheless  impresses with a smooth power delivery. Recent tech and safety upgrades, such  as a full suite of driver aids including adaptive cruise control, automatic  emergency braking and lane control, make the GS a more compelling choice than  ever. </p>, <p>There are no significant changes for the  2018 model, although Lexus now includes its roadside and emergency assistance  program free for a full 10 years, which should offer additional peace of mind  for the long road trips to which the GS is so well-suited. With its incremental  upgrades year over year, today's GS is even more luxurious, smooth, comfortable  and engaging than it was at the outset. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus GS 350 midsize luxury  sedan comes in two main versions: base and <strong>F  Sport</strong>. Both are available with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment for the  rear-wheel-drive GS 350 includes a 3.5-liter V6 engine (311 horsepower, 280  pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, a sunroof, ambient  LED cabin lighting, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate  control, power-adjustable front seats (heated and ventilated), leather  upholstery, driver-seat memory settings, a power-adjustable steering wheel and  a power rear sunshade. </p>, <p>Standard  tech content includes Bluetooth, the Remote Touch infotainment interface, a  navigation system, voice controls, smartphone app integration, a 12.3-inch  display screen and a 12-speaker sound system. Various driver safety aids  (blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and the Lexus Safety System  Plus suite of advanced active safety features) are also included.</p>, <p>Note  that on the all-wheel-drive GS 350, leather upholstery is optional by way of  the Premium package, which also includes the heated and ventilated front seats  and power rear sunshade. A six-speed automatic transmission is used on this  model instead of the eight-speed.</p>, <p>The  rear-wheel-drive <strong>F Sport</strong> ups the  ante on handling with 19-inch wheels with summer performance tires, a  sport-tuned adaptive suspension and bigger front brakes. It offers the option  of four-wheel steering or a limited-slip rear differential. The F Sport has  more aggressive front and rear bumper and grille styling, power sport seats and  different interior trim pieces. All-wheel drive is available, but it's not  quite as sporty and doesn't have the option for four-wheel steering or the  limited-slip rear differential.</p>, <p>On  all GS 350s, key stand-alone options include parking sensors, a premium Mark  Levinson sound system and a power-operated trunk.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions, although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test and an extended yearlong test of the <strong>2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport</strong> (3.5-liter V6 | 6-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the GS 350 has received some upgrades, including  an eight-speed automatic transmission for the rear-wheel-drive models, a more  sophisticated fuel-injection system, engine upgrades that added 5 horsepower,  LED headlights and more capable entertainment system software. Our initial  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's GS 350.</p>]

[<p>For the most part, owning a sporty luxury  sedan means sacrificing fuel economy. But the 2018 Lexus GS 450h is a notable  exception. This hybrid luxury sedan is enjoyable to drive and saves you gas at  the same time. </p>, <p>From economical to sporty, there's a Lexus  GS model that appeals to most luxury sedan buyers. The 450h's hybrid powertrain  combines a 3.5-liter V6 with large electric motor producing a healthy 338  combined horsepower. The rear-wheel-drive 450h can accelerate from zero to 60  mph in a claimed 5.6 seconds and return combined 31 mpg (29 city/34 highway).</p>, <p>And while other manufacturers have  sacrificed dynamics for hybridization, the GS 450h maintains its performance  capability thanks to its sporty handling. The rest of the 450h is very similar  to the GS 350, including the large 12.3-inch infotainment display, navigation  system, and plenty of standard and optional features. </p>, <p>On  the downside, the 450h's pricing is much higher than a comparably equipped  gasoline-only GS 350 as well as starting prices for rivals such as the BMW 530e  plug-in hybrid and Acura RLX Sport Hybrid. We're also not fond of the 450h's  infotainment interface. But on the whole, the 2018 Lexus GS 450h is a smart  pick if you're looking to get high levels of luxury, performance and fuel economy  in one package.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus GS 450h is available in  two well-equipped trim levels. Under the hood is a 3.5-liter V6 paired to a  battery-fed electric motor. The combination is good for a total of 338  horsepower that is sent to the rear wheels through a continuously variable  automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>Standard feature highlights include 18-inch wheels, a sunroof, keyless ignition  and entry, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats, leather  upholstery, a rearview camera, the Remote Touch infotainment interface, a navigation  system, voice controls, smartphone app integration, a 12.3-inch display screen  and a 12-speaker sound system. A variety of driver safety aids (blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and the Lexus Safety System+ suite of  advanced active safety features) is also included.</p>, <p>The <strong>F  Sport</strong> version includes 19-inch wheels, special exterior and interior  styling, a sport-tuned suspension with adaptive dampers, enhanced steering  (variable gear-ratio and rear-wheel steering) and sport front seats.</p>, <p>Notable options for the GS 450h include a 17-speaker Mark Levinson premium  audio system, a power-operated trunk, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>]

[<p>The world of high-performance luxury  sport sedans has basically become a game of one-upmanship. Which one has the  most horsepower? Which one goes from zero to 60 mph in the quickest time? Which  goes around Germany's Nürburgring track quicker than the rest? In the  process, some of the visceral thrill and tactility of these cars have been lost  — turbocharging is numbing engine response and all-wheel drive is  limiting tail-out antics.</p>, <p>Well, consider the 2018 Lexus GS F a  refreshing option for keeping it old-school. Its 469-horsepower V8 is  non-turbocharged. As such, it has less low-rpm, torque-rich thrust than its <br>turbocharged competitors, but in return  it produces sharper and more engaging responsiveness and a more special  soundtrack. Oh, and it sends its power to the rear wheels, just the way the  sports car gods have always intended. </br></p>, <p>As with all of Lexus F cars, there's more  than just a big engine. Compared to a regular GS, the GS F features retuned  steering for even better feel. And its superb handling is made possible by an  adaptive sport-tuned suspension that allows for impressive control, minimum  body roll and, quite impressively, a sufficiently comfortable ride. The end  result is an uncommonly rewarding sport sedan even in routine driving. </p>, <p>Of course, beyond its performance  credentials, the GS F is still a Lexus GS — for better and for worse.  For better, you get impeccable build quality and a long list of standard  features, including safety and driver aids that its competitors almost always  charge extra for. There are still some downsides here — most notably,  the frustrating-to-use Remote Touch infotainment interface — but  overall this is one refreshingly honest and thrilling luxury sport sedan. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Lexus GS F as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sport Sedans">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus GS F is the  high-performance version of the regular Lexus GS sedan, which we review  separately. There is only one loaded trim level. It comes with a 5.0-liter V8  (467 horsepower, 389 pound-feet of torque), rear-wheel drive and an eight-speed  automatic transmission. Besides its engine, the GS F stands apart from lesser  GS models with a torque-vectoring rear differential, an adaptive sport-tuned  suspension, sport steering, Brembo brakes, aerodynamic enhancements and special  styling.</p>]

[<p>Other standard features include  auto-dimming mirrors, xenon headlights, automatic high beams, LED running  lights, automatic wipers, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning  with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist,  keyless ignition and entry, power-adjustable front seats with memory functions,  leather upholstery and a power-adjustable steering wheel.</p>, <p>Also standard is the Remote Touch  infotainment interface with a 12.3-inch display, a navigation system, voice  controls, Lexus Enform (infotainment app suite and remote vehicle controls), a  USB port, and a 12-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite radio and  HD radio.</p>, <p>Options are limited to different wheels,  orange brake calipers, a head-up display, and a 17-speaker Mark Levinson sound  system that also adds a six-CD changer.</p>]

[<p>Evaluated in isolation, the 2018 Lexus GX  460 will probably wow you with its luxury-lined cabin, expansive features and  smooth on-road ride. The trouble is that it has a rather dated design with  diminishing appeal. In comparison, virtually every one of the GX 460's  three-row luxury SUV rivals offers superior driving manners, interior space,  power and fuel economy. They have even more features and are even more  comfortable. </p>, <p>Of course, there are still some things to  like about the GX 460, including its rugged, trucklike construction, commanding  driving position, and the latest and greatest off-roading hardware Lexus has to  offer. It should be able to take you wherever you want to go. Unfortunately,  the aggressive new Lexus styling applied to the GX a few years ago took its  toll on its approach angle and ground clearance.</p>, <p>As a result, the GX has less clearance  than a Volvo XC90 — a vehicle that otherwise has nowhere near the  GX's four-wheel-drive capabilities. At the same time, its trucklike construction  significantly reduces its interior space and cargo-carrying versatility. The GX  even retains an old-school swing-out tailgate that opens toward the curb. </p>, <p>In the end, there's just not enough to  the 2018 Lexus GX 460 to warrant a recommendation. It's compromised no matter  how you look at it. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus GX 460 is a large  three-row SUV using traditional body-on-frame construction. It seats seven  people standard. Available second-row captain's chairs reduce capacity to six.  There are <strong>base</strong> and <strong>Luxury </strong>trim levels available. Both come  with a 4.6-liter V8 engine (301 horsepower, 329 pound-feet of torque), a  six-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the <strong>base</strong> trim includes 18-inch wheels, a  full-size spare tire, LED headlights, running boards, a flip-up rear window  within the swing-out tailgate, roof rails, Lexus' Kinetic Dynamic Suspension  System (improves off-road traction), a sunroof, a rearview camera, and keyless  ignition and entry. </p>, <p>Inside, you'll find dual-zone automatic  climate control, simulated leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats,  driver-seat memory settings, a power-adjustable steering column, a  40/20/40-split second-row seat (sliding, reclining, folding) and a 50/50-split  folding third-row seat. Infotainment features include Lexus Enform emergency  and remote vehicle services, an 8-inch touchscreen, two USB ports, Bluetooth,  and a nine-speaker sound system with a CD player and satellite and HD radio.</p>, <p>Stand-alone options include a blind-spot  monitoring system (with rear cross-traffic alert), LED foglights, automatic  wipers, a windshield de-icer, heated and ventilated front seats and a  navigation system. The <strong>Premium</strong> package  bundles most of those stand-alone options (minus blind-spot monitoring) and  further adds parking sensors, heated second-row seats, leather upholstery and  three-zone climate control. You can also add second-row captain's chairs. </p>, <p>The GX 460<strong> Luxury </strong>comes with all of the above as standard plus an adaptive  and auto-leveling suspension, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, headlight  washers, a heated wood-trimmed steering wheel, a rear cargo cover, the  second-row captain's chairs and upgraded leather upholstery.</p>, <p>Only the Luxury model can be enhanced  with a 17-speaker Mark Levinson sound system, a two-screen rear seat  entertainment system, and the Driver Support package, which adds adaptive  cruise control, forward collision warning and automatic braking, front- and  side-view cameras, a driver inattention monitoring system, lane departure  warning, automatic high beams, crawl control (an off-road, low-speed cruise  control system) and the Mark Levinson sound system. </p>, <p>The Sport Design package adds special styling  elements to the Premium or Luxury models. </p>]

[<p>Seeing a 2018 Lexus IS 300 at rest, you  might take its aggressive style — the pinched grille, prominent air  intakes and sweeping body lines to the back — as the sign of an  uncompromising performance car. But don't let its looks fool you. The IS 300 is  foremost a cruise and comfort machine, with a well-honed ride, hushed cabin and  generous feature set. </p>, <p>For 2018, the IS 300 lineup gains a  turbocharged four-cylinder engine with rear-wheel drive. This isn't entirely a  new development, however; Lexus has simply renamed last year's rear-wheel-drive  IS 200t as a 300. The rear-wheel-drive IS 300 uses an eight-speed transmission  while the all-drive-wheel model retains the smooth, if outdated, V6 engine and  six-speed automatic. </p>, <p>The V6 puts out 260 horsepower this year,  although this still pales in comparison to the IS' European six-cylinder  rivals. The IS 300's overall handling capabilities also fail to deliver the  robust driving excitement of some other sport luxury sedans. But overall we  think you'll like the IS 300. The interior stands out in both design and  quality, the standard features included on the base level trim are generous by  any measure, and the convenience and safety tech is top-notch.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus <strong>IS 300</strong> is a  five-passenger small luxury sedan that slots below the more powerful <a href="/lexus/is-350/2018/">IS 350</a>. The IS 300 is available with a  four-cylinder engine and rear-wheel drive or a V6 engine with all-wheel drive.  There are no actual trim levels, only stand-alone options and trim packages,  although the F Sport package adds exterior elements and hardware that improve  the IS 300's performance.</p>]

[<p>The  IS 300 rear-wheel-drive model starts with a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (241 hp, 258 pound-feet of torque) and an eight-speed  automatic transmission. </p>, <p>Standard  features include 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, a sunroof, heated side  mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control,  power-adjustable front seats, premium vinyl upholstery, 60/40-split folding  rear seatbacks, Bluetooth, a 7-inch color display, and a 10-speaker sound  system with dual USB ports and an auxiliary audio input. </p>, <p>Standard  tech and safety features include a rearview camera, automatic high beams, lane  departure warning and intervention, adaptive cruise control, and a forward  collision warning system with pedestrian detection and automatic braking. </p>, <p>The  IS 300 all-wheel-drive model substitutes a 3.5-liter V6 engine (260 hp, 236  lb-ft of torque) and a six-speed automatic transmission. Heated front seats  also come standard. </p>, <p>The  IS 300 offers a few options packages, among them the Comfort package, which  adds automatic wipers, a power-adjustable steering wheel, driver-seat memory  settings, and blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. A Premium  package includes heated and ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>The  Navigation package replaces the standard infotainment control dial with Lexus'  Remote Touch mouse-type controller and adds a navigation system with a larger  10.3-inch display. A 15-speaker Mark Levinson audio system is also available,  but only when bundled with the navigation system.  </p>, <p>For  those who want to dial up the sporting factor, the F Sport package adds a  full-mesh front grille, a revised front bumper, twin-projector LED headlights,  staggered-width 18-inch wheels (with either summer or all-season tires), a  sport-tuned suspension, upgraded brake pads, an intake sound generator that  amplifies engine noise during acceleration, heated and ventilated front sport  seats and a special sport-oriented gauge cluster. </p>, <p>Other  stand-alone options include 18-inch wheels, adaptive headlights, a power rear  sunshade, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>]

[<p>Based on the Lexus IS 350's looks alone,  you might take its aggressive style — the pinched grille, prominent  air intakes, and sweeping body lines to the back — as the sign of an  uncompromising performance car. But don't let its looks fool you. The IS 350 is  foremost a cruise and comfort machine. </p>, <p>Much of the credit goes to the Lexus'  cabin, which stands out in both design and quality, and the IS 350's smooth  ride quality both around town and out on the open highway. There are also  generous standard features and plentiful options. We particularly like how adaptive cruise control and a  forward collision warning system with pedestrian detection and automatic  braking come standard. </p>, <p>The focus on comfort doesn't mean the IS  350 is a wet blanket to drive. With its 311-horsepower V6, the 350 is the  fastest version of the IS lineup. But the reality is that rival luxury sedans  with six-cylinder engines (as upgrades) do offer quicker acceleration and often  have sharper handling abilities. You just have to ask yourself how much that  really matters. Overall, we think the IS 350 offers a pleasing blend of the  qualities most luxury sedan shoppers will want. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus <strong>IS 350</strong> is a  five-passenger small luxury sedan that tops the IS lineup. It's only available  with a V6 engine, which can be paired with an eight-speed automatic  transmission and rear-wheel drive or a six-speed auto with all-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>The  IS 350 rear-wheel-drive model starts with a V6 engine (311 hp, 280 pound-feet  of torque) and eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive versions use  a six-speed automatic. </p>, <p>Standard  features include 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, a sunroof, heated side  mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control,  power-adjustable front seats, simulated leather upholstery, 60/40-split folding  rear seatbacks, Bluetooth, a 7-inch color display, and a 10-speaker sound  system with dual USB ports and an auxiliary audio input. </p>, <p>Standard  tech and safety features include a rearview camera, automatic high beams, lane  departure warning with lane-keep steering assist, adaptive cruise control, and  a forward collision warning system with pedestrian detection and automatic  braking.

[<p>For nearly 20 years, the Lexus SC was the luxury  automaker's premier two-door coupe and convertible. Early on, it combined  respectable performance with the ride comfort Lexus owners had come to expect.  But by the end of its run in 2010, the SC 430 hardtop convertible was dated and  generally unexciting compared to fresher European rivals. After an eight-year  absence — during which time we've seen inspiring results from Lexus'  LFA supercar and RC F coupe — Lexus is back in the midsize luxury  coupe business with the 2018 LC 500. And unlike its most recent SC predecessor,  the LC 500 thoroughly delivers as a thrilling yet livable grand tourer. </p>, <p>The performance part of this high-powered luxury  coupe comes from a 5.0-liter V8. It's the same one found in the RC F, but it's  slightly more powerful and good for 471 horsepower. It's paired to a new  10-speed automatic transmission (yes, 10) that drives the rear wheels. For  comfort, Lexus fits the LC with an adjustable suspension and an utterly  bewitching cabin. From the padding in the footwells to the headliner, nearly  every surface is draped in high-quality leather or suede. That the new LC also  has jaw-dropping styling helps considerably, too. </p>, <p>There are a few downsides, such as the Lexus Remote  Touch infotainment interface, which is unwieldy and frustrating to use, and the  lack of customization possibility. But overall we think highly of the LC 500.  It's proof that Lexus can craft a performance luxury coupe that stands toe to  toe with some of the most elite grand tourers on sale today. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Lexus LC 500 is a luxury sport coupe that brilliantly marries comfort and  performance. It has seating for four and is sold in a single trim (the LC 500h  hybrid is reviewed separately) with a long list of standard equipment. Several  packages and stand-alone options are available to bolster the LC 500 with  additional features.</p>]

[<p>The  thundering heart of the LC 500 is a 5.0-liter V8 engine (471 horsepower, 398  pound-feet of torque). It drives the rear wheels through a 10-speed automatic  transmission with steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles. </p>, <p>Befitting  a luxury coupe at this price and performance level, the number of standard  features is generous. They include 20-inch wheels, LED exterior lights,  automatic high-beam control, heated and auto-dimming mirrors, keyless entry and  ignition, ambient interior lighting, an 8-inch driver information screen, a  power-adjustable tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, adaptive cruise control,  heated and ventilated eight-way power front seats (with two-way power lumbar  adjustment), driver-seat memory settings, adjustable driving modes,  leather-upholstered front seats (simulated leather for the rear seats), a  10.3-inch central display, a navigation system, and a 12-speaker audio system  with two USB ports and HD and satellite radio. Notable safety features include  a rearview camera, a pre-collision warning system with automatic braking, and  lane departure warning and mitigation.</p>, <p>Although  the LC 500 is loaded out of the box, there are a few options and packages  available so you can tailor this ground tourer to your liking. Stand-alone  options include forged 20- and 21-inch wheels, a head-up display, a Torsen  limited-slip differential and a 13-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio system.</p>, <p>For added  convenience and/or style, consider the <strong>All-Weather </strong>package (heated steering wheel and windshield de-icer), the <strong>Convenience</strong> package (front and rear  parking sensors and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert) and  the <strong>Touring </strong>package (forged 20-inch  wheels, faux suede headliner, upgraded leather upholstery and the Mark Levinson  audio system).</p>, <p>If  high-octane thrills are what you're after, you can always specify the <strong>Sport </strong>package, which adds the  Convenience package plus front sport seats with simulated suede inserts and the  limited-slip diff (this package can also be ordered with a carbon-fiber roof).  Finally, the <strong>Performance </strong>package  starts with the Sport pack with the carbon-fiber roof and adds an adaptive rear  spoiler, an active rear steering system, variable-ratio steering, carbon-fiber  kick plates and faux suede headliner.</p>]

[<p>Buyers of high-end luxury vehicles are  used to getting what they want, but until recently, opulent sports cars that  didn't gorge on vast stores of gasoline simply didn't exist. Now, one of the  most experienced hybrid automakers in the business is thrusting its best foot  forward with the new 2018 Lexus LC 500h. This seductive coupe offers an  enticing blend of high style, performance, comfort and luxury.</p>, <p>Motivating the LC 500h is a combination  of a 3.5-liter gasoline V6 and an electric motor. A continuously variable  automatic transmission works in conjunction with a traditional four-speed  automatic to send power to the rear wheels. The unique powertrain helps make  the most out of the horsepower available, which is 354 hp for the total system.</p>, <p>This hybrid feels quick on the road. In  fact, it posted the same 0-60 mph time at our test track as the V8-driven LC  500. Plus, you get 30 mpg in combined city/highway driving, according to the  EPA, which is fantastic for a luxury performance coupe and more than 50 percent  better fuel economy than the LC 500.</p>, <p>As impressive as the powertrain is, it's  the cabin that immediately yields the most impassioned responses from  passengers. From the seats to the headliner, nearly every surface is draped in  supple leather or suede. The penchant for high-quality materials even travels  down to smaller details, such as the paddle shifters made of magnesium and the  hand-trimmed shift knob. There are a few functional blunders, such as the Lexus  Remote Touch infotainment interface, which is unwieldy and frustrating to use.  But overall we think highly of the LC 500h. It's proof that Lexus can craft a  jaw-dropping coupe that stands toe to toe with some of the most elite grand  tourers on sale today. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus LC 500h is a unique car: There are no other high-end hybrid sport  coupes with a starting price under six figures. It's sold in just a single trim  (the V8-powered <a href="/lexus/lc-500/2018/coupe/review/">LC 500</a> is reviewed separately), but there  are so many standard features, it's sufficiently luxurious without any options.  Two packages, Convenience and Touring, add a few creature comforts such as  upgraded leather and blind-spot monitoring. For those looking for dynamic  improvements, the Sport and Performance packages have you covered with  simulated suede upholstery throughout the cabin, a Torsen limited-slip  differential and more. </p>]

[<p>The  LC 500h is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 assisted by an electric motor, generating  354 horsepower overall. Two transmissions, a continuously variable automatic  and a four-speed conventional automatic, work in conjunction to drive the rear  wheels. The transmissions simulate a total of 10 gears, which can be manually  selected using steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles. </p>, <p>Like  most luxury coupes in this price range, the LC 500h boasts an abundance of  standard features. They include 20-inch wheels, LED exterior lights, automatic  high-beam control, heated and auto-dimming mirrors with puddle lamps, keyless  entry and ignition, ambient interior lighting, an 8-inch driver information  screen, a power-adjustable tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, adaptive cruise  control, eight-way power front seats (with two-way power lumbar), driver-seat  memory settings, adjustable driving modes, a 10.3-inch central display, a  navigation system, and a 12-speaker audio system with two USB ports and HD and  satellite radio. Notable safety features include a rearview camera, a  pre-collision warning system with automatic braking, and lane departure warning  and mitigation.</p>, <p>Since  the LC 500h is well-equipped as it is, only a smattering of options and  packages are available, but some significantly alter the character of the car.  Stand-alone options include 20- and 21-inch wheels, a head-up display, a Torsen  limited-slip differential and a 13-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio system.</p>, <p>If  you want to pack the LC 500h with even more luxury features, consider the <strong>All-Weather</strong> package, which adds a  heated steering wheel and windshield de-icer; the <strong>Convenience</strong> package, which brings front and rear parking sensors  and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert; and the <strong>Touring </strong>package, which adds forged  20-inch wheels, a simulated suede headliner, upgraded leather upholstery and  the Mark Levinson audio system. If a high-performance hybrid is more your  speed, you can always specify the <strong>Sport </strong>package,  which adds the Convenience package plus front sport seats with simulated suede  inserts and the limited-slip diff. (This package can also be ordered with a  carbon-fiber roof.) Finally, the <strong>Performance </strong>package takes the Sport package with carbon-fiber roof and adds an adaptive  rear spoiler, an active rear steering system, variable-ratio steering,  carbon-fiber kick plates and the simulated suede headliner.</p>]

[<p>Don't let the sharp angles and bold style  fool you: The 2018 Lexus LS 500 is traditional Lexus throughout. A  comprehensive redesign inside, outside and underneath places the LS once again  in the same rare air as recently updated large luxury sedan designs from Audi,  BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. The cushioned ride and whisper-quiet interior are  made to pamper, and the cutting-edge tech delivers increased driver safety. The  LS 500 reminds you that Europe doesn't have a lock on world-class luxury. </p>, <p>The new fifth-generation Lexus LS 500 is  longer, lower and wider than its predecessor, the LS 460, with a new coupelike  profile that makes it look slimmer and more lithe — no small feat for  a car that weighs more than 5,000 pounds. A new suspension design yields  sportier handling, but we use that term loosely. This is, first, a luxury sedan  better suited to arcing through turns than attacking them.</p>, <p>An all-new turbocharged V6 engine  delivers more horsepower than the outgoing model, and it pairs with a  quick-shifting 10-speed automatic transmission. The new LS 500's longer  wheelbase, longer even than that of the earlier extended model, ensures a cabin  roomy enough to cosset weary leaders of industry or even just visiting in-laws,  especially when you spring for the seats with up to 28 separate adjustments. </p>, <p>Even a base model LS 500 comes with  enough appointments to satisfy most buyers, but those with a more discerning  eye can opt for enhancements such as a lowering suspension to ease entry and  exit, advanced driver safety aids, and an audiophile-grade sound system. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus LS 500 is a full-size  luxury sedan with seating for five passengers. It comes in a single,  well-appointed trim level with a handful of stand-alone options and options  packages. Even without a single option, the LS 500 comes loaded with the safety  and comfort features you'd expect of this class. A hybrid version is reviewed  separately.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the <strong>LS 500 </strong>is extensive and begins with a  twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine (416 horsepower, 442 pound-feet of  torque) paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive comes  standard; all-wheel drive is optional. </p>, <p>Highlights include 19-inch wheels, an  adaptive suspension, LED headlights, a sunroof, a hands-free trunk,  power-closing doors, leather upholstery, power-adjustable heated and ventilated  front seats, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, magnesium paddle  shifters, 16-way power-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, and a  power rear sunshade. </p>, <p>Technology features include a 12.3-inch  color display, a navigation system, a trackpad-style interface, a Wi-Fi  hotspot, Lexus Enform smartphone app integration, Enform emergency and  convenience services, Bluetooth and a 12-speaker audio system. Finally,  standard driver aids include a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors,  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning,  pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, adaptive  cruise control, automatic high beams and rain-sensing wipers. </p>, <p>The  LS 500 can be further tailored to your taste with a comprehensive options list.  The Interior Upgrade package adds leather upholstery with quilted stitching,  28-way power-adjustable driver seat, and heated rear seats, among other items.  The Luxury package adds a 28-way adjustable seat for the passenger, 18-way  adjustable and reclining rear seats, four-zone climate control, power rear side  sunshades, an armrest-mounted touchscreen controller for climate and seat  functions, and rear-seat knee airbags. </p>, <p>Drivers  seeking a more sporting flavor can equip the LS 500 with the F Sport package,  which adds 20-inch wheels, larger brakes, a retuned suspension, unique styling  trim, exclusive leather upholstery, and 28-way power-adjustable seats. The  Performance package bundles all that and adds variable gear-ratio steering and  rear-wheel steering. </p>, <p>The  Executive package truly transforms the LS 500 into a luxury shuttle, adding  butterfly rear headrests, individual climate control settings, heated and  ventilated rear seats with massaging function, and an extendable ottoman  footrest for the right-side rear passenger. The cabin is further touched with  hand-pleated trim and stylized glass materials. </p>, <p>Additional  safety aids come with the Safety System+ A package, which adds adaptive cruise  and automatic steering that can detect and "trace" the path of the  vehicle in front, for a semiautonomous driving experience. Other features  include forward cross-traffic alert, road sign recognition, an enhanced head-up  display, and a panoramic rearview monitor. </p>, <p>Notable  individual options include an adaptive air suspension, a panoramic sunroof,  adaptive LED headlights, upgraded wood trim, and a premium 23-speaker Mark  Levinson sound system.</p>]

This is, first, a luxury sedan better  suited to arcing through turns than attacking them.</p>, <p>An all-new turbocharged V6 engine  replaces the outgoing model's V8, and it pairs with dual electric motors and a  lithium-ion battery. A two-stage continuously variable automatic transmission  adds a four-speed gear set to effectively mimic a 10-speed automatic  transmission. The net effect is less power than the last LS hybrid but improved  fuel economy. It's now up to 28 mpg combined compared to the LS 600h L's 20 mpg  combined rating. </p>, <p>Its combined rating is also 5 mpg better  than the non-hybrid LS 500's. But at an additional cost of around $4,500,  you'll need to consider whether the LS 500h's fuel savings will pay off in the  long run. Regardless, the new LS hybrid achieves fuel economy similar to its  competitors, even those that use plug-in hybrid charging. (The Mercedes-Benz  S-Class S550e, for example, returns 26 mpg combined after depleting its 12  miles of electric range.) </p>, <p>One thing you won't need to consider is  the LS 500h's long-term comfort. The new sedan's longer wheelbase, longer even  than that of the previous extended model, ensures a cabin roomy enough to  cosset weary leaders of industry or even just visiting in-laws, especially when  you spring for the seats with up to 28 separate adjustments. </p>, <p>Even a base level LS 500h comes with  enough appointments to satisfy most buyers, but those with a more discerning  eye can opt for enhancements such as a lowering suspension to ease entry and  exit, advanced driver safety aids, and an audiophile-grade sound system. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus LS 500h is a full-size  luxury sedan with seating for five passengers. It comes in a single,  well-appointed trim level with a handful of stand-alone options and option packages.  Even without a single option, the LS 500h comes loaded with the safety and  comfort features you'd expect of this class.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the <strong>LS 500h </strong>is extensive and begins with a  twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine (295 horsepower) connected to a pair of  electric motors and a lithium-ion battery. Total system horsepower is 354 hp,  with power distributed through a continuously automatic variable transmission.  Rear-wheel drive comes standard; all-wheel drive is optional. </p>, <p>Highlights include 19-inch wheels, an  adaptive suspension, LED headlights, a sunroof, a hands-free trunk,  power-closing doors, leather upholstery, power-adjustable heated and ventilated  front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with heating, magnesium paddle  shifters, 16-way power-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, and a  power rear sunshade. </p>, <p>Technology features include a 12.3-inch  color display, a navigation system, a trackpad-style interface, a Wi-Fi  hotspot, Lexus Enform smartphone app integration, Enform emergency and  convenience services, Bluetooth and a 12-speaker audio system. Finally,  standard driver aids include a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors,  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning,  pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, adaptive  cruise control, automatic high beams and rain-sensing wipers. </p>, <p>The  LS 500h can be further tailored to your taste with a comprehensive options  list. The Interior Upgrade package adds leather upholstery with quilted  stitching, 28-way power-adjustable driver's seat, and heated rear seats, among  other items. The Luxury package adds a 28-way adjustable seat for the  passenger, 18-way adjustable and reclining rear seats, four-zone climate  control, power rear side sunshades, an armrest-mounted touchscreen controller  for climate and seat functions, and rear-seat knee airbags. </p>, <p>The  Executive package truly transforms the LS 500h into a luxury shuttle, adding  butterfly rear headrests, individual climate control settings, heated and  ventilated rear seats with massaging function, and an extendable ottoman  footrest for the right-side rear passenger. The cabin is further touched with  hand-pleated trim and stylized glass materials. </p>, <p>Additional  safety aids come with the Safety System+ A package, which adds adaptive cruise  and automatic steering that can detect and "trace" the path of the  vehicle in front for a semiautonomous driving experience. Other features  include forward cross-traffic alert, road sign recognition, an enhanced head-up  display, and a panoramic rearview monitor. </p>, <p>Notable  individual options include an adaptive air suspension, a panoramic sunroof,  adaptive LED headlights, upgraded wood trim, and a premium 23-speaker Mark  Levinson sound system.</p>]

[<p>Mechanically, there's not much separating  the 2018 Lexus LX 570 from Toyota's Land Cruiser. They share the same chassis  design, powertrain and general interior layout. They both specialize in going  places most other vehicles wouldn't dare, with the safety net of a reliability  reputation that stretches back decades.</p>, <p>Where do they diverge then? Well, think  of the Land Cruiser as an outdoor adventurer going about his trek in a  high-dollar shell jacket from REI. The LX 570 is wearing a high-dollar suit  — it's still capable, but the fancy clothes do hold it back a bit. </p>, <p>You can tell just by looking at the LX  570's expressive Lexus styling that results in less ground clearance. The LX's  big 20- or 21-inch wheels are also less conducive for venturing off the beaten  path. Inside, the LX features higher-quality materials and ritzier design than  its Toyota sibling.</p>, <p>Of course, the LX 570 also shares the  Land Cruiser's inherent drawbacks. Its fuel economy is abysmal even by  full-size SUV standards, and the third-row seat is cramped, difficult to reach  and doesn't fold into the floor. Instead, it flips against the cargo area  sides, which reduces utility.</p>, <p>For these reasons, another large luxury  SUV would likely be a better choice if utility and family-hauling duty are  priorities. But if you do like to venture off to places where pavement and  traction are scarce, the LX 570 delivers capabilities that few other SUVs can  match. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota LX 570 is an eight-passenger luxury SUV offered in one trim level.  It comes with a 5.7-liter V8 (383 horsepower, 403 pound-feet of torque) paired  to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a four-wheel-drive system. An  adaptive suspension that is height adjustable and automatically levels the load  is also standard. </p>]

[<p>Other  standard mechanical components include 20-inch wheels, Crawl Control (a  low-speed off-road cruise control), Multi-Terrain Select (off-road vehicle  settings) and hill start assist.</p>, <p>Standard  exterior features include automatic LED exterior lighting, power-folding and  auto-dimming mirrors, automatic wipers, windshield wiper de-icers, running  boards, a tow hitch and a power-operated liftgate. </p>, <p>Electronic  driver aids include standard forward collision warning with pedestrian  detection and automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert systems, lane departure warning, full-speed adaptive cruise  control, driver inattention warning, an automatic parking system, multiview  parking cameras, and Lexus Enform Safety Connect emergency communications. </p>, <p>Interior  comfort and convenience features include a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry,  four-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated  front seats, power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat memory settings, a  40/20/40-split second-row seat (folding, reclining, power-sliding and heated),  and a 50/50-split third-row seat that folds up against the cargo area sides  (power-operated).</p>, <p>Infotainment  features includes the Lexus Remote Touch interface (a 12.3-inch center display  with center console mouselike controller), a navigation system, Bluetooth, a  USB port, Lexus Enform infotainment smartphone app suite, and a nine-speaker  sound system.</p>, <p>Optional  features include 21-inch wheels, a head-up display, Lexus Enform Remote  (smartphone vehicle controls), a wireless smartphone charger, a refrigerated  coolbox under the front center armrest and a 19-speaker Mark Levinson sound  system. There's also an optional rear-seat entertainment system (includes a  pair of displays mounted to the front seatbacks) and a Luxury package that adds  heated and ventilated second-row seats and upgraded leather upholstery with  contrasting stitching.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus NX 300 is the new name for what used to be called the NX 200t. There  are a few minor differences, but overall it's the same vehicle. That means  you're getting a small luxury crossover with mini-RX 350 styling and a  comfortable around-town demeanor. Buyers will enjoy comfortable seating, a  quiet interior and a suitably powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine. </p>, <p>There  are a few drawbacks. Rear cargo space is limited due to the steeply sloped rear  window. Also, Lexus' Remote Touch infotainment interface may leave some drivers  frustrated because of its attention-sapping nature. Overall, though, the NX 300  should appeal to shoppers seeking a refined and comfortable luxury crossover.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus NX 300 is a five-passenger compact SUV  available in a two trim levels. The NX 300h hybrid is reviewed separately. It  comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (235  horsepower, 258 pound-feet) and a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel  drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment includes 17-inch wheels, LED headlights,  LED foglights and running lights, keyless ignition and entry, automatic  dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable front seats, simulated-leather upholstery  (Lexus' NuLuxe), a 60/40-split folding and reclining back seat, a 8-inch  infotainment display with a touchpad interface, and an eight-speaker sound  system.</p>, <p>Also included is adaptive cruise control, forward collision  warning and mitigation, lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic  high beams.</p>, <p>The NX 200t F Sport version adds 18-inch wheels, special  exterior styling elements, a sport-tuned suspension, special interior trim and  NuLuxe color schemes, more aggressively bolstered seats, different gauges and a  sport steering wheel.</p>, <p>Other packages are also available, but their availability  can vary by region, so you'll want to check with your local dealer. The Comfort  package includes heated and ventilated front seats and blind-spot monitoring.  To that package, the Premium package adds 18-inch wheels, a sunroof,  driver-seat memory settings and a power-adjustable steering wheel.</p>, <p>The Luxury package bundles the above options with automatic  wipers, a heated steering wheel and leather upholstery. There's also a  Navigation package with a larger 10.3-inch screen and a premium sound system. </p>, <p>Additional options include front and rear parking sensors, a  power liftgate, upgraded LED headlights and adaptive suspension dampers (F  Sport only).</p>]

[<p>Despite its aggressive styling, this  hybrid is an even more sensible-shoes compact SUV than the NX 300 upon which it  is based. It retains the visual attitude of its stablemate while delivering  even better fuel economy.</p>, <p>Entering its fourth model year, the Lexus  NX 300h compact SUV receives only minor changes for 2018. You can expect a  quiet, pleasant driving experience even if the outside world thinks you're  making a shouty statement. </p>, <p>With less power and slightly more weight  to haul around than the regular NX 300, the hybrid NX won't pin you to the seat  with authority. But the thrust of the NX hybrid is perfectly adequate around  town, moving it away from stoplights on a bump of electrically augmented  torque. Plus, that aforementioned seat is a well-padded and comfortable place  from which to spend long stints behind the wheel. </p>, <p>Hybrid versions of conventional vehicles  often suffer reduced cargo volume resulting from the need to package the large  hybrid battery. In the case of the NX hybrid, this penalty is modest. However,  the NX doesn't have a large cargo area to begin with. It's one of just two  notable downsides to the NX 300h. The other is its infotainment interface,  which can be distracting to use.</p>, <p>Overall, though, we like the NX 300h and  think it's a smart choice for luxury crossover SUV shoppers wanting a pleasing  mix of luxury, fuel economy and style.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus NX 300h is a five-seat compact hybrid SUV, available in just one  version. Its 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and hybrid system deliver a  combined power of 194 hp. It is available only with all-wheel drive and a  continuously variable automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment includes 17-inch wheels, LED headlights,  LED foglights and running lights, keyless ignition and entry, automatic  dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable front seats, simulated-leather  upholstery (Lexus' NuLuxe), a 60/40-split folding and reclining back seat, a  8-inch infotainment display with a touchpad interface, and an eight-speaker  sound system.</p>, <p>Also included is adaptive cruise control, forward collision  warning and mitigation, lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic  high beams. </p>, <p>Available  option packages help buyers get the most out of their NX. The Navigation  package, for example, comes with a larger 10.3-inch display, Enform Destination  Assist, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a 10-speaker audio system. A Comfort  package includes heated and ventilated front seats, blind-spot monitoring and  auto-dimming side mirrors. The Premium package includes the items from the  Comfort package and adds a sunroof, driver-seat memory settings, 18-inch  wheels, a power-adjustable steering wheel, and enhanced LED daytime running  lights with integrated turn signals. Finally, a Luxury package combines what  you get from the Premium package and adds leather seating surfaces, wood  interior pieces, automatic wipers and a heated leather steering wheel.</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include a hands-free liftgate, parking sensors, adaptive headlights and  even power-folding rear seats.</p>]

It's a  fine companion for both commuting and long-distance driving, and it offers  all-wheel drive for enhanced traction in wet or snowy conditions. Beyond that,  though, there's not much that we can point to as obvious RC 300 advantages. </p>, <p>Unlike  other cars in this class, the RC 300 offers only modest performance. With an  estimated 0-60 mph acceleration time of 7.3 seconds, the standard RC 300 with  its turbocharged four-cylinder engine lacks pep. The V6-powered,  all-wheel-drive RC 300 can do the sprint to 60 mph in a more respectable 6.3  seconds. But at that point you might as well get the even more powerful  311-horsepower RC 350. Whichever powertrain you pick, the RC's handling is  dulled by the car's beefy curb weight and its infotainment system disappoints.</p>, <p>The  2018 Lexus RC 300 wins some points for its smooth and quiet road manners.

[<p>As high-performance coupes go, the 2018  Lexus RC F is not among the best. The main issue with the Lexus RC F is its  hefty curb weight: It's hundreds of pounds heavier than its competitors, which  keeps it from being as energetic or agile. It just doesn't feel like the performance  machine you might expect from its looks and the sweet-sounding 5.0-liter V8  firing away behind that Lexus grille. </p>, <p>But if all you want is a boldly styled  luxury coupe with a big V8 engine, the RC F could be pretty appealing. That's  especially true this year since it now comes with an adaptive suspension that  should provide a smoother ride quality than previous RC Fs.

[<p>The  2018 Lexus RX 350 is one of our top recommendations for a luxury crossover SUV.  Chief among the RX's appealing qualities is its overall quality. From the  premium materials in the cabin to the comfortable seats to the solid  construction, the RX gives you the impression the Lexus paid attention to the  details. A smooth ride, an easy-to-drive nature and a long list of standard  features for a relatively affordable price round out the RX 350's appeal.</p>, <p>The  RX 350 isn't without a few flaws. The infotainment interface is often  distracting to use and is a big letdown when compared to user-friendly rival  systems from Audi and BMW. The RX 350 is a little short on cargo space for  larger families, too. (Interestingly, Lexus has introduced the roomier  three-row <a href="/lexus/rx-350l/2018/suv/">350 L</a> this year to help out.) Overall,  though, the 2018 RX 350 will be a great choice if you're shopping for a  five-passenger luxury crossover.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus RX 350 is a five-passenger luxury crossover available in <strong>base </strong>and <strong>F Sport </strong>versions. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>base RX 350</strong> comes with a 3.5-liter  V6 engine (295 horsepower, 267 pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed automatic  transmission and front-wheel drive.

It's equipped  with 18-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights (with automatic high beams), rear  privacy glass, a power liftgate, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone  automatic climate control, simulated leather upholstery, power-adjustable front  seats, a power-adjustable steering wheel, a 40/20/40-split rear seat and a rear  cargo cover. </p>, <p>Also  standard is a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, Safety Connect  emergency communications, a suite of drive safety aids (the Safety System+  package, including lane departure warning and intervention as well as forward  collision warning and mitigation with automatic emergency braking), Bluetooth,  an 8-inch display screen, a smartphone-integrated navigation system and a  nine-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>The <strong>F Sport</strong> is our pick in the RX  lineup, and it includes sportier exterior styling, 20-inch wheels, adaptive  suspension dampers, enhanced engine sound, transmission paddle shifters, unique  gauges, heated and ventilated sport seats, leather upholstery and unique  interior trim. The F Sport is also available with all-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Options  are generally grouped into packages with the RX, but there are a few  stand-alone items, too, and availability can depend on the trim level and  region in which you live.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium </strong>package is available on  non-F Sport models and adds roof rails, auto-dimming side mirrors, automatic  wipers, driver-seat memory functions, leather upholstery, wood trim and a rear  armrest storage compartment. The <strong>Luxury </strong>package  (also only available on base RX models) includes the Premium package items and  adds heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, rear door  sunshades, upgraded leather upholstery, four-way lumbar adjustment for the  front seats, heated rear seats, power-folding and -reclining rear seatbacks,  and 20-inch wheels with your choice of color inserts.</p>, <p>The <strong>Navigation </strong>package adds a navigation  system, the Remote Touch tech interface, a larger 12.3-inch display, voice  controls, the Lexus Enform App Suite and a 12-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Other  options include a blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and  automated braking, a panoramic-view backup camera, either a regular or a  panoramic sunroof, a towing package (with an upgraded cooling system), front  and rear parking sensors, a hands-free liftgate, upgraded LED headlights (with  18 individual LED accent lights), a color head-up display, a heated steering  wheel and a 15-speaker Mark Levinson sound system.</p>]

In years past, shoppers  needing something with a third row had to look at one of Lexus' traditional  SUVs, like the LX 570, or shop a different luxury brand entirely. But that  changes with this year's stretched-out 2018 Lexus RX 350L. </p>, <p>The  2018 RX 350L is essentially a carbon copy of its two-row sibling, with almost  all of the same standard and optional equipment and with many of the same  virtues. That means high-quality materials, a quiet interior and excellent  build quality. The main difference is the additional third-row seat.</p>, <p>Lexus  was able to fit the third row by making the RX 350L 4.4 inches longer than the  regular RX 350. That length is all in the back of the vehicle, however; Lexus  chose to keep the wheelbase of the RX 350L (the length between the front and  rear wheels) the same as the standard RX's. This choice results in both  positives and negatives relative to other three-row crossover SUVs.</p>, <p>On  the upside, expect the same easy-to-drive nature with the RX 350L. It's not a  lumbering beast like Lexus' LX 570 SUV. But the retained wheelbase means Lexus  had only so much interior space to squeeze in a third row. Third-row seating is  cramped, and adults will have a very difficult time fitting back there. The  addition of the third row has also reduced legroom in both the first and second  row, and there's only a minimal amount of increased cargo space. </p>, <p>No doubt the 2018 RX 350L, and its hybrid sibling, the RX 450hL, will be very  appealing if you've always wanted an RX with the ability to occasionally take  on a couple of extra passengers. But for a more dedicated family hauler in the  luxury class, you'll likely be more satisfied with one of the RX L's three-row  competitors such as the Acura MDX or Volvo XC90. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus RX 350L is a  three-row luxury crossover available in <strong>base </strong>and <strong>Luxury</strong> versions. Each comes  standard with seven seats, but the second-row bench seat can be switched out  for optional captain's chairs, reducing seating capacity to six passengers.  Both come standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (290 horsepower, 263 pound-feet  of torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.  All-wheel drive is optional. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>base</strong> 350L model comes with 18-inch  wheels, automatic LED headlights and high beams, LED foglights and running  lights, rear privacy glass, keyless ignition and entry, tri-zone automatic  climate control, leather upholstery, eight-way power-adjustable front seats, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, a 40/20/40-split rear seat and a power-folding  third-row seat. </p>, <p>Other  standard equipment includes a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, Safety  Connect emergency communications, a suite of drive safety aids (the Safety  System+ package, including lane departure warning and intervention, and forward  collision warning and mitigation with automatic emergency braking), Bluetooth,  an 8-inch display screen, a smartphone-integrated navigation system and a  nine-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>The  Premium package adds roof rails, a sunroof, auto-dimming side mirrors,  automatic wipers, driver-seat memory functions, wood trim and a rear-armrest  storage compartment. The Navigation package pads on an integrated navigation  system, the Remote Touch tech interface, a larger 12.3-inch display, voice  controls, the Lexus Enform App Suite and a 12-speaker sound system. The  Navigation package is also available with a 15-speaker Mark Levinson sound  system. </p>, <p>The <strong>Luxury </strong>trim level (also referred to  as the Luxury package) includes all the base equipment plus the contents of the  Premium package, along with 20-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats,  a heated steering wheel, rear door sunshades, upgraded leather upholstery,  four-way lumbar adjustment for the front seats, and heated second-row seats. </p>, <p>Other  options include a Cold Weather package, second-row captain's chairs, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and automated braking, a  panoramic-view backup camera, front and rear parking sensors, a hands-free  liftgate, upgraded LED headlights (with 18 individual LED accent lights), and a  color head-up display.</p>]

[<p>A strong road presence, unparalleled  passenger comfort and a practical amount of storage space are absolute  requirements for any luxury SUV maker. Environmental friendliness is often an  afterthought, or at least not a priority. This isn't the case with the 2018  Lexus RX 450h, the hybrid variant of the massively successful RX 350 crossover.  Not only is the 450h quicker and more efficient than its gas-only sibling, its  price point is lower than it has been in years.</p>, <p>One of our primary complaints against the  RX 450h in the past was its high price tag relative to the standard RX 350.  Part of that was due to the 450h's substantial list of standard features, which  was far more robust than the base 350's equipment roster. That changes for  2018; the 450h loses some luxuries in exchange for a lower base price, so it  doesn't cost a fortune if you just want the hybrid powertrain. You can always  put these features back in through a combination of packages and stand-alone  options.</p>, <p>Like other Lexus vehicles, the RX 450h  boasts high-quality interior appointments, a quiet ride and exceptional  everyday livability. Also like other Lexus models, the mouselike controller for  the infotainment interface is exceptionally difficult to use — take  it for an extensive test run before you commit to buying the car. Other than  that, the 2018 Lexus RX 450h is as solid as they come, and should be a top  choice for luxury SUV buyers in the market for a fuel-efficient people mover.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lexus RX 450h is a five-passenger midsize luxury SUV. Although there is  officially only one <strong>base </strong>trim level,  the <strong>F Sport</strong> package deserves a  special mention, as it drastically changes the character of the SUV. It  features different styling, an upgraded suspension and a lower ride height.  Otherwise, both the regular and F Sport versions of the RX 450h come well  equipped and are available with the same option packages. Just keep in mind  that the availability of those options can vary based on the region of the  country you live in.</p>]

[<p>Every  RX 450h is all-wheel drive, powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine and three electric  motor-generators (one on each front wheel and one controlling the rears). The  power unit's combined 308 horsepower is routed through a continuously variable  automatic transmission. </p>, <p>Standard  equipment highlights for the <strong>base </strong>RX  450h include 18-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting (headlights, foglights,  taillights and running lights), automatic high beams, automatic wipers, heated  mirrors, a power liftgate, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, forward  collision warning and automatic braking, lane departure warning and  intervention, and keyless ignition and entry. </p>, <p>Inside,  the RX includes an auto-dimming rearview mirror, dual-zone automatic climate  control, synthetic leather upholstery, 10-way power front seats, a power-adjustable  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a 40/20/40-split rear seat (reclines,  slides and folds) and a cargo cover. Tech features include the Remote Touch  interface, an 8-inch color display, Safety Connect emergency communications,  voice controls, Bluetooth connectivity, and a 12-speaker sound system with HD  and satellite radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>The <strong>F Sport</strong> package adds sportier  exterior styling, 20-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers, a lower ride  height, an engine noise enhancer, special gauges, heated and ventilated sport  seats, a heated sport steering wheel and special interior trim.</p>, <p>There  are a number of notable packages available for the RX 450h, whether you stick  with the base model or check the box for the F Sport. These include the <strong>Cold Area </strong>(a windshield wiper de-icer,  auto-leveling headlights, headlight washers and a heavy-duty heater), <strong>Premium </strong>(auto-dimming and power-folding  mirrors, driver-seat memory settings and leather upholstery) and <strong>Luxury </strong>(20-inch wheels, a  wood-and-leather-wrapped steering wheel, ambient lighting, rear sunshades and  upgraded leather upholstery) packages. A <strong>Towing </strong>package is also available, adding a heavy-duty alternator, radiator and  transmission oil cooler. </p>, <p>There  are numerous stand-alone options, some of which require adding one or a few of  the aforementioned packages. Options include a color head-up display, a  panoramic sunroof, power-folding and heated rear seats, a hands-free liftgate,  upgraded LED headlights, a 12.3-inch central display (bundled with a navigation  system) and a 15-speaker Mark Levinson sound system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Lexus RX 450h F Sport</strong> (3.5L  V6 hybrid | CVT automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current RX 450h has received some revisions,  including new safety equipment added in 2017 and the deletion of some standard  features in 2018. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's RX  450h.</p>]

[<p>The  Lexus RX has long been known for its excellent build quality, easy handling,  quiet interior and reliability. What it hasn't been known for, though, is being  able to seat more than five people. But that changes with the new 2018 Lexus RX  450hL. Like its similarly new sibling, the RX 350L, the RX 450hL has a longer  body and an extra row of seats.</p>, <p>Those  extra seats aren't very roomy, though. Even with the second-row seats slid all  the way forward, there's barely enough room for an average-size adult. Also,  while you get more cargo space in this L version compared to the regular RX,  it's not dramatically more. Then again, Lexus doesn't intend the 450hL to be a  massive family taxi. It's more for people who want a vehicle that can provide  occasional seating for a couple extra kids without costing a whole lot or being  a lumbering beast to drive.</p>, <p>On  that front, the 2018 Lexus RX 450hL succeeds. It drives much like the regular  RX, too, providing quiet and care-free motoring. Being the hybrid version of  the RX family, it's also impressively fuel-efficient. It gets 29 mpg combined,  which is just 1 mpg less than the regular 450h.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lexus RX 450hL is a six- or  seven-passenger midsize hybrid SUV that comes with three rows of seating and  all-wheel drive. It uses a 3.5-liter V6 engine that works with a pair of  front-mounted electric motor/generators through a continuously variable  automatic transmission to drive the front wheels, while a third electric motor  powers the rear wheels. Total system output is 308 horsepower.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment highlights for the  base RX 450hL include 18-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting (headlights,  foglights, taillights and running lights), automatic high beams, automatic  wipers, a power liftgate, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, forward  collision warning and automatic braking, lane departure warning and  intervention, a sunroof, and keyless ignition and entry. Inside, the RX comes  with dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, power-adjustable  front seats, a power-adjustable steering wheel, and a power-folding 50/50-split  third-row seat.</p>, <p>Standard tech features include the Remote  Touch interface, a 8-inch display, Safety Connect emergency communications,  Bluetooth and a 10-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>The RX 450hL's Luxury<strong> </strong>trim level (which can also be considered a package) adds 20-inch  wheels, rear side sunshades, LED ambient lighting, illuminated doorsills,  auto-dimming and power-folding side mirrors, a heated wood steering wheel,  perforated-leather seating surfaces, and front-seat power lumbar and  thigh-extension adjustments.</p>, <p>A Premium package adds wood interior  trim, driver-seat memory settings, auto-dimming and folding side mirrors, and a  storage compartment in the rear armrest.</p>, <p>Like other RX models, a package bundling  navigation with a Mark Levinson premium audio system is available. It includes  a 15-speaker surround-sound system plus a 12.3-inch display, Enform smartphone  connectivity, and a climate-control smog sensor. </p>, <p>An optional Cold Weather package includes  a windshield wiper de-icer, an upgraded interior heater with quicker warm-up  time, auto-leveling headlamps and headlamp washers, and automatic wipers. </p>, <p>Stand-alone options include a color  head-up display, a hands-free liftgate, upgraded LED headlights, a  surround-view camera system, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert  (includes automatic braking), front and rear parking sensors, 60/40-split  folding second-row seats, and heated and ventilated front seats.</p>]

[<p>The Continental nameplate has a lot of  history for Lincoln. At its inception in the 1930s, it was intended to emulate  the sleeker European design language of the day. While the 2018 Lincoln  Continental is a far cry from the curvaceous coupe of the art deco era, its  mission remains much the same: compete with European rivals. </p>, <p>Lincoln introduced its new Continental  just last year. The result is an undeniably handsome car with expansive rear  legroom, a full suite of optional technology upgrades and a quiet, comfortable  interior. Unfortunately, the Continental straddles a price range where it has  trouble competing. In lower trims, the rather unimpressive standard engine and  lack of certain standard features make the Continental a slightly less  appealing value. In higher trims — which can get up to almost double  the Continental's base price, at least from an as-new MSRP perspective  — the Lincoln is priced against some of the best luxury sedans on the  market, and simply can't match their refinement. </p>, <p>In its absolute base trim, the  Continental faces pressure from downmarket options that are fully loaded. Cars such as the Buick LaCrosse, Kia Cadenza or Toyota Avalon offer similar comfort and  quiet (although less presence), and significantly more content for the money.  Other luxury marques avoid this sort of comparison thanks to their higher  starting prices and distinct driving dynamics, but the base Continental is  priced similarly and features a similar powertrain and similar performance  numbers to these near-luxury full-size sedans.</p>, <p>Loaded up with all the bells and  whistles, the Continental is priced against heavy hitters like the Audi A6, BMW  5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. While you're getting the upgraded engine  and more rear-seat room with the Continental, all three of the Germans offer  similar acceleration from their base engines, and all three still offer  generous rear passenger space. Moreover, the Continental simply can't match the  execution of the Germans' technology, or the level of refinement and engagement  found in their driving experiences. Even the Genesis G90, Hyundai's recent  luxury spinoff, is a more refined luxury car that competes directly with the  Continental in terms of rear passenger space and comfort, and offers more room  up front for the driver. </p>, <p>Standing next to the 2018 Continental,  it's easy to see its appeal. It's a car that makes an impression, and the  experience of sitting in and driving the Continental is one of comfort and  authority. The problem is that in choosing the Continental, you have to accept  that you're going to get a little less for your money than what competitors  have to offer.</p>]

[<p>Three  engines are available for the Continental. The base engine is a 3.7-liter V6  (305 hp, 280 lb-ft of torque), which comes standard on the Premiere and Select  trims. A turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 (335 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) is optional on  the Select and standard on the Reserve and Black Label Trims. Both engines are  paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and can be had in either  front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive configurations.</p>]

[<p>The  third engine option is a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (400 hp, 400 lb-ft of  torque) that's optional on the Reserve and Black Label trims. To manage this  engine's power, Lincoln bundles it with a torque-vectoring AWD system. This  engine also uses a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Beyond  the 3.7-liter V6, the <strong>Premiere</strong> trim  receives 18-inch alloy wheels, LED daytime running lights and taillights,  power-folding side mirrors (driver-side auto dimming), front and rear parking  sensors, a rearview camera, automatic headlights, hill-start assist, adaptive  suspension and steering, and keyless entry. </p>, <p>Inside,  you get dual-zone climate control with a rear-seat air vents, heated 10-way  power-adjustable driver and passenger seats, simulated leather upholstery, a  60/40-split folding rear bench and push-button start. Infotainment duties are  handled by Ford's Sync 3 system, which comes with an 8-inch touchscreen  interface, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, satellite radio, two USB  ports, and a 10-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>The  base Premiere also comes with Lincoln Connect, which allows you to use an app  to remotely start the car, lock and unlock it, or locate it via GPS, among  other features. </p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>Select</strong> trim adds 19-inch  wheels, power-operated soft-close doors, a hands-free trunklid opener, leather  upholstery and rear-seat USB ports. Beyond the engine choices, several options  packages are available. </p>, <p>The  Climate Package adds automatic high beams, automatic wipers, a windshield-wiper  de-icer, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated rear seats and a heated  steering wheel. The Technology package includes the auto wipers, windshield  wiper de-icer and auto-dimming rearview mirror, as well as a head-up display  and a suite of driver aids: a top-down parking camera system, adaptive cruise  control, lane departure warning and intervention, and forward-collision warning  with automatic emergency braking. Blind-spot monitoring is a stand-alone  option.</p>, <p>Other  options include navigation, a 13-speaker Revel stereo, Lincoln's 30-way  power-adjustable "Perfect Position" seats, 20-inch wheels and a  panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>The  Continental's <strong>Reserve</strong> trim, on top  of starting with the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6, gets blind-spot monitoring, the  13-speaker Revel stereo and navigation standard. It also upgrades to 24-way  power-adjustable front seats that are heated and ventilated, three-zone  automatic climate control with separate rear-seat controls, and a power  rear-window sunshade.</p>, <p>The  Climate and Technology packages are available for the Reserve, as are two more  major packages. The Rear Seat package adds upgraded outboard rear seating  (four-way power lumbar, reclining, heating and ventilation), rear side-window  sunshades and the panoramic sunroof. The Luxury package adds LED headlights,  upgrades the stereo to Revel's 19-speaker system and adds a CD player. The  sunroof, 30-way power-adjustable front seats and 20-inch wheels are available  as stand-alone options.</p>, <p>At  the top of the range, and nearly doubling the Premiere's starting price, is the  Continental <strong>Black Label</strong>. This trim  comes standard with 20-inch wheels, the panoramic moonroof and both the Luxury  and Technology packages. It also benefits from unique interior trims that  combine bold colors and trims with lots of extra premium materials draped over  many of the interior plastics. The 30-way seats and Technology and Climate  packages are available as upgrades.</p>, <p>Buying  a Black Label car also gets the buyer access to Lincoln's lifestyle and  concierge service. Lincoln will wash your car for free, pick it up from you for  service and book you reservations (and even buy you a dinner), among other  services. Black Label Continentals are also covered by a four-year/50,000-mile  that covers services and wear items.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Lincoln Continental Reserve</strong> (turbo 3.0L V6 | 6-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Lincoln Continental has received  only minor revisions. Our findings remain applicable to this year's Lincoln  Continental.</p>]

[<p>The  Lincoln MKC likely doesn't come first to mind for a lot of shoppers. It's only  been out for a few years, and it's only recently that Lincoln has been making  more of an effort to raise the quality of its vehicles and perceived brand cachet.  But take a look and you could very well be impressed with what Lincoln has  cooked up.</p>, <p>The  basics are certainly covered well in the 2018 MKC. It offers a quiet cabin, a  smooth ride quality and extensive list of standard features. The MKC is less  expensive than many rival crossovers, too. Comfortable and affordable  — for a lot of crossover SUV shoppers, that's going to be an  appealing combination.</p>, <p>Dig  deeper, however, and you'll find the MKC isn't as polished as some rival  crossovers. The MKC's back seat and cargo area are small, and some of the  interior materials don't look or feel very high-quality. Performance is a  little disappointing even though the MKC's power output looks good on the spec  sheet. We're also disappointed that Lincoln restricts the availability of the  MKC's advanced driver aids, such as forward collision warning and mitigation,  to the most expensive trim levels. </p>, <p>As  such, our opinion of the 2018 Lincoln MKC is mixed. It's certainly likable, but  we recommend shopping around some before making a final decision.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lincoln MKC is a five-passenger compact luxury SUV available in four  trims/equipment groups. The base trim, <strong>Premiere</strong>,  still offers competitive technology features. The <strong>Select</strong> trim adds convenience features, while <strong>Reserve </strong>and <strong>Black Label</strong> increase luxury and post-sales support. Standard on all trims is a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder (240 horsepower, 270 pound-feet of torque) mated to a  six-speed automatic and front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional, as is a  turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder (285 hp, 305 lb-ft) that is available only  on Select, Reserve and Black Label trims.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment highlights on the MKC <strong>Premiere </strong>include 18-inch wheels, automatic xenon headlights, a power liftgate,  heated mirrors, rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, keyless ignition and  entry, remote start, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery,  heated power-adjustable front seats (eight-way driver seat with four-way lumbar  control, and four-way passenger), driver-seat memory functions, and a 60/40-split  reclining and folding back seat. Standard technology features include the Sync  3 infotainment interface, an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto, Bluetooth, Lincoln Connect (with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot), two USB ports  and a nine-speaker sound system with satellite radio.</p>, <p>The MKC <strong>Select </strong>includes auto-dimming  and power-folding mirrors, an eight-way power passenger seat, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, ambient interior light, a cargo cover and  upgraded leather on the seats and steering wheel. Options include a panoramic  sunroof and the Select Plus package (a navigation system and a blind-spot  warning system).</p>, <p>The MKC <strong>Reserve </strong>has those Select  options and a hands-free liftgate, ventilated front seats and an onboard  modem that allows for remote functions. Nineteen- and 20-inch wheels are also  available.</p>, <p>The MKC <strong>Black Label </strong>adds to the  Reserve equipment 19-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers (optional on  Select and Reserve), upgraded leather upholstery, extended leather interior  trim, a simulated suede headliner, unique exterior and interior trim, and  special color choices.</p>, <p>The Select, Reserve and Black Label can also be equipped with an optional  14-speaker THX II sound system and the Climate package (heated rear seats and  steering wheel, automatic high beams, automatic wipers and a wiper de-icer).</p>, <p>The Reserve and Black Label can be equipped with the Technology package, which  adds adaptive cruise control, a forward collision warning and mitigation  system, lane departure warning and intervention, and an automatic parking  system.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lincoln  MKT has some appeal in its distinctive design, appealing list of features and  strong available turbocharged V6 engine. But its dated overall design holds it  back from being a truly desirable pick for a luxury crossover.</p>, <p>Not  surprisingly, it's the same story with the Ford Flex on which the MKT is based.  Both have been on the market for more than seven years without a significant  redesign, which might as well be an eternity for the typical passenger vehicle.  The luxury-oriented MKT is further hampered by its sloping roofline that  reduces cargo space and third-row headroom compared to the boxier Flex.</p>, <p>If you're  shopping for a three-row luxury crossover SUV we think you'll be happier with  just about any of the MKT's rivals. Even some non-luxury models have surpassed  it in terms of features and refinement.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Lincoln MKT is a large luxury crossover wagon with three rows of seats. It's  offered in two trim levels: <strong>Premiere</strong> and <strong>Reserve</strong>. Seven-passenger seating  is standard, but optional second-row captain's chairs reduce capacity to six.  The MKT Premiere has a 3.7-liter V6 (303 horsepower, 278 pound-feet of torque),  and the MKT Reserve gets a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 (365 hp, 350 lb-ft of  torque). Both have a six-speed automatic transmission. We like the added power  of the Reserve, but either way you'll be getting plenty of standard features. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>Premiere</strong>, which is front-wheel-drive  only, comes with features such as 19-inch alloy wheels, adaptive xenon  headlights, automatic wipers, keyless ignition and entry, remote engine start,  a fixed glass sunroof, rear parking sensors, a power liftgate and a rearview  camera. Inside, you'll find tri-zone automatic climate control, leather  upholstery, heated and ventilated power front seats, 60/40-split folding  second-row seats with heating (outboard only), 50/50-split folding third-row  seats, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, driver-seat memory settings  and retractable manual second-row sunshades. Technology features include the  Sync 3 infotainment system, an 8-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity,  Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone app integration, and a 10-speaker  sound system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Reserve</strong> trim level is equipped  similarly but adds adaptive suspension dampers and standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With the  Reserve, you can also add extra optional features. We recommend the optional  Elite package, which provides a blind-spot monitoring system with rear  cross-traffic alert, power-folding third-row seats (including a tailgate  seating feature), a heated steering wheel, a navigation system and a 14-speaker  premium audio system. The optional Technology package (available only in  combination with the Elite package) includes adaptive cruise control, a forward  collision warning system, a lane departure warning and intervention system, and  an automatic parallel parking assist system.</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options for the Reserve model include 20-inch wheels, heated and ventilated  sliding second-row captain's chairs (reducing capacity from seven to six  passengers), a second-row refrigerator console (between the captain's chairs),  a panoramic power sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>]

[<p>Shopping for a luxury crossover  SUV? You might like the 2018 MKX. Lincoln redesigned the MKX a few years ago  with an eye toward quality and luxury. It offers a quiet interior and a lot of  features for a respectable price. </p>, <p>The  MKX is related to the Ford Edge SUV. There are many similarities, but overall  we like how Lincoln has upped the MKX's luxury credentials. It's quiet on the  highway, the seats are very comfortable, and the suspension ably soaks up bumps  and ruts. Essentially, the 2018 Lincoln MKX checks all the luxury SUV boxes. </p>, <p>It's  true that European SUVs have more prestige attached to them. But if you're  looking for a high-class way to transport your family, the MKX is a solid pick. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lincoln MKX is a five-passenger crossover SUV. It comes in four trim  levels: <strong>Premiere</strong>, <strong>Select</strong>, <strong>Reserve</strong> and <strong>Black Label</strong>.  Feature content grows as you work your way up the trim-level ladder, but the  MKX has a decent amount of equipment at the base level. </p>]

[<p>All  MKX models come standard with a 3.7-liter V6 (303 horsepower, 278 pound-feet of  torque) paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is  standard as well, with all-wheel drive optional. A turbocharged 2.7-liter V6  (335 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) is an optional upgrade offered on all four trims. </p>, <p>Standard  equipment highlights for the <strong>Premiere</strong> trim level include adaptive suspension dampers (all-wheel-drive models only),  18-inch wheels, xenon headlights, remote engine start, keyless ignition and entry,  dual-zone automatic climate control, simulated leather upholstery,  power-adjustable front seats, 60/40-split second-row seat with power-folding  seatbacks, driver-seat memory functions and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. </p>, <p>Standard  interior tech includes Lincoln's Sync 3 infotainment system with an 8-inch  touchscreen display, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility,  two USB ports, and a 10-speaker audio system with a CD player and satellite  radio.</p>, <p>The<strong> Select </strong>model adds LED daytime running  lights, power-folding side mirrors (with driver-side auto-dimming), a  hands-free liftgate, leather upholstery and a power tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel. </p>, <p>A  couple of optional packages available for the Select are worth considering. The  optional Select Plus package adds a navigation system plus blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems. The Climate package adds  heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, automatic windshield wipers and  automatic high beams. </p>, <p>The <strong>Reserve</strong> trim level adds 20-inch  wheels, adaptive headlights, a panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats,  mobile app compatibility and the contents of the Select Plus package.</p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Black Label</strong> variant builds upon  the Reserve's features with trim-specific 20-inch wheels, LED headlights,  upgraded leather upholstery, rear parking sensors, a simulated-suede headliner,  the contents of the Climate package and a 19-speaker Revel Ultima  surround-sound audio system with HD radio. Each Black Label MKX gets a choice  of three design themes (Indulgence, Modern Heritage and Thoroughbred), each of  which alters the trim and the color of the upholstery, headliner and carpeting.  This trim also grants access to Lincoln's Black Label program, which offers  vehicle maintenance, detailing and some travel perks.</p>, <p>The  Reserve and Black Label versions offer several separate packages, including  Technology (front parking sensors, a 360-degree camera system and automated  parallel parking), Driver Assistance (adaptive cruise control, adaptive steering,  lane keeping assist, forward collision warning and mitigation) and Luxury  (adaptive LED headlights and the Revel Ultima audio system).</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include 21-inch wheels, 22-way-adjustable front seats, a trailer tow  package, a 13-speaker Revel audio system (Select and Reserve), inflatable rear  seat belts, and a rear-seat video entertainment system with dual displays.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Lincoln MKX Black Label</strong> (turbo  2.7L V6 | 6-speed automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Lincoln MKX has received a few minor  revisions, including the upgrade to the newer, far better Sync 3 infotainment  system. Overall, our findings remain broadly applicable.</p>]

[<p>For  decades, American car shoppers have typically gravitated toward European and  Japanese brands for entry-level luxury sedans. Lincoln has been trying  to chip away at the market with the Ford Fusion-based MKZ for years now but  with limited success.</p>, <p>Last year, Lincoln restyled the MKZ's front end with a new look first  introduced by the brand's new Continental sedan. Available LED headlights and a  Jaguar-esque grille add character to the car's sleek lines. Lincoln also introduced  a new turbocharged V6 engine good for up to 400 horsepower, which is an  impressive output for this class of car. A base turbocharged four-cylinder  engine and the MKZ Hybrid continue to round out the MKZ's powertrain lineup.</p>, <p>Inside  are plenty of standard luxury features and the MKZ's Sync 3 infotainment  interface, which is quick and easy to use. In other aspects, however, you'll  find that the MKZ comes across as pretty average. Interior materials quality  isn't as rich as you'll find in other cars in this class, for example, and the  rear seat isn't particularly accommodating for adults. </p>, <p>If  you're shopping for a luxury sedan that gives you a lot of features for your  money, or if high fuel economy is a priority, we think the 2018 Lincoln MKZ is  worth checking out. Otherwise, you might find some rival luxury sedans are more  appealing overall. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Lincoln MKZ is available with three powertrains — a  four-cylinder, six-cylinder and hybrid — and four trims. The <strong>Premiere </strong>comes fairly well-equipped,  but go with the <strong>Select</strong> to get  additional interior and technology options. The <strong>Reserve</strong> offers the most flexibility with options and packages.  Finally, the <strong>Black Label</strong> is just as much  about ownership experience as a stand-alone a trim, providing owners with free  washes and a higher level of roadside assistance and maintenance.</p>]

[<p>For  all trims, a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four (245 hp, 275 lb-ft) is  standard, and is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel  drive. All-wheel drive is available as an option. For the Select, Reserve and  Black Label trims, a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (also with a six-speed  automatic) is optional, and can be equipped with front-wheel drive (350 hp, 400  lb-ft) or all-wheel drive (400 hp, 400 lb-ft). A hybrid powertrain is also  available, and uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine combined with an electric  motor to produce a combined 188 hp. </p>, <p>The <strong>Premiere </strong>base model comes  well-equipped with features such as 18-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension,  adaptive xenon headlights, heated mirrors, rear parking sensors, keyless entry  and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, simulated leather  upholstery, power-adjustable front seats with heating, driver-seat memory settings  and a 60/40-split folding rear seat with pass-through. Standard technology  features a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Lincoln's Sync 3 infotainment interface,  an 8-inch touchscreen display, Sync smartphone app integration, Android Auto  and Apple CarPlay, and an 11-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite  radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>Select </strong>model gets  you an auto-dimming driver-side mirror, leather upholstery, genuine wood trim,  front seats with four-way power lumbar adjustment, a power-adjustable steering wheel,  enhanced interior ambient lighting, a 110-volt household-style power outlet and  two rear-seat USB charging ports.</p>, <p>Optional for the Select is the Select Plus package, which adds a navigation  system, power trunklid, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The <strong>Reserve </strong>trim level has those  features as standard, plus 19-inch wheels, ventilated front seats and enhanced  connectivity functionality. A 14-speaker Revel audio system with HD radio  capability is also standard.</p>, <p>There's also the <strong>Black Label </strong>trim.  It comes equipped similarly to the Reserve but has an upgraded interior  (upgraded and extended leather upholstery and a simulated suede headliner, most  notably) and a choice of three unique themes. The Black Label also offers a  host of special services, including a mobile showroom, remote vehicle delivery,  pickup and drop-off of your car for service work, an extended premium  maintenance plan and more.</p>, <p>Most options are grouped into packages. The Climate package bundles automatic  high-beam control, automatic wipers, a windshield wiper de-icer, a heated  steering wheel and heated rear seats. The Technology package has adaptive  cruise control, a forward collision warning system with pre-collision assist,  lane departure warning and intervention, and an automated parking system (both  parallel and perpendicular parking). </p>, <p>The Reserve model can be had with a Luxury package that contains LED headlights  and a premium Revel Ultima audio system with 20 speakers and HD radio. There's  also a Driver's package with 19-inch polished alloy wheels, a sport-tuned  suspension, torque vectoring (with the turbo V6 and AWD), painted brake  calipers, multi-contour front seats, and distinctive interior and exterior trim  details. The Climate and Technology packages are available with the Reserve as well.</p>, <p>Major stand-alone options include the choice of 19-inch polished alloy wheels,  a traditional sunroof or a panoramic moonroof, a power rear sunshade and  inflatable rear safety belts.</p>]

[<p>Even  before its redesign, the Lincoln Navigator was one of our favorite luxury SUVs.  Capable of comfortably hauling plenty of people and cargo while also towing a  heavy load, the Navigator packed lots of versatility, even if it didn't have  quite the gravitas of some other rival SUVs. This year's Navigator, however,  should hold more sway with valet attendants.</p>, <p>Outside,  the Navigator has an entirely fresh and appealing new look. Up front, there's a  simultaneously sleek and massive grille and new LED headlights. Under the hood  is an impressive new powertrain. The Navigator is powered by a revised  turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that now cranks out a stout 450 horsepower. Putting  that power to the ground is a new 10-speed automatic transmission that replaces  last year's six-speed automatic. Ten speeds may seem like overkill, but you'll  hardly notice the shifting, and the additional gearing helps improve both  acceleration and fuel economy. </p>, <p>Inside,  the Navigator uses top-notch materials on every panel and offers updated, modern tech behind the infotainment screen and three rows of adult-size seating with a  massive amount of cargo space to back them up. As with other amply sized models  of this class, the Navigator isn't the easiest to drive in crowded urban areas,  but overall we think it will be one of the nicest luxury SUVs on the market for  2018. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Lincoln Navigator is available in four trim levels: <strong>Premiere</strong>, <strong>Select</strong>, <strong>Reserve</strong> and <strong>Black Label</strong>. All trims are powered by the same turbocharged  3.5-liter V6 (450 hp, 500 lb-ft) paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission.  Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional for the first  three trims; the Black Label gets 4WD as standard.</p>]

[<p>The base  Premiere trim level is standard wheelbase only, and the Select, Reserve and  Black Label models are all available in standard-wheelbase and  extended-wheelbase (Navigator L) sizes.</p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights on the <strong>Premiere</strong> include 20-inch wheels, LED headlights, a trailer towing package, front and  rear parking sensors, a power hands-free liftgate, keyless ignition and entry,  tri-zone automatic climate control, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, driver-seat memory settings, first- and second-row leather upholstery  (third-row vinyl), eight-way power front seats (with power lumbar adjustment  and heating), power-adjustable pedals, power-folding second-row captain's  chairs with heating, and a power-folding 60/40-split third-row bench. </p>, <p>Also included  is a configurable gauge cluster display, 10-inch touchscreen display with the  Sync 3 interface, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, six USB ports  throughout the cabin, voice controls, navigation, a rearview camera, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and a 14-speaker surround-sound audio  system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Select</strong> adds 22-inch wheels, adaptive  suspension dampers, power-folding running boards, upgraded leather upholstery,  a heated steering wheel, a surround-view parking camera system and a wireless  charging pad for personal devices. Just a bit further up the ladder is the <strong>Reserve </strong>trim that adds exterior welcome  lights, 24-way power-adjustable front seats (with ventilation), illuminated  seat belt buckles and a panoramic sunroof. </p>, <p>Optional  for both the Select and Reserve is the Technology package (adaptive cruise  control, forward collision mitigation with automatic braking, a head-up  display, lane departure warning and intervention, an automated parking system  and automatic high beams) and a Heavy Duty Trailer Tow package.</p>, <p>The <strong>Black Label</strong> Navigator adds the above  two option packages as standard plus additional chrome exterior trim, upgraded  leather upholstery, ambient interior lighting and a 20-speaker stereo system.</p>, <p>Some of  the upper trim level items are available as stand-alone or packaged options on  the lower trim levels. Other notable options include a rear-seat entertainment  system (with dual headrest-mounted displays) and 30-way front seats with  massage.</p>, <p>Both the  standard- and extended-wheelbase versions have three-row seating, with  captain's chairs in both the first and second rows. This places the Navigator's  standard seating capacity at seven passengers, but a three-person,  40/20/40-split second-row bench seat that increases seating capacity to eight  is available on the Premiere, Select and Reserve trims.</p>]

[<p>Available as a coupe or convertible, the  two-door, four-seat 2018 Maserati GranTurismo is best described as a grand  touring car. It occupies the center of a Venn diagram representing both luxury  and sport. Its interior boasts extended leather upholstery and other  high-quality materials while its engine, a 454-horsepower non-turbocharged V8,  comes from Ferrari. </p>, <p>The  GranTurismo, however, went on sale more than 10 years ago. It's received a few  updates over the years, including this year, but it still lacks the advanced  safety and assistance features you'll find on competitors. A lot of its  switchgear just looks old, and performance is also underwhelming. </p>, <p>There's  certainly some emotional appeal to the GranTurismo. It looks great and its V8  sounds amazing. But we don't think that's enough to overcome this model's  significant drawbacks. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Maserati GranTurismo is a two-door, four-seat coupe or convertible that's  available in two trim levels. The base <strong>Sport </strong>is more comfort-oriented, while the <strong>MC</strong>'s  firmer suspension and carbon-fiber trim give it a racier feel. Each version  features a 4.7-liter V8 (454 horsepower and 384 pound-feet of torque) and a  six-speed automatic transmission. The GranTurismo is only available in  rear-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>Sport</strong> has 20-inch wheels,  adaptive suspension dampers, adaptive xenon headlights, power-folding and  heated auto-dimming mirrors, and front and rear parking sensors. The interior  boasts leather upholstery, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, and a  rearview camera. The new 8.4-inch entertainment display offers Bluetooth,  navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, and satellite radio. The  standard Harman Kardon stereo plays through 10 speakers. </p>, <p>The <strong>MC</strong> starts where the Sport leaves  off. The biggest hardware change is a firmer nonadaptive suspension for  sportier handling. Other upgrades include MC-specific 20-inch wheels and  exterior trim, a carbon-fiber hood, and chrome exhaust tips. The interior gains  a microfiber suede headliner (coupe only), aluminum pedals, and the brand's  trident logo stitched into headrests. </p>, <p>Most  features that come standard on the MC, such as the fixed suspension and  carbon-fiber trim, are optional on the Sport as well. You can also opt for the  softer adaptive suspension on the MC if you prefer a smoother ride. Other  options include wheels, brake caliper colors and interior trim. </p>, <p>Though  the convertible models have different interior appointments, their features are  largely the same as the coupe's. Exceptions include the absence of the optional  fixed suspension for the Sport and the standard carbon-fiber hood for the MC,  though you can opt for the latter in a Trofeo appearance package. Convertible  models come standard with an automatically deploying roll bar.</p>]

[<p>Introduced  last year, the Levante brings the Maserati character to the world of large  luxury SUVs. Its distinctive design helps it stand out in parking lots and on  the road, and its engine plays the soundtrack of a thoroughbred, which is  appropriate considering some of its roots come from Ferrari.</p>, <p>The  Levante's extensive customization options include everything from the color of  the brake calipers to the leathers and materials inside. With a large  entertainment display, the interior looks the part, too. That is, unless you  recognize some of the buttons and switches borrowed from less expensive  vehicles. </p>, <p>Aside  from some downmarket switchgear, the Levante lacks the interior and cargo space  of its mainstream rivals. And as cool as the Ferrari link may sound, it means  the Levante's fuel economy trails the segment. But these aren't the reasons you  look for an SUV with a borderline exotic pedigree. In this regard, the  Levante's flair and exclusivity separate it from the crowd. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Maserati Levante comes in two variants that are defined by how much power  they have. Though both trim levels use a twin-turbocharged 3.0L V6, the one in  the base <strong>Levante</strong> has 345 horsepower,  while the <strong>Levante S</strong> offers 424 hp.  Regardless of output, each model comes with an eight-speed automatic and  all-wheel drive, which Maserati calls Q4. After deciding on power, you can  elect between either the GranLusso or GranSport option group. Both packages  cost the same, but the GranLusso adds luxury features, such as premium leather,  and the GranSport adds sporty features, such as shift paddles.</p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>Levante</strong> comes with a twin-turbo  3.0L V6 (345 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque), engine stop-start, an eight-speed  automatic, and all-wheel drive. Other mechanical standard items include a  driver-adjustable and adaptive air suspension, a limited-slip differential, and  hill descent control. The exterior shows automatic bi-xenon headlights with LED  daytime running lights, LED fog- and taillights, auto-dimming side and rearview  mirrors, chrome exterior trim, and a power liftgate. Inside, you'll find  piano-black plastic interior trim, leather upholstery, 12-way adjustable power  front seats with memory and heating, dual-zone climate control, three 12-volt  outlets (one per row), four USB outlets (two front, two rear), and 60/40-split  folding rear seats. The 8.4-inch entertainment display offers navigation,  satellite radio with a one-year subscription, and support for Android Auto and  Apple CarPlay. The standard 280-watt stereo plays through eight speakers.  Safety features include a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring, and front and  rear parking sensors. </p>, <p>Opting  for the GranLusso package adds a panoramic sunroof, metallic-finished roof  rails, bright chrome skid plates, additional body coloring to the exterior,  different 19-inch wheels, and black brake calipers. The interior receives  open-pore wood trim, premium leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, and a  heated and wood-lined steering wheel. The stereo is upgraded to 900 watts and  14 speakers. </p>, <p>The  GranSport also gains a panoramic sunroof, additional body-colored exterior  panels, and the stereo upgrade. Cosmetic upgrades include piano-black exterior  trim, 20-inch wheels, red brake calipers, and extended leather options. True to  its name, this package also adds shift paddles, 12-way power-adjustable seats  with larger bolsters, and a sport steering wheel and pedals. </p>, <p>The <strong>Levante S</strong> comes with a more powerful  version of the twin-turbo 3.0L V6 (424 hp and 428 lb-ft of torque), though it  retains the eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. Above the base model the  S also gains larger front brakes, shift paddles, a panoramic sunroof, and  extended leather options. The GranLusso package adds soft-close doors, while  the GranSport package retains the same features described above. </p>, <p>Most  features in the GranLusso and GranSport can be optioned à la carte  for either Levante. The last two packages to choose from are the Climate  package, which adds heated rear seats and windshield washer nozzles, and the  Driver Assistance Plus package, which includes adaptive cruise control with  stop and go, forward collision warning, traffic sign recognition, and a  surround-view camera system. This package also offers active lane keeping and  blind-spot assist, which can selectively apply the brakes to prevent unsafe  lane changes.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2017 Maserati Levante S</strong> (twin-turbo  3.0L V6 | 8-speed automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Levante has received some revisions,  including the addition of electric power steering and more standard safety  features. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Levante.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mazda 3 isn't the quickest car  in its class, but it is the best to drive. The Mazda 3 doesn't have the biggest  cargo capacity in its class either, but it will certainly hold a whole lot of  stuff. This is a clear case of the raw numbers not telling the entire story. </p>, <p>Inside and out, the Mazda 3 is  attractive, and plenty of elements give it a more upmarket appeal. On the road,  it's not just competent; it's actually entertaining and sporty to drive. Even  if you're not into performance, this translates to a feeling that the car will  respond to emergency maneuvers with confidence and ease.</p>, <p>In the competitive budget-conscious  compact sedan and hatchback class, the 2018 Mazda 3 is a rarity for exceeding  expectations and delivering far more than its price would suggest. We bore this  out in a yearlong test of this car's current generation as well as subsequent  evaluation of newer variants. You'd be remiss not to have it on your short  list.</p>]

[<p>The  five-passenger 2018 Mazda 3 is available as either a sedan or four-door  hatchback. Both body styles are offered in either <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong> or <strong>Grand Touring</strong> trims. </p>]

[<p>The  Sport trim is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (155 horsepower, 150  pound-feet of torque). The Touring and Grand Touring models get a 2.5-liter  engine (184 hp, 185 lb-ft). A six-speed manual transmission is standard for all  Mazda 3s, with a six-speed automatic available as an option.</p>, <p>Standard <strong>Sport</strong> trim features for the sedan  include 16-inch steel wheels, remote keyless entry, keyless ignition, a  60/40-split folding rear seat, Bluetooth, the Mazda Connect infotainment system  with a 7-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, low-speed forward collision warning  and automatic emergency braking, emergency telematics, and a six-speaker stereo  with two USB ports. The hatchback adds the upgrades of alloy wheels and a rear  spoiler. </p>, <p>The  sedan is eligible for the optional Preferred Equipment package that adds alloy  wheels, automatic headlights, automatic wipers, heated mirrors, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, upgraded upholstery and a rear-seat  armrest with cupholders. </p>, <p>The <strong>Touring</strong> trim includes all of the  above, along with 18-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry, dual-zone automatic  climate control, simulated leather upholstery, a six-way power driver seat and  heated front seats. </p>, <p>At  the top of the range, the <strong>Grand Touring</strong> model gains LED exterior lights (headlights, foglights and taillights); a sunroof;  a digital speedometer; an upgraded display in the instrument panel; leather  upholstery; a nine-speaker Bose surround-sound system; and satellite radio. To  this, the Premium Equipment package adds adaptive headlights, automatic high  beams, a heated steering wheel, paddle shifters (for the automatic  transmission), an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a navigation system, lane  departure warning and intervention, adaptive cruise control, forward collision  warning and braking for higher speeds, and a traffic sign reader.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mazda 6 aspires to more than mere family-sedan duties. Sure, it has a big  interior and competitive fuel economy, but on top of that it adds an upscale  design and a focus on driving enjoyment. The Mazda 6 has offered these attributes  for some time now, but Mazda is doubling down as other top automakers are  trying a similar approach.</p>, <p>For  2018, that means broad improvements to the Mazda, with refinements in how it  looks, drives and feels. A  new grille and standard LED headlights highlight the changes on the outside,  but it's only once you step into the cabin that the breadth of the revisions  becomes clear. The restyled dashboard trim and climate controls give the 6 a  more luxurious look. The seats have also been redesigned for better comfort and  higher-quality materials give this sedan a luxury-like vibe. Under the hood is  a newly optional turbocharged engine, which should complement the 6's already  sharp handling.</p>, <p>If  fuel economy is a concern, you should know that the 6's base engine comes up a  few mpg shy of its contemporaries. There is no hybrid variant, and all-wheel  drive is not available. Aside from these omissions, though, the 2018 Mazda 6's  upmarket style and enjoyable performance make it an excellent option for the  family who likes the experience of driving.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Mazda 6 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mazda 6 is a midsize family  sedan that's available in five trim levels. The base <strong>Sport</strong> is fairly bare in terms of features, but it comes in at a  reasonable price. The <strong>Touring</strong> and  the <strong>Grand Touring </strong>have the features  most shoppers would want, and the latter includes a more powerful engine. For a  more premium experience, consider the <strong>Grand  Touring Reserve </strong>or the <strong>Signature</strong>,  which come with more attractive exterior trimmings, higher-quality materials  and even more features.</p>]

[<p>The  entry-level <strong>Sport </strong>starts with a  2.5-liter four-cylinder (187 horsepower, 186 pound-feet of torque) and a  six-speed manual transmission. (A six-speed automatic is optional.) Standard  equipment includes 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, push-button start,  60/40-split folding rear seats, non-illuminated vanity mirrors, and a  leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>, <p>An  8-inch entertainment touchscreen includes Bluetooth, one USB port and a  six-speaker sound system. Standard safety features include blind-spot  monitoring, a rearview camera, and rear cross-traffic alert. </p>, <p>Advanced  safety and driver assistance features are available in the optional  i-Activsense package, which includes forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning and lane  keeping assist. </p>, <p>It's  worthwhile to step up to the <strong>Touring</strong> trim, which adds features throughout the vehicle. A six-speed automatic is  standard, as are 19-inch wheels, proximity keyless entry, automatic wipers,  automatic high-beams, simulated leather upholstery, heated front seats, a  power-adjustable driver seat, illuminated vanity mirrors and a sunroof. Rear  passengers get additional vents in the center console and a center armrest with  two USB charging ports. The safety features of the i-Activsense package are  standard with the Touring, too. </p>, <p>The <strong>Grand Touring</strong> starts where the  Touring leaves off, but it adds the turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine  (250 hp, 310 lb-ft of torque) and the six-speed automatic. The infotainment  system gets more power, too, with the addition of an 11-speaker stereo,  satellite radio and navigation. </p>, <p>You  can tell the <strong>Grand Touring Reserve</strong> apart by its upgraded LED lighting and the addition of a rear spoiler. Comfort  improvements for the driver include a heated steering wheel, a power-adjustable  front passenger seat, and driver-seat memory settings. There's leather seating  for everyone else, along with ventilation for the front row and heating for the  rear. Above the gauge cluster sits a transparent panel that works like a  head-up display, showing information such as traffic signs and your current  speed. This trim also has adaptive front lighting, which turns the low beams in  conjunction with the steering wheel to improve visibility at night. </p>, <p>Aside  from the addition of a gunmetal front grille, the fully loaded <strong>Signature </strong>trim level primarily improves  the look and feel of the interior. You'll find higher-quality materials such as  microfiber suede, wood, and upgraded leather, along with the addition of LED  interior lighting and a frameless rearview mirror. Other feature additions  consist of a digital gauge cluster and a surround-view camera system with front  and rear parking sensors.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Mazda 6 i Touring Sedan</strong> (2.5L  inline-4 | 6-speed manual | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Mazda 6 has received major  revisions, including a new optional engine, along with a refreshed interior and  suspension. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Mazda 6. </p>]

[<p>For  its third year, the Mazda CX-3 receives a handful of updates that improve on  some of its best characteristics. In past years, we praised the CX-3 for being  the most enjoyable vehicle in the subcompact crossover SUV segment to drive.  For 2018, revisions to the suspension tuning promise an even sharper driving  experience. There's also more sound insulation and added low-speed crash  protection in the form of a standard automatic emergency braking system. And  just like last year, the 2018 CX-3 also boasts an upscale interior, comfortable  seats and high fuel economy. </p>, <p>The  CX-3 does have a few shortcomings, though, such as a cramped back seat and  below-average cargo capacity. If interior space is a priority for you, you  might prefer the more versatile Honda HR-V. You could also check out the Jeep  Renegade or Subaru Crosstrek for superior off-road capability. All in all,  though, we think the CX-3 is a pretty appealing package. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Mazda CX-3 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-small-suvs/" title="Best Small SUVs">Best Small SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mazda CX-3 is available in three trim levels: <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong> and <strong>Grand Touring</strong>. The base Sport trim is  actually nicely equipped, especially considering its price, but moving up  through the trim levels gets you some desirable conveniences and nice luxuries.  All trims rely on a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (146 horsepower, 146  pound-feet of torque) paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.  Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>]

[<p>The  CX-3 <strong>Sport</strong> comes standard with  16-inch alloy wheels, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding  rear seat, air-conditioning, push-button start, cruise control, Bluetooth, a  7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a USB input, app integration (including  Pandora, Stitcher and Aha) and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player.  Standard safety features on the base Sport trim include a rearview camera and  Mazda's Smart City Brake Support System, which will automatically apply the  brakes to avoid a collision as long as the CX-3 is traveling at less than 19  mph.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>Touring</strong> trim adds 18-inch  alloy wheels, heated mirrors, automatic headlights and automatic wipers.

[<p>Mazda redesigned its CX-5 crossover SUV  just last year. Notable improvements include a more comfortable ride quality, a  nicer cabin, and new safety and technology features. Factoring in the  traditionally taut steering and suspension, we think the 2018 Mazda CX-5 is one  of the best small SUVs available. </p>, <p>A quiet cabin and refined interior don't  detract from this SUV's reputation as a driver's vehicle either. About the only  thing that diminishes its appeal is a lack of an engine upgrade. Although  performance is on par with the base engines on competing models, there's  nothing more powerful available. Rival compact crossovers such as the Chevrolet  Equinox and the Kia Sportage offer strong turbocharged engines if you're after  something with more oomph, and competitors such as the Honda CR-V have a bit  more interior room and better fuel economy.</p>, <p>But overall we like the 2018 Mazda CX-5  for its excellent balance of sportiness, comfort and practicality. The exterior  design is sleek and modern, and while not overly generous inside, the interior  offers a competitive amount of room for people and cargo. The upscale interior  materials, along with a host of standard tech and convenience features, convey  the sense of a vehicle that should cost quite a bit more than it does. It's a  top pick for a small crossover in 2018.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Mazda CX-5 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-family-suv/" title="Best Family SUVs">Best Family SUVs</a> and <a href="/suv/articles/best-small-suvs/" title="Best Small SUVs">Best Small SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

All models have front-wheel drive with all-wheel  drive available as an option. The sole engine choice is a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder (187 hp, 186 lb-ft of torque), which is mated to a six-speed  automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment for every CX-5 includes  17-inch wheels, LED headlights, a 7-inch touchscreen, a rearview  camera, a 40/20/40-split rear seats (fold and recline), a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, a four-speaker sound system, Bluetooth, a four-speaker  stereo and two USB ports. Low-speed forward collision warning and mitigation  and blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert are also included.</p>, <p>The  available Sport i-Activsense package adds such features as automatic  high-beams, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise  control, upgraded forward collision warning and mitigation, and automatic  windshield wipers.</p>, <p>The <strong>Touring </strong>trim adds a healthy dose of  comfort items that most buyers will find appealing, such as 19-inch wheels,  keyless ignition and entry, heated front seats, simulated leather upholstery,  dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver seat, two  additional speakers and two more USB ports. It also gets the i-Activsense suite  of safety features as standard.

[<p>With three rows of seats  and a loaded feature list to satisfy a growing family's needs, the 2018 Mazda  CX-9 is one of the best, and best-looking, big crossovers out there. But it's  more than just a pretty face; it's also a genuine pleasure to drive. </p>, <p>The CX-9 delivers what most  SUV owners really want: a high level of comfort and refinement, a lot of room  and modern connected technology. In its top Signature trim level, the CX-9 even  flirts with a look and feel that you'd expect of an Audi or Volvo. It's the  most luxurious example in its class. That the CX-9 actually <em>drives</em> really well — it's  quick and alert when you stomp on the gas or bend it into a turn — is  icing on the cake. </p>, <p>Taste being subjective, the  CX-9 strikes one of the best poses among family SUVs. No safe,  middle-of-the-road body design here. This is clean and windswept, with sharp  edges and just-right proportions. It won't suit every buyer, but it's a  standout look. Inside and around that striking shape, you'll find plenty of safety  and connected tech and an interior highlighted by leather, aluminum and  rosewood accents, depending on trim level. </p>, <p>The CX-9 makes some  compromises, however. At about 72 cubic feet with second- and third-row seats  folded, cargo capacity isn't as cavernous as others in the class, and its third  row isn't especially accommodating either, at least not compared to the one in  a competitor such as the Honda Pilot. These are the trade-offs for the  impeccable style we lauded earlier. But overall, the CX-9 delivers an  all-around package that makes it one of the best three-row SUVs on the market. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Mazda CX-9 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-family-suv/" title="Best Family SUVs">Best Family SUVs</a> and <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mazda CX-9 is a three-row crossover SUV that seats  seven passengers. It's available in <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong>, <strong>Grand Touring</strong> and <strong>Signature</strong> trim levels. All CX-9s are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (250  horsepower, 310 pound-feet of torque) paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>]

[<p>Standard features on the <strong>Sport</strong> include 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, tri-zone automatic  climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver  seat, 60/40-split folding second-row seats, 50/50 split-folding third-row  seats, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Mazda's Connect infotainment system with a  7-inch display, and a six-speaker sound system. Also included is blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and a low-speed automatic emergency  braking system useful in urban and congested traffic. </p>, <p>The <strong>Touring</strong> trim adds  to Sport features with automatic wipers, heated mirrors, a power liftgate,  keyless ignition and entry, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated front  seats, leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, an 8-inch infotainment  display and two USB ports in the second-row center armrest. </p>, <p>The Touring also adds more safety features that include  automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and  intervention, and enhanced automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The <strong>Grand Touring</strong> trim further dresses things up with 20-inch wheels, adaptive headlights, LED  foglights, roof rails, a sunroof, front and rear parking sensors, a head-up  display with traffic sign recognition, driver-seat memory functions,  retractable sunshades for the middle-row seats, heated second-row seats, a  heated steering wheel, aluminum interior trim, additional interior lighting, a  navigation system, a 12-speaker Bose premium audio system and satellite radio. </p>, <p>At the top of the range is the <strong>Signature</strong> trim, which adds exterior LED accent lighting, premium  leather upholstery and rosewood interior trim. All-wheel drive is standard on  the Signature. </p>, <p>Some of the features on higher trims are available on supporting  models as options.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically  comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.

---http://edmunds.com/mazda/mx-5-miata/2018/review
[<p>The  Mazda MX-5 Miata was completely redesigned just two years ago, so it's no  surprise the 2018 model receives few changes. Mazda did its homework with this  Miata generation, improving the interior quality and accommodations while  making it lighter and quicker than its predecessor. There is perhaps no better  Mazda model that currently embodies the "Zoom-Zoom" spirit more than  the MX-5 Miata.</p>, <p>Miatas  are best enjoyed when the road turns twisty. A peppy yet fuel-efficient  four-cylinder engine provides enough power and a delightful soundtrack to keep  you entertained for as many miles as you can handle. And on that note, if you  want the best version of the Miata for such activities, we strongly recommend  the Club trim and the six-speed manual transmission. Mazda also offers an  automatic transmission, but it doesn't come with many of the Miata's dynamic-enhancing  goodies.</p>, <p>As  always, though, there are downsides to Miata ownership. Taller individuals  might find the cabin confining and particularly difficult to enter and exit if  the top isn't down. Trunk capacity is a laughable 4.6 cubic feet, so packing  light is a requirement for any road trip. And lastly, in the interest of saving  weight, the lack of sound deadening results in a fair amount of road and wind  noise at speed with the top up.</p>, <p>Still,  few cars are more rewarding and fun to wheel around than the Miata. If you can  live with the size limitations, you have little reason to consider anything  else in this segment for the pleasure of driving. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a two-seat roadster offered in three trim levels: <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Club</strong> and <strong>Grand Touring</strong>.  All three trim levels are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (155  horsepower, 148 pound-feet of torque) that drives the rear wheels through  either a six-speed manual or an optional six-speed automatic transmission with  paddle shifters. The Sport trim offers a more bare-bones motoring experience;  the Club is for sport-oriented driving, with a number of mechanical upgrades  and added interior features; and the top Grand Touring trim focuses on  providing comfort, convenience and technology.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>Sport</strong> trim include  16-inch alloy wheels, a manually retractable black soft top with a glass rear  window, LED headlights and taillights, air conditioning, a 7-inch touchscreen  infotainment interface, keyless entry with push-button ignition, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob,  cruise control, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, a  USB port and an auxiliary audio jack. </p>, <p>The <strong>Club</strong> trim includes everything from  the Sport but comes with different equipment depending on the chosen  transmission. With the manual shifter, it includes a sport-tuned suspension  with Bilstein shock absorbers, a shock-tower brace, a limited-slip differential  and an engine sound enhancer. Opting for the automatic negates these features.</p>, <p>Otherwise,  all Miata Clubs get 17-inch wheels with summer performance tires, a sportier  front fascia, a rear lip spoiler, black mirror covers and roll hoops, red  interior stitching, upgraded interior trim panels, a nine-speaker Bose audio  system (with headrest speakers, satellite radio and HD radio, and dual USB  ports), voice controls, and a 7-inch touchscreen interface with an auxiliary  control knob mounted on the center console. The Club also gets a  safety-oriented bundle that includes blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The <strong>Grand Touring</strong> loses the  manual-transmission Club's performance upgrades except for the sound enhancer,  which remains a manual-only feature. But it gets adaptive headlights with  automatic high-beam control, auto-dimming mirrors with exterior heating, lane  departure warning, body-colored mirror covers, automatic wipers, a cloth-lined  top, leather upholstery, heated seats, automatic climate control and a  navigation system.</p>, <p>A  Brembo/BBS package is offered on manual-transmission Club models, and it  includes 17-inch forged BBS wheels, more powerful Brembo front brakes, an aero  body kit and heated leather seats. For 2018, this package can also be enhanced  with Recaro sport seats.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the<strong> 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata Club Convertible</strong> (2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed manual | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current MX-5 Miata is fundamentally  unchanged. Our findings remain fully applicable to this year.</p>]
---http://edmunds.com/mazda/mx-5-miata-rf/2018/review
[<p>The 2018 Mazda MX-5 Miata takes a classic  approach to sports-car design with its light weight and diminutive size. It  feels more like an extension of the driver than a box you sit in. Even with  just 155 horsepower, it's one of the most engaging cars on the road at any  price, and having your head in the open air has always been an integral part of  that experience.</p>, <p>The MX-5 Miata RF, or Retractable  Fastback, swaps out the cloth roof of the convertible and replaces it with a  fold-away roof panel and rear window, leaving something like a wide roll bar  supported on long buttresses just behind the passenger compartment. The metal  roof makes for a slightly quieter car with the top up and gives the Miata a  distinct coupelike look. The trunk size remains the same between the hard- and  the soft top, so you don't lose what little practicality the Miata offers. </p>, <p>The trade-off is that you don't get the  full open-air experience, and the metal roof along with its complex folding  mechanism adds about 100 pounds and a higher price to the lightweight roadster.  But the RF version is still a blast to drive. If you're shopping for an  affordable sports car, the Miata RF gives you a unique mix of coupe and  convertible attributes. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF is available in two trim  levels: <strong>Club </strong>and <strong>Grand Touring</strong>. We prefer the Club for  its available sport-oriented hardware, although buyers seeking more comfort and  amenities will gravitate toward the Grand Touring's longer list of convenience  features. Both trim levels are equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine  (155 horsepower, 148 pound-feet of torque) and are available with a six-speed  manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. </p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment on the <strong>Club </strong>includes LED  headlights, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, keyless entry  and push-button start, a 7-inch infotainment screen with a console-mounted  rotary control knob, a nine-speaker Bose stereo with headrest speakers, and  cloth upholstery.</p>, <p>Manual-equipped  Club<strong> </strong>models are the sportiest,  gaining a retuned suspension, Bilstein dampers, limited-slip differential and  shock tower brace, making it our version of choice. Manual Club models can be  optioned with upgraded Brembo front brakes, BBS wheels and heated Recaro sport  seats.</p>, <p><strong>Grand Touring</strong> models — equipped with  heated leather seats, navigation, a cloth-lined top, automatic climate control,  adaptive headlights and lane departure warning — skew toward the  luxury end. These features are nice to have, but strike us as contradictory to  the Miata's elemental nature. Then again, a power-folding top isn't exactly  simple either. Still, at least there's a choice between sport-oriented and  comfort-tuned versions rather than some middling compromise. </p>]

[<p>With  its long nose and swooped-back cabin, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT evokes  imagery of its sports car ancestors, starting with the original 300 SL and  moving up to the more recent SLR and SLS. There's a functional reason for this  design, too — the length of that snout means the GT's powerful V8  engine sits behind the front axle, improving overall vehicle balance. Putting  the driver so close to the rear wheels makes for a unique driving experience,  once again reminiscent of classic sports cars. </p>, <p>Little  else is stuck in the past. As Mercedes-Benz's sports car flagship, the GT represents the best of performance and technology. As you move up through the  four different trim levels, the amount of electronic sophistication increases;  computer controls take over the suspension dampers, limited-slip differential  and even steering for the rear wheels. </p>, <p>Yet  the GT isn't overwhelmed by technology. Jamming the gas is thrilling, not only  because of the engine's power but also thanks to the deep roar it makes under hard  acceleration. Each trim level boasts rewarding handling that will satisfy  anyone, even those set on extreme racetrack performance. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-AMG GT is a two-seat, rear-wheel-drive sports car that is  available in four levels of increasing performance. The base <strong>GT</strong> model has the lowest power output of  the family, but still comes well equipped as a convertible in <strong>GT Roadster</strong> form. The <strong>GT S </strong>gets a solid power bump and more  sophisticated drivetrain and suspension hardware. Along with more power, the <strong>GT C </strong>gains wider rear fenders and rear  steering. It is also available as a convertible called the <strong>GT C Roadster</strong>. At the top is the hardcore <strong>GT R</strong>, whose manually adjustable suspension and slick tires mean  it's intended primarily for racetrack use. </p>]

[<p>Like  all trim levels, the <strong>GT</strong> employs a  4.0-liter V8 and seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. It is  available as both a coupe and convertible called the <strong>GT Roadster</strong>. For the base version here, the V8 produces 469 hp and  465 lb-ft of torque. Standard equipment includes 19-inch wheels, a mechanical  limited-slip differential, an 8.4-inch center infotainment display, a  navigation system, a four-speaker sound system, a rearview camera, parking  sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control and heated eight-way  power-adjustable seats. Convertible models come with a standard neck heating  system and dual roll bars. Options include an aerodynamics package, black  exterior trim appearance package, panoramic roof, and Burmester stereo system.  Buyers can also opt for driver-adjustable exhaust and adaptive dampers, along  with a variety of wheel choices. </p>, <p>The  engine in the <strong>GT S</strong> gets a power pump  (515 hp, 494 lb-ft of torque), while the chassis gains more sophisticated tools  in the form of electronic control for the dampers and limited-slip differential.  Drivers have access to a more aggressive Race driving mode and can adjust the  loudness of the exhaust. The 640-watt, 10-speaker Burmester stereo system is  standard, as are 19-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels. Options are similar to  what's available on the base model, but the GT S also gets access to a Dynamic  Plus package that broadens the V8's powerband and adds a more aggressive  suspension calibration and drivetrain mounts. A high-end 1,000-watt Burmester  stereo system, carbon-ceramic brakes and extreme performance sport tires are  also available. </p>, <p>The <strong>GT C</strong> (late availability) offers an  even higher engine output (550 hp, 502 lb-ft of torque) in both coupe and  convertible <strong>GT C Roadster</strong> variants.  It's 2.3 inches wider in the rear than the previous models, with space used to  house wider wheels and a rear-wheel steering system that improves low-speed  agility and high-speed stability. The GT C rides on adjustable and continuously  variable dampers and has a sharper overall setup thanks to the standard Dynamic  Plus package, which adds stiffer engine and transmission mounts and widens the  power delivery. </p>, <p>The <strong>GT R</strong> is the most powerful trim  available (577 hp, 516 lb-ft of torque) and is further endowed by carbon-fiber  bodywork and a big rear wing. Large and lightweight forged wheels wrapped with  extremely aggressive tires along with manually adjustable coil-over suspension  mean this hardcore variant is intended primarily for track use. It even has a  nine-mode traction control system styled after Mercedes' GT3 racecar. The GT R  doesn't have a few features that are standard on lesser models due to its focus  on performance, but most are available as options. </p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT S</strong> (turbo 4.0L  V8 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | RWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Mercedes-AMG GT S has received some  revisions, including an increase in horsepower and torque. Our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's Mercedes-AMG GT, however. </p>]

[<p>There  was a time when you could call the Mercedes-Benz C-Class an entry-level luxury  vehicle. But to do so for 2018 would be a bit of a disservice. First of all,  the CLA-Class is technically Mercedes' entry-level sedan now. But more  importantly, the C-Class is more impressive than the words  "entry-level" would lead you to believe. It comes with an impeccably  built interior, high-quality materials inside and out, upgrading and  customizing options galore, and a variety of engine choices. </p>, <p>As  for those engines, there's a lot to chose from if you want something other than  the C300's turbocharged four-cylinder engine. For better fuel economy, check  out the C350e. This plug-in hybrid version of the C-Class offers a modicum of  all-electric driving range, an increase in power and the best fuel economy of  the C-Class range. If autobahn-worthy speeds are more your thing, there's a  turbocharged V6 in the AMG C43 and the turbocharged V8 in the AMG C63, both of  which are bona fide sport sedans. </p>, <p>Of  course, there are other entry-level luxury sedans, coupes and convertibles that  may catch your eye. But it would be a glaring omission if the 2018  Mercedes-Benz C-Class didn't end up on your short list. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class AMG C 63 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sports Sedans">Best Sports Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class comes in three body styles: sedan, coupe and  convertible (Cabriolet). The C-Class sedan, coupe and convertible are available  in five trim levels: base <strong>C300</strong>, <strong>C300 4Matic </strong>(all-wheel drive), <strong>AMG C43</strong>, <strong>AMG C63</strong> and <strong>AMG C63 S</strong>.  The sedan also gets a plug-in hybrid variant called the <strong>C350e</strong>. With the exception of the high-horsepower engines and  sport-tuned components in the AMG models, most C-Classes get the same standard  equipment and are available with a plethora of packaged and stand-alone  options. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>C300 sedan </strong>(and C300 4Matic) comes  standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (241 horsepower,  273 pound-feet of torque), a nine-speed automatic transmission, 17-inch wheels,  automatic wipers, a rearview camera, a sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate  control, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 10-way power front seats  (with four-way lumbar adjustment), driver-seat memory settings, simulated  leather upholstery (the rather good MB-Tex) and 40/20/40-split folding rear  seatbacks.</p>, <p>Standard  tech includes the COMAND infotainment system (with a 7-inch central display  screen and a console-mounted dial controller), Bluetooth and an audio system  with a CD player, dual USB ports, an SD card reader and HD radio.</p>, <p>For  the most part, the <strong>C300 coupe</strong> gets  the same equipment plus 18-inch wheels. The <strong>C300 convertible </strong>gets a power-folding fabric top, Mercedes'  Airscarf system — which delivers warmed air to the neck and shoulders  of front passengers — and a removable wind blocker.</p>, <p>On  top of the 18-inch wheels, the <strong>C350e</strong> (sedan only) gets a turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an  electric motor (275 hp combined), a seven-speed automatic transmission, an  air-spring suspension with multiple tuning modes, and LED headlights. </p>, <p>Primary  options packages for all C300s are essentially the same. The Premium package  adds an electronic trunk closer, blind-spot monitoring, keyless entry and  push-button start, and satellite radio. In the coupe and convertible, the  Premium package also includes an upgraded Burmester sound system.</p>, <p>Several  other options packages are available for the C300 and C350e as well as  stand-alone options. We'll dispense with the packages first. </p>, <p>Options  packages include the Multimedia package (an upgraded 8.4-inch screen with  navigation, voice controls, touchpad infotainment controller); Advanced  Lighting package (adaptive high-beam headlights, cornering headlamps, LED  headlights, ambient interior lighting); Smartphone Integration package (Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto compatibility); Parking Assist package (front and rear parking  sensors, top-down parking camera system); the AMG Line package (upgraded  brakes, sport suspension, a rear spoiler, unique bodywork); and the Driver  Assistance package (forward collision mitigation, adaptive cruise control, lane  keeping assist, rear cross-traffic alert).</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options for the C300/350e include a panoramic sunroof, a head-up display,  heated and ventilated seats, leather upholstery, a cabin air purification and  fragrance system, a heated steering wheel, and a number of interior and  exterior trim pieces.</p>, <p>For  the most part, <strong>AMG C43</strong> models get  the Premium package equipment along with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (362 hp,  384 lb-ft), all-wheel drive, a nine-speed automatic transmission, a sport tuned  suspension, adaptive suspension dampers, heated front seats and unique interior  trim. </p>, <p>The <strong>AMG C63</strong> and <strong>C63 S</strong> are widely similar with the exception of the turbocharged  4.0-liter V8 (469 hp, 479 lb-ft with the C63; 503 hp, 516 lb-ft with the C63 S)  and a multiclutch, high-performance seven-speed automatic transmission. Options  for the AMG models include carbon-ceramic brakes, exhaust and upgraded wheels  and tires sport seats, carbon-fiber interior and exterior trim, and a special  AMG head-up display. </p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz three-pointed star is one of the  most recognizable luxury badges in the world. The fact that acquiring one  typically sets you back a hefty sum has been well established, but that's not  necessarily the case with the 2018 CLA-Class. For about the same price as a  non-luxury sedan, you can get a lot of Mercedes charm and quality. And for a  lot of shoppers, that could be enough.</p>, <p>If it were the only sedan in its class, we'd be  inclined to agree. But there are some similarly priced vehicles out there, and  they don't have the same drivability, comfort and space issues that the CLA  does. As a result, we suggest checking out those European rivals before signing  on the dotted line.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class sedan is offered in <strong>CLA250</strong> (208 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque) and a  higher-performance <strong>AMG CLA 45</strong> (375  hp, 350 lb-ft) trims. Both models are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine paired with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic  transmission. The standard CLA250 is front-wheel-drive, but all-wheel drive  (Mercedes' 4Matic) is available as an option. All-wheel drive is standard with  the AMG CLA 45. </p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights for the <strong>CLA250</strong> models include 17-inch wheels, automatic wipers, selectable drive modes,  dual-zone automatic climate control, simulated leather upholstery (MB-Tex),  eight-way power front sport seats with memory functions, and 60/40-split  folding rear seats with a center pass-through. </p>, <p>On the  technology front, you get an 8-inch infotainment screen, Mercedes' COMAND  infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera, forward  collision warning and mitigation, a drowsy driver monitor, the Mbrace emergency  telematics, and an audio system with<br>  a CD  player, HD radio, two SD card slots and two USB ports.</br></p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>AMG CLA 45 </strong>adds 19-inch  wheels, LED headlights and running lights, unique styling and aerodynamic  flourishes, a sport exhaust system, upgraded brakes and transmission, a  torque-vectoring differential, a sport steering wheel and simulated suede  upholstery inserts.</p>, <p>There are  a few main option packages to look out for. These include the Premium package  (keyless ignition and entry, a hands-free trunklid, blind-spot monitoring,  heated front seats and satellite radio); the Convenience package (auto-dimming  mirrors and a universal garage door opener); the Interior package (leather  upholstery, upgraded dash and door trim, and interior ambient lighting); the  Multimedia package (a navigation system, voice controls, and Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration); and the Driver Assistance package  (adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning and intervention).</p>, <p>Many  AMG-based styling elements are available on the CLA250. Other notable add-ons  include an automated parking system, an adjustable suspension, a panoramic  sunroof and a 12-speaker premium Harman Kardon audio system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA250</strong> (turbo 2.0L  inline-4 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | FWD)</p>, <p>Since this  test was conducted, the current CLA-Class has received some revisions,  including a retuned-suspension, a minor interior and exterior styling update,  extendable front-seat thigh supports and a new infotainment screen. Our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's CLA250, however.</p>]

[<p>When the Mercedes-Benz CLS debuted for  the 2006 model year, it pioneered the "four-door coupe" market.  Mercedes got away with calling it a coupe because of the sloping roofline that  gave it a distinctive two-door look. Since then, this styling cue has endured  as well as inspired other manufacturers to follow suit.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS maintains its  favorable standing with its potent engine choices, admirable handling,  cosseting comfort, impeccable interior and available advanced safety features.  Alongside rivals such as the Audi A7 and BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, it's a great  pick if you like the idea of a sedan that has a coupelike look to it. Just note  that a redesigned CLS will be coming out for the 2019 model year. It boasts new  styling and Mercedes' latest technology.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS is a four-door, four-passenger sedan, though Mercedes  refers to it as a coupe due to its sleekly raked roofline. Three trims are  available: the <strong>CLS 550</strong>, the <strong>CLS 550 4Matic</strong> and the <strong>AMG CLS 63 S</strong>. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>CLS 550</strong> models are powered by a  turbocharged 4.7-liter V8 (402 horsepower, 443 pound-feet of torque). A  nine-speed automatic transmission sends power to the rear wheels or, in the  case of the <strong>CLS 550 4Matic</strong>, all four  wheels.</p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights for the <strong>CLS 550</strong> include 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, a sunroof, automatic wipers,  auto-dimming mirrors, an adaptive air suspension, dual-zone automatic climate  control, power-adjustable and heated front seats, front-seat memory functions,  leather upholstery, a power-adjustable steering wheel, the COMAND infotainment  interface (8-inch screen, knob controller), a navigation system, Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto, and a 14-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. Also standard is  forward collision warning with automatic braking, </p>, <p>The  Premium package adds keyless entry and ignition, adaptive headlights, automatic  high beams, power-folding mirrors, a power trunklid, ventilated front seats and  a power rear sunshade. </p>, <p>Other  bundled options include the Lane Tracking package (blind-spot monitoring and  lane departure warning), the Driver Assistance package (adaptive cruise  control, steering assist, additional forward collision mitigation technology,  rear-end collision cabin preparation, active blind-spot assist and active  lane-keeping assist), and the Parking Assist package (a surround-view monitor,  front and rear parking sensors, and an automated parallel parking system).</p>, <p>Notable  stand-alone options include an illuminated Mercedes logo in the grille, a  heated steering wheel, split-folding rear seats, rear-seat side airbags, a  multicontour front seat, and a premium Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p>, <p>The <strong>AMG CLS 63 S</strong> receives a turbocharged  5.5-liter V8 (577 hp, 590 lb-ft) that is paired with a performance-focused  seven-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. </p>, <p>In  addition to the CLS 550's standard features, the AMG CLS 63 S also gains  19-inch wheels with summer tires, upgraded brakes, a limited-slip differential,  a sport exhaust system, unique styling elements, front and rear parking  sensors, an automated parallel parking system, upgraded LED headlights, special  gauges and interior trim, a sport steering wheel, an IWC Ingenieur analog  clock, more aggressively bolstered sport seats, the power rear sunshade and  upgraded leather upholstery.</p>, <p>Most  option packages are available and similar in content to those for the CLS 550.  Carbon-ceramic brakes are a stand-alone option.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our evaluation of  the <strong>2015</strong> <strong>CLS 550 4Matic sedan</strong> (twin-turbo 4.7L V8 | 7-speed automatic |  AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current CLS has received some revisions,  including a nine-speed automatic transmission, and additional standard  features. Our findings remain applicable to the 2018 CLS. </p>]

[<p>Mercedes-Benz  redesigned the E-Class sedan and wagon last year but left the coupe and  convertible alone. This year, it's the two-door's turn. The 2018 E-Class coupe  and convertible are fully redesigned. They ride on a new platform and boast a  more richly designed interior and more advanced driver safety aids. Also, Benz  has brought back the sedan's E63 AMG model. Now called the AMG E63 S, it packs  more power and torque from a new turbocharged V8 that's also more efficient. </p>, <p>On  the inside, every variant of the E-Class now has the same fantastic luxury  aesthetic. As expected, there's a huge range of features available, including  the latest in nearly autonomous driver features. Whether you value comfort,  performance or technology in your midsize luxury sedan, coupe, convertible or  wagon, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz E-Class should be right at the top of your list. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Mercedes-Benz E-Class as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans">Best AWD Sedans</a> and <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is a midsize luxury vehicle that comes in four  different body styles: a five-passenger sedan, a seven-passenger (thanks to a  fold-down, rear-facing third row) wagon, and a four-passenger coupe and  convertible. The sedan, coupe and convertible all come standard with rear-wheel  drive with all-wheel drive (dubbed 4Matic) either optional or standard,  depending on the engine and body style. The four basic trim levels are tied to  different powertrains: <strong>E300</strong> (sedan  only), <strong>E400</strong> (sedan, wagon, coupe,  convertible), <strong>AMG E43</strong> (sedan only)  and <strong>AMG E63 S</strong> (sedan and wagon).</p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment for the E-Class <strong>E300</strong> sedan  includes a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (241 horsepower, 273  lb-ft of torque), a nine-speed automatic transmission, LED headlights,  automatic wipers, power-folding mirrors with heating, a sunroof, selectable  drive modes, an adaptive suspension, dual-zone automatic climate control,  premium simulated leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat  memory functions and 40/20/40-split folding rear seats.</p>, <p>Standard  technology highlights for the E300 are a 12.3-inch display, a rearview camera,  Mercedes' COMAND infotainment system with a touchpad controller, voice  controls, a navigation system, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, HD  radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>The <strong>E400</strong> gets all of the E300's  equipment plus a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine (329 hp, 354 lb-ft). In  addition to the above, the E400 wagon has power liftgate and the convertible  receives a power-folding fabric top, Mercedes' Aircap wind deflector and a rear  center pass-through. <br> <strong>Sport</strong> and <strong>Luxury</strong> versions are available for both the E300 and E400. The Sport  has bigger wheels, a sport-tuned suspension and brakes, and special styling  details. The Luxury gets some additional wheel choices, upgraded upholstery and  a different grille. </br></p>, <p>For  the most part, the above variants share optional package availability. The <strong>Premium 1</strong> package adds an automated  parallel and perpendicular parking system, a wireless phone charger, satellite  radio, keyless entry, a power trunklid (sedan) with hands-free activation, rear  cross-traffic alert, heated front seats and a Burmester surround-sound system.  The <strong>Premium 2</strong> package includes all  of the Premium 1 package, along with adaptive headlights with automatic  high-beams, a perfumed air freshener system and a power rear sunshade (sedan).</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium 3</strong> package includes all of  the above plus a surround-view camera system, adaptive cruise control with  steering and lane-change assist, a speed-limit sign reader, forward collision  and rear cross-traffic warnings and mitigation, evasive steering assist, active  blind-spot assistance, a head-up display, and Pre-Safe side and rear impact  preparation.</p>, <p>Other  notable options include the Warmth and Comfort package (rapid heating for front  seats, heated front armrests, upper door panels and steering wheel), tri-zone  climate control, rear side airbags, an adaptive air-ride suspension, a  panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, an upgraded gauge cluster display,  additional sound and solar insolation, active multicontour front seats with  massage functions, and a couple of premium Burmester sound systems. Numerous  upholstery and trim options are also available. The Airscarf neck-warmer is  available as an option for the convertible.</p>, <p>For  more power and some upgraded equipment, there's the <strong>AMG E43</strong>, which comes with most of the E400's standard equipment,  plus a more powerful turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (396 hp, 384 lb-ft), an AMG  sport-tuned suspension and braking, keyless entry, blind-spot monitoring,  AMG-specific interior and exterior pieces, and leather upholstery. </p>, <p>At  the top of the horsepower heap is the <strong>AMG  E63 S</strong>. It gets the E43's equipment plus a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 (603  hp, 627 lb-ft), AMG-developed or -tuned powertrain and suspension components, a  limited-slip rear differential, and heated and ventilated front seats. It also  comes standard with several of the E400's optional items. Any E63 S can be  outfitted with carbon-ceramic brakes.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2017 Mercedes-Benz E300</strong> Sport Sedan (2.0L turbo inline-4 | 9-speed  automatic | RWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Mercedes-Benz E-Class has received  some revisions, including the redesign of the coupe and convertible variants as  well as some additional standard equipment for the sedan including a rearview  camera.

[<p>The Mercedes G-Class is a throwback to an odd moment in the company's history.  It was originally commissioned by the shah of Iran as a military vehicle, but  that all stopped with the shah's ouster. Shortly thereafter, the G-Wagen, as it  was known, was put up for sale to the public and officially brought to the U.S.  decades later in 2002. </p>, <p>In the 40-year span since its  development, there have been many upgrades, but the G-Class remains a rather  crude and outdated vehicle. Handling is ponderous. It's difficult to get in and  out of. It's uncomfortable. The interior is well behind the times, and there's  not much room for passengers or cargo. Despite these drawbacks, it became a  status symbol for wealthy clients looking to make a statement. </p>, <p>At long last, an all-new 2019 G-Class is  set to go on sale, though from outward appearances it's nearly identical to  this final first-generation G-Wagen. It will feature a ton of new updates  throughout that should address its many drawbacks. Quite frankly, we suggest  any potential G-Class owners wait for the new model that should go on sale in  late 2018.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a five-passenger SUV that is offered in four  trim levels: <strong>G550</strong>, <strong>AMG G63</strong>, <strong>AMG G65</strong> and <strong>G550  4x4<sup>2</sup></strong> (as in "squared"). All versions are  equipped with a seven-speed automatic transmission, live axles at both ends,  full-time four-wheel drive, a two-speed transfer case and three locking  differentials, and they can tow up to 7,000 pounds. The <strong>G550</strong> is entry-level only in a relative sense. It's extremely  well-equipped — beyond its prodigious drivetrain hardware, it has  leather-upholstered 10-way power-adjustable and heated seats, heated back  seats, power-folding and heated mirrors, adaptive cruise, dual-zone climate  control, navigation and premium audio. It's equipped with a 4.0-liter  twin-turbo V8 (416 horsepower, 450 pound-feet of torque).</p>]

[<p>Stepping up to the <strong>AMG G63</strong> nets you a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V8 (563 hp, 561 lb-ft of  torque), 20-inch wheels, larger brakes and a performance-tuned suspension. It  also grants access to the AMG Performance Studio, whereby near-endless  customization is available. The next step in the G-Class lineup goes from  merely silly to truly absurd: the <strong>AMG  G65</strong>, which slots in a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V12 (621 hp, 738 lb-ft of  torque) and adds 21-inch wheels and revised upholstery.</p>, <p>Then there's the <strong>G550 4x4<sup>2</sup></strong> for which words do not do justice.  This has the 4.0-liter V8 but swaps the standard axles for portal axles, which  dramatically increase ground clearance. It also adds 22-inch wheels,  larger-diameter tires, twin coilover-damper assemblies at each wheel, wider  fender flares and skid plates.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically  comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the <strong>Mercedes-Benz  G63 AMG </strong>(turbo 5.5L V8 | 7-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted in 2015, the current G-Class has received only  minor, mostly cosmetic revisions and the addition of the G550  4x4<sup>2</sup> trim level. Our findings remain broadly applicable  to this year's G-Class.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes Benz GLA-Class makes a smart  choice if you want a luxury crossover that moves, parks and economizes fuel  like a compact sedan. The high-performance GLA 45 trim, meanwhile, is in a  class by itself. <strong> </strong></p>, <p>Based on  Mercedes' budget-friendly CLA sedan, the GLA crossover delivers athletic  handling and big smiles on narrow, twisting roads. Most Benzes lean toward  stately power and control, but the GLA is one of the more fun, raucous models  in the lineup. Both the GLA250 and AMG GLA 45 also offer powerful engines, good  real-world fuel economy (29 and 26 mpg combined, respectively), a full  complement of convenience and connected technology, and a long list of luxury  and safety features. </p>, <p>For 2018,  the GLA carries over mostly unchanged, but there's a subtle new look to the  front and rear bumpers and new wheel designs. The gauge cluster design is new,  and a rearview camera and 8-inch display are now standard equipment. </p>, <p>The GLA's  inherent weaknesses, however, haven't changed. The ride is still rougher than  you'd expect of a Mercedes, sporty or not. There's not much headroom or  legroom, or much cargo space. And though the GLA250's four-cylinder engine  sounds strong and performs well, the accompanying automatic transmission  responds slowly to pedal inputs, especially in the default Eco mode. The AMG  GLA 45 has a more responsive transmission to go along with its big increase in  horsepower.  </p>, <p>The GLA's  relatively high cost doesn't help its case. Similar models from BMW, Audi and  Lexus, while not much bigger or roomier, offer a greater level of refinement  for the same price or less. Even the Infiniti QX30, essentially a GLA in  Infiniti clothing, offers better ride quality and (slightly) better  transmission tuning. </p>, <p>Though the  GLA wears a Mercedes star, it's worth considering its rivals before making a  final decision. The GLA 45 is something else entirely. It shares most of the  GLA's basic flaws, but blistering speed and performance tend to overshadow its  blemishes. There's nothing else like it in the class. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class is offered in three trim levels: <strong>GLA250</strong>, <strong>GLA250 4Matic</strong>,  and <strong>AMG GLA 45</strong>. The <strong>GLA250</strong> comes with a 208-hp turbocharged  four-cylinder engine and a decent feature list that includes power-adjustable  front seats, a power liftgate, Bluetooth and a 7-inch central display. The  GLA250 4Matic<strong> </strong>version adds all-wheel  drive and hill descent control. The <strong>AMG  GLA 45</strong> shares the same basic feature set, but with a more powerful engine  and other high-performance upgrades. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>GLA250</strong> starts with a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (208 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque), a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Key standard features include  18-inch alloy wheels, a power liftgate, power-adjustable driver seat, three  performance driving modes, imitation leather upholstery, and a 60/40-split  folding rear seatback with a center pass-through. </p>, <p>Tech  features include an 8-inch central display with a dial-and-button control  array, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker audio system with a CD player, HD radio, an  SD card reader and two USB ports. Certain features of Mercedes' Mbrace  telematics system (including a Wi-Fi hotspot and concierge services) are  available on a subscription basis. </p>, <p>The  all-wheel-drive <strong>GLA250 4Matic</strong> model  adds some all-weather and light off-road capability with hill descent control  and an off-road status monitor that analyzes steering angle, tilt angle and  grade percentage. </p>, <p>Several  option packages are available for the GLA250. The Premium package bundles  blind-spot monitoring, keyless entry and ignition, heated front seats, and  hands-free liftgate open and close, while the Interior package adds leather  upholstery, sport seats and ambient cabin lighting. The Multimedia package  includes a navigation system, voice controls, smartphone integration via Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto, and real-time satellite traffic and weather  information. </p>, <p>Adaptive  cruise control and lane keeping assist are available in the Driver Assistance  package, a Convenience package adds an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a new  Parking Assist package adds a surround-view camera and a self-parking system. </p>, <p>The AMG  Line Exterior package offers a high-performance look with 19-inch AMG wheels,  AMG body styling and a black headliner. The Night package further enhances this  look with black wheels, trim and side mirror caps. </p>, <p>Stand-alone  options include several package items (blind-spot monitoring, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto, heated front seats, for example) as well as upgrades that include  a panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, ambient cabin lighting, and a 12-speaker  Harman Kardon sound system. </p>, <p>The <strong>AMG GLA 45</strong> comes with all-wheel drive  and the GLA250's standard features, but with significantly more power (375 hp,  350 lb-ft of torque) from the same engine. It's further distinguished with  19-inch wheels, a sport exhaust, sport-tuned suspension and steering, upgraded  brakes, LED headlights and a power passenger seat. The GLA 45's options largely  mirror those of the GLA250, but there are a couple of exclusive additions. </p>, <p>The AMG  Dynamic Plus package includes adaptive dampers, a limited-slip differential, a  Race driving mode and a higher top speed. Meanwhile, a new AMG Performance  Studio package is a fierce styling upgrade that includes 20-inch wheels, body  kit, a rear spoiler, sport seats, and various components trimmed in black and  yellow. A handful of other packages offer aesthetic enhancements inside and  out. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 4Matic </strong>(turbo  2.0L inline-4 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD).</p>]

[<p>We expect a lot from small crossover  SUVs. This class, one of the commanding forces in the automotive industry, is  chock full of vehicles that offer an elevated view, plenty of passenger room,  and superior cargo capacity to their sedan and hatchback counterparts. In the  luxury category, expectations are even higher because crossovers also have to  be exceptionally smooth, quiet and powerful. Yet even measured against these  standards, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class manages to stand out. It's that  good.</p>, <p>Much of the GLC's superiority comes from  its expertly crafted cabin. Every detail, from the metal speaker covers to the  leatherette-trimmed dash and open-pore wood trim, seems to have been obsessed  over. The interior feels justifiably more expensive than even those of most  other luxury crossovers.</p>, <p>The attention to detail carries over when  you move from the standard GLC 300 to one of the high-performance AMG models.  Not only do you get throaty V6 and V8 engines that rocket the GLC away from a  stoplight, you also get upgrades such as a sport-tuned air suspension, bigger  brakes, and summer tires to make the most of the extra power. And we haven't  even touched on the GLC's roomy cabin, which will fit four tall adults with ease.  Pound for pound, this is one of the best small luxury crossovers on the market.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is a  small luxury crossover SUV with seating for five. It's offered in four trim levels.  Most buyers will select the four-cylinder <strong>GLC  300</strong> since it's the most affordable and can be ordered with a wide range of  luxury and safety enhancements. There's also the <strong>GLC 350e</strong> plug-in hybrid (late availability) that pairs the  four-cylinder with an electric motor. Performance enthusiasts will enjoy the <strong>AMG GLC 43</strong>'s turbocharged V6, while the <strong>AMG GLC 63</strong> (also late availability)  turns up the wick even more with a turbocharged V8.  </p>]

[<p>Note that though the GLC 300 comes with  standard rear-wheel drive and offers all-wheel drive (called 4Matic) as an  option, the rest of the lineup comes with all-wheel drive. The GLC 350e uses a  seven-speed automatic transmission, and the other models use a nine-speed auto.</p>, <p>The base <strong>GLC 300 </strong>comes equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder  engine (241 horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque), 18-inch wheels, adaptive suspension damping (not  driver selectable), a power liftgate, a rearview camera, power-folding mirrors  (with auto-dimming on the driver side) and automatic wipers. Inside, you'll  find dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, adjustable drive settings, a power-adjustable  driver seat with memory functions, 40/20/40-split power-folding rear seats, simulated  leather upholstery (MB-Tex) and keyless ignition. </p>, <p>Tech features include a 7-inch infotainment display,  Mbrace Connect (includes smartphone app integration), and an eight-speaker  sound system with HD radio and two USB ports. </p>, <p>Select  the <strong>GLC 350e</strong> plug-in hybrid and an  electric motor and battery pack will be paired to the four-cylinder for a  combined 315 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque. Its EV-only range and standard  equipment have not been made public, but the features and options should be  similar to what's offered in the GLC 300. </p>, <p>The <strong>AMG GLC 43 </strong>is quite different from  the above two trims. In addition to a potent turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (362 hp, 384 lb-ft), the GLC 43 is  further equipped with 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned air suspension, a sport  steering wheel, the contents of the GLC 300's Premium package (blind-spot  monitoring, keyless ignition and entry, satellite radio and a 115-volt power  outlet), simulated-suede seat inserts and heated front seats. </p>, <p>The  most exciting trim is the <strong>AMG GLC 63</strong>.  Besides its turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 (469 hp, 479 lb-ft), you also get  upgraded brakes, LED headlights, a mechanical limited-slip differential, variable torque distribution for  the all-wheel drive system, and a 14-speaker premium Burmester  surround-sound system. </p>, <p>Some features on the upper trims can be  ordered on lower trims, though most extras are grouped into packages that are  available across the GLC lineup. Safety-minded buyers might consider the <strong>Driver Assistance</strong> package, which adds  adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and mitigation, rear  cross-traffic alert, and forward collision warning and mitigation (with  automatic braking). It also adds the contents of the Premium package to the GLC  300. </p>, <p>There's also the <strong>Advanced Parking Assist</strong> package. It includes a top-down parking  camera system, front and rear parking sensors, an automated parking system and  a hands-free liftgate. For the ultimate night cruiser, check out the <strong>Advanced Lighting</strong> package, which adds  adaptive LED headlights, automatic high-beam control, interior ambient lighting  and illuminated door sills.</p>, <p>For the techies out there, a <strong>Multimedia </strong>package is offered, with a  navigation system, touchpad controller and an 8.4-inch central display screen.  There's also an option that bundles Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but note  that it's incompatible with the Multimedia or Driver Assistance package.</p>, <p>Some of the features in the above  packages can be ordered as stand-alone options. There are a number of separate  items that buyers might also want to add. Styling upgrades include 21-inch  wheels, the Night package (glossy black exterior elements) and the AMG Line  (GLC 300 only, adds interior and exterior appearance modifications, a  flat-bottom steering wheel and the GLC 43's upgraded brakes).</p>, <p>Luxury enhancements are also available,  such as a cabin fragrance and air purification system, a panoramic sunroof, a  head-up display, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, heated rear  seats, rear side-window shades, various trim accents and multiple premium  leather upholsteries (paired with adjustable passenger thigh support and memory  settings). A performance exhaust system is available exclusively for AMG  models. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC 300 4Matic</strong> (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 9-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current GLC-Class has received some  revisions, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which became available  just this year. Our findings remain applicable to this year's GLC-Class,  however.</p>]

[<p>Don't be fooled by its name; the 2018  Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class Coupe is not a two-door version of the GLC crossover.  Rather, the coupe designation refers to the vehicle's fastback profile, which  stands in contrast to the boxy designs of most other SUVs. Other than reduced  headroom in the back seat and a ding to cargo capacity, the coupe is as easy to  live with as its GLC sibling.</p>, <p>Like the standard GLC, the GLC coupe  features a world-class cabin inspired by the vaunted S-Class sedan's. Every  touch point feels rich and substantial, from the grippy, leather-covered  steering wheel to the window switches. As with many Mercedes-Benz products,  buyers can select exotic leather upholsteries, trim pieces and automated  driving features even on the base model. And there are plenty of configurations  to choose from, including an efficient yet sprightly turbocharged four-cylinder  and a bellowing turbo V8 with 503 horsepower. As long as you don't mind the hit  to practicality and the price premium over the standard model, we think you'll  enjoy the comfort, luxury and performance offered by the 2018 Mercedes-Benz  GLC-Class Coupe.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class Coupe is  a compact luxury crossover SUV with a sleeker profile than the standard  GLC-Class. It's offered in four trim levels, each with unique engine tuning.  Starting things off is the four-cylinder <strong>GLC  300</strong>, which has a reasonable starting price and can be ordered with a wide  range of luxury and safety enhancements. Next up is the <strong>AMG GLC 43</strong>, which adds a turbocharged V6 engine and several  features that are optional on the GLC 300. True performance-minded buyers will  appreciate the V8-powered <strong>AMG GLC 63</strong> and <strong>AMG GLC 63 S</strong>.</p>]

[<p>The base <strong>GLC 300 </strong>comes with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine (241  horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque). Like all GLC models, power is sent to  all four wheels through a nine-speed automatic transmission. Standard features  include 19-inch wheels, adaptive suspension damping (not driver selectable), a power liftgate, auto-dimming  rearview and driver-side mirrors, a sunroof, automatic wipers, a  power-adjustable tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, driver-seat memory  settings, 40/20/40-split power-folding rear seats, simulated leather  upholstery, a rearview camera, dual-zone climate control, a 7-inch central  display screen, Mbrace Connect (includes smartphone app integration), and an  eight-speaker sound system with HD radio and two USB ports.<br> <strong> </strong><br>The <strong>AMG  GLC 43</strong> is the first of the performance-oriented trims. It comes with a  turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (362 hp, 384 lb-ft), 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned  version of the GLC 300's optional adaptive air suspension, upgraded brakes,  simulated-suede seat inserts, heated front seats, steering-wheel-mounted shift  paddles and the contents of the GLC 300's Premium package (blind-spot  monitoring, keyless ignition and entry, satellite radio and a 115-volt power  outlet). </br></br></p>, <p>The <strong>AMG  GLC 63</strong> receives a plethora of performance upgrades, starting with a  turbocharged V8 (469 hp, 479 lb-ft). It also gets a sport-tuned version of the  nine-speed automatic, a mechanical limited-slip differential, variable torque  distribution for the all-wheel drive system, and a 14-speaker premium Burmester  sound system. The <strong>AMG</strong> <strong>GLC 63 S</strong> goes even further with a  punchier engine tune (503 hp and 516 lb-ft), along with an electronically controlled  limited-slip differential and simulated suede grips on the steering wheel.  </p>, <p>Most packages are available across the  GLC lineup. Safety-minded buyers might consider the <strong>Driver Assistance</strong> package, which adds adaptive cruise control, lane  departure warning and mitigation, rear cross-traffic alert, and forward  collision warning and mitigation (with automatic braking). It also includes the  contents of the Premium package for the GLC 300. There's also the <strong>Advanced Parking Assist</strong> package, which  includes a top-down parking camera system, front and rear parking sensors, an  automated parking system and a hands-free liftgate. For the ultimate night  cruiser, check out the <strong>Advanced Lighting</strong> package, which adds adaptive LED headlights, automatic high-beam control,  interior ambient lighting and illuminated doorsills.</p>, <p>For the techies out there, a <strong>Multimedia </strong>package is offered, with a  navigation system, touchpad controller and an 8.4-inch central display screen.  There's also an option that bundles Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but note  that it's incompatible with the Multimedia and Driver Assistance packages.</p>, <p>A few of the features in the above  packages can be ordered as stand-alone options. There are a number of separate  items that buyers might want to add. Styling upgrades include 21-inch wheels,  the Night package (glossy black exterior elements) and the AMG Line (GLC 300  only), which adds interior and exterior appearance modifications, a flat-bottom  steering wheel and the GLC 43's upgraded brakes.</p>, <p>Luxury enhancements are also available,  such as a cabin fragrance and air purification system, a head-up display, a  heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rear  side-window shades, various trim accents and multiple premium leather  upholsteries (paired with adjustable passenger thigh support and memory  settings). The GLC 300 can be ordered with the sport exhaust system found on  the AMG models, while an upgraded performance exhaust is available for those  models. </p>]

[<p>In  some ways, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is a bit unusual for a luxury  crossover SUV. It's bigger than the typical compact crossover (think Mercedes' GLC) but lacks a third row of seats like many rivals offer. Instead, the GLE  provides plenty of room to transport four adults in supreme comfort. And while  many crossovers come in just one version, Mercedes offers four distinct GLE  models. </p>, <p>The  non-turbocharged V6 under the hood of the base GLE 350 provides enough thrust  for everyday driving and is rated to tow up to an impressive 7,200 pounds. To  really get up to speed quickly, though, check out one of the two  performance-focused GLEs. The turbocharged engines in the AMG GLE 43 and the  AMG GLE 63 transform the GLE from a laid-back cruiser to a hard-charging  bruiser. There's also a GLE 550e plug-in hybrid. It offers a paltry 12 miles of  electric-only range, but its mix of power and fuel economy is the best of the  GLE lineup. </p>, <p>Whichever  model you choose, you'll be impressed by the GLE's beautifully constructed  interior. A wide variety of luxurious leathers, rich trim pieces and  high-quality plastics line every conceivable touch point, making each variant  feel as if it's worth the money. With so many versions available, there's surely  a 2018 Mercedes GLE-Class to match your needs. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is a five-passenger SUV that slots between the GLC  compact crossover and the three-row GLS. It's offered in five trims, each with  a distinct powertrain. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the GLE 350, while  Mercedes' 4Matic all-wheel-drive system is optional on that model and standard  on all others. </p>]

[<p>Powering  the <strong>GLE 350 </strong>is a 3.5-liter V6 (302  horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque) and a seven-speed automatic transmission.  Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive (4Matic) is optional. The  generous list of standard features starts with 19-inch alloy wheels, automatic  wipers, a sunroof, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, and a power  liftgate. </p>, <p>Inside,  you'll find dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable steering  wheel, heated front seats, a 10-way power driver seat (with four-way power  lumbar adjustment and memory functions), simulated leather upholstery,  Mercedes' COMAND electronics interface (with an 8-inch display) and an  eight-speaker audio system with a CD player and two USB ports. Standard  advanced safety features include a rearview camera, a forward collision warning  system and Mercedes' <a href="https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/mbrace">Mbrace telematics system</a>. </p>, <p>There  are three optional packages that encompass many of the features available for  the GLE-Class. The <strong>Premium 1</strong> package  is one of the most comprehensive for the GLE 350, adding keyless ignition and  entry, a navigation system, a touchpad controller for the central display,  satellite radio, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration, a  14-speaker premium Harman Kardon audio system, a 115-volt household-style power  outlet, a blind-spot monitoring system and a lane departure warning system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium 2</strong> package adds adaptive LED  headlights, automatic high-beam control, heated and cooled front cupholders,  interior ambient lighting, illuminated doorsills, rear-window sunshades and a  fold-down pass-through behind the rear-center armrest (not available on the GLE  550e). On top of that, the <strong>Premium 3 </strong>pack  features a 360-degree parking camera, adaptive cruise control, an automated  steering system, a collision avoidance system, lane departure intervention and  an automated parking system.</p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>GLE 550e</strong> not only includes  the plug-in hybrid powertrain — a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 and  electric motor provide a combined 436 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque  — but also adds leather upholstery and the contents of the Premium 1  package.</p>, <p>The  first of the performance-oriented models is the <strong>AMG GLE 43</strong>. It features a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (385 hp, 384  lb-ft), a nine-speed automatic transmission, 20-inch wheels, an AMG-tuned  adaptive air suspension, a sport exhaust, exterior styling upgrades, a  flat-bottom steering wheel, simulated leather upholstery and the contents of  the Premium 1 package. </p>, <p>Next  up is the <strong>AMG GLE 63</strong>, which adds a  stout turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 (550 hp, 516 lb-ft), upgraded brakes, summer  performance tires, active stabilizer bars, front and rear parking sensors, a  sport steering wheel, a 10-way power passenger seat (with four-way power lumbar  and memory functions), ventilated front seats, upgraded leather upholstery, a  faux-suede headliner and the contents of the Premium 2 package.</p>, <p>Finally,  there's the top-dog <strong>AMG GLE 63 S</strong>,  powered by a tuned version of the turbo V8 (577 hp, 561 lb-ft). It also adds 21-inch  wheels, a carbon-fiber engine cover and faux suede steering-wheel inserts.</p>, <p>Many  features included in the upper trims or packages can be added separately.  Notable stand-alone options include a panoramic sunroof, a trailer hitch,  tri-zone climate control, multicontour front seats with massage, ventilated  front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a rear-seat  entertainment system, and a 14-speaker Harman Kardon or a 14-speaker Bang &amp;  Olufsen premium audio system.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Coupe is  not for the faint of heart or practical of mind. </p>, <p>While most people buy crossovers for  their superior passenger and cargo space compared to sedans or wagons, the 2018  Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Coupe instead prioritizes style over utility. Relative  to the standard GLE-Class, the GLE Coupe's swoopy roofline reduces both rear  seat headroom and vertical storage space in the back. So if the  "utility" aspect of this SUV is compromised, where exactly does it  shine?</p>, <p>Ostensibly, the GLE-Class Coupe is more  interested in that "sport" bit. Most Mercedes-Benz vehicles offer a  variety of engines that run the gamut from fuel-efficient to tire-shredding.  The GLE-Class Coupe skips the boring stuff and comes in just two versions:  outlandish and ludicrous. The so-called base engine is a twin-turbo V6 churning  out nearly 400 horsepower, while the AMG 63 S' twin-turbo V8 cranks out nearly  600 hp. </p>, <p>Though the GLE Coupe absolutely stomps in  a straight line, Mercedes' engineers weren't able to do much to enhance this  vehicle's handling prowess. Even compared to some similarly designed  crossovers, the coupe just isn't much fun to drive. The end result is a vehicle  that isn't especially practical or sporty. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Coupe is  a five-passenger midsize SUV available in two trim levels: <strong>AMG GLE 43</strong> and <strong>AMG GLE 63 S</strong>.  Both can tow up to 7,200 pounds and are equipped with standard 4Matic all-wheel  drive. Despite their similar names, a vast gulf in price and performance  separates the two variants. The AMG GLE 43 is well-equipped as standard, and on  the whole it could be described as a reasonable alternative to everyday luxury  people movers. There's very little that's reasonable about the AMG GLE 63 S,  however, and its fans embrace its ludicrousness as a badge of honor.</p>]

[<p>Powering the <strong>AMG GLE 43</strong> is a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (385 horsepower, 384  pound-feet of torque) and a nine-speed automatic. Standard equipment highlights  include 21-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, a panoramic sunroof, a  power liftgate, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a power-adjustable steering wheel, heated front seats,  driver-seat memory settings, premium vinyl upholstery and a 115-volt  household-style power outlet.</p>, <p>Standard tech and safety features include  an 8-inch central display, the COMAND infotainment interface, a navigation  system, a 13-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning and intervention, and a  forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>Two primary options packages are  available for the GLE 43. The reasonably priced <strong>Premium 2</strong> package includes heated and cooled front cupholders,  interior ambient lighting, illuminated doorsills and a center pass-through for  the rear seat. The <strong>Premium 3</strong> pack  further adds a  360-degree parking camera, front and rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise  control, an automated steering system, a collision avoidance system, lane  departure mitigation and an automated parallel parking system.</p>, <p>It's a big step up pricewise to the <strong>AMG GLE 63 S</strong>. Under the hood is a  turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 (577 hp, 561 lb-ft of torque) mated to a seven-speed  automatic transmission. It adds 22-inch wheels, summer performance tires,  active stabilizer bars, bigger brakes, adaptive LED headlights, automatic  high-beam control, a carbon fiber engine cover, a 360-degree parking camera,  noise-reducing front-row windows, a sport steering wheel, heated and ventilated  front sport seats, front passenger memory settings, upgraded leather upholstery  and the contents of the Premium 2 package. It also includes the Premium 3  package's 360-degree parking camera and parking system.</p>, <p>There are a few appearance packages as  well. Both models can be equipped with the Night package, which adds  gloss-black lower valances and window surrounds. The GLE 43-only AMG  Performance Studio package includes the Night package plus an orange lip on the  front bumper, an orange stripe on the wheels and faux-suede seat inserts.</p>, <p>Notable stand-alone options include  tri-zone climate control, a premium 14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system,  multicontour massaging front seats, heated rear seats, a rear entertainment  system and a trailer hitch. Optional for the GLE 63 S is a performance exhaust  system. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 GLS-Class is Mercedes-Benz's flagship SUV. It's available with three  engines, a twin-turbo V6 (362 horsepower, 369 pound-feet of torque) in the GLS  450; a twin-turbo V8 (449 hp, 516 lb-ft) in the GLS 550; and an even more  powerful V8 (577 hp, 561 lb-ft) in the barnstorming GLS 63 AMG variant. The GLS  450 and GLS 550 are equipped with a nine-speed automatic transmission, while  the GLS 63 AMG comes with a seven-speed automatic. All GLS models feature  Mercedes-Benz's all-wheel-drive system called 4Matic. </p>, <p>Still,  outright performance is not what the GLS is about. Rather, the GLS is designed  to accommodate passengers and cargo with features such as second-row seats with  adjustable recline. And, in a pinch, seats can be stowed and moved for flexible  cargo requirements. With optional features, all of this can be done  electronically at the touch of a button.</p>, <p>Thanks  to its street-oriented suspension, the GLS rides smoothly over the road, giving  drivers and passengers one of the most serene experiences in its class. And yet  an available body roll control system and sport-oriented suspension can firm up  the handling.</p>, <p>Some  buyers may hesitate once they see the price, particularly if it's a  well-equipped example. And others may find the size and dynamics too big and  too soft, respectively. But the GLS is levels above the cutthroat midsize SUV  and crossover market, and it dominates in the full-size segment by bringing an  S-class to the SUV fight.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a seven-passenger, large luxury SUV that's  offered in three models. The <strong>GLS 450 </strong>is  the base model that's well equipped but doesn't include many of the higher-end  features you might expect in an luxury SUV. The <strong>GLS 550</strong>, ups the power and includes many features that are optional  on the GLS 450. Finally, performance aficionados will be drawn to the  ultra-powerful <strong>AMG GLS 63</strong>. All three  feature standard all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>GLS 450 </strong>comes with a  turbocharged V6 engine (362 hp, 369 lb-ft), 19-inch alloy wheels, a  self-leveling air suspension, power-folding and auto-dimming side mirrors, LED  running lights and taillights, roof rails, a power liftgate and Mbrace Connect  remote vehicle access (via smartphone app; includes remote start).</p>, <p>Interior highlights include premium vinyl upholstery, heated front seats, a  10-way power driver seat (with four-way power lumbar adjustment), driver-seat  memory settings, a power-adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, genuine wood trim and dual-zone automatic climate  control. Technology highlights include the COMAND infotainment interface (with  both a control knob and a touchpad), an 8-inch central display, a rearview camera,  Bluetooth, a 115-volt household-style power outlet, and a sound system that  features HD radio and dual USB ports.</p>, <p>An available Premium package adds keyless entry and ignition, a power front  passenger seat with memory settings, lighted door sills and multicolor ambient  lighting, a navigation system with real-time traffic, voice controls, Apple  CarPlay and satellite radio, as well as lane keeping assist and blind-spot  monitoring<strong>.</strong></p>, <p>The Lighting package bundles adaptive LED headlights and automatic high beams.  The Parking Assist package adds front and rear parking sensors, an automated  parallel parking system and a surround-view camera system. Also available are  three-zone automatic climate control, ventilated front seats, leather  upholstery, a 13-speaker Harman Kardon sound system with a CD/DVD player, an SD  card reader, and multicontour front seats that add a massaging feature and  adjustable side bolsters and shoulder supports.</p>, <p>The <strong>GLS 550 </strong>starts with all of the  above as standard, but it uses a twin-turbo V8 engine (449 hp, 516 lb-ft). It  also adds 21-inch alloy wheels, adaptive suspension dampers, sporty exterior  styling cues, soft-close doors and upgraded interior trim (including wood  steering-wheel inserts). The optional Night package throws in 21-inch black  wheels and gloss-black exterior accents.</p>, <p>Optional items on both the GLS 450 and GLS 550 include a panoramic sunroof,  heated second-row seats, diamond-quilted leather upholstery and the Driver  Assistance package, which adds adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist,  blind-spot monitoring, and front and rear collision mitigation. Also available  is an Off-Road package that includes an upgraded multimode terrain selector, a  dual-range transfer case and front underbody protection; on the GLS 450, it  also adds the GLS 550's standard adaptive dampers.</p>, <p>The high-performance <strong>AMG GLS 63</strong> starts with most of the above and adds an even more powerful turbocharged V8  (577 hp, 561 lb-ft), a sport exhaust, exclusive 21-inch alloy wheels, a  sport-tuned suspension, upgraded brakes, adaptive stabilizer bars (the Active  Curve System in Mercedes-speak), AMG-specific styling elements inside and out,  enhanced bolstering for the front seats, upgraded leather upholstery and a  flat-bottom sport steering wheel.</p>, <p>All three GL models can also be outfitted with a trailer hitch, a heated  steering wheel, power-sliding second-row seats for improved third-row access,  rear side-window sunshades, a rear entertainment system, a Wi-Fi hotspot and a  14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p>]

[<p>If you're one of the rare individuals who wants more features, refinement and  performance than a Mercedes-Benz S-Class delivers, you're in luck. The 2018  Mercedes-Benz Maybach Sedan is an excellent upgrade. It's almost twice the  price of the base S-Class on which it is based, but for the money you get  pretty much every S-Class option available and many that are exclusive to the  Maybach.</p>, <p>In a way, though, you could view the  Maybach as a value play. It competes with other ultra-premium luxury sedans  from Rolls-Royce and Bentley that cost perhaps a third more. Compared to the  competition, the Maybach benefits from more technological items that enhance  comfort and performance as well as add some automated driving and advanced  safety features.</p>, <p>Holding it back, however, is its  similarity to the more common S-Class. In a segment in which exclusivity weighs  heavily, this is one of the Maybach's few drawbacks.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz Maybach Sedan is available in <strong>S 560 4Matic</strong> and <strong>S 650</strong> trims. The <strong>S 560 4Matic</strong> is powered  by a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 (463 horsepower, 516 pound-feet of torque) that  is paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Mercedes' 4Matic  all-wheel-drive system is included. The<strong> S 650</strong> upgrades to a turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 (621 hp, 738 lb-ft) mated to  a seven-speed transmission that sends power to the rear wheels.</p>]

[<p>The  comprehensive list of standard features is identical for both trims, starting  with 20-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, automatic wipers, soft-close doors,  a hands-free trunklid, an adaptive air suspension, a panoramic sunroof, a  heated windshield, and keyless entry and ignition.</p>, <p>On  the inside, you get a head-up display, four-zone automatic climate control,  extensive premium leather upholstery, a heated wood- and leather-trimmed  steering wheel, wood interior trim, heated and ventilated multicontour front  and rear seats with memory and massage functions, a power footrest for the  right rear seat, heated armrests, power rear sunshades, and heated rear seats.  You'll also find an IWC analog clock, a 12.3-inch virtual gauge display,  interior ambient lighting, and an air fragrancer with the Energizing Comfort  system, which combines audio, climate, fragrance and massage to enhance  comfort.</p>, <p>Also  included on the Maybach are a household power outlet, a 12.3-inch display,  Mercedes' COMAND infotainment system, a navigation system, Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto, wireless charging pads and a 13-speaker Burmester premium audio  system.</p>, <p>On  the advanced safety feature and driver assist front, you get automatic high  beams, a surround-view camera system, a night-vision camera system, automatic  speed limit adjustment, an automated parking system, adaptive cruise control,  forward and cross-traffic collision warning with automatic braking, emergency  evasive steering, active blind-spot assist, active lane-change assist, lane  keeping and crosswind assist, a pre-collision hearing protection system,  airbags built into the rear shoulder belts, and a drowsy-driver monitoring  system with emergency stop assist.</p>, <p>Options  include various wheel and interior trim choices; Magic Sky Control, which  offers a dimmable sunroof tint; a rear center console, which reduces passenger  capacity to four; dual rear entertainment systems; folding rear-seat tables; a  refrigerated box between the rear seatbacks; heated and cooled cupholders; and  silver Champagne flutes from Robbe &amp; Berking.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Metris is unique  because it's the only van on the market that's sized between small and  full-size commercial vans. As such, the Sprinter offers enhanced capability  compared to those small vans but a more maneuverable size than the larger  full-size vans.</p>, <p>It features a no-nonsense and functional  interior and is available in two overall configurations: cargo and passenger.  Both configurations are available in different wheelbases and rear door  configurations, and the passenger version can be equipped as a five-, seven- or  eight-seater. </p>, <p>The cargo version is available with  tie-downs, interior panels, and upfitter packages that are designed for the  wear and tear of commercial transportation duty. And since it's a Mercedes, you  can equip the Metris with an array of upscale features, including simulated  leather upholstery, automatic climate control, blind-spot monitoring and lane  departure warning.</p>, <p>There is one hurdle to ownership, though,  and it's the price. If you're a fleet operator only interested in the bottom  line, another small van might suit you better. But overall we think the  Mercedes Metris provides enough value to justify its asking price. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Metris is  available in four versions and can be outfitted for cargo duty (with a  completely open space behind the front bucket seats) or as a five-, seven- or  eight-seat passenger van. The Metris <strong>Cargo</strong> is the one with an expansive cargo area, while the <strong>Passenger</strong> fills that space with two rows of seating. There are also <strong>Worker Cargo</strong> and <strong>Worker Passenger</strong> versions that cost  less than their non-Worker counterparts in exchange for a shorter list of  available features. An extended-wheelbase version is offered for the Metris  Cargo only.</p>]

[<p>Powering  the Metris is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (208 horsepower,  258 pound-feet of torque) that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed  automatic transmission. Standard features include 17-inch steel wheels,  automatic headlights, remote locking and unlocking, air conditioning,  wheel-mounted shift paddles, Bluetooth, and a five-speaker audio system with a  USB port. </p>, <p>Some  additional standard features depend on which Metris you buy. A 5.8-inch color  screen is included on standard models and optional on Worker models, which  otherwise come with a simple monochrome display. Passenger and Worker Passenger  models also get a rearview mirror, rear air conditioning and a nine-speaker  audio system. All Metris vans have sliding rear doors. Farther back, you'll  find 270-degree swing-out rear cargo doors standard on the Metris Cargo. All  others get 180-degree rear cargo doors.</p>, <p>The  list of available option packages for <strong>Worker  Cargo</strong> is relatively short. You can get the Convenience<strong> </strong>package (automatic wipers, heated mirrors, a rearview camera,  cruise control, the color display and LED cargo area lighting) and the Utility  package<strong> </strong>(Convenience package plus  roof rails, a rearview mirror, a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel,  a driver information display, a heated rear window, blind-spot monitoring,  rails on the cargo floor and sides, and tie-downs). </p>, <p>On the <strong>Worker Passenger</strong>, there's also  the Appearance<strong> </strong>package (Convenience  package plus alloy wheels, body-colored bumpers, roof rails, a rear liftgate  instead of the swing-out cargo doors, a heated rear window and simulated  leather upholstery) and Comfort package (all contents of the Utility and  Appearance packages plus power-sliding rear doors).</p>, <p>Options  are broken apart into more cost-effective packages in the <strong>Cargo</strong> and <strong>Passenger</strong> models, allowing buyers to mix and match the features they want. Notable  combinations include the Cold Weather package (heated front seats, a heated  windshield washer system and an upgraded heater); the Premium Safety package  (Utility package plus lane departure warning, forward collision warning and  automated parallel parking); and the Driver Comfort package (a comfort-tuned  suspension and upgraded seats with lumbar support).</p>, <p>Many  of the options listed above are offered as stand-alone choices, as are a  trailer hitch, rear privacy glass, chrome interior trim and a backup alarm.  Mercedes' MasterUpfitter program allows buyers to further customize Metris  Cargo vans to their business needs.</p>]

[<p>As the current generation Mercedes-Benz  S-Class reaches the halfway point in its life cycle, it receives the customary  refreshening to keep it competitive against newer rivals. Those include the BMW  7 Series, Porsche Panamera and next year's redesigned Audi A8. To its credit,  the S-Class would have remained a top pick in the premium luxury sedan class  without the subtle styling tweaks and added features. That's how good it  already was.</p>, <p>A slightly more affordable S 450 model  debuts this year. Its V6 is down on horsepower compared to the S 560's larger  V6, but otherwise it has the same exhaustive list of features. It's the best  value here. The new driver assistance features aren't as well-executed as we  would have expected, or as advanced as they might be portrayed, so we're more  inclined to pass on those options. What you're left with is a stately sedan  with an impeccable interior and a smooth ride that keeps occupants blissfully  isolated from the harsh outside world. Quite simply, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz  S-Class exceeds expectations.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is available as a five-passenger sedan,  four-passenger coupe and convertible (cabriolet). </p>]

[<p>The <strong>S450 </strong>is available as a sedan only  while the <strong>S560</strong>, <strong>AMG</strong> <strong>S63</strong> and <strong>AMG</strong> <strong>S65 </strong>are offered in all three body styles. The main difference among  these trims is what's under the hood. </p>, <p>Starting  things off is the <strong>S450 </strong>sedan. It's powered  by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine (362 horsepower, 369 pound-feet of  torque) that sends power to the rear wheels through a nine-speed automatic  transmission. Mercedes' 4Matic all-wheel-drive system is available as an  option.</p>, <p>The <strong>S560</strong> has a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8  engine (463 hp, 516 lb-ft) but is otherwise equipped similarly. The  all-wheel-drive system is standard on the S560 coupe but not available on the  convertible. </p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights include adaptive LED headlights, auto-dimming and  power-folding mirrors, a panoramic sunroof, a power trunklid, an air-ride  adaptive suspension, keyless ignition and soft-close doors. On the inside, you  get a virtual instrument panel, leather upholstery, 16-way power-adjustable  front seats (with heating and memory functions), an air fragrancer and a power  rear sunshade. </p>, <p>On  the tech front, the S-Class comes with remote control over some features via a  smartphone app, a wireless charging pad, a 115-volt household power outlet, a  12.3-inch display with Mercedes' COMAND infotainment system, a navigation  system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a 13-speaker Burmester  surround-sound system. Standard safety features include forward collision  warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, lane departure  warning, and a drowsy driver warning system. </p>, <p>The  S560 coupe and convertible add ventilated front seats, premium leather and an  automated parking system but go without the household power outlet and rear  sunshade. The convertible also features a folding soft top, Airscarf neck  heating, and the Aircap system that deploys wind blockers atop the windshield  and between the rear headrests.</p>, <p>Naturally,  Mercedes offers a wealth of options to further solidify the S-Class' luxury  status. You'll probably want the Premium package, which includes front  multicontour seats with massage functions with instant heating and a  surround-view camera system for the coupe and convertible while the sedan also  adds ventilated front seats, power rear sunshades and the automated parking  system. A head-up display is also included for the coupe and convertible. If  safety is a priority, the Driver Assistance package bundles a wide assortment  of advanced driver safety aids. </p>, <p>To  keep rear passengers completely comfortable, there's the Executive Rear Seat  package for the sedans with its multicontour seats with massage functions and a  power-reclining right rear seat with ottoman and seat cushion airbags. There's  also an optional Executive Rear Seat Plus package that replaces the center seat  with a console and includes an entertainment system and refrigerated  compartment.</p>, <p>Other  add-ons include Magic Sky Control (dimming tint for the sunroof), Magic Body Control  (a predictive suspension for sedans with a tilting function when cornering), a  night-vision camera, a head-up display, a rear-seat wireless charging pad and a  26-speaker premium Burmester audio system.</p>, <p>The <strong>AMG S63</strong> has a sportier take on  luxury with a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 (603 hp, 664 lb-ft). A  performance-tuned all-wheel-drive system is standard along with unique exterior  treatments. The <strong>AMG S65</strong> ups the ante  with a turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 (621 hp, 738 lb-ft) and is only available  with rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The  AMG models include the Premium package, 20-inch wheels, upgraded brakes, an  adaptive sport suspension, a sport exhaust, unique sport modes and performance  apps, the surround-view camera and an IWC clock (sedan only). The S65 adds  further enticement with standard Magic Body Control, a leather headliner, the  premium audio system and the night-vision system.</p>]

[<p>On  the heels of a major update last year, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class roadster  maintains its top position in the luxury convertible segment. Of course, all  four engine options provide prodigious power, and the SL-Class' adaptive  suspension soaks up the bumps and provides excellent agility when the road gets  twisty. But it's the integration of these sporty attributes with a plush and  quiet cabin, in addition to a few choice luxury features, that makes the  SL-Class the gold standard for luxury convertibles.</p>, <p>The  SL-Class' power-retractable hardtop comes with a glass roof, which can be  further optioned with an electrochromic feature that uses an electric current  to adjust its opacity for when you want the view without the exposure to the  elements. Alternately, Mercedes' Airscarf system blows warm air from the base  of the headrest to keep necks warm on those top-down drives when you want just  a little exposure. And a power-retractable wind deflector mitigates buffeting  when top-down cruising at highway speeds for conversations and minimal  hair-tussling.</p>, <p>There  are sportier convertibles available. If that's what you want, look no further  than Mercedes' own AMG GT, perhaps. But for an expert balance of both luxury  and sport, there's nothing better than the SL-Class.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class is a two-seat convertible with a power-folding  hardtop and is available in four trim levels. The base <strong>SL 450</strong> is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (362 horsepower,  369 pound-feet) and sends power to the rear wheels through a nine-speed  automatic transmission. The <strong>SL 550</strong> ups the power with a turbocharged 4.7-liter V8 (449 hp, 516 lb-ft). The <strong>AMG SL 63</strong> comes with a bigger turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 (577 hp,  664 lb-ft), a seven-speed automatic and special performance hardware and  styling elements. Finally, the <strong>AMG SL 65</strong> tops the group with its  turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 (621 hp, 738 lb-ft) and the seven-speed automatic. </p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>SL 450</strong> include  19-inch wheels, a power windblocker, LED headlights and running lights,  automatic high beams, headlight washers, automatic wipers, a panoramic sunroof,  front and rear parking sensors, forward collision warning and mitigation,  keyless entry and ignition, selectable drive modes and an adaptive suspension.</p>, <p>Inside,  you get dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable steering wheel,  sun-reflecting leather upholstery, power-adjustable heated seats, a navigation  system, voice controls, Mercedes' Mbrace emergency communications, the COMAND  infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, two USB ports, and an  11-speaker Harman Kardon sound system with a six-CD changer and satellite and  HD radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>SL 550</strong> adds AMG-branded 19-inch  wheels, a power trunklid with hands-free activation, an automated parking  system, the Airscarf neck-level heater, and ventilated seats with active side  bolsters and massage functions.</p>, <p>The <strong>AMG SL 63</strong> receives a  high-performance drive and suspension settings, Active Body Control (which  mitigates body roll while cornering), upgraded brakes, a limited-slip  differential, unique AMG gauges and other AMG-themed aesthetic flourishes, a  dashtop analog clock made by International Watch Co., upgraded leather  upholstery, and a simulated-suede headliner. </p>, <p>At  the top of the SL food chain is the <strong>AMG  SL 65</strong>, which gets staggered-diameter wheels (19-inch front, 20-inch rear),  adaptive LED headlights, the Magic Sky Control electrochromic dimming roof,  soft-closing doors, adaptive cruise control, rear collision mitigation,  blind-spot monitoring, lane keeping assist, and a 12-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen  sound system.</p>, <p>Most  of the fancier trims' premium features are optional on lesser models. All SLs  are eligible for a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot and many interior upholstery and trim  upgrades. AMG models can be outfitted with carbon-ceramic brakes and  carbon-fiber exterior trim.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Mercedes-Benz SL 63 AMG </strong>(turbo  5.5L V8 | 7-speed automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current SL-Class has received some revisions  but our findings remain applicable to this year's SL-Class.</p>]

[<p>The  current generation of the SLC has undergone many changes since its introduction  in 2011. Back then, it was called the SLK and could be outfitted with a hot-rod  V8. That V8 is no longer around, but the core appeal of the 2018 Mercedes-Benz  SLC is the same: It serves as a compact version of the brand's flagship  convertible SL, offering similar design and prestige at a lower price. </p>, <p>The  SLC's two trim levels are defined by the available engines: a four-cylinder and  a more powerful V6. Though the bigger engine comes with sportier equipment,  both SLCs offer the same options. Determining what's right for you just depends  on how fast you want to go. </p>, <p>Overall,  the 2018 SLC's luxury focus helps distinguish it from the rest. It's the only  one with a convertible hardtop, for instance. But all the same, it's probably  worth checking out rivals such as the all-wheel-drive Audi TT, the muscular  Chevrolet Corvette, and the sporty Porsche 718 Boxster.</p>]

[<p>The  two-seat 2018 Mercedes-Benz SLC Convertible is available in two trim levels  that are differentiated by their engines. The <strong>SLC 300</strong> has a turbocharged four-cylinder, while the sporting <strong>AMG SLC 43 </strong>offers a powerful turbo V6.  The latter also comes with more standard equipment and performance-oriented  features including upgraded brakes and paddle shifters. Both cars have a  nine-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive and offer the same  option packages. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>SLC 300</strong> employs a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (241 horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque).  Standard features include a power-retractable hardtop with a fixed glass roof  panel, 17-inch alloy wheels, xenon headlights, Bluetooth, power-adjustable  seats with memory function, simulated-leather upholstery, a rearview camera, a  7-inch infotainment display, and an eight-speaker audio system with HD radio.  Safety features include integrated roll bars and a forward collision alert and  mitigation system. </p>, <p>Shoppers  can choose from one of three Premium packages. The first brings an upgraded  Harman Kardon sound system, heated seats, keyless ignition and entry, and  blind-spot monitoring. It also includes Mercedes' Airscarf system, which blows  warm air around your neck from the seat for drop-top driving on cool days. The  Premium 2 package includes the aforementioned features and adds navigation, LED  headlights, dual-zone climate control, and support for Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay. The Premium 3 package brings driver assistance features such as  adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist. </p>, <p>The <strong>AMG SLC 43 </strong>derives its name  — somehow — from its twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 (362 hp, 384  lb-ft of torque). Along with a more potent engine, this trim level comes  standard with the Premium 1 package. Due to its sporty nature, the SLC 43 also  has 18-inch wheels, cross-drilled brake rotors, a sport exhaust system, a  steering wheel lined with simulated suede, and paddle shifters. </p>, <p>Aside  from the Premium 2 and 3 packages described above, the SLC 43 is also available  with the AMG Handling package that adds a limited-slip differential, a  sport-tuned suspension, a steering wheel with synthetic suede inserts, and an  IWC analog clock.</p>]

[<p>The original Clubman was a slightly stretched version of the Mini Hardtop with  a reverse-opening side passenger door and a distinctive swing-out tailgate  arrangement. The latest-generation Clubman takes a more conventional approach  to car design, though. Regular rear doors take the place of the reverse-opening  one, and it's now significantly larger than the four-door Hardtop. It's 3  inches wider; it rides on a wheelbase that's 4 inches longer; and it's nearly a  foot longer end to end. Predictably, these changes have resulted in a lot more  weight, and the Clubman feels blunted somewhat as a result. </p>, <p>Yet the Clubman rides better than the  Hardtop, and it will carry a lot more. Life is full of compromises, and this  car is an example of that. At least the trim levels on offer don't hold  anything back: You can option out a Clubman in a variety of ways to suit a  variety of dispositions. At the base end, the Cooper sips the least fuel to the  tune of 27 mpg in combined city/highway driving. The fastest Clubman is the  John Cooper Works. But we reckon the sweet spot in the range is the Cooper S,  which balances performance with value.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mini Clubman is for people who love the driving and handling  characteristics of a Mini but need more rear-seat room and cargo space than the  four-door Hardtop model provides. It's available in three trims that are mostly  differentiated by the engine lying underhood. The <strong>Cooper </strong>and<strong> Cooper S</strong> are  relatively close in price, while the <strong>John  Cooper Works</strong> version is significantly pricier (though its list of  additional performance items is impressive). A staggering number of styling,  performance and luxury upgrades are available on all models.</p>]

[<p>Powering  the <strong>Cooper </strong>is a turbocharged  three-cylinder engine (134 horsepower, 162 pound-feet of torque) paired to your  choice of a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. It's got a  ton of standard features, including 16-inch alloy wheels, run-flat tires, automatic  headlights and wipers, heated mirrors, rear parking sensors, dual-zone  automatic climate control, selectable driving modes, height-adjustable front  seats, simulated leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, a 60/40-split folding rear seat and multicolor ambient  lighting. Among the standard tech items are Bluetooth, a 6.5-inch central  display, smartphone app integration, a rearview camera, and a six-speaker sound  system with HD radio and a USB port.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>Cooper S</strong> adds a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (189 hp, 207 lb-ft) mated to the  six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic (steering-wheel-mounted paddle  shifters are optional). It also gets 17-inch wheels, dual exhaust tips, extra  styling flourishes, foglights, and front sport seats with adjustable thigh  support.</p>, <p>At  the top of the Clubman range lies the <strong>John  Cooper Works</strong> trim. Motivated by a more potent version of the turbocharged  four-cylinder (228 hp, 258 lb-ft), this Clubman comes only with all-wheel  drive. Upgrades include 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, a rear spoiler, a  sport-tuned suspension, keyless entry, rear parking sensors, a sport steering  wheel, and simulated suede and cloth upholstery.</p>, <p>Though  some of the available packages are trim-specific, a few can be ordered on any  Clubman variant. These include the <strong>Cold  Weather</strong> (auto-dimming mirrors and heated front seats) and <strong>Premium </strong>(keyless ignition and entry, a  panoramic sunroof, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system and, for the John  Cooper Works trim, adaptive LED headlights) packages. There's also a <strong>Technology </strong>package, which adds an  automated parking system, front and rear parking sensors, an 8.8-inch  touchscreen, a navigation system, a head-up display, Apple CarPlay smartphone  integration and wireless device charging.</p>, <p>Both  Cooper and Cooper S can be ordered with the <strong>Sport </strong>package, which adds 17-inch wheels (Cooper only), adaptive  suspension dampers, LED foglights (Cooper S only) and LED headlights. These two  trims can be ordered with a <strong>Fully Loaded</strong> package, which bundles the Premium, Sport and Technology packages. The <strong>JCW Exterior</strong> and <strong>Interior </strong>packages add special design flourishes from Mini's John  Cooper Works performance division.</p>, <p>Many  of these items can be ordered individually. Other notable options include  adaptive cruise control, various wheel designs (17-, 18- and 19-inch), black or  white hood stripes, roof rails, a rear foglight, power-adjustable front seats  (with driver-seat memory functions), a 40/20/40-split rear seat, cloth  upholstery, leather and cloth upholstery, full leather upholstery, various  interior trim pieces, satellite radio and a space-saver spare tire.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Mini Clubman Cooper Hatchback</strong> (turbo 1.5L inline-3 | 6-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE: Since this test was conducted, the current Clubman has received some  revisions, including touchscreen functionality for the upgraded central  display. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Clubman.</p>]

[<p>As  its name suggests, the 2018 Mini Convertible is the drop-top version of the  two-door Mini Hardtop. It has the same fun-to-drive nature as the Hardtop, but  its power-operated soft top gives you the option of warming up to the sun's  rays.</p>, <p>As  with all other Minis, the Convertible's base price is just a jumping-off point  to a list of seemingly endless options. Check enough boxes and the price  escalates with shocking quickness. But the Mini's extensive paint, interior and  performance combinations are also what set it apart, giving owners a degree of  personalization unlike any others. Want 18-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension,  and taillights with an inset Union Jack design? Done.</p>, <p>But  at its core, the Mini Convertible is an exceptionally fun car to drive, whether  it's powered by the base three-cylinder engine, the 189-horsepower midlevel  engine, or the highly caffeinated 228-hp turbo four-cylinder in the John Cooper  Works trim. The Mini always feels playful and engaging, its tires firmly  embedded in the asphalt. The trade-off is a firm, and at times harsh ride,  especially with larger wheels. </p>, <p>And  so while no other small convertible can match the Mini's level of  customization, there are others worth considering, notably the Fiat 124 Spider,  Mazda MX-5 Miata and even the Volkswagen Beetle convertible. But even among  this group, the Mini Convertible's charm and likability stand out. It's that  good. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mini Convertible is a compact  convertible that seats four and is available in <strong>base</strong> (Cooper), <strong>Cooper S </strong>and  high-performance <strong>John Cooper Works</strong> trims. The <strong>base Cooper</strong> trim serves  as a great starting point for customization, but the attractive base price can  escalate quickly as you tack on desirable options. The <strong>Cooper S</strong> adds larger wheels and more power and performance, while  the <strong>John Cooper Works</strong> is the highest  performer of the bunch, with a cranked-up turbo engine and a sport-tuned  suspension. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>base  Cooper</strong> starts with a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine (134  horsepower, 162 pound-feet of torque) paired with a six-speed manual  transmission and front-wheel drive. A six-speed automatic transmission is  optional. </p>, <p>Standard  features include a power-operated fabric convertible roof (with sunrooflike  function), 15-inch alloy wheels, an electronic limited-slip differential,  automatic headlights and wipers, heated mirrors, push-button ignition, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a cooled glovebox, cruise control, premium  vinyl upholstery, and 50/50-split folding rear seatbacks. Technology highlights  include a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, Bluetooth, smartphone app  integration, a 6.5-inch display screen, and a six-speaker sound system with HD  radio, a USB port and an auxiliary input jack.</p>, <p>The <strong>Cooper S</strong> adds a more powerful  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (189 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque), a  hood scoop, dual center-mounted exhaust tips, 16-inch wheels with run-flat  tires (regular tires are optional), LED foglights and sport front seats.</p>, <p>The <strong>John Cooper Works</strong> trim ratchets up  the performance index with a hotter turbo four-cylinder engine (228 hp, 236 lb-ft),  17-inch wheels, upgraded Brembo front brakes, a sport-tuned suspension, LED  headlights, an aerodynamic body kit, a rear spoiler, a sport steering wheel,  and special seats with cloth upholstery. The standard suspension is available  as a no-cost option for the JCW.</p>, <p>There  are many stand-alone options, but most are bundled into packages. The Premium  package consists of keyless entry, heated front seats, satellite radio,  auto-dimming mirrors, and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system. The Sport  package includes adjustable suspension dampers, a choice of 17- or 18-inch  wheels, sport seats, and LED headlights and foglights. The Technology package  bundles a self-parking system with front and rear parking sensors, a navigation  system, a touchpad controller, and an 8.8-inch display screen. The Fully Loaded  package combines all three packages. John Cooper Works interior and exterior  packages are also available. As the package names suggest, they kit out the two  lower trim levels with a choice of leather cabin materials and JCW performance  parts. </p>, <p>Notable  stand-alone options include adaptive cruise control, a head-up display, and  various combinations of cloth or leather upholstery. Even more personalization  is available through a large selection of custom details such as hood stripes,  mirror cap choices and special interior trim pieces.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Mini Cooper S Convertible</strong> (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed manual | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Mini Convertible has received only  minor revisions.

[<p>Even though its beefy dimensions easily  make it the largest vehicle in Mini's lineup, the 2018 Countryman keeps the  playful spirit of the brand intact. With a comparatively roomy cabin and  decently sized cargo area, this is the Mini to get if you plan on bringing  friends along for the ride. It's also a great choice if you want a fun and  highly customizable crossover with more personality than the others. Either  way, new additions for 2018 ensure the Mini Countryman offers something for  everyone.</p>, <p>Two new models — the sporty  John Cooper Works and fuel-efficient Countryman S E plug-in hybrid —  join the roster this year. Like other JCW variants across Mini's lineup, this  high-octane thriller boosts the output of the turbocharged four-cylinder to 228  horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. And yes, you can get it with a manual  transmission. The S E plug-in hybrid is unique to the Countryman. It takes the  Cooper's turbocharged three-cylinder and pairs it to an electric motor, giving  it 12 miles of all-electric range. It also offers significant horsepower and  torque gains while achieving the same combined fuel economy as the standard  car.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mini Countryman is a sporty and  fun alternative to the standard set of small crossovers and wagons. The  Countryman earns the premium price tag it carries by offering a substantial  list of standard features, while a plethora of available options allows buyers  to customize the Countryman to their heart's content. All four trims  — <strong>Cooper</strong>, <strong>Cooper S</strong>, <strong>John Cooper Works</strong> and <strong>Cooper  S E </strong>— have similar feature content but are differentiated by the  engines underhood. Whichever you get, you'll be rewarded with a Mini that prioritizes  passenger space and driving thrills in equal measure. </p>]

[<p>Powering  the base front-wheel-drive <strong>Cooper </strong>is  a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine (134 horsepower, 162 pound-feet  of torque) matched to your choice of a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic  transmission. On the all-wheel-drive Countryman All4, the automatic  transmission has eight speeds.</p>, <p>You  get a lot of features with the Countryman, including 17-inch wheels, summer  performance run-flat tires, automatic wipers, heated mirrors, a heated  windshield wiper system, roof rails, a panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and  ignition, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, adjustable driving modes,  height-adjustable front seats, 40/20/40-split rear seats, simulated leather  upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting, Bluetooth, a  6.5-inch display screen and a six-speaker audio system. Selecting all-wheel  drive also adds heated front seats.</p>, <p>Our  pick is the next-level <strong>Cooper S</strong>. It  has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (189 hp, 207 lb-ft) mated to  an eight-speed automatic transmission. It also gets 18-inch wheels, LED  headlights and foglights, front sport seats and additional stability control  choices. A six-speed manual is standard with all-wheel drive models, with the  eight-speed auto optional. </p>, <p>As  opposed to the Cooper and Cooper S, all-wheel drive is standard on the next two  models. The <strong>John Cooper Works</strong> trim  adds an even more powerful version of the turbocharged four-cylinder (228 hp,  258 lb-ft); the manual is standard and the eight-speed auto is optional.  Additional features include aerodynamic modifications, a rear spoiler, a  sport-tuned suspension and aggressively bolstered front seats. LED foglights  are not available.</p>, <p>The <strong>Cooper S E</strong> is quite different from  the rest of the lineup. Up front is the Cooper's turbocharged three-cylinder  engine that drives the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission.  In back, and driving the rear wheels, is an electric motor powered by a  rechargeable 7.6 kWh battery pack. Mini says total combined output for the S E  is 221 hp and 284 lb-ft. EPA estimated all-electric driving range is 12 miles.  The Cooper S E's feature content is identical to that of the Cooper S, though  it's the only model in the range to not have a panoramic sunroof standard.</p>, <p>Though  all models typically draw from the same pool of options packages, the <strong>Sport </strong>package is unique to the Cooper.  It includes the 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and foglights, and sport seats  from the Cooper S, along with adaptive suspension dampers. The Cooper's <strong>Cold Weather</strong> package adds heated front  seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>, <p>Other  packages can be outfitted to all models. If you're looking for additional  luxury and storage features, there's the <strong>Convenience </strong>package (rear armrest, vehicle alarm, cargo divider, and a choice between a  cargo area flip-out seating cushion or spare tire) and <strong>Premium </strong>package (power-adjustable front seats, a 12-speaker Harman  Kardon audio system, tinted glass, a hands-free power liftgate, and, for the  Cooper S E, the panoramic sunroof). The <strong>Technology </strong>package includes a wealth of upgrades, including front parking sensors, an  8.8-inch touchscreen, navigation, a head-up display, wireless phone charging,  Apple CarPlay and an automated parallel parking system.

[<p>While financial considerations typically  drive the purchase of a subcompact car, the 2018 Mini Hardtop is something else  entirely. It has the hallmarks of a tiny coupe, such as limited cargo volume  and a mostly useless back seat, but the Hardtop has some qualities that justify  its high price tag.</p>, <p>Unlike other pint-size runabouts, the  Hardtop emphasizes quality. Its elegant cabin is trimmed with upscale  materials, and the precision switchgear bears no resemblance to the flimsy  buttons you'll find in other cars in the class.</p>, <p>Subcompacts are often a snooze to drive,  but the Cooper Hardtop bucks this trend with its excellent handling. It  absolutely flies around corners, allowing you to have some fun and do your best<em> Italian Job</em> impression even if you  don't opt for one of the more powerful engines. And with more customization  options than any vehicle less expensive than a Porsche, your Mini can be  tailored down to the design of the mirror caps.</p>, <p>There are drawbacks, of course. With so  many options available, your perfect car will be hard to find on a dealer lot,  and custom orders can quickly reach stratospheric prices as you add features  such as an upgraded engine, navigation and leather seats. And on a more  intrinsic level, the small wheelbase, sporty suspension and low-profile tires  mean the ride is almost always choppy. </p>, <p>The two-door Mini Hardtop offers far more  personality and fun than you'll get in most any other small car, though. If you  can set aside the rough ride and limited interior space, you might just find  that the 2018 Mini Hardtop is worth the premium paid.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mini Hardtop two-door hatchback  is sold in three trims, each with its own powertrain. The <strong>Cooper </strong>is fairly expensive for a subcompact, but its high-quality  materials and playful personality elevate it far above the rest of the class.  The <strong>Cooper S</strong> adds a turbocharged  four-cylinder engine and a few performance goodies, well worth its extra cost.  The <strong>John Cooper Works</strong> tops the  Hardtop range, with extra power under the hood, an exterior body kit and a  sport-tuned suspension. </p>]

[<p>The base <strong>Cooper </strong>is powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine  (134 horsepower, 162 pound-feet of torque) that drives the front wheels via a  six-speed manual or an automatic transmission. Standard features include 15-inch alloy wheels, an electronic  limited-slip differential, automatic headlights and wipers, heated mirrors, a  rearview camera, rear parking sensors, keyless ignition, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, a cooled glovebox,  height-adjustable front seats, simulated leather upholstery and 60/40-split  folding rear seatbacks. Technology highlights include Bluetooth, smartphone app  integration, a 6.5-inch display screen, and a six-speaker sound system with HD  radio and a USB port.</p>, <p>The <strong>Cooper S </strong>adds a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (189 hp, 207 lb-ft), a hood scoop, dual  center-mounted exhaust tips, 16-inch wheels with run-flat tires (regular tires  are optional), LED foglights, sport seats and adjustable driving modes.</p>, <p>Going  with the <strong>John Cooper Works</strong> gets you  a more powerful version of the Cooper S motor (228 hp, 236 lb-ft) plus 17-inch  wheels, Brembo front brakes, a sport-tuned suspension, LED headlights, an  aerodynamic body kit, a rear spoiler, a sport steering wheel and special seats  with cloth upholstery. The standard suspension is available as a no-cost option  for the JCW.</p>, <p>Although  there are many stand-alone options, most are bundled into packages, most of  which are available on all three trims. The <strong>Premium</strong> package consists of keyless entry, a dual-pane sunroof and  a 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system. The <strong>Sport </strong>package (Cooper and Cooper S only) includes adjustable  suspension dampers, 16-inch wheels (17-inch wheels on the Cooper S), sport  seats, adjustable driving modes and LED headlights. The <strong>Technology </strong>package bundles front parking sensors, an automated  parallel parking system, a navigation system and an 8.8-inch display screen.  The <strong>Fully Loaded</strong> package (Cooper and  Cooper S only) combines all three packages, while a separate <strong>Cold Weather</strong> package adds auto-dimming  mirrors, power-folding exterior mirrors and heated front seats.</p>, <p>Other  available features include all-season tires, a head-up display, adaptive cruise  control and cloth or leather upholstery. Even more personalization is available  through a large selection of custom details such as hood stripes, contrasting  hardtop roof colors and special interior trim pieces.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2014 Mini Hardtop Cooper</strong> (turbo  1.5L inline-3 | 6-speed automatic | FWD)</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Mini Cooper has received a few minor  revisions but our findings remain applicable to this year's Cooper Hardtop.</p>]

[<p>Mini  generally does not compromise on style and passion. But the 2018 Mini Cooper  Hardtop 4 Door compromises, just a little bit, to achieve some needed  practicality. It trades the Mini Cooper's traditional two-door, short-roof  proportions for a longer, four-door profile. The benefits are obvious: a larger  rear seat (1.5 inches more leg room) and more cargo volume (4.4 cubic feet). </p>, <p>But  the core tenets of Mini still remain. Two peppy turbocharged engines are  available: a 1.5-liter three-cylinder (134 horsepower, 162 pound-feet) in the  Cooper and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder (189 hp, 207 lb-ft) in the Cooper S. Both  engines — mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission  (naturally, an automatic is available) — provide smooth power while  being fairly economical. Handling remains sharp and nimble, even with the 4  Door's added size and weight.</p>, <p>But  the real fun for Mini owners lies in the build process. The four-door Hardtop's  base price is a jumping-off point for an options list that includes stylish  18-inch wheels, an adjustable suspension, leather upholstery, colorful interior  trims, and painted roof motifs such as a chequered flag or Union Jack. All of  these options are fun and dizzying. Just be prepared to pay to play. </p>]

[<p>Unlike  the two-door Mini Cooper, with its top-spec John Cooper Works variant and  corresponding price tag, the 2018 Mini Cooper Hardtop 4 Door is only available  in <strong>Cooper </strong>and <strong>Cooper S </strong>versions. Base model Cooper is a stylish economy car,  while the S features performance chops, thanks to its larger engine and  standard drive modes. Either way, both cars can be optioned with a myriad of  paint, interior and driver assist functions.</p>]

[<p>All <strong>Cooper </strong>models come standard with  15-inch alloy wheels, an electronic limited-slip differential, automatic  headlights, automatic wipers, heated mirrors, remote locking/unlocking, keyless  ignition, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, automatic  climate control, a cooled glovebox, cruise control, height-adjustable front  seats, a center armrest,premium simulated leather upholstery and 60/40-split  folding rear seatbacks. Technology highlights include Bluetooth connectivity,  smartphone app integration, a 6.5-inch display screen, and a six-speaker sound  system with HD radio, a USB port and an auxiliary input jack. Powering the  standard Cooper is a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine (134 hp, 162  lb-ft) paired with a six-speed manual transmission that drives the front  wheels. A six-speed automatic is optional.</p>, <p>The <strong>Cooper S </strong>adds a turbocharged  2.0-liter engine (189 hp, 207 lb-ft), a hood scoop, dual center-mounted exhaust  tips, 16-inch wheels with run-flat tires (regular tires are optional), LED  foglights, sport seats and adjustable driving modes.</p>, <p>Although there are many stand-alone options, most are bundled into packages.  The Premium package consists of keyless entry, a dual-pane sunroof and a 12-speaker  Harman Kardon audio system. The Sport package includes adjustable dampers,  larger wheels, sport seats, adjustable driving modes and LED headlights. The  Technology package bundles front parking sensors, a navigation system and a  larger 8.8-inch display screen. The Fully Loaded package combines all three  packages, while a separate Cold Weather package adds auto-dimming mirrors,  power-folding exterior mirrors and heated front seats. </p>, <p>Two  John Cooper Works packages change the look and feel of the car. The JCW  Exterior Package adds an aero kit, black-painted 17-inch alloy wheels,  Performance Control sport software calibration to the drivetrain and stability  control systems, and a spoiler over the hatch. The JCW Interior Package  features JCW-specific leather steering wheel, stainless steel pedal trim and  door sills, sportier seats and an anthracite headliner.</p>, <p>For  traditionalists, the Mini Seven Edition package adds hood stripes, 17-inch  Seven Edition specific two-tone wheels, silver roof and mirror caps, Mini Seven  badging, a black/malt brown interior color combination, door sills and  piano-black interior trim surfaces.</p>, <p>Other available features include a head-up display, an automated parking  system, adaptive cruise control and cloth or leather upholstery. Even more  personalization is available through a large selection of custom details such  as hood stripes, contrasting hardtop roof colors and special interior trim  pieces.</p>]

[<p>Fans of Japanese performance cars will  likely be disappointed to learn that the
2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is not, in  fact, a rebirth of the brand's well-known Eclipse coupe from the 1990s. Instead  it's a new pint-size crossover SUV that joins the Outlander and Outlander Sport  in Mitsubishi's stable of SUVs. But this new model's turbocharged power and  distinctive styling are two good reasons to pull the Eclipse name out of  retirement.</p>, <p>You can read our First Drive article  about the Eclipse Cross for an in-depth look, but the short take is that we  like its clean interior design, which is a big improvement over some of  Mitsubishi's recent offerings. We also like the Eclipse Cross' peppy  acceleration and many standard technology and safety features. </p>, <p>Unfortunately, its ride quality is a  little uncomfortable, and its handling isn't sporty, as you might expect. Also,  Mitsubishi has priced it in such a way that the more expensive trim levels are  similar to what you might pay for more versatile and polished crossovers such  as the Honda CR-V and the Mazda CX-5. Overall, though, there's enough good that  the 'Clipse Cross might make you want to jump at the chance to own a  Mitsubishi.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Eclipse Cross is a small SUV  with seating for five that comes in five trim levels, starting with the  bare-bones ES and moving up to the well-equipped SEL S-AWC. Only one engine is available: a  turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder (152 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of torque)  that's connected to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).  All-wheel drive is standard on all but the base ES trim, which is  front-wheel-drive. </p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment on the <strong>ES</strong> trim includes  16-inch alloy wheels, LED daytime running lights, foglights, and heated side  mirrors. Inside, you'll find a height-adjustable driver's seat, 60/40-split  folding rear seats that slide and recline, a rearview camera, cruise control,  automatic climate control, a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen, Bluetooth, a USB  port, and a four-speaker sound system. Stepping up to the <strong>ES S-AWC</strong> adds all-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Next  up is the <strong>LE S-AWC</strong>. It adds black  exterior trim pieces with black 18-inch alloy wheels. The infotainment system  is upgraded to a 7-inch screen with a remote touchpad controller mounted near  the shift lever. This system also gets Apple CarPlay and Android Auto,  satellite radio and voice controls. </p>, <p>Our  favorite of the mix is the <strong>SE S-AWC</strong>.  It gets a bunch of upgrades such as proximity entry with push-button start,  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, illuminated vanity mirrors,  heated front seats, upgraded fabric upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, a six-speaker stereo system, dual-zone climate control and a rear-seat  center armrest. The SE also comes with Mitsubishi Connect, a subscription that  adds an SOS and emergency roadside assistance button and a remote tracker. It  also provides the ability to remotely control climate settings, door locks,  horn, lights, vehicle settings, and parental controls from a cellphone.</p>, <p>The  range-topping <strong>SEL S-AWC</strong> adds full  LED headlights, leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver's seat, a head-up  display, and a surround-view parking camera system. The Touring package,  exclusively available for the SEL trim, includes a panoramic sunroof, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, a premium Rockford Fosgate nine-speaker stereo  system, automatic high beams, and extra safety features such as lane departure  warning, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and  adaptive cruise control. </p>, <p>A  towing package is available for all trim levels, which adds a tow hitch and a  wiring harness. </p>]

[<p>We'll get  straight to the point: The main reason to consider buying a 2018 Mitsubishi  Mirage is its inexpensive price. When new, it's one of the cheapest cars you  can buy. If you're on a tight budget, the Mirage represents a viable new-car  option that also gets you the warranty and financing benefits that come with  it. Just know that you're also getting one of the least appealing cars to drive  right now. It's slow, uncomfortable and unrefined.</p>, <p>If your  budget allows, we suggest going with more practical and desirable subcompact  hatchbacks, such as the Chevrolet Sonic, Ford Fiesta and Honda Fit. The Mirage  may be inexpensive, but rivals still offer more car for the money. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Mitsubishi Mirage is a four-door, five-passenger compact hatchback offered in  three trim levels: <strong>ES</strong>, <strong>SE </strong>and <strong>GT</strong>. Moving up through the trims provides additional convenience and  style-related features. Every Mirage comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that produces 78  horsepower and 74 pound-feet of torque. The ES and SE trim levels give you the  choice between a five-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT), while the GT is exclusively available with the  CVT.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the base Mirage<strong> ES</strong> trim  include 14-inch steel wheels, a rear spoiler, automatic headlights,  air-conditioning, full power accessories, a tilt-only steering wheel,  60/40-split folding rear seats, a rearview camera, a 7-inch touchscreen  display, Bluetooth connectivity, and a four-speaker sound system with a CD  player and a USB port.</p>, <p>The Mirage <strong>SE</strong> adds alloy wheels, foglights,  keyless ignition and entry, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver seat,  automatic climate control, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.  On the SE, Mitsubishi also replaces the ES' touchscreen with a slightly smaller  6.5-inch screen that has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.</p>, <p>If you go  with the range-topping <strong>GT</strong>, you'll  get 15-inch alloy wheels, xenon headlights and heated front seats.</p>, <p>Notable  options for the Mirage include front and rear parking sensors, remote engine  start and a six-speaker Rockford Fosgate sound system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our First Drive of the <strong>2014 Mitsubishi Mirage ES </strong>(1.2L  inline-3 | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Mitsubishi Mirage has received some  revisions, including refreshed exterior bodywork, new interior materials,  optional smartphone integration, revised suspension tuning and engine power.

[<p>The 2018  Mitsubishi Mirage G4 is the sedan stablemate to the Mirage hatchback. And just  as with the hatchback, the main reason to consider buying the G4 is its  inexpensive price.

[<p>The  2018 Mitsubishi Outlander provides the answer to a very specific question: What  should I buy if I'm looking for one of the least expensive three-row crossovers  on the market? Indeed, the Outlander is one of just a few vehicles in this  price range to offer a third-row seat. You get a lot of features as part of the  deal, too. </p>, <p>Now  for the fine print. The Outlander isn't particularly exciting to drive; it's  also not the most modern, fuel-efficient or comfortable vehicle in its class.  That third-row seat is pretty small and difficult to access. </p>, <p>If  you're looking for an all-weather-capable three-row crossover on a budget, the  Outlander is probably worth a look. But these days, just about every  manufacturer is making a competitive crossover, so we recommend shopping around  before settling on the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is a seven-passenger crossover SUV that comes in five  different trim levels: <strong>ES</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>LE</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong> and <strong>GT</strong>. </p>]

[<p>The  Outlander's base engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (166 horsepower and  162 pound-feet of torque) paired with a continuously variable automatic  transmission (CVT). Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is  optional.</p>, <p>Standard  features for the <strong>ES</strong> include 18-inch  alloy wheels, LED running lights and taillights, heated mirrors, rear privacy  glass, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  60/40-split folding second-row seat that slides and reclines, a 50/50-split  third-row seat, a rearview camera, voice controls, Bluetooth connectivity, and  a six-speaker sound system with a 7-inch touchscreen display, a CD player and a  USB port.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>SE </strong>gets you foglights,  body-colored side mirrors with integrated turn signals, keyless ignition and  entry, an electronic parking brake (all-wheel drive only), heated front seats,  and an upgraded audio system with satellite radio, and Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration.</p>, <p>The <strong>LE</strong> (Limited Edition) mostly adds a  few aesthetic upgrades (such as black roof rails and black exterior trim) and  also gets you blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. </p>, <p>The <strong>SEL</strong> starts with the SE's content and  adds automatic headlights, power-folding mirrors, automatic wipers, gloss-black  interior trim, a power liftgate, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, leather upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and a power driver  seat.</p>, <p>The  SEL also has some optional equipment that you can't get on lower trim levels.  The Premium package adds LED headlights and LED foglights, a sunroof, a heated  steering wheel, a 360-degree parking camera system, and a nine-speaker Rockford  Fosgate audio system. The SEL Touring package includes the Premium package  contents plus automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, a forward  collision mitigation system with automatic braking, and a lane departure  warning system.</p>, <p>The <strong>GT </strong>comes standard with all of the  above options except the advanced safety technologies, all of which are  included in the optional GT Touring package. Exclusive standard features on the  GT include a 3.0-liter V6 (224 hp, 215 lb-ft) paired with a conventional six-speed  automatic, all-wheel drive, chrome exterior beltline accents and steering-wheel  shift paddles.</p>, <p>Stand-alone  options for all trims include remote engine start, a tow hitch and a rear-seat  entertainment system.

[<p>The  2018 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV offers a reason to take another look at this  family SUV. While the regular Outlander lacks the comfort and refinement of its  many competitors, the new PHEV model is one of the first vehicles to bring  plug-in recharging capability to the SUV class.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi  has sold the Outlander PHEV in other global markets for two years. Now it makes  its debut in the United States. Starting at about $35,000 before applicable tax  credits, the Outlander PHEV looks pretty much the same as its gas engine-only  counterpart. But for the PHEV decals and badging, you wouldn't know the  difference. </p>, <p>It's  a different story under the hood, where a four-cylinder gas engine joins  electric hybrid components. The engine and electric motor combination drives  the front wheels, while a second electric motor drives the rear wheels.  Sophisticated computer processing determines the best way to dole out power to  all four wheels, although drivers can also manually engage a four-wheel-drive  lock mode when desired. </p>, <p>Total  system output is 197 horsepower, yet the Outlander PHEV's key appeal to most  drivers will be its plug-in rechargeability. Mitsubishi says the Outlander  plug-in can travel about 22 miles on a full charge, and you can charge from  120-volt, 240-volt or DC fast-charger sources. We'll wait to see what  real-world driving actually yields, but 22 miles on all-electric power is  similar to how far you can go in other plug-in hybrids.</p>, <p>Less  impressive is the Outlander PHEV's fuel economy once the rechargeable battery  is largely depleted. At just 25 mpg in combined city/highway driving, it  actually does a little worse than a regular four-cylinder Outlander with  all-wheel drive (26 mpg). A non-plug-in Toyota RAV4 Hybrid posts 32 mpg  combined.</p>, <p>Plug-in  utility requires some additional sacrifices. Unlike the standard Outlander, the  PHEV doesn't offer three rows of seats due to placement of the battery pack and  electrical components. Mitsubishi also had to use a smaller gas tank with the  PHEV, and that limits overall gas-electric driving range. </p>, <p>But  with 78 cubic feet of maximum cargo space and standard all-wheel drive, the  PHEV still rates as a proper SUV. If you need the space and utility and you  like the idea of maximizing miles through electricity, the Outlander PHEV  warrants a close look. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is a  five-passenger plug-in hybrid SUV offered in two trim levels: <strong>SEL </strong>and <strong>GT</strong>. Both are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (117 horsepower) joined by a  60-kilowatt electric motor; the combination drives the front wheels, and a  second 60-kW motor powers the rear wheels. Total system output is rated at 197  hp. Electrical power is stored in a 12-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features include 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights with LED accents,  foglights, heated side mirrors, automatic wipers, a power liftgate, keyless  entry, push-button start, leather upholstery, power-adjustable heated front  seats, 60/40-split folding and reclining rear seats, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a rearview camera, voice controls, Bluetooth, a six-speaker  sound system, a 7-inch touchscreen display, dual USB ports, and Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto smartphone integration. Driver safety aids include blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>Stepping  up to the <strong>GT </strong>adds LED headlights and  foglights, a sunroof, a heated steering wheel, a multiview camera, dual AC  power outlets (rated up to 1,500 watts), and a nine-speaker Rockford Fosgate  sound system. Enhanced driver aids include forward collision alert with  pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning,  adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams. </p>, <p>There  are two main option packages. The Entertainment package includes a rear-seat  DVD player with remote control and wireless headphones, while the Towing  package includes a tow hitch and trailer-prepped wiring harness. There are also  a handful of optional accessory and cosmetic trim packages that include items  such as side mirror covers, lower air dams and cargo mats. </p>]

[<p>Relativity  often influences critical opinion. Just as <em>Happy  Gilmore</em> could be seen a cinematographic masterpiece compared to, say, <em>Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2</em>, the 2018  Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is worlds better than classic automotive stinkers  such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. Undoubtedly, the Outlander Sport  will safely get you to where you need to go. But compared to its modern  competition, this pint-sized Mitsubishi falls short in nearly every category.</p>, <p>We  say "nearly" because there are a couple bright spots to the Outlander  Sport. The main one is value. It's one of the least expensive crossover SUVs  you'll come across, yet Mitsubishi has managed to pack it with most of the  features you'll likely want. Mitsubishi's warranty coverage is also better than  most, which could further the financial appeal of the Outlander Sport if you  plan to own it for a long time.</p>, <p>But  for everything else we evaluate vehicles on, the Outlander Sport brings up the  rear. It's noisy and slow when accelerating, uncomfortable and harsh-riding  over bumps, and not overwhelmingly versatile from a utility standpoint. In  general, the Outlander Sport is ineffective at convincing you that you bought  anything other than basic transportation. </p>, <p>Like  a plucky Happy Gilmore winning a golf tournament to save the day, we'd like to  see the plucky Outlander Sport rise to greatness. For now, however, we think  you'll be much happier with rival crossovers such as the Honda HR-V, Jeep  Renegade and Mazda CX-3.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a five-passenger compact crossover SUV that  can be seen as the little brother to the three-row Outlander. The entry-level <strong>ES </strong>and <strong>LE </strong>are motivated by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (148  horsepower, 145 pound-feet) that is a bit slow. The <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>SEL </strong>are powered  by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder (168 hp, 167 lb-ft) that feels more potent.  Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional on all trims. </p>]

[<p>Standard <strong>ES </strong>features include 18-inch alloy  wheels, heated mirrors, remote locking and unlocking, cruise control, automatic  climate control, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a driver information display, 60/40-split  folding rear seatbacks, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen display, a rearview  camera, and a four-speaker audio system with a USB port. A five-speed manual  transmission is standard, and a continuously variable automatic transmission  (CVT) is optional. </p>, <p>The <strong>LE </strong>trim adds xenon headlights with  LED running lights, fog lights, special exterior and interior styling details,  heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a slightly smaller  touchscreen (6.5 inches) that has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration.</p>, <p>Next  is the Outlander Sport's <strong>SE</strong> trim. It  gets most of the LE's upgrades except the xenon headlights and styling changes.  It also has the 7-inch touchscreen (now with the Android and Apple phone  integration) and a six-speaker audio system with satellite radio and an extra  USB port. </p>, <p>When  you step up to the <strong>SEL</strong>, you get the  xenon headlights plus power-folding mirrors, automatic wipers, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, leather upholstery and a power-adjustable driver seat.</p>, <p>The  main factory option for the 2018 Outlander Sport is a Touring package for the  SEL. It includes a panoramic sunroof, a nine-speaker Rockford Fosgate sound  system, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane  departure warning and automatic high-beam headlights.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of a <strong>2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SEL </strong>(2.4L  inline-4 | CVT automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Outlander Sport has received only  minor revisions.

[<p>There is a decided lack of affordable  sports cars these days. In fact, you wouldn't need all your fingers to count  them. So we should celebrate the fact that the 2018 Nissan 370Z is so  singularly focused on being a sports car with its two seats, small dimensions  and powerful, non-turbocharged V6 engine.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, this generation 370Z came  out for 2009. There hasn't been a full redesign since, which is an eternity in  car terms, and Nissan hasn't made many substantive updates either. That means  the 370Z continues to be just as unrefined and inconvenient for your daily  drive as it was about a decade ago, but now it has also been surpassed in  performance by newer competitors.</p>, <p>These rivals also provide more features  and a more livable driving experience. You could probably get by knowing that  the Z lacks advanced accident avoidance safety features or smartphone features  such as Apple CarPlay. But the 370Z is so dated, it doesn't even come standard  with a USB port.</p>, <p>Having a back-to-basics sports car  certainly doesn't have to be a bad thing. But when competitors outdo the 370Z  in both performance and livability, it's hard to recommend. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan 370Z is a two-seat sports  car available as a hatchback coupe or a soft-top convertible. The coupe comes  in <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Sport Tech</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong> and <strong>Nismo Tech</strong> trims, while the convertible can be had as the <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong> and <strong>Touring Sport</strong>.  All trim levels come with a 3.7-liter V6 engine paired to either a six-speed  manual transmission or a seven-speed automatic transmission. This engine  produces 332 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque in regular 370Z trim  levels and 350 hp and 276 lb-ft in the Nismo. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>base </strong>370Z<strong> </strong>comes standard with 18-inch wheels, summer performance tires,  automatic xenon headlights, LED running lights and taillights, keyless ignition  and entry, cruise control, automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped  tilt-only steering wheel, Bluetooth phone connectivity, and a six-speaker sound  system with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack.</p>, <p>Upgrade  to the <strong>Sport </strong>trim (only available on  the coupe) and you'll get a limited-slip differential, upgraded brakes, a  rev-matching downshift feature for the manual transmission, 19-inch wheels,  heated mirrors, chin and rear deck spoilers, and an eight-speaker Bose audio  system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Touring </strong>trim loses the Sport's  performance upgrades but adds leather and simulated suede upholstery, a rear  cargo cover (coupe only), heated four-way power-adjustable seats (with  adjustable driver lumbar), an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 7-inch  touchscreen infotainment system, navigation, a USB port, voice controls, a  rearview camera, Bluetooth audio connectivity, satellite radio, a media player  interface and the Bose audio system. The convertible gets ventilated front  seats.</p>, <p>The <strong>Sport Tech </strong>coupe gets most of the  equipment from the Sport and Touring models minus the heated power seats,  upgraded upholstery and cargo cover. The convertible's <strong>Touring Sport </strong>mirrors the Sport Tech's equipment, but it is missing  the front-chin and rear-deck spoilers. It does get the upgraded seats and  upholstery, though.</p>, <p>The  370Z <strong>Nismo Tech</strong> gets a more powerful  version of the standard V6 and features the same or upgraded versions of the  Sport trim's performance hardware, including an exclusive sport-tuned  suspension, upgraded tires, and special brake fluid and hoses. The Nismo also  features unique aerodynamic body pieces, Recaro sport seats, a simulated  suede-trimmed steering wheel and the Touring's auto-dimming rearview mirror and  various upgraded electronics features, including the 7-inch touchscreen  interface and navigation system.</p>, <p>The  only option is the Heritage Edition package, exclusive to the base coupe. It  features exterior decals, yellow interior trim, and a choice of either black or  yellow paint.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Nissan 370Z Base Coupe</strong> (3.7L V6 | 6-speed Manual | RWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 370Z has received some revisions,  including a new high-performance clutch for 2018. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's 370Z.</p>, <p> </p>]

[<p>Though small crossovers have become more  popular in recent years, midsize sedans are still one of the top choices for  family-friendly transportation. This segment is so important to automakers that  a few of the most popular models have been redesigned or notably freshened for  the 2018 model year. Unfortunately, the 2018 Nissan Altima is not one of them.</p>, <p>We've generally like the Altima over the  years, but this particular generation is getting on in years. The newest crop  of rival sedans further highlights the Altima's deficiencies in the areas of  technology, interior quality and performance.</p>, <p>To Nissan's credit, the 2018 Altima does  have some useful enhancements. A forward collision notification system with  automatic emergency braking is standard on all trim levels, and the upgraded  infotainment display now includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.  But the segment has so many strong competitors that even a decent choice like  the Nissan Altima has a hard time differentiating itself. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Altima comes in five trim  levels: <strong>2.5 S</strong>,<strong> 2.5 SR</strong>,<strong> 2.5 SV</strong>,<strong> 2.5 SL </strong>and <strong>3.5 SL</strong>. All  Altimas (except the 3.5 SL) are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine  (179 horsepower, 177 pound-feet of torque) that routes power through the front  wheels through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). </p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>2.5 S</strong> include  16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers, a rearview camera, keyless entry and  ignition, a height-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats,  Bluetooth, a 5-inch display screen, and a six-speaker audio system with a USB  port. Also standard for 2018 is a forward collision warning system with  automatic emergency braking. </p>, <p>The  sporty <strong>2.5 SR </strong>trim upgrades the 2.5  S with 18-inch alloy wheels, daytime running lights, foglights, a rear spoiler,  a sport-tuned suspension, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, paddle shifters  (with seven simulated shift points), upgraded upholstery and a power-adjustable  driver seat. </p>, <p>Compared  to the 2.5 S, the <strong>2.5 SV </strong>trim has  17-inch alloy wheels, LED daytime running lights, remote engine start,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, dual-zone automatic  climate control, satellite radio and the SR's foglights, power driver seat and  leather-wrapped steering wheel. The <strong>2.5  SL</strong> adds LED headlights, power-folding mirrors, a heated steering wheel,  leather upholstery, heated front seats, air vents for the rear seats, a power  front passenger seat and a nine-speaker Bose premium audio system. </p>, <p>The<strong> 3.5 SL</strong> is the only model not powered  by the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. Instead, a 3.5-liter V6 lies underhood,  developing a healthy 270 hp and 251 lb-ft of torque. It also gets 18-inch  wheels, front and rear parking sensors, a sunroof, heated mirrors, paddle  shifters, adaptive cruise control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 7-inch  touchscreen, a navigation system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone  connectivity, and NissanConnect services with emergency telematics. </p>, <p>All  four-cylinder trims can be ordered with a single package that adds features  from upper levels. For example, the Convenience package for the 2.5 S only adds  a power driver seat and remote engine start, while the 2.5 SR's Special Edition  package includes satellite radio, heated front seats, synthetic leather  upholstery, and the 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. </p>]

[<p>Surprisingly  luxurious and easy to drive, the 2018 Nissan Armada offers ample power, room  and utility. With three rows of seats, robust towing limits and sophisticated  four-wheel-drive capability, the Armada capably handles both the daily grind  and the road less traveled. </p>, <p>Some  of the Armada's special sauce comes from the Armada sharing its bones with the  upmarket Infiniti QX80. It's the same SUV from Nissan's luxury division. There  are some differences between the two models, and certainly the Armada lacks the  Infiniti's more refined details, but overall the design and fit-and-finish  rises above those of a standard SUV. </p>, <p>There's  also plenty of room to highlight all that interior goodness. The Armada's total  cabin space is larger than many of its competitors, and offers 16 cubic feet of  luggage space behind its upright third row. Folding all rows opens up nearly 95  cubic feet of cargo space, which is better than average — less space  than a Ford Expedition, but more than a Chevrolet Tahoe. The Armada also  brakes, steers and handles with surprising coordination, and the 5.6-liter V8  engine delivers hearty acceleration.</p>, <p>There  are a few drawbacks to the Armada. Fuel economy is poor even for a big SUV, the  third-row isn't that roomy (for adults at least), and the infotainment  interface is dated. But as an overall package that can tackle outdoor pursuits  or the suburban mean streets with equal aplomb, the 2018 Nissan Armada is a  heavyweight. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Nissan Armada as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-family-suv/" title="Best Family SUVs">Best Family SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Nissan Armada is a full-size SUV that seats eight passengers. Second-row  captain's chairs are available on the top Platinum trim and reduce seating to  seven. All Armada trims use a 5.6-liter V8 engine (390 horsepower, 394  pound-feet of torque) paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission.  Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is optional. The Armada's  trim levels start at the <strong>SV</strong>, move up  to the midgrade <strong>SL</strong>, and finish with  the nearly fully loaded <strong>Platinum</strong>.</p>]

[<p>The  standard <strong>SV</strong> trim starts with 18-inch  alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, roof rails, side steps, keyless  ignition and entry, a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors,  dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable heated front seats, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a reclining second-row bench split seat and a  60/40-split third-row seat. </p>, <p>Tech  features include Bluetooth connectivity, a navigation system, an 8-inch  touchscreen display, and a 13-speaker Bose audio system with a CD player,  satellite radio, HD radio, two USB media inputs and two USB charge-only ports. </p>, <p>The  optional Driver package adds a power liftgate, foglights, a power-adjustable  third-row seat, an auto-dimming mirror and a trailering package.</p>, <p>The <strong>SL</strong> trim level includes the Driver  package items plus 20-inch wheels, rain-sensing wipers, remote engine start, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, driver-preferences memory, leather upholstery,  leather door trim, a 120-volt power outlet, and an enhanced 360-degree top-down  parking camera with moving-object detection and warning.</p>, <p>The  SL's optional Premium package adds a sunroof, adaptive cruise control, forward  and rearward emergency automatic braking, blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The  range-topping <strong>Platinum</strong> adds the SL's  optional equipment along with different 20-inch wheels, speed-sensitive  steering (requires less effort at slow speeds), heated and ventilated front  seats, heated second-row seats, a heated steering wheel, a rear-seat  entertainment system and an upgraded rearview mirror than can display a  constant video feed from the rearview camera. </p>, <p>Two  packages are available for the Armada Platinum. The Captain's Chairs package  replaces the second-row bench seats with two bucket seats and a center console with  a padded armrest, and the Platinum Reserve package adds special exterior trim  and two-tone leather upholstery.</p>]

[<p>The  midsize truck segment has undergone plenty of change in recent years. General  Motors kicked off the renaissance with its redesigned Chevrolet Colorado and  GMC Canyon trucks, and new versions of the Toyota Tacoma and Honda Ridgeline  soon followed. Left in the dust is the Nissan Frontier, which has loped along  largely unchanged since this current generation's debut more than a decade ago. </p>, <p>That  could change next year when an all-new Frontier is expected to arrive. But for  now, the 2018 Nissan Frontier is outdated in just about every area. The  interior, though certainly durable, has a low-buck look and feel to it and lets  in plenty of noise. The Frontier's engines burn fuel with the abandon of a  failed missile test, and technology and advanced safety features are few and  far between. </p>, <p>On  the upside, the Frontier offers a surprisingly comfortable ride, a bed with all  manner of useful cleats and tie-downs, and legitimate off-road fun and  capability when equipped in the Pro-4X trim. It's also relatively affordable  compared to its newer rivals. As such, the 2018 Frontier could be a good pick  for truck shoppers seeking simple utility and fun. For a more modern take on a  midsize pickup, though, you'll want to look elsewhere.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Nissan Frontier is a midsize truck offered in two body styles (the King  extended cab or four-door crew cab) and with 5-foot and 6.1-foot bed lengths.  Two engines are available, a 2.5-liter four-cylinder (152 horsepower, 171  pound-feet of torque) or a 4.0-liter six-cylinder (261-hp, 281 lb-ft). Both can  pair to either a six-speed manual or a five-speed automatic transmission (the  four-cylinder is also available with a five-speed manual). There are five trim  levels: <strong>S</strong> is the base model; the <strong>SV</strong>, with an upgraded interior; the <strong>Desert Runner</strong>, which pairs  off-road-oriented features with two-wheel drive; the four-wheel-drive-only <strong>Pro-4X</strong>; and the top-tier <strong>SL, </strong>which is the best optioned overall.</p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>S </strong>trim starts with two-wheel  drive, an extended cab, a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and a five-speed  manual transmission. Standard features include 15-inch steel wheels, rear  privacy glass, cloth front bucket seats, air-conditioning, cruise control,  Bluetooth, a rearview camera, a 5-inch central display, steering wheel audio  controls, Siri Eyes Free voice command, and a four-speaker sound system with a  CD player, USB input and an auxiliary audio jack. </p>, <p>An  optional Work Truck package adds a spray-in bedliner, bed rail caps, splash  guards and rubber floor mats.</p>, <p>The <strong>SV </strong>builds on the above features with  16-inch alloy wheels, power accessories (windows, door locks), sliding rear  window, and satellite radio. Options include a sunroof on the crew cab and a  Value Truck package that adds foglights, rear parking sensors, a rearview  camera, a sliding bed extender, a spray-in bedliner, adjustable cargo  tie-downs, a Class IV trailer hitch, dual-zone automatic climate control,  heated front seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and two extra speakers on  extended cabs.</p>, <p>The  SV crew cab is also available with the Midnight Edition package, which adds  blacked-out 18-inch wheels, side steps, body-colored bumpers, and side mirror  housings. </p>, <p>The <strong>Desert Runner</strong> is a rear-wheel-drive  V6 only. Available in either cab configuration, it builds on the base SV  equipment list with special styling details, foglights, high-performance shock  absorbers and off-road tires. The SV Value package equipment isn't available  with this trim.</p>, <p>For  serious off-roaders, there is the four-wheel-drive-only <strong>Pro-4X</strong>. This trim features knobby off-road tires, specially tuned  shocks, a locking rear differential, skid plates, automatic headlights, a  5.8-inch NissanConnect touchscreen with navigation, satellite radio and voice  controls, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a first-aid kit. It includes  everything in the SV Value Truck package except the trailer hitch and bed  extender, which are optional. Crew cabs also get a 10-speaker Rockford Fosgate  audio system. </p>, <p>The  Pro-4X Premium package, only available on automatic-equipped crew cabs, adds a  sunroof, a roof rack with crossbars, heated mirrors, leather upholstery,  power-adjustable front seats and a rear-seat center armrest.</p>, <p>The  top-level <strong>SL</strong> is only available as a  crew cab with the automatic transmission. It loses the Pro-4X's  off-road-oriented equipment but retains most of the items in the Pro-4X Premium  package, including a sunroof for long-bed SLs. (The sunroof is a stand-alone  option for short-bed SLs.) Additional standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels  and side steps that ease access to the cab. The trailer hitch and bed extender  remain optional on the Frontier SL.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2013 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X Crew Cab </strong>(4.0L V6 | 5-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Nissan Frontier has received only  minor revisions, including increased feature availability throughout various  trim levels (Bluetooth, updated displays and navigation systems, for example).  Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Nissan Frontier.</p>]

[<p>This  is the time to be alive if you're shopping for a high-performance sports car.  Not only are there more choices than ever, sports car manufacturers have a  seemingly unending supply of updates to apply to their technological  powerhouses. But for the 2018 GT-R, Nissan is doing things a little  differently. While most manufacturers are selling cars with more features and  corresponding price hikes, Nissan is bringing out a less expensive GT-R trim,  called Pure, to the lineup. The benefit to consumers? The Pure's starting MSRP  is below the six-figure mark. </p>, <p>Whichever  trim you get, the GT-R brings plenty of performance to the road with little  sacrifice in regard to comfort and convenience. To its credit, Nissan has  continuously updated and refined the the GT-R's powertrain, and it's much more  refined than when it was introduced back in 2009. But compared to other  performance cars with dual-clutch transmissions on the market, the GT-R is  still lurchy and noisy. For better and for worse, the 2018 GT-R is fundamentally  the same well-appointed but rough-and-tumble car as the one from nine years  ago. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan GT-R is a  high-performance sport coupe. It uses a turbocharged 3.8-liter V6 engine (565  hp, 467 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission  and a variable all-wheel-drive system for its propulsion. <strong>Pure</strong>, the new trim level, is the least expensive way to get a GT-R,  but it still has all the essential features. <strong>Premium</strong> trim cars add luxury options, while the <strong>Track Edition</strong> adds even more track  focus. Finally, the GT-R <strong>Nismo </strong>ups  all performance qualities to the max, including an engine tuned for more power.</p>]

[<p>The new <strong>Pure </strong>trim<strong> </strong>includes  20-inch wheels with summer run-flat tires, LED headlights and running lights,  power-folding and heated mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, an adaptive  suspension, configurable drive modes, and keyless entry and ignition.</p>, <p>Inside, you get leather upholstery with faux suede inserts, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a heated eight-way power driver seat (four-way for the front  passenger), a manual tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a rearview camera, an  8-inch touchscreen, a navigation system, voice controls, NissanConnect  mobile-app integration, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker Bose audio  system with active noise cancellation and enhancement, USB connectivity, and  satellite and HD radio. </p>, <p>Going with the Premium adds an active  sound enhancement and noise cancellation system, titanium exhaust, and a  11-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Options for the Pure and Premium are limited to the Cold Weather package, with  all-season tires and a unique coolant mixture. Premium models can be equipped  with a Premium Interior package, which adds hand-stitched premium leather  upholstery; special floor mats; and a few premium paint and interior color  schemes.</p>, <p>The GT-R <strong>Track Edition </strong>is similar  but receives the Nismo's suspension, chassis and interior upgrades (see below).</p>, <p>Finally, the limited-production GT-R <strong>Nismo </strong>comes with a stiffer body structure, a front fascia with more cooling area  and downforce, side skirts and rear wing, Recaro seats, lightweight forged  alloy wheels, a more aggressive suspension calibration, and an uprated version  of the V6 engine good for 600 hp and 481 lb-ft of torque.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Nissan GT-R Premium </strong>(turbo  3.8L V6 | 6-speed dual-clutch automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current GT-R has received some revisions,  including a bit more power and an updated interior. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's GT-R.</p>]

[<p>Subcompact crossover SUVs are wildly popular at the moment, thanks to elevated  ride heights, versatile interiors, accessible pricing and ease of  maneuverability. The 2018 Nissan Kicks is the latest to join this class and  should deliver on a number of fronts. Compared to much of the competition, the  Kicks has a lower price, a larger cargo space and higher fuel economy. </p>, <p>Holding it back, however, is an engine  that is weak even by subcompact crossover standards. Nor can you get all-wheel  drive, which diminishes the appeal of the vehicle from a utility standpoint.  Also, Nissan fitted it with rear drum brakes, which don't offer the more  consistent and confident braking power of more modern disc brakes. Overall, though, the 2018 Nissan  Kicks' bold design and price make it worth checking out. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Kicks is available in  three trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong> and <strong>SR</strong>. The S trim is very basic as are the upper trims compared to  other subcompact crossovers. All models receive a 1.6-liter four-cylinder (125  horsepower, 115 pound-feet of torque) that is paired to a continuously variable  automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. All-wheel drive isn't  available.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment for the <strong>S</strong> trim includes 16-inch steel wheels,  roof rails, automatic headlights, hill start assist, forward collision warning  with automatic braking, cruise control, air conditioning, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver's seat,  60/40-split folding rear seats, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, Siri Eyes Free  integration, three USB ports, a rearview camera and a six-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The <strong>SV</strong> adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert,  keyless entry and ignition, remote start, a driver information display,  interior chrome accents, padded front door armrests, automatic climate control  with rear heater ducts, a cargo cover, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  smartphone integration, and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The range-topping <strong>SR</strong> comes with LED headlights and foglights, heated mirrors, a rear  roof spoiler, a surround-view parking camera system, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel and upgraded cloth upholstery. </p>, <p>The optional SR Premium package adds an  eight-speaker Bose audio system, simulated leather upholstery and heated front  seats. Both the SV and SR trims are eligible for a two-tone paint scheme.</p>]

[<p>Though the Nissan Leaf has received incremental changes over its lifetime, 2018  brings the most comprehensive rework of the car to date. The new car's styling  is a complete departure from the previous Leaf, although under the skin the  cars are very similar aside from the larger battery capacity and additional  power. For a detailed look at these changes, please see our <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/first-impressions/2018-nissan-leaf-first-drive.html">2018 Nissan Leaf First Drive</a> article.</p>, <p>The Leaf hasn't become more expensive in  the bargain. In fact, the new car is actually less costly than the outgoing  model when you factor in the differences in feature content. As such, it offers  more range for the same price as other similar EVs, such as the Volkswagen  e-Golf. Only the more expensive Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3 offer more  driving range.</p>, <p>Other advantages to the 2018 Leaf include  its new e-pedal mode and a new suite of advanced driver assist features called  ProPilot Assist. The e-pedal delivers stronger regenerative braking when you  lift off the accelerator, making it easier to slow  the car appreciably without requiring you to apply the brake pedal.</p>, <p>On the downside, the Leaf's interior  isn't particularly stylish, and the rear seats don't fold completely flat,  hurting utility. Overall, though, we think the 2018 Leaf is a great pick for an  electric vehicle, especially if value is a priority.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Nissan Leaf as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/" title="Best Electric Cars">Best Electric Cars</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Leaf is available in three trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong> and <strong>SL</strong>. As the lowest trim level, the <strong>S</strong> is a bit bare-bones, at least as  electric mobility goes. But you can add the optional Charge package for quicker  recharging. Otherwise, it's still a very functional car since it comes with all  the range and performance of the other trim levels. The <strong>SV</strong> adds the Charge package and navigation as standard, but it still  doesn't beat the S if value is paramount. The top-level <strong>SL</strong> adds leather seats, LED headlights, and a host of comfort  features that might edge out the S for those folks who prefer a pampered  electrified ride.</p>]

[<p>All three trim levels feature the same  suspension and powertrain, and they differ mainly in infotainment, creature  comforts and wheel choices. </p>, <p>Our choice, the <strong>S</strong>, comes with 16-inch steel wheels, a 110-kW electric motor (147  horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque), keyless entry and start, a rearview  camera, a 5-inch central display, Bluetooth, a USB port, and a four-speaker  sound system with a CD player and satellite radio. Forward collision warning  and mitigation with automatic braking is also standard.</p>, <p>The optional Charge package includes a DC fast-charger port (CHAdeMO standard)  and a portable charge cable capable of connecting to 120- and 240-volt sources.</p>, <p>The <strong>SV</strong> comes with the Charge  package, 17-inch alloy wheels, a 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, adaptive  cruise control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and  NissanConnect, Nissan's web connectivity and remote-access system.</p>, <p>Optional for the SV is the SV Technology  package. It adds a power-adjustable driver seat, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, LED headlights and running lights, automatic high beams, an electronic  parking brake, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, lane  departure warning and intervention, and adaptive cruise control. </p>, <p>Also optional for the S and SV is an All  Weather package with heated side mirrors, heated seats and steering wheel, and  heat pump cabin heater (SV only).</p>, <p>As the top model, the SL adds the All Weather package and a few of the features  from the SV's Technology package (power driver seat, auto-dimming mirror, LED  lighting, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert). Also  standard are leather upholstery and a Bose seven-speaker sound system. Optional  for this trim only is the SL Technology package that adds the remaining SV  Technology features plus Nissan ProPilot Assist, which provides additional  lane-keeping assist functionality.</p>]

[<p>The  Maxima isn't like most other sedans you might be considering. It's sportier  than the typical family sedan but is equipped and priced more like a large  sedan. It could even be an option for an entry-level luxury car. As such, the  Maxima is largely a niche offering, but one with undeniable appeal. </p>, <p>Nissan has long called the Maxima a  "four-door sports car." Of course, the phrase is mostly marketing  hype. But the Maxima handles pretty well when you're driving around turns and  comes standard with a powerful V6 engine. There's even a sporty SR trim with  unique suspension tuning and performance-oriented driver aids. </p>, <p>Given the Maxima's lengthy list of  features, upscale interior appointments and all-around competence, it could be  a solid alternative to luxury sedans such as the Acura TLX or Lincoln MKZ. The  cabin is so decadently trimmed in the SR and Platinum levels, it outdoes even  those cars at that price. </p>, <p>We will note that this year's crop of  midsize sedans is pretty appealing. The redesigned Honda Accord and Toyota  Camry, in particular, boast sportier styling and stronger performance than ever  before. That might dilute the Maxima's appeal considering the Honda and Toyota  are roomier and less expensive. But if you're looking for a sedan with equal  parts sportiness and unpretentious luxury, the 2018 Nissan Maxima is certainly  worth checking out.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Nissan Maxima sedan comes in five trim levels: the base <strong>S</strong>, midlevel <strong>SV</strong>, the slightly more expensive <strong>SL, </strong>sporty <strong>SR </strong>and the  top-level <strong>Platinum</strong>.</p>]

[<p>Like  all Maximas, the <strong>S </strong>is powered by a  3.5-liter V6 engine (300 horsepower, 261 pound-feet of torque) that drives the  front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). </p>, <p>Standard  features include 18-inch wheels, LED daytime running lights, foglights, remote engine  start, keyless entry and ignition, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, dual-zone  automatic climate control, adjustable driving modes, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, power-adjustable front seats (eight-way driver and four-way passenger),  a 60/40-split rear seat, a navigation system, an 8-inch touchscreen, two USB  ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, and an eight-speaker audio  system with a CD player and satellite radio. </p>, <p>Standard  safety systems include a rearview camera and forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The  Maxima <strong>SV</strong> adds front and rear  parking sensors, heated mirrors, heated front seats, leather upholstery, and an  upgraded driver seat with extendable thigh support and two-way power lumbar  adjustment. The <strong>SL </strong>doesn't cost much  more, and its impressive list of extra features includes a dual-panel sunroof,  active noise reduction, active engine sound enhancement, adaptive cruise  control, a heated steering wheel, ambient interior lighting, a 12-speaker Bose  premium audio system, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The <strong>SR </strong>adds performance enhancements to  the SL, with 19-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, column-mounted paddle  shifters, Active Ride Control (uses the brakes to quell body motions over  bumps), Active Trace Control (uses targeted braking to keep the vehicle on its  intended path) and active engine braking that helps slow the car when heading  aggressively into corners or approaching a stop. The panoramic sunroof is  removed, but the SR does add a few luxury features, including LED headlights,  ventilated front seats, and upgraded leather upholstery with quilted simulated  suede seat inserts and special interior trim.</p>, <p>A  rear spoiler and the Midnight Edition package (black-painted wheels and  exterior styling elements, rear spoiler, an auto-dimming driver-side mirror,  driver-seat memory settings and a 360-degree parking camera) are optional for  the SR.</p>, <p>The  top-trim <strong>Platinum </strong>does away with  some of the SR's add-ons, though it retains the LED headlights and ventilated  front seats. It then adds automatic wipers, an auto-dimming driver-side mirror,  a 360-degree parking camera, a power-adjustable steering column, driver-seat  memory settings, a six-way power passenger seat, upgraded leather upholstery  and interior trim, a rear power sunshade and NissanConnect services (remote  start, automatic collision notification, emergency calling and stolen vehicle  location).</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Nissan Maxima Platinum</strong> (3.5L V6 | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Maxima has received some revisions,  including newly standard driver aids and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  compatibility. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Maxima.</p>]

[<p>Nissan's 2018 Murano could be for you if  typical crossover SUVs seem too boring and dull. For starters, dramatic curves  and a sleek roofline give the Murano a distinctive look. Inside, the interior  is noticeably upscale thanks to high-quality materials, a fetching ergonomic  design, impressively comfortable front seats and a generous list of standard  comfort and convenience features. We're also fond of the Murano's combination  of a standard V6 engine and a continuously variable automatic transmission  (CVT) that work together for smooth power and respectable fuel economy. </p>, <p>The Murano does fall short of some  competitors in overall cargo space, and its modest towing limits make it less  than ideal for those who need an SUV that can tow trailers and toys. But if weekend  watersports aren't in your plans, the Murano is a solid choice for an upscale,  comfortable five-passenger crossover that delivers a bit more style than the  norm.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Nissan Murano as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Murano crossover  is offered in four trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong>, <strong>SL</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>. All  have a 3.5-liter V6 engine (260 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of torque) and a  continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive comes standard;  all-wheel drive is optional. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>S</strong> comes standard with 18-inch  alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED running lights, keyless entry and  ignition, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control and a 60/40-split  folding rear seat. Standard technology includes a navigation system, an 8-inch  touchscreen interface, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with CD  player, satellite radio, USB and auxiliary audio jacks, and smartphone app  integration (with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto). There's even a USB port for  rear passengers to connect a music device to the audio system. </p>, <p>All  2018 Muranos also have forward collision warning with automatic emergency  braking as standard.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>SV</strong> adds roof rails,  foglights, remote engine start, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The  SV's optional Premium package adds unique 18-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic  sunroof, heated front seats and mirrors, an 11-speaker Bose audio system, and  driver aids such as adaptive cruise control, a 360-degree parking camera  system, and a drowsy driver warning system. </p>, <p>The <strong>SL</strong> model comes standard with the  SV's options (including the driver aids and Bose audio), as well as a  hands-free liftgate, heated side mirrors, driver-seat memory settings, leather  upholstery, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, and ambient  interior lighting. A panoramic sunroof is optional. </p>, <p>The  top-line Murano <strong>Platinum</strong> is loaded  with the SL's features plus 20-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, a  power-adjustable steering wheel with memory setting, heated and ventilated  front seats, power-folding rear seats, and NissanConnect telematics, including  automatic collision notification to emergency services and customizable alerts  (to keep tabs on teen drivers or valets, for example). </p>, <p>A  Midnight Edition optional styling package for SL trims adds special 20-inch  wheels and a blacked-out finish on roof rails, mirror caps, grille, lower  bumper accents, sill plates, side moldings.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Nissan Murano Platinum </strong>(3.5L  V6  | CVT automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Nissan Murano has received some  minor equipment revisions.

[<p>Available in a wide range of models,  including standard and high roofs and V6 or V8 power, the 2018 Nissan NV Cargo is a strong choice for shoppers in  the market for a work van. It  meets or exceeds the class average in hauling and towing capability.</p>, <p>The Nissan NV Cargo offers 234 cubic feet  of cargo space in the standard-roof model and 323 cubic feet in the high-roof  configuration. The 1500 version with the V6 engine is equipped to tow up to  6,900 pounds with a payload capacity of more than 2,700 pounds, while the 3500  with the V8 can tow up to 9,400 pounds and carry more than 3,800 pounds of  cargo.</p>, <p>On the downside, the NV Cargo doesn't  come in as many possible configurations as some rival vans, and its fuel  economy is subpar. Overall, though, it's a capable choice for individuals or businesses in the market  for a commercial work van. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan NV Cargo is a  full-size van that is available in three models (1500, 2500 and 3500) with  increasing levels of hauling and towing capabilities. Within these models are  three trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong> and <strong>SL</strong>. The 1500 model comes only with a standard roof and a 4.0-liter  V6 engine (261 horsepower, 281 pound-feet of torque) paired with a five-speed  automatic transmission that drives the rear wheels. The 2500 model comes  standard with this engine and is also eligible for a high roof and a 5.6-liter  V8 (375 hp, 387 lb-ft) mated to a seven-speed transmission as options. The 3500  can be had with either roof but comes only with the V8.</p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights for the 1500 <strong>S</strong> trim include 17-inch steel wheels, power windows and door locks, air  conditioning, remote keyless entry, cruise control, a tilt-only steering wheel,  a rearview camera, 5-inch color display, Bluetooth, a USB port, and a  two-speaker stereo with a CD player. The 2500 S version also includes  power-adjustable mirrors, two household power outlets, additional cargo lights,  and storage bins under the driver seat and in the rear door. </p>, <p>Stepping  up to the 1500 <strong>SV</strong> trim adds standard  power-adjustable mirrors, rear parking sensors, a cargo mat, trim panels on the  cargo walls, and a four-speaker stereo with redundant steering wheel controls.  The 2500 SV also comes with a center console, cupholders and additional 12-volt  power outlets. The top <strong>SL</strong> trim is  available starting with the 2500 model and includes heated mirrors, chrome  exterior trim, chrome wheels, a security system and an eight-way power driver  seat.</p>, <p>Opting  for the V8 in the SV and SL trim levels adds extendable tow mirrors, two front  tow hooks, a prewired Class IV receiver hitch and a trailer brake controller.  High-roof models add integrated roof-rack mounting points and an overhead  console.</p>, <p>Bundled  add-ons include the Back Door Glass package (rear windows with defrosters and a  rearview mirror) and the Navigation package (navigation, a 5.8-inch  touchscreen, NissanConnect mobile apps, voice recognition and satellite radio).  Some features are available as options on various trims.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan NV Passenger is a heavy-duty van that offers the choice of a V6  or a V8 engine and highly configurable seats. It's a good option for commercial  users who need a flexible shuttle vehicle. </p>, <p>Although the NV Passenger is obviously  meant for people transport, underneath it's still a rugged, full-size van with  many of the capabilities that buyers demand from this type of vehicle. With the  standard V6 engine, payload capacity is up to 2,800 pounds and towing capacity  tops out at 6,200 pounds. Specify the V8 and you'll get up to 8,700 pounds in  towing ability. </p>, <p>The NV comes with some downsides, such as  subpar fuel economy and no option for a 15-passenger configuration. But if  you're in the market for a large van that can do double duty carrying a sports  team or a load of cargo, the 2018 Nissan NV Passenger is definitely worth a  look. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan NV Passenger is a  full-size van with seating for up to 12 passengers. It is offered in three trim  levels, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong> and <strong>SL</strong>, with a choice  of two engines. The base engine is a 4.0-liter V6 (261 horsepower, 281  pound-feet of torque) paired with a five-speed automatic transmission that  sends power to the rear wheels. A 5.6-liter V8 (375 hp, 387 lb-ft) is available  as an option on the S and SV trims, standard for the SL, and comes with a  seven-speed automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>S</strong> trim is outfitted with three rows  of configurable bench seats, front and rear air conditioning, power windows and  door locks, remote keyless entry, cruise control, a tilt-only steering wheel, a  rearview camera, a 5-inch color display, Bluetooth, a USB port, and a  two-speaker stereo with a CD player. </p>, <p>The <strong>SV</strong> adds some chrome exterior  accents, a security system, rear parking sensors, an eight-way power driver  seat, a center console, four 12-volt power outlets throughout the cabin,  overhead lighting for the passenger rows, audio controls on the steering wheel,  and an upgraded six-speaker stereo.</p>, <p>S  and SV models with the V8 engine also get extendable tow mirrors and a Class IV  towing hitch with a brake controller.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>SL</strong> trim is only  available with the V8 engine. It adds foglights, front parking sensors, leather  upholstery for all rows, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate  control for the front seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 5.8-inch  touchscreen, a navigation system, NissanConnect mobile apps and satellite  radio.</p>, <p>Just  one option is available, the Navigation package, which fits the SV with the  SL's navigation system, a 5.8-inch display, NissanConnect and satellite radio.</p>]

[<p>Nissan's  NV200 small cargo van can squeeze through congested traffic and slip into those  small curbside parking spots that leave larger vans circling the block. This  Nissan (and its Chevrolet City Express twin) is also significantly more  fuel-efficient than those full-size cargo vans; the EPA says it can return 25  mpg in combined city and highway driving. </p>, <p>For  light-duty commercial business use, the NV200 should be sufficient. The small  van's cargo hold will fit a full-size standard pallet between the rear  wheelwells and swallow almost 1,500 pounds of whatever payload you need to  haul. It's also one of the most affordable cargo vans on the market.</p>, <p>The  NV200 has some downsides, though. Its performance is underwhelming —  some competing vans offer gutsier engines — and its interior is  utilitarian to a fault. Most other small cargo vans offer more interior room,  too. Still, if you need an inexpensive cargo van, the NV200 is worth checking  out.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Nissan NV200 is a two-passenger compact cargo van designed for commercial  use. It's offered in <strong>S</strong> and <strong>SV</strong> trims. The sparsely equipped S is  priced accordingly, while the SV is more upscale and can be fitted with more  optional features. Both come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (131  horsepower and 139 pound-feet of torque), a continuously variable automatic  transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features on the <strong>S</strong> model include  15-inch steel wheels, sliding side doors, 40/60-split swing-out rear cargo  doors, wide-angle spotter mirrors, air conditioning, cloth and vinyl  upholstery, a height-adjustable driver's seat, a fold-flat passenger seat, a  tilt-only steering wheel, power windows and door locks, a rearview camera,  Bluetooth, a two-speaker audio system, a USB input, and a 5-inch color display  for controlling audio and phone functions. Cruise control and rear parking  sensors are optional. </p>, <p>The <strong>SV</strong> offers heated power mirrors,  keyless entry, cruise control, an additional rear 12-volt power outlet, and six  cargo area tie-down hooks. The SV also presents more options, including a  Navigation package that adds navigation, a 5.8-inch touchscreen display, voice  controls, smartphone app integration and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Optional  on both the S and SV are right-hand side and rear door windows with privacy  glass and wire mesh guards, rear parking sensors, a rear defroster and an  interior rearview mirror.</p>]

[<p>Versatile,  roomy and even somewhat rugged, the 2018 Nissan Pathfinder checks several boxes  for shoppers looking for a three-row crossover SUV. It's got a classy, upscale  interior and a V6 engine with plenty of power for towing. The Pathfinder  strikes an excellent balance of quality and utility.</p>, <p>After  some substantial upgrades in 2017 — among them, new engine technology  for more power, fortified suspension and steering, and increased towing  capacity — the Pathfinder carries into 2018 with only a few changes.  One of them is noteworthy, however: The automatic emergency braking safety  feature, previously available only on upper trims, joins the base model's  standard equipment. </p>, <p>There's  also a new Rear Door Alert, intended to remind the driver of people, pets or  objects that might still be present when the driver exits the car. It works by  registering whether the door was opened before a trip but not reopened at the  end of that trip or ignition cycle. It's a nifty feature that proves its worth  with just one use, and it comes standard on all Pathfinders. </p>, <p>The  Pathfinder also offers one of the sharpest infotainment interfaces around. The  8-inch touchscreen looks great and is supplemented by an intuitive  dial-and-button controller (although its vertical location on the center stack  makes less sense than down on the center console near the shifter as with many  rival systems). On the downside, the Pathfinder offers relatively compact cargo  capacity and utility compared to others. </p>, <p>None  of this detracts from the Pathfinder overall, though. It elevates the humble  family SUV to something slightly less than luxury, but more upscale than  utilitarian. It's a happy middle ground, backed up by some real capability,  that makes it worth a look for anyone considering a three-row crossover. </p>]

[<p>The  seven-passenger 2018 Nissan Pathfinder is offered in four main trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong>, <strong>SL</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>S</strong> comes with a range of  essential features and nice surprises, starting with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (284  horsepower, 259 pound-feet of torque) paired with a continuously variable  automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive comes standard, but a four-wheel-drive  system is optional and includes hill descent control and a special  four-wheel-drive locking function for extra traction.</p>, <p>Highlights  of the <strong>S</strong> trim's standard features  include 18-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, tri-zone automatic climate control, a  rearview camera, keyless ignition and entry, a 60/40-split folding second-row  seat (which also slides and reclines), Bluetooth, an 8-inch touchscreen  interface, and a six-speaker sound system with HD and satellite radio, a CD  player, dual USB media inputs and two additional charge-only USB ports for rear  passengers. Automatic emergency braking also comes standard. </p>, <p>The <strong>SV</strong> adds helpful features including  automatic headlights, foglights, rear parking sensors, a power-adjustable  driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an auto-dimming rearview  mirror. An optional All Weather package offers heated front seats, along with  heated side mirrors and steering wheel. A navigation system, driver safety aids  (including blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and adaptive cruise  control), Nissan telematics services and a trailer hitch receiver are available  with the optional Tech package. </p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>SL</strong>, our recommended trim,  adds the features from the SV's All Weather and Tech packages, as well as  leather upholstery, a power liftgate, a top-down 360-degree parking camera  system, a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated second-row seats and upgraded  interior trim. </p>, <p>The  optional SL Premium package adds 20-inch wheels, a panoramic sunroof, a  13-speaker Bose audio system and a trailer hitch receiver. You can also order  the SL with the Midnight Edition package, which adds blacked-out 20-inch  wheels, side mirrors, roof rails and other cosmetic elements. </p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Platinum</strong> bundles all the  previously mentioned options with 20-inch wheels, LED headlights, ventilated  front seats, a power-adjustable steering wheel and wood interior trim. A rear  seat entertainment system with dual 8-inch headrest displays is optional for  the Platinum only. </p>]

[<p>The word "rogue" gets a lot of  play in today's media and conversation. Similar to "maverick," it's  often used flatteringly to describe someone who defies convention to forge his  or her own singular path. While you can certainly credit Nissan's marketers for  smartly tapping into this theme, the 2018 Nissan Rogue is not that kind of car. </p>, <p>Really, this is about as mainstream a  choice for a small crossover as you'll find. Nissan sells loads of them. And  there's a lot to like. Cabin and seat comfort are excellent, as are cargo space  and utility. The Rogue's ability to seat up to seven passengers gives it a  notable advantage among compact crossovers, and its upscale interior materials  and design give the cabin a classy feel. Seventy cubic feet of cargo space also  makes it one of the roomier and more versatile small SUVs around. </p>, <p>But the Rogue's lethargic acceleration  and poor visibility drop it a notch from competitors that do better. Its sole  four-cylinder engine and sluggish continuously variable automatic transmission  (CVT) drag down an otherwise competent package, and there's nary a hint of  handling spirit that you'll find in the Rogue's competitors from Honda, Mazda  or even Chevrolet. The Rogue is enticing, yes, but it doesn't do much to stand  out from the pack or measure up to its namesake.</p>]

[<p>The  new 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport is a five-passenger compact crossover SUV with  three trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong> and <strong>SL</strong>. The S trim is pretty basic but SV and SL get some desirable  upgrades. All Rogue Sport trims come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (141  horsepower, 147 pound-feet of torque) and a continuously variable automatic  transmission (CVT) that sends power to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is  optional.</p>]

[<p>Note  that standard equipment for the Rogue Sport can vary slightly depending on when  it was built. The following information is for the so-called 2018.5 Rogue  Sport; Rogue Sports built earlier in the model year lack some of the driver  safety aids that Nissan added as standard equipment to the 2018.5.</p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights for the <strong>S </strong>include  16-inch steel wheels, cruise control, air conditioning, cloth upholstery,  60/40-split folding rear seats that slide and recline, a rearview camera,  Bluetooth, a 5-inch infotainment display, Siri Eyes Free iPhone control, and a  four-speaker CD player with a USB input and satellite radio. Also included is  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and forward collision  warning with automatic braking.</p>, <p>The  Rogue Sport's <strong>SV</strong> trim adds a few  creature comforts and upgrades such as 17-inch alloy wheels, roof rails,  automatic headlights, keyless entry and ignition, a cargo management system,  dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver's seat and a  six-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>SL</strong> trim includes  19-inch wheels, foglights, heated mirrors, remote start, adaptive cruise  control, leather upholstery, a heated and leather-wrapped steering wheel,  heated front seats, a 7-inch touchscreen, a surround-view camera system,  NissanConnect emergency and convenience telematics, and a navigation system.</p>, <p>Seventeen-inch  wheels are available for base models via the S Appearance package, and most of  the SL's standard features, such as heated seats and upgraded  navigation/multimedia, are optional for SV trims in the SV Technology package. </p>, <p>The  SL Premium package adds a sunroof, LED headlights, automatic emergency braking  with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the<strong> 2014 Nissan Rogue SL </strong>(2.5L inline-4 |  CVT automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, Nissan has revised the current Rogue, notably  adding more sound insulation to curb excess powertrain noise and now offering  expanded technology, including semi-autonomous driving features. Our findings  remain broadly applicable to this year's Rogue, however. </p>]

[<p>with  increased demand for crossovers, Nissan has parlayed the success of its larger  Rogue into the smaller 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport. It seats five passengers,  offers good cargo space, and has a lower profile and sleeker look than its  counterpart. Alongside competitors such as the Honda HR-V and the Mazda CX-3,  the Rogue Sport offers innovative tech and driver assistance features to help  it stand out. </p>, <p>Despite  its size and entry-level spot in Nissan's SUV lineup, the 2018 Rogue Sport  offers a lot of cargo capacity for the class, plus available safety features  that include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, automatic  emergency braking, and a surround-view camera. Few other subcompacts can be so  roundly equipped. </p>, <p>But  while its virtues are impressive, the Rogue Sport is outrun —  literally — by its faster Honda and Mazda rivals, and it also  struggles to deliver the refinement of other competitors. Overall, we think the  Rogue Sport is a good choice if utility is a priority, but it's worth  considering some of the more well-rounded choices in the class. </p>]

[<p>The Nissan Sentra offers straightforward  practicality and an appealing price. There's plenty of cargo space and lots of  room for passengers. It's also an easy car to live with thanks to simple  controls and a smooth driving experience.</p>, <p>That said, nothing about the Sentra  stands out in the class. Its base engine is one of the slowest available, and  even the optional turbocharged engine lags behind some competitors in terms of  outright performance. There are also rival sedans that offer nicer interiors  and greater degrees of comfort and technology. </p>, <p>A good example is the Kia Forte, which  has an extensive list of optional features for a reasonable price. There's also  the all-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza that has many excellent active safety  features and driver aids available. Finally, the Honda Civic, when equipped  with its available turbocharged 1.5-liter engine, is our overall favorite  vehicle in the class.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Nissan Sentra sedan is offered in <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong>, <strong>SR</strong>, <strong>SR Turbo</strong>, <strong>Nismo</strong>, and <strong>SL </strong>trim levels. A 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 124  horsepower and 125 pound-feet of torque (130 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque  with the S trim's manual transmission) is standard on the S, SV, SR and SL  models. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the S, and a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is optional on that model  and standard on all other Sentras. </p>]

[<p>The  base Sentra <strong>S</strong> comes with 16-inch  steel wheels, automatic headlights, remote keyless entry, air conditioning, a height-adjustable  driver seat, 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering column, cruise control, trip computer, a 5-inch central touchscreen, a  rearview camera and Bluetooth audio connectivity. Automatic emergency braking  for imminent front collisions is now also standard on all CVT-equipped Sentra  trim levels, except the Nismo. </p>, <p>Stepping  up to the SV gets you 16-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry and ignition,  upgraded cloth upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a six-speaker sound system and satellite radio. </p>, <p>The  SR gets 17-inch alloy wheels, rear disc brakes, a sport body kit including a  rear spoiler, LED headlights (low beams), foglights, adaptive cruise control,  heated mirrors, unique cloth upholstery and heated front seats. </p>, <p>For  both the SV and SR, heated front seats and side mirrors, a sunroof and a  5.8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with navigation are optional.</p>, <p>The  SR Turbo takes the SR trim and adds a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder (188  hp and 177 lb-ft), mated to a choice of a six-speed manual or a specially  calibrated CVT with a manual-shift mode. Nissan also adds a sport-tuned  suspension, recalibrated steering, upgraded front brakes and a sunroof.</p>, <p>Optional  upgrades for the SR and SR Turbo include leather upholstery, a power driver  seat, an auto-dimming mirror, a power sunroof, the bigger touchscreen with  navigation, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and an  eight-speaker Bose audio system with  <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/connect">NissanConnect</a> app connectivity.</p>, <p>The  Sentra Nismo comes with the SR Turbo's features and adds a lot of Nismo-branded  trim pieces such as a spoiler, 18-inch wheels, exhaust, grille and badges,  along with a unique interior appearance package. It also comes standard with  NissanConnect and the larger touchscreen, as well as the eight-speaker Bose  stereo system. </p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line SL loses the SR's sport-themed flourishes, keeps the 1.8-liter  engine, and adds unique 17-inch alloy wheels plus the rear disc brakes, leather  upholstery, a six-way power driver seat (with power lumbar adjustment), an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, a moonroof, a larger 5.8-inch touchscreen with  navigation and voice controls, NissanConnect, and the premium eight-speaker  Bose stereo system. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic  alert is also standard.</p>]

[<p>There  are few metrics by which the 2018 Nissan Titan beats its rivals outright.  Several full-size pickup trucks can tow more, haul more and have more modern  interiors. Overall, though, the 2018 Titan is still appealing. </p>, <p>It  might not have gargantuan towing capabilities, but the 2018 Nissan Titan is  thoroughly qualified to pull most trailers. It doesn't have an ultra-luxurious  or modern vibe, but it does have several tech and safety features worth noting.  What's more, the Titan is comfortable, versatile and competitively priced. The  Titan wouldn't likely be our first choice in the full-size truck segment, but  it's still worth considering, especially if you're a buyer looking for a  well-rounded package. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Nissan Titan is a full-size pickup truck available in five trims: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong>, <strong>SL</strong>, <strong>Platinum Reserve</strong> and the off-road-oriented <strong>Pro-4X</strong>. As is the case with most full-size trucks, there are  multiple cab configurations and a wide array of options. The S is essentially a  basic work truck. The SV and SL bring more in the way of convenience and tech  features (power mirrors, an upgraded stereo), while the Platinum Reserve adds  mostly luxury equipment (leather upholstery and chrome accents). The Pro-4X  offers some unique off-road equipment and a more rugged appearance. </p>]

[<p>Depending  on your needs, you can get a Titan as a crew cab with a short (5-foot-7-inch)  bed, a single cab with a long (8-foot) bed, or an extended cab with a standard  (6-foot-6.7-inch) bed. The single cab can seat two or three, while the King Cab  and the crew cab can seat five or six, depending on the trim level.</p>, <p>The  Titan <strong>S</strong> work truck is available with  any of the three cab configurations and comes standard with a 5.6-liter V8  engine (390 horsepower, 394 pound-feet of torque) paired to a seven-speed  automatic transmission. It includes 18-inch steel wheels, an active grille  shutter, cab-mounted LED bed lights, a lockable damped tailgate, remote locking  and unlocking, manual exterior mirrors, push-button ignition, air conditioning,  cloth upholstery, a vinyl floor, power windows and locks, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, a 40/20/40-split folding front bench seat, a 60/40-split  folding rear seat, a 5-inch color display, Bluetooth, NissanConnect with Mobile  Apps, and a six-speaker audio system with a CD player, an auxiliary input and a  USB port.</p>, <p>Step  up to the <strong>SV</strong>, and you'll also get  alloy wheels, chrome exterior trim (bumpers, door handles and grille), front  tow hooks (4x4 only), power-adjustable heated mirrors, a carpeted floor, cloth  and vinyl upholstery, a driver information display, satellite radio and  Nissan's Trailer Sway Control, which helps keep a trailer tracking straight  when buffeted by crosswinds or while driving on poor-quality roads.</p>, <p>On  top of the SV's equipment, the off-road-focused <strong>Pro-4X </strong>(4WD only) gets dark-finish wheels with all-terrain tires,  off-road-tuned Bilstein shocks, a lockable rear differential, hill descent  control, a receiver hitch, and a seven-pin wiring harness connector, skid  plates, automatic headlights, foglights, automatic wipers, a spray-in bedliner,  a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, keyless  entry and ignition, front bucket seats, an eight-way power-adjustable driver  seat (with power lumbar), unique cloth upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 7-inch touchscreen, voice  controls (with Siri Eyes Free), a navigation system, a rear air vent, a  120-volt household-style power outlet and floor mats.</p>, <p>Next  is the <strong>SL</strong> (available only in crew  cab), which takes the Pro-4X's upgrades (minus the all-terrain tires and  off-road mechanical upgrades) and adds 20-inch wheels, power-folding mirrors  with puddle lamps, running boards, a power-sliding rear window, LED cargo box  lighting, and a Utili-Track bed rail system with four movable tie-down cleats.  It also has remote engine start, front and rear parking sensors, a  power-adjustable steering wheel, driver-seat memory functions, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, a four-way power passenger seat, heated front seats, leather  upholstery, a Rockford Fosgate 12-speaker audio system, a 120-volt outlet  inside the bed, and NissanConnect Services, a subscription-based emergency  telematics features suite.</p>, <p>The  range-topping <strong>Platinum Reserve</strong> builds upon the SL's features, adding unique wheels, dark chrome exterior trim,  a 360-degree parking camera, upgraded leather upholstery, chrome and wood  interior accents, a heated steering wheel with wood inserts, ventilated front  seats and heated rear seats.</p>, <p>Several  option packages are available, many of which bring the luxury and utility  features from higher trims to the lower trims. Other notable packages include  the SL Tow package (tow mirrors, a trailer brake controller, and front tow  hooks for rear-wheel-drive models), the SV and SL's Chrome package (20-inch chrome  wheels, chrome exhaust tips and a chrome grille) and the Platinum Utility  package (in-bed Titan Box storage bins, a remote locking tailgate and a bed  utility step). The Platinum Reserve can also be ordered with a rear-seat DVD  entertainment system and an Off-Road package with the Pro-4X's 18-inch alloys,  all-terrain tires and Bilstein shocks. The Midnight Edition package is  available on SV and SL crew-cab models, and it adds black body accents, unique  interior trim and black 20-inch wheels. </p>, <p>The  SL and Platinum Reserve come with NissanConnect Services, including automatic  crash notification, stolen-vehicle recovery assistance and roadside assistance.  It's added to the Pro-4X when you buy the Convenience package.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2017 Nissan Titan  Platinum Reserve Crew Cab (5.6L V8 | 7-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Nissan Titan has received some  revisions, such as the addition of a King Cab (extended-cab) configuration, but  our findings remain applicable to this year's Titan.</p>]

[<p>In the world of full-size pickups,  there's a defined split between the light-duty trucks omnipresent throughout  the American heartland and heavy-duty pickups that could probably pull the moon  if you could lasso it. However, there is one truck that effectively straddles  the line between the two: the 2018 Nissan Titan XD.</p>, <p>The Titan XD is in a unique space, able  to tow more and carry a heavier payload than a half-ton truck such as the Ford  F-150 or the standard Titan, but not as much as a heavy-duty pickup. No matter  how you view it, the Titan XD is a highly capable vehicle sold in a variety of  trims, from the fairly basic S work truck to the deluxe Platinum Reserve. Those  who enjoy traversing the wilderness would do well to consider the Pro-4X trim,  the only off-road-oriented model in either truck class available with a diesel  engine. Even though it doesn't boast the outlandish tow ratings of other  heavy-duty trucks, we think the Titan XD is worth considering if you don't need  to pull heavy equipment on a regular basis.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Nissan Titan XD as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Pickup Trucks">Best Pickup Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Titan is a full-size  pickup that sits squarely between the light-duty and heavy-duty versions of its  competitors. Five trims are available: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong>, <strong>Pro-4X</strong>, <strong>SL </strong>and <strong>Platinum Reserve</strong>. The modestly priced S  is basic but better equipped than entry-level competitors. The SV adds a few  extra features for a modest price bump, while the SL is considerably more  expensive with a ton of additional luxuries. The Platinum Reserve sits at the  top of the trim ladder with a richly appointed cabin. The Pro-4X stands apart  with tons of mechanical enhancements for off-road dominance.</p>]

[<p>All  versions of the 2018 Nissan Titan XD are available with a crew cab matched with  a 6.5-foot bed. The work-oriented S and SV trims are also available with a  single cab and an 8-foot bed. The extended-cab variant (Nissan calls it King  Cab) is offered with the 6.5-foot bed in S, SV and Pro-4X trims. In all cases,  shoppers can choose between a 5.6-liter V8 gasoline engine (390 horsepower and  394 pound-feet of torque) or a turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 diesel (310 hp and 555  lb-ft). Rear-wheel drive is standard, with four-wheel drive available as an  option (it's standard on the Pro-4X model). The gasoline engine is mated to a  seven-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel uses a six-speed  automatic.</p>, <p>Feature  highlights for the entry-level <strong>S</strong> work truck include 17-inch steel wheels, a black grille and black bumpers, a  lockable tailgate, remote locking and unlocking, power windows and locks, a  rearview camera, air conditioning, cruise control, Bluetooth, a bench front  seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats, cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, a  four-speaker audio system, and a 5-inch central display screen with a USB port.  King Cab and crew-cab models get a six-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The <strong>SV</strong> trim adds chrome exterior trim,  power-adjustable and heated mirrors, a receiver hitch with a 4/7-pin wiring  harness connector, a trailer brake controller, an overhead console, upgraded  instrumentation, carpeted floors, cloth upholstery and satellite radio.  Four-wheel-drive models also add front tow hooks.</p>, <p>The  off-road-focused <strong>Pro-4X</strong> model steps  up with standard four-wheel drive, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-terrain tires,  a two-speed transfer case, Bilstein shocks, a lockable rear differential, skid  plates and hill descent control. It also comes with automatic headlights,  foglights, a spray-in bedliner, automatic wipers, keyless entry and ignition,  dual-zone automatic climate control, rear air vents, unique cloth upholstery, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual front captain's chairs with adjustable  lumbar support, storage space under the rear seats, a 120-volt outlet, a 7-inch  touchscreen, navigation, blind-spot monitoring, Siri Eyes Free and  NissanConnect mobile app integration.</p>, <p>The <strong>SL</strong> trim does without the Pro-4X's  off-road gear, building on the list of features with 20-inch alloy wheels,  running boards, a cargo-management rail system and a 120-volt power outlet in  the bed, LED bed lighting, a power-sliding rear window, auto-dimming mirrors,  front and rear parking sensors, remote ignition, a power-adjustable steering  wheel, heated front seats, leather upholstery, a 12-speaker Rockford Fosgate  audio system with expanded entertainment apps, and NissanConnect emergency  telematics.</p>, <p>At  the top of the Titan XD lineup is the <strong>Platinum  Reserve</strong> trim that goes all in with an abundance of chrome trim, premium  leather upholstery, wood trim, a heated steering wheel, cooled front seats,  heated rear seats and a surround-view camera system.</p>, <p>Some  features are available on supporting trims as options. The Platinum Reserve is  eligible for a dual-screen rear entertainment system with two wireless  headphones. The Chrome and Texas Titan packages add a variety of cosmetic  enhancements to the SV and SL trims. The SV and SL are also available with the  new Midnight Edition package, which adds black exterior and interior styling  elements.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Versa offers a huge back  seat and trunk, a comfy ride and good fuel economy. It's also one of the least  expensive cars around, at least in base form. If you're a driver for Lyft or  Uber, a Versa could very well be an ideal car. But if you're car shopping isn't  based on such obvious commercial reasons, the Versa stops making as much sense. </p>, <p>The Versa's base trim level provides so  little equipment we think most car shoppers are going to want the SV trim level  and its Special Edition package. That raises the price to a point more typical  of the subcompact class. And when the Versa is compared to similarly priced  rivals, its appeal dims considerably. </p>, <p>That's because Versa is innocuously  styled, boring to drive, and has a low-rent cabin that will never let you  forget how little you paid. Competitors are more stylish, better-equipped and  enjoyable to drive. So while there is certainly something to be said for  getting a big-car interior for not much money, we think shopping around a bit  is a good idea before settling on this über Uber car.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Versa is a subcompact  sedan available in S, S Plus and SV trim levels. There is also a <a href="/nissan/versa-note/2018/review/">Versa Note hatchback</a>,  but there are a number of significant differences and we review it separately.  Every Versa sedan comes standard with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine (109  horsepower, 107 pound-feet of torque). The base S trim comes only with a  five-speed manual transmission, and the S Plus and SV come only with a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). </p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the base <strong>S</strong> includes 15-inch steel wheels, power  mirrors, manual locks and crank windows, Bluetooth phone connectivity, and a  four-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack. </p>, <p>The <strong>S  Plus </strong>adds an automatic transmission, cruise control and a rear spoiler.</p>, <p>The<strong> SV</strong> trim adds upgraded cloth upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  driver-seat armrest, a 60/40-split folding back seat, power locks and windows,  keyless entry, a USB port, and a media player interface for the sound system.  The SV's Special Edition package adds 15-inch alloy wheels, foglamps, a rearview  camera, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth audio streaming, satellite  radio and a 5-inch touchscreen interface. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Versa Note might be considered a suitable hatchback for young drivers  or shoppers on a tight budget. But among its competitors in the humble  subcompact class, the Versa Note will come up short for most buyers.</p>, <p>The Versa Note is sluggish compared to  most competing models, not particularly fun to drive and lacking in creature  comforts. It does offer comparatively generous rear passenger space and a  cleverly designed cargo system, but these assets are not enough to earn it a  strong recommendation. We suggest checking out the alternatives before settling  on the Versa Note.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Versa Note hatchback  seats five and is offered in three trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SV</strong> and <strong>SR.</strong> It's powered by a 1.6-liter  four-cylinder engine (109 horsepower, 107 pound-feet of torque), routed through  a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) on the way to the front  wheels.</p>]

[<p>Standard  feature highlights for the base <strong>S</strong> trim include 15-inch steel wheels, air conditioning, power mirrors, a tilt-only  steering wheel, cloth upholstery, 60/40-split folding rear seats, Bluetooth  phone integration, and a four-speaker CD player with auxiliary audio input.</p>, <p>The <strong>SV </strong>trim adds remote keyless entry,  cruise control, power windows and locks, upgraded gauges, additional interior  trim, upgraded cloth upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat with an  armrest, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an adjustable cargo floor, a 5-inch  touchscreen display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth streaming audio, USB-iPod  audio input, satellite radio and a hands-free text messaging assistant.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-range <strong>SR </strong>trim adds such  features as sporty exterior treatments, 16-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated  mirrors, a rear spoiler, remote keyless ignition and entry, a vehicle  immobilizer system, Nissan's Easy-Fill Tire Alert system (beeps when the  correct pressure has been reached), a sport steering wheel, simulated suede  upholstery and a center rear armrest. </p>, <p>Some  features are available as options on lower trim levels.</p>]

[<p>The ratings in this review are  based on our full test of the  <strong>2014 Nissan Versa Note SV Hatchback</strong> (1.6L inline-4 | CVT automatic | FWD)</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Nissan Versa Note has received some  revisions. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's 2018 Versa  Note, however.</p>]

[<p>The  Porsche 718 Boxster is a convertible sports car in the classical sense, which  is to say it's focused primarily on nimble handling and driver enjoyment. We  wouldn't want it any other way. Much of its allure comes from its mid-engine  configuration, meaning the engine sits between the seats and rear wheels. This  gives the 718 Boxster (and its fixed-roof 718 Cayman sibling) a handling  balance prized by car enthusiasts. </p>, <p>The  Boxster received the 718 name last year as part of a complete redesign. Though  there were many significant changes as part of the update, the biggest was the  switch from six-cylinder engines to more efficient and powerful turbocharged  four-cylinder engines. While the new engines lack the high-revving charm of the  old ones, it's hard to argue with the performance increase they bring. Even the  cheapest Boxster you can buy is now cranking out 300 horsepower.</p>, <p>Of course,  being a Porsche, the Boxster can also be fitted with all sorts of customization  options. Some enhance the car's performance while others are just for visual  flair. But it's the car's core qualities, including its sublime steering and  handling, plus the carefree nature of owning a two-seat roadster, that will  have you hooked for life. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Porsche 718 Boxster is a two-seat, rear-wheel-drive soft-top convertible sports  car that is available in a base or <strong>S </strong>trim  level. The primary difference between the two is the size and output of the  turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The <strong>S </strong>has the more powerful version. Porsche offers an exhaustive supply of  options for both trims. </p>]

[<p>The base <strong>718 Boxster</strong> comes with a turbocharged  2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder (300 hp, 280 pound-feet of torque)  and 18-inch wheels. Aside from the badges, you can tell it apart from the S by  its black brake calipers and single central tailpipe.</p>, <p>The <strong>718 Boxster S</strong> is furnished with a  turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder (350 hp, 309 lb-ft of torque). It is  visually differentiated from the base model by 19-inch wheels, two centrally  mounted exhaust tips and red brake calipers. </p>, <p>With minor  exception, both trim levels start with the same level of standard equipment,  including a power-folding soft top, xenon headlights, a six-speed manual  transmission, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, power and  heated side mirrors, automatic climate control, sport seats, partial leather  upholstery, Bluetooth, a touchscreen display, and a six-speaker sound system  with satellite radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>Both trims  also have equal access to Porsche's exhaustive options list, providing numerous  opportunities for prospective owners to personalize their car. </p>, <p>Performance  choices include Porsche's PDK seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic,  carbon-ceramic brakes, an adaptive suspension, a louder exhaust, and a  mechanical rear differential that also includes a brake-actuated torque  vectoring system. The Sport Chrono package adds a stopwatch to the top of the  center console, a drive mode selection dial to the bottom right of the steering  wheel, and a less intrusive stability control setting. When optioned with the  PDK transmission, the package also includes launch control. </p>, <p>Interior  options to look out for include upgraded seats (heating, ventilation and more power  adjustments), upgraded leather upholstery, and keyless ignition and entry.  Porsche offers two upgrades for the standard stereo: a 10-speaker Bose system  and a 12-speaker Burmester system. Apple CarPlay is available through Porsche  Connect, while a Plus variant of that option adds 4G LTE connectivity. Safety  options include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and  mitigation, turn-adapting headlights and blind-spot monitoring, </p>, <p>Porsche  also provides seemingly endless ways to customize the 718 Boxster's interior  and exterior, from wheel style to the color of the soft top to completely  custom body paint. The interior offers multiple leather and stitching styles,  and trims are available in wood, aluminum and simulated suede.</p>]

[<p>Last year, the Porsche Cayman gained a  new numerical name (718 is shared between it and its Boxster convertible  sibling), incremental improvements to its handling and fundamental changes to  its available engines. It didn't look that different, but there was a lot  happening underneath the sheet metal. </p>, <p>Just like last year, the 2018 Porsche 718  Cayman features turbocharged four-cylinder engines. These new engines outdo  their six-cylinder predecessors in terms of output and fuel economy. But we're  disappointed in the way they sound: They don't provide the high-revving  excitement of the old flat-sixes.</p>, <p>That's the only area where the revised  Cayman isn't clearly better, though. The steering is quicker and sharper, the  brakes are more powerful, and the optional adaptive suspension gained an  increase in adjustability. There's also a revised stability control system that  provides more of a safety net out on the road in Normal and gives you more  leeway in Sport. </p>, <p>This year's Cayman is pretty much  unchanged, and we're just fine with that. If you're seeking a pure driver's  car, there are few out there that can match the 2018 Porsche 718 Cayman.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Porsche 718 Cayman is a two-seat  coupe available in <strong>Cayman </strong>and <strong>Cayman S</strong> trim levels. (The 718 Boxster  is the convertible version and <a href="/porsche/718-boxster/2018/">reviewed separately</a>.)  The Cayman has a turbocharged 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder  engine (a flat-four) good for 300 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque. The  Cayman S has a turbocharged 2.5-liter flat-four good for 350 hp and 309 lb-ft  of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is standard and a seven-speed,  dual-clutch automatic transmission (Porsche's PDK) is optional.</p>]

[<p>Standard features on the <strong>718 Cayman</strong> include 18-inch wheels,  performance summer tires, xenon headlights, LED running lights, heated mirrors,  front and rear parking sensors, automatic climate control, a rearview camera,  six-way adjustable seats (power backrest adjustments, manual all others), a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, partial leather upholstery, Bluetooth, a  7-inch touchscreen, two USB ports, and a six-speaker audio system with a CD  player and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>718  Cayman S </strong>only differs in its more powerful engine and 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Like every Porsche, the options list is  extensive, allowing for a great deal of customization. Performance add-ons  include a selection of 19- and 20-inch wheels, a steering upgrade for lighter  low-speed effort, Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) that adds  adaptive dampers and lowers ride height 10mm (the Cayman S is eligible for PASM  Sport that lowers it 20 millimeters), Porsche Torque Vectoring (a brake-based  differential), ceramic composite brakes and a sport exhaust.</p>, <p>There's  also the Porsche Sport Chrono package, which includes dynamic transmission  mounts, a digital and analog stopwatch mounted atop the dash, a driving mode  switch on the steering wheel, launch control (for PDK models), an additional  performance display, and a Sport response button that sharpens engine and  transmission response for 20 seconds.</p>, <p>Comfort  and convenience options include adaptive headlights, LED adaptive headlights,  headlight washers, auto-dimming mirrors, a rear window wiper, power-folding  mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control,  heated and ventilated seats, 14-way power-adjustable seats, upgraded seats with  more aggressive bolstering and either manual or power adjustments, several  types of upgrade leather and upholstery, a navigation system, Car Connect  (includes Apple CarPlay and a variety of emergency services), Car Connect Plus  (adds a 4G LTE connection and Wi-Fi hotspot), updatable navigation maps and  online navigation system elements, a 10-speaker Bose audio upgrade and a  12-speaker premium Burmester audio system. </p>]

[<p>Few cars match the 911's poise in so many areas. The 911 range is at once fast  yet tremendously composed, rewarding and civilized. Likewise, there are few  cars that are offered in such an onslaught of variants — for 2018,  there are 20 distinct 911s. Porsche's strategy of methodically rolling out a  new variant nearly every six months (or so it seems) has been so successful  that it has been adopted in varying degrees by many other automakers. </p>, <p>The 911 shares its front-end architecture with the lesser  718 Boxster/Cayman models, which reduces cost — the bones from the  firewall forward are largely shared. Aft of the firewall, the 911 is like no  other car. Its 2+2 seating arrangement and engine hung outside of the rear axle are unique in the motoring world. </p>, <p>While in the past the 911's rear engine layout has  been at the root of some wayward handling characteristics, there is no denying  the braking and acceleration benefits that it imparts. And the modern 911 has  thoroughly exorcised its more notorious habits. In the process the 911 has  morphed into more of a GT car, something that is larger and more comfortable  for long journeys than 911s of yore. Yet there is no denying it is an  accomplished driver's car with few equals.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Porsche 911 is available in a breathtaking number of trim levels and body  styles. At its most basic level, there's the standard rear-wheel-drive <strong>Carrera </strong>coupe or the open-top <strong>Cabriolet</strong>. Each of those models is  available with all-wheel drive, which is designated as the <strong>Carrera 4 </strong>or<strong> Carrera 4  Cabriolet. </strong>There's also a <strong>Targa </strong>model  with a retractable hardtop that is only available with all-wheel drive. All of  the aforementioned models are also available in a higher-performance S version.  There's also an even higher-performance <strong>Carrera  GTS</strong> that is available on all three body styles. The most powerful  rear-wheel-drive model is the track-ready<strong> GT3</strong>. Finally, there's the all-wheel-drive <strong>911 Turbo</strong>. It, too, is available as a coupe or convertible in  either standard tune or more powerful S tune. If that's not enough, the Porsche  Exclusive program provides for further customization.</p>]

[<p><strong>Carrera</strong> models are rear-wheel-drive coupes and are equipped with a 3.0-liter twin-turbo  flat-six engine (370 hp, 331 lb-ft). A seven-speed manual gearbox is standard;  the PDK dual-clutch automatic is optional. Don't be fooled by its  "base" billing — the Carrera is one hell of a satisfying  car that is often overlooked.</p>, <p><strong>Carrera  4</strong> models (and others with the numeral 4 in their names) add all-wheel drive and  1.7-inch-wider rear fenders.</p>, <p>All <strong>S </strong>models  (aside from the Turbo S) have a twin-turbo 3.0-liter flat-six engine with more  power (420 hp, 368 lb-ft), larger brakes, a limited-slip differential and  20-inch wheels. Optional features on S models that are unavailable on the base  versions include a sport suspension, active stabilizer bars and rear-wheel  steering system. </p>, <p><strong>Cabriolet </strong>models  are equipped an electrically operated folding soft top, while <strong>Targa </strong>variants have an electrically  stowable hard roof panel. </p>, <p><strong>GTS </strong>variants  are essentially S models with more standard equipment, a power increase (450  hp, 405 lb-ft), the wider rear fenders of 4 models on all GTS variants, and  unique interior and exterior trim. These models are deceptively desirable.</p>, <p><strong>Turbo </strong>models  are mega-powerful cars with an immense range of talents. They have a 3.8-liter  twin-turbo flat-six engine (540 hp, 486 lb-ft) and rear fenders that are 2.8  inches wider than the base 911's, and are equipped exclusively with a PDK  gearbox and all-wheel drive. <strong>Turbo S</strong> models have more power (580 hp, 516 lb-ft), center-lock wheels, active  stabilizer bars, carbon-ceramic brakes, 18-way adaptive sport seats with  backrests in leather, a two-tone leather interior and adaptive LED headlights  as standard equipment.</p>, <p><strong>GT3 </strong>models  are the most focused of all 911s and are favored heavily by the trackday  contingent of owners. They are exclusively rear-wheel-drive coupes that have a  nonturbocharged 4.0-liter flat-six engine (500 hp, 339 lb-ft) and a choice of  seven-speed PDK or a unique six-speed manual gearbox. A fixed rear wing and  unique front end and underbody treatments enhance its aerodynamic performance.  Rear-wheel steering, active engine mounts, a mechanical limited-slip  (PDK-equipped GT3s have an active differential), unique seats, navigation and a  track analysis app are standard.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2017 Porsche 911 Carrera S</strong> (turbo 3.0L  flat-6 | 7-speed dual-clutch automatic | RWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 911 has received only minor  revisions. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's 911.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Porsche Cayenne is one of those  vehicles that has a broad range of appeal. On one hand, it's an SUV that is  focused on performance, yet it's very luxurious and easy to live with on an  everyday basis. There's also a wide breadth of powerplants, from a base V6 to a  hybrid model, all the way up to a stout V8. Likewise, the price varies wildly  from the $60,000 range to almost triple that for the top-of-the-line Cayenne  Turbo S.</p>, <p>Throughout the Cayenne lineup, there are  plenty of personalization options to suit your particular tastes. You can  choose from a dizzying array of colors, wheels, interior materials, trim  elements and performance-related upgrades. Since it's a Porsche, these options  will send the price skyrocketing, so be warned.</p>, <p>As good as the Porsche Cayenne is, there are some  drawbacks to keep in mind. We consider the rear seat and cargo area adequate,  but other SUVs in the class are more spacious. For the money, we also expect  more standard features. Our biggest complaint, however, is with the E-Hybrid model, which remains one of the least impressive hybrids we've evaluated.  Otherwise, we're fans of the 2018 Porsche Cayenne and we're confident you will  be, too.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Porsche Cayenne is a five-passenger midsize  SUV available in six levels of trim: <strong>Cayenne</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>S E-Hybrid</strong>, <strong>GTS</strong>, <strong>Turbo</strong> and <strong>Turbo S</strong>. Each has a different engine and a consequent increase in  performance, although they do typically include a few extra features with each  step up. All come with all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic  transmission. Within these trim levels are two more generously equipped  submodels: the<strong> Cayenne Platinum</strong> and <strong>Cayenne S E-Hybrid Platinum</strong>. </p>]

[<p>Standard feature highlights for the <strong>base Cayenne</strong> include a 3.6-liter V6  (300 horsepower, 295 pound-feet of torque), 18-inch wheels, xenon headlights,  power-folding heated mirrors, a power tailgate, dual-zone automatic climate  control, eight-way power-adjustable front seats, partial leather upholstery,  40/20/40-split folding rear seats (with slide and recline), Bluetooth phone and  streaming audio, a 7-inch central touchscreen, a  navigation system and a 10-speaker audio system with satellite radio and  auxiliary/USB input.</p>, <p>The<strong> Cayenne S</strong> gets a more powerful turbocharged version of the 3.6-liter V6 (420 hp, 406  lb-ft) plus 19-inch wheels, a sunroof, speed-sensitive variable steering effort  (Power Steering Plus), front and rear parking sensors and driver-seat memory  functions.</p>, <p>The <strong>Cayenne S  E-Hybrid</strong> has a special hybrid-electric powertrain that features a  supercharged 3.0-liter V6 and an electric motor (416 hp and 435 lb-ft of torque  combined). It also includes adaptive suspension dampers (PASM), Porsche Car  Connect with E-Mobility (provides remote access to important hybrid features  via a smartphone app), a 3.6-kilowatt onboard charger (a 7.2-kW charger is  available) and an energy management display in the instrument cluster.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the<strong> Cayenne GTS</strong> gets you a more powerful version of the S engine good  for 440 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. It also offers a variety of additional  performance enhancements that include 20-inch wheels, a specially tuned  adjustable air suspension, larger high-performance brakes, a sport exhaust  system, front sport seats, a simulated-suede headliner and seat inserts, and  unique exterior styling elements.</p>, <p>The <strong>Cayenne  Turbo</strong> adds to the Cayenne S equipment a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 (520  hp, 553 lb-ft), adaptive LED headlights, a heated steering wheel, a full  leather interior, 18-way adaptive power-adjustable front sport seats, heated  front and rear outboard seats, and a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound audio  system.</p>, <p>The range-topping <strong>Cayenne Turbo S </strong>adds an even more powerful version of the Turbo V8  (570 hp, 590 lb-ft) plus 21-inch wheels, two-tone leather upholstery,  carbon-fiber interior trim and the Sport Chrono package with a dash-mounted  timer. It also includes handling upgrades such as active anti-roll bars (PDCC),  brake torque-vectoring and electronic-locking rear differential (PTV Plus) and  ultra high-performance carbon-ceramic brakes.</p>, <p>The two <strong>Platinum  Edition</strong> models adds a selection of popular options plus exclusive 20-inch  wheels and special exterior trim. The E-Hybrid version also includes an auxiliary  climate system that allows preheating or precooling of the cabin. </p>, <p>Many features that come standard on upper trim  levels can be ordered as stand-alone options. Indeed, like other Porsches, the  Cayenne is one of the most customizable vehicles you can buy.</p>, <p>Then you've got even more choices from a dizzying  options list. It starts with four main packages — Sport, Porsche  Connect Plus, Premium and Premium Package Plus — and then goes to a  huge list of stand-alone choices. All serve to enhance the Cayenne's  performance, technology and audio, comfort, safety, and exterior and interior  style. All for a price, of course. </p>]

[<p>No automaker is more skilled at making an  amalgamation of a sports car and an SUV as Porsche. As a great example, check  out the 2018 Porsche Macan. The Macan minimizes the compromise in trading  performance and handling for utility. But how does it do it?</p>, <p>It starts with what's under the hood. Five  fast-revving and powerful engine options, from 252 horsepower all the way to  440 hp, give the Macan plenty of performance. That's combined with a  rear-biased all-wheel-drive system, a quick-shifting seven-speed transmission  and a suspension that's calibrated more for a winding mountain road than for  off-roading. Equipped properly, though, the Macan performs respectably well  once the road gives way to dirt or gravel.</p>, <p>Mix in a high-quality interior and an understated  yet handsome exterior and you end up with a compact luxury crossover that's the  sportiest in its class. There are a couple downsides. From an interior volume  perspective, the Macan isn't the roomiest pick you can make. And like every  other new Porsche, the Macan can be optioned and equipped to your heart's  desire, but that often results in an uncomfortably steep price. But if you want  a small crossover that's a lot like a sports car, the Macan is the way to go.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Porsche Macan is a five-seat compact luxury SUV available in five trim levels  that correspond to different engines: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>GTS</strong>, <strong>Turbo</strong> and <strong>Turbo with Performance Package</strong>. All  come standard with all-wheel drive and a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic  transmission as well as a respectable amount of standard features. Porsche adds  a few more standard items as you move up in the range, but you'll likely need  to visit the options list to get a Macan equipped the way you truly want. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>base</strong> model comes standard with features  such as a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (252 hp, 273 lb-ft of  torque), 18-inch wheels, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, a  lane departure warning system, a power liftgate, xenon headlights, automatic  wipers, rear privacy glass, three-zone automatic climate control, power front  seats, partial leather and simulated suede upholstery, a 60/40-split folding  rear seat and a cargo cover. Electronic features include the Porsche  Communication Management (PCM) 7-inch touchscreen interface, Bluetooth, Apple  CarPlay, and a 10-speaker sound system with satellite and HD radios, two USB  ports and a CD player.</p>, <p>The <strong>Macan S</strong> gains a turbocharged  3.0-liter V6 engine (340 hp, 339 lb-ft), 19-inch wheels, more powerful brakes,  different exterior trim types and dual twin-pipe exhaust ports.</p>, <p>The <strong>Macan GTS </strong>has a more powerful  version of the S engine (360 hp, 369 lb-ft) plus a sport-tuned adaptive air  suspension, 20-inch wheels, unique exterior design elements, a sport exhaust,  adaptive headlights, front-seat memory functions and heated sport seats unique  to the GTS.</p>, <p>The <strong>Macan Turbo </strong>builds on the Macan  S with an even more powerful V6 engine (400 hp, 406 lb-ft), different 19-inch  wheels, adaptive suspension dampers, a heated steering wheel, upgraded front  sport seats, full leather upholstery, a simulated suede headliner, a navigation  system and a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound audio system.</p>, <p>Finally, Porsche offers a <strong>Macan Turbo  with Performance Package </strong>(440 hp, 442 lb-ft) trim that adds some engine  tweaks for more power and an adaptive air suspension that features a lower ride  height.</p>, <p>Most of  the Turbo's extras are available on the other trims as part of the Macan's  extensive options list. Although virtually all of those options are available  as stand-alone items, there are two noteworthy packages that could make  ordering or selecting a Macan a little simpler. The <strong>Premium package</strong> adds the adaptive headlights, auto-dimming mirrors,  heated front and rear seats and the 14-speaker Bose system. The <strong>Premium Package Plus</strong> adds those items  plus a panoramic sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, and 14-way power front  seats with ventilation and memory functions.</p>, <p>Other options include (and we do mean "include" because there are  countless trim, color and material customization choices) LED headlights,  different wheels from 18 to 21 inches, carbon-ceramic disc brakes,  surround-view parking cameras, lane departure intervention, adaptive cruise  control, noise-reducing privacy glass, roof rails, an adaptive suspension  (PASM), the adaptive air suspension, a sport exhaust, Porsche Torque Vectoring  Plus (brakes individual wheels around turns to improve handling) and the Sport  Chrono package (an enhanced Sport Plus driving mode and launch control).  Inside, you can get a rear side sunshades, extended leather interior trim, a  dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system, Porsche Connect smartphone apps and  a 16-speaker Burmester sound system. </p>]

[<p>The Porsche Panamera was redesigned from the ground  up just a year ago. It got new looks, new engines and a bevy of tech upgrades.  But for Porsche, that's apparently not enough. The 2018 Porsche Panamera gets  two big additions: the Panamera Sport Turismo and the Turbo S E-Hybrid. The  Sport Turismo has an expanded hatchback area that gives the Panamera an almost  wagonlike profile, while the Turbo S E-Hybrid packs more power than almost any  car Porsche has ever made.</p>, <p>With a whopping 680 horsepower and 626 pound-feet of  torque, the Turbo S E-Hybrid will out-accelerate most sports cars on the planet  (Porsche estimates it will go from zero to 60 mph in just 3.2 seconds with the  optional Sport Chrono package). That would be impressive on its own, especially  from such a big, luxurious sedan, but the same car can be plugged in and  charged for, Porsche says, about 30 miles of electric-only range. Last year's  Panamera was already performance-focused and conspicuously luxurious. It's even  more so for the 2018 Panamera.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Porsche Panamera 4S as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/" title="Best Sports Sedans">Best Sports Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>While the  range-topping Turbo S E-Hybrid is appealing, it comes with a mighty price tag  and for that reason, we recommend the <strong>Panamera  Turbo</strong> (non-hybrid). The Turbo is available in all three Panamera body  styles (we prefer the Sport Turismo) and it comes with Porsche's fire-breathing  550-hp twin-turbo V8.</p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the Panamera Turbo includes a wide-view 12.3-inch touchscreen  infotainment system, an adaptive air suspension, full leather upholstery,  10-way power front seats with memory settings, heated rear seats and a  14-speaker Bose audio system.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Porsche Panamera is available in three  different body styles, with five different powertrains. Equipment levels change  as you climb up the ladder, but no matter which one you choose, each Panamera  is highly customizable. Essentially,  if you're buying a Panamera, you're spoiled for choice.</p>]

[<p>At the  bottom of the ladder, there's the only rear-wheel-drive Panamera, the <strong>base</strong> trim. From there, everything else  is all-wheel-drive: the <strong>Panamera 4</strong>, <strong>Panamera 4S</strong>, <strong>Panamera 4 E-Hybrid</strong>, <strong>Panamera  Turbo</strong> and <strong>Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid</strong>.  Everything above the base trim is also offered in the <strong>Executive</strong> body style, which is a longer version of the Panamera  that adds nearly 6 inches of rear legroom. The 4, 4S, 4 E-Hybrid and Turbo  models are also available in a <strong>Sport  Turismo</strong> body style, which has a bigger hatchback cargo area. All Panameras  come with an eight-speed automatic transmission and four seats (a middle rear  seat is optional).</p>, <p>The <strong>base</strong> Panamera<strong> </strong>comes with quite a bit of standard equipment, including a  turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (330 hp, 331 lb-ft), 19-inch wheels, Porsche Active  Suspension Management (also known as adaptive suspension or PASM), LED  headlights, automatic wipers, a panoramic sunroof, a power hatchback trunklid,  power-folding and auto-dimming side mirrors with heating, a two-way adaptive  rear spoiler, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, keyless  ignition (without keyless entry), partial leather upholstery, eight-way  power-adjustable front seats with heating, driver-seat memory settings, dual-zone  automatic climate control, a manually adjustable steering wheel, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks, Bluetooth, a  wide-view 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system (including a navigation  system, Apple CarPlay and a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot), and a 10-speaker audio  system with satellite and HD radio and USB and auxiliary audio inputs.</p>, <p>The <strong>Panamera 4</strong> keeps the same standard  equipment utilizes the same single-turbo 3.0-liter V6 as the standard model but  adds all-wheel drive. The <strong>Panamera 4S</strong> keeps the all-wheel-drive powertrain, but it swaps the engine to a twin-turbo  2.9-liter V6 (440 hp, 405 lb-ft) and adds a unique dual exhaust system. The <strong>Panamera 4 E-Hybrid </strong>gets the 2.9-liter  engine along with an electric motor and a 14-kWh lithium-ion battery (for a  combined 462 hp, 516 lb-ft) with approximately 30 miles of all-electric driving  range. To support the extra weight of the battery pack, air suspension is standard  on the hybrid models.</p>, <p>The more  performance-oriented <strong>Panamera</strong> <strong>Turbo </strong>makes use of a twin-turbocharged  4.0-liter V8 (550 hp, 567 lb-ft), 20-inch wheels, adaptive headlights, an  adaptive air suspension, a four-way adaptive rear spoiler, quad tailpipes, keyless  entry and ignition, a power-adjustable steering wheel, dark walnut wood trim,  synthetic suede roofliner and pillar trim, full leather upholstery, 14-way  power front seats with memory settings, heated rear seats and a 14-speaker Bose  audio system.</p>, <p>At the top  of the ladder, there's the <strong>Panamera</strong> <strong>Turbo S E-Hybrid</strong>, which adds the hybrid  components to the 4.0-liter turbo V8 (for a combined 680 hp and 626 lb-ft).  Essentially, standard equipment is the same as on the regular Turbo with the  addition of 21-inch wheels; ceramic composite brakes; the optional Sport Chrono  package (launch control, a dash-mounted stopwatch, an Individual driving mode  for a custom feel, a dedicated Sport button and performance-oriented displays);  and a second air-conditioning system to cool the car while it's parked.</p>, <p>There's a  long list of stand-alone or bundled options for pretty much every trim level  since Porsche believes that owners should be able to customize their cars to  personal taste. You can have the 4 and the 4S with most of the Turbo's standard  equipment. Additional highlights for the rest of the lineup include various  wheel, paint, interior trim and leather specifications (with multiple two-tone  interior treatments on offer), speed-sensitive steering assist, a sport exhaust,  power-closing doors, a heated steering wheel, a 21-speaker Burmester audio  system, 18-way adaptive sport seats, eight-way power rear seats with memory  function, ventilated front and rear seats, massaging front and rear seats,  four-zone climate control, a rear touchscreen interface, power rear sunshades  and a dual-screen rear entertainment system.</p>]
---http://edmunds.com/ram/1500/2018/review
[<p>Though  the 2018 Ram 1500 is one of the oldest designs on sale in the segment, it's  easy to make the case that the Ram is still our favorite light-duty pickup. One  of the primary reasons is the Ram's smooth ride, which is best in class. It  comes about from the Ram's class-exclusive coil-spring rear suspension and  available self-leveling air suspension.</p>, <p>But that's not all we like. Another Ram strength is its excellent engine  lineup. Although the Ram comes in below the class-leading towing numbers by a  few hundred pounds, it's still abundantly capable. Its standard engine is a  strong but efficient V6, and there's also an optional V8 with plenty of towing  power and a turbocharged diesel V6 that returns excellent fuel economy in the  class.</p>, <p>Once you've picked an engine, several variants are available for the Ram, from  the bare-bones Tradesman to the top-of-the-line Limited and even the  off-road-ready Rebel. The Ram also boasts a modern interior, an easy-to-use  infotainment system, and lots of opportunity for even more customization. </p>, <p>Of course, competing trucks aren't  exactly slouches. But even as the old guy of the group, the Ram is still  standing strong. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Ram 1500 (including the Ram 1500 Diesel) as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Trucks">Best Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ram 1500 is a full-size pickup available in multiple body styles and bed  lengths and with three engine options. The regular cab (two doors) can seat  three and is available with either a standard bed (6 feet 4 inches) or an  extended bed (8 feet). The Quad Cab (four doors) can seat six and comes only  with the standard bed. The crew cab (also four doors, but bigger rear doors)  increases rear-seat legroom and is available with either a short bed (5 feet 7  inches) or the standard bed. </p>]

[<p>There  are 11 standard trim levels: <strong>Tradesman</strong>, <strong>HFE EcoDiesel</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Big Horn/Lone Star</strong>, <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Night</strong>,, <strong>Lone Star Silver</strong>, <strong>Laramie</strong>, <strong>Rebel</strong>, <strong>Laramie Longhorn</strong> and <strong>Limited. </strong>A variety of  special-edition models exist, one of which is the <strong>Harvest</strong>.</p>, <p>Most  trims come standard with a 3.6-liter V6 (305 hp, 269 lb-ft), while Rebel,  Laramie Longhorn and Limited variants come standard with a 5.7-liter V8 (395  hp, 410 lb-ft). For fans of diesel torque, a 3.0-liter diesel V6 (240 hp, 420  lb-ft) will also be available on all but Express, Night and Rebel trims  (delayed availability). Of course, the V8 is optional on all Ram 1500s, save  for the HFE trim. And all three engines are paired with an eight-speed  transmission and can be had in either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The <strong>Tradesman </strong>is the workhorse of  the lineup, with minimal luxury accoutrements and amenities. Just about all of  its exterior parts that aren't metal are black, but it does come with a Class  IV hitch receiver, a spray-in bedliner and cruise control. Like the Tradesman,  the <strong>Express </strong>is also a worker's  truck, but it deletes the hitch and bedliner (they are offered as options) and  adds body-colored exterior trim, carpeting and 20-inch wheels. Both have the  most flexibility with bed and cab configurations and come standard with the V6.</p>, <p>The <strong>HFE EcoDiesel</strong> is a work truck that's  outfitted with the 3.0-liter diesel engine and is intended to be the fuel  economy standout of the lineup. It's available only in a Quad Cab configuration  and comes with few features and fewer options.</p>, <p>But  trucks just aren't about working, so the <strong>Big  Horn</strong> (called <strong>Lone Star</strong> in Texas)  adds more features such as a 110-volt power outlet, dual-zone automatic climate  control, and an 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system dubbed Uconnect  Access. Upgraded cloth seating with a power-adjustable driver's seat and  leather-wrapped steering wheel round things out.</p>, <p><strong>Sport </strong>and <strong>Night </strong>models are similar and bring a street-truck flair to the  lineup with 20-inch wheels, bucket seats, projector headlights, LED interior  lighting and adjustable pedals. While Sport models have body-colored exterior  pieces, Night models are in black, with black wheels to match. Regular-cab,  rear-wheel-drive Sport models are referred to as the R/T and come with 22-inch  wheels, a sport hood and a blacked-out grille with R/T badging.</p>, <p>New-for-2018 <strong>Harvest</strong> trims are available in two  unique colors and have additional ground clearance, all-terrain tires, black  tubular side steps, skid plates and tow hooks, and a unique chrome grille as  well as chrome bumpers and exterior trim.</p>, <p>The <strong>Laramie </strong>is similar to the Big Horn  but also has auto-dimming mirrors, wood trim, heated and ventilated leather  front seats with driver-seat memory settings, and a 10-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Laramie Longhorn </strong>(crew-cab V8 only)  is the perfect blend of luxury and work truck. Added features include keyless  entry and ignition, remote start, front and rear parking sensors, wood interior  trim, upgraded leather upholstery and a navigation system.</p>, <p>At  the top of the range, the <strong>Limited </strong>is  only available with the V8 and adds monotone paint schemes, side-step bars,  automatic windshield wipers, automatic high beams, a self-leveling air  suspension and even fancier stitched leather upholstery.</p>, <p>The  Ram is also available in an off-road-oriented variant called the <strong>Rebel</strong>. On the outside, you'll find  features similar to those on the Sport R/T, but the Rebel has 17-inch wheels  and all-terrain tires, black fender flares, Bilstein shock absorbers, tow  hooks, LED foglights and keyless entry. The Rebel's interior is similar to that  of the Sport, though with a few more features.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our drive of the <strong>Ram 1500 Laramie Crew Cab </strong>(turbo 3.0L  V6 diesel | 8-speed automatic | 4WD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted in 2014, the current Ram 1500 has received some  revisions, primarily around a new infotainment system and updates to trims and  packages. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Ram 1500.</p>]

[<p>As versatile as they are, light-duty  trucks are not one-size-fits-all vehicles, especially if you have serious  towing and hauling needs. For that, you'll need to step up to a heavy-duty  pickup such as the 2018 Ram 2500. To put it into numbers, the Ram 1500 carries  a max tow and payload rating of 10,620 pounds and 1,880 pounds, respectively.  The Ram 2500 comes close to doubling those figures by towing up to 17,980  pounds and carrying 3,890 pounds in the bed. </p>, <p>The Ram 2500 is unique in the heavy-duty  truck segment because of its coil-spring rear suspension that gives it a more  comfortable ride than its competitors. Such a configuration also allows for an  air suspension, just like the one available for the Ram 1500. Besides improved  ride comfort, the air suspension levels the bed when towing and hauling to keep  the headlights pointed straight ahead.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ram 2500 offers something for  everyone, whether you're looking for a basic work truck, a luxury equipment  hauler or a trail-conquering pickup. It's an excellent all-rounder that  surpasses many rivals.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Ram 2500 (including the Ram 2500 Diesel) as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Trucks">Best Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>Like  many heavy-duty pickups, the 2018 Ram 2500 is available in multiple  configurations. There are three cab styles, two bed lengths, three engines, two  transmissions and seven trim levels: <strong>Tradesman</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong>, <strong>Big Horn/Lone Star</strong>, <strong>Laramie</strong>, <strong>Laramie Longhorn</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong> and <strong>Power Wagon. </strong>At one end of the spectrum is the Tradesman, a  minimal-frills workhorse. At the other, the Limited, widens the boundaries of  big-truck luxury. The Power Wagon stands alone as the off-road-ready variant.</p>]

[<p>Cab  styles include a two-door regular cab, a four-door crew cab, and a four-door  jumbo crew cab called the Mega Cab. The regular cab comes with a long bed (8  feet) only, while the crew cab has either the long bed or the short bed (6 feet  4 inches). The Mega Cab rides on the same wheelbase as the long-bed crew cab  but combines an even bigger cabin with the short bed. </p>, <p>Most  2500s come with a 5.7-liter V8 gasoline engine (383 horsepower, 400 pound-feet  of torque) paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. A modified version  of this engine runs on compressed natural gas (CNG) and produces identical  power figures to the gasoline version. The CNG option is only available on  regular and crew-cab models with the 8-foot bed.</p>, <p>There  are two optional engines: a 6.4-liter V8 (410 hp, 429 lb-ft of torque) paired  to a six-speed automatic transmission and a turbocharged 6.7-liter diesel  six-cylinder. The latter makes 350 hp and 660 lb-ft when matched to a six-speed  manual transmission. When paired with a reinforced six-speed automatic, those  numbers are 370 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque. </p>, <p>The  Tradesman and SLT trims are available with all three cabs, while the Big  Horn/Lone Star, Laramie, Laramie Longhorn and Limited versions can only be  ordered with a crew cab or a Mega Cab. The off-road Power Wagon variant (crew  cab, short bed only) can be ordered in Tradesman and standard forms.</p>, <p>The  2500 is available with either rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive,  except the Power Wagon, which is available in 4WD form only. </p>, <p>The <strong>Tradesman</strong> is the most basic trim.  Standard feature highlights include 17-inch steel wheels, a locking tailgate,  air conditioning, a 40/20/40-split front bench, a tilt-only steering wheel, a  driver information display, vinyl upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror  with an incorporated rearview camera display, and a six-speaker stereo with a  USB port. </p>, <p>Power  windows and locks, including the locking tailgate, are standard on crew-cab  models, as are power-adjustable and heated mirrors. Regular-cab models have  manual controls and non-heated mirrors by default. </p>, <p>The <strong>SLT</strong> adds chrome exterior trim,  18-inch steel wheels, an integrated trailer brake controller, power heated  mirrors, a power-sliding rear window (manual on regular cabs), remote locking  and unlocking, an overhead console, cloth upholstery, carpeted floors, full  power accessories for all body styles, Bluetooth, satellite radio, and a 5-inch  touchscreen interface that displays the rearview camera image.</p>, <p>The <strong>Big Horn</strong> (<strong>Lone Star</strong> for shoppers in Texas) adds 18-inch alloy wheels, a  limited-slip rear differential, chrome grille slats, foglights, remote ignition,  a 115-volt power outlet, a power-adjustable driver's seat, premium cloth  upholstery and an extra charge-only USB port<em>.</em></p>, <p>The <strong>Laramie</strong> builds off the Big Horn  /Lone Star and adds a standard 6.4-liter V8, more chrome trim (including the  bumpers), projector headlights, LED taillights, power-folding and auto-dimming  mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control,  leather upholstery, driver-seat memory settings, a power-adjustable front  passenger seat, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, an  upgraded driver information display, a 10-speaker surround-sound audio system,  HD radio, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and an 8.4-inch touchscreen with Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto. The limited-slip differential is dropped as standard  equipment but is available as an option. </p>, <p>The <strong>Laramie Longhorn</strong> adds to the  Laramie's substantial features list by including a chrome mesh grille,  accent-colored bumpers, running boards, a spray-in bedliner, LED bed lights,  remote ignition, a full center console, upgraded floor mats, upgraded leather  upholstery, wood interior and steering wheel trim, power-adjustable pedals with  memory settings, front bucket seats, heated rear seats and a navigation system<em>.</em></p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> trim adds monotone paint,  color-keyed bumpers, 20-inch wheels, additional chrome exterior trim, automatic  high beams, automatic wipers, the RamBox cargo management system (includes  bedside storage compartments, an adjustable bed divider and tie-downs), keyless  entry and ignition, and special black leather upholstery. </p>, <p>Finally,  there's the off-road-themed <strong>Power Wagon</strong>,  which is available only in crew-cab 4WD with the short bed and the 6.4-liter  V8. It has some slightly different exterior and interior styling changes, but  it's the extensive mechanical upgrades that make a Power Wagon. They include  unique 17-inch wheels shod with aggressive all-terrain tires, Bilstein off-road  shock absorbers, tow hooks, skid plates, a manual transfer case, electronically  locking front and rear differentials with a 4.10 axle ratio, hill descent  control, an integrated front winch, and a front anti-roll bar than can be  disconnected electronically to improve wheel articulation off-road.</p>, <p>Interestingly,  the Power Wagon isn't just a trim level. It's also an option package you can  add to a crew-cab Tradesman 4x4 with a 6.4-liter Hemi engine. Here you'll get  all of the Power Wagon mechanical bits, including the fender flares, but  without any other bodywork styling cues or graphics. It's a stealthy working  man's Power Wagon at a lower price.</p>, <p>Those  who aren't looking for the extreme capability of the Power Wagon can select the  4x4 Off-Road package that is available on 2500 crew-cab and Mega Cab 4x4  models. This package is available with any engine and includes hill descent  control, tow hooks, a transfer case skid plate, upgraded shocks, a limited-slip  differential, and all-terrain tires.</p>, <p>Many  upper trim features are available on lower trim levels as part of packages or  as stand-alone options. Other option highlights include a load-leveling air  suspension, tow mirrors, a cargo-view camera, fifth-wheel trailer preparation,  off-road tires, a CD player and a sunroof. </p>]

[<p>If you're looking to step up to the big  leagues for towing and hauling, only a heavy-duty pickup truck will do. And as  these trucks go, the 2018 Ram 3500 is one of the most capable you'll find. Like  the Ram 2500, this heavy-duty powerhouse offers far greater capability than the  full-size, light-duty Ram 1500. With the 3500, you're looking at a maximum  towing capacity of more than 31,000 pounds and a max payload capacity of 7,390  pounds.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ram 3500 isn't the only  heavy-duty truck on the market, of course. Both Chevrolet and Ford offer  similarly stout rigs with more capability than you'll probably ever need. Among  this group, the Ram stands out for its high-quality cabin and comfortable ride.  The 3500's ride isn't quite as plush as that of its siblings — the  rear coil springs that make those pickups so easy-riding have been replaced by  typical leaf springs — but you can still equip it with an air  suspension to smooth out some ruts and keep the truck level while towing.</p>]

[<p>Like  many heavy-duty pickups, the 2018 Ram 3500 is available in multiple  configurations. There are three cab styles, two bed lengths, three engines, two  transmissions, and six trim levels: <strong>Tradesman</strong>, <strong>SLT</strong>, <strong>Big Horn/Lone Star</strong>, <strong>Laramie</strong>, <strong>Laramie Longhorn</strong>, and <strong>Limited</strong>. At one end of the spectrum is  the Tradesman, a minimal-frills workhorse; at the other is the Limited, which  widens the boundaries of big-truck luxury. </p>]

[<p>Cab  styles include a two-door regular cab, a four-door crew cab, and a four-door  jumbo crew cab called Mega Cab. The regular cab comes with an 8-foot bed only,  while the crew cab has either the long bed or a short bed (6 feet 4 inches).  The Mega Cab rides on the same wheelbase as the long-bed crew cab long but  combines an even bigger cabin with the short bed. </p>, <p>Most  3500s come with a 5.7-liter V8 gasoline engine (383 horsepower, 400 pound-feet  of torque) paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

There's even a heavy-duty six-speed auto that  churns out 385 hp and 930 lb-ft. </p>, <p>The  3500 is available with either rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive. <br>  Tradesman  and SLT trims are available with all three cabs, while the Big Horn/Lone Star,  Laramie, Laramie Longhorn and Limited versions can only be ordered with crew  and Mega cabs.</br></p>, <p>The <strong>Tradesman</strong> is the most basic trim and  comes with 18-inch steel wheels (17 inches on models with dual rear wheels),  automatic headlights, black grille and bumpers, tow hooks, a locking tailgate,  a limited-slip rear differential, air conditioning, a 40/20/40-split front  bench, a tilt-only steering wheel, vinyl upholstery, a driver information  display, an auto-dimming rearview mirror with an incorporated rearview camera  display, and a six-speaker stereo with a USB port. </p>, <p>Power  windows and locks, including the locking tailgate, are standard on crew-cab  models, as are power-adjustable and heated mirrors.

This trim also brings heated and ventilated front seats, a heated  steering wheel, an upgraded driver information display, a 10-speaker  surround-sound audio system, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, HD radio, and an 8.4-inch  touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The <strong>Laramie Longhorn</strong> adds to the  Laramie's substantial features list by including a chrome mesh grille,  color-keyed bumpers, running boards, a spray-in bedliner, LED bed lights,  remote ignition, a full center console, upgraded floor mats, upgraded leather  upholstery, wood interior and steering wheel trim, power-adjustable pedals with  memory settings, front bucket seats and a navigation system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> trim adds monotone paint,  20-inch wheels, additional chrome exterior trim, automatic high beams,  automatic wipers, keyless entry and special black leather upholstery. <br>  This  choice also brings the RamBox cargo management system, which includes bedside  storage compartments, an adjustable bed divider and tie-downs. </br></p>, <p>Many  upper-trim features are available on lower trim levels as options.

---http://edmunds.com/ram/promaster-cargo-van/2018/review
[<p>There have been dramatic shifts in the  full-size cargo van market over the last few years. The Chevrolet Express, GMC  Savana and Nissan NV all ride on body-on-frame truck chassis, while newer  models such as the Ford Transit utilize unibody construction for reduced weight  and improved ride comfort. The 2018 Ram ProMaster Cargo takes it a step further  and really throws convention out the window: Not only is it a unibody cargo  van, but it's also front-wheel-drive in a segment otherwise dominated by  rear-wheel-drive haulers.</p>, <p>Going front-wheel drive brings a few  benefits. The ProMaster's step-in and cargo-loading heights are the lowest in  the class, and the extra weight over the driven wheels should give the  ProMaster better traction when the road is slippery. A tight turning circle  also helps with low-speed maneuverability. It can't tow as much as rivals, but  its maximum payload capacity of 4,430 pounds is right up there with the rest of  the class.</p>, <p>We think the 2018 Ram ProMaster is a good  choice for commercial use as long as you're willing to overlook the van's  unconventional looks and mediocre tow rating in exchange for greater mobility  in the city and easy cargo loading and unloading.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ram ProMaster Cargo is a large  van with two seats and a large cargo area perfect for storing gear and  upfitting. There are no traditional trim levels; instead, its <strong>1500</strong>, <strong>2500 </strong>and <strong>3500 </strong>levels  indicate the size of the vehicle (higher numbers translate to longer available  wheelbases and taller roofs) as well as an increasing gross vehicle weight  rating for higher payloads. The engine is a 3.6-liter V6 gasoline engine (280  horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque) that drives the front wheels through a  six-speed automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>1500</strong> carries a GVWR of 8,550 pounds, with a payload rating of 3,770 to 3,990 pounds,  depending on how it's configured. A 118-inch wheelbase and low cargo roof are  standard, while a 136-inch wheelbase with a low or high cargo roof is optional.  The <strong>2500</strong>'s GVWR is listed at 8,900  pounds, with a payload rating of 3,700 to 4,130 pounds. It's available in a  136-inch or a 159-inch wheelbase with a high cargo roof. The GVWR for the <strong>3500 </strong>is listed at 9,350 pounds, with a  payload rating of 4,020 to 4,430 pounds. The 159-inch wheelbase is standard,  but you can order an extended version with an even longer cargo area. </p>, <p>The  standard features on the Ram ProMaster 1500 include 16-inch steel wheels,  split-opening rear doors, manually adjustable mirrors, remote locking and  unlocking, a rearview camera, air conditioning, cloth upholstery, a telescoping  steering wheel, cargo lights, tie-down rings in the cargo area, a 5-inch  touchscreen, and a four-speaker audio system with a USB port.</p>, <p>The  2500 and 3500 versions come with the same equipment as the 1500, but they  feature a heavy-duty suspension to deal with the higher payload capabilities. </p>, <p>Optional  features include alloy wheels, power-folding and heated mirrors, windows for  the sliding rear doors, rear windows, daytime running lights, rear parking  sensors, cruise control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, vinyl upholstery,  heated seats, lumbar adjustment for one or both seats, a double passenger seat,  swivel seats, a suspended driver's seat, cargo area climate control, satellite  radio, a navigation system and a tow hitch.</p>, <p>A  few options are also available through Mopar, including remote engine start,  electronic vehicle tracking, carpeted or rubberized floor mats, LED cargo  lighting, a spray-in bedliner and a Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>]

[<p>Ram  offers the 2018 ProMaster City as both a two-passenger cargo van and a  five-passenger variant. Although you can't stand upright inside this van as you  can in the full-size ProMaster van (reviewed separately), it's still plenty  useful. The interior is spacious, and it beats most competitors when it comes to maximum cargo volume. The ProMaster City's payload rating of 1,886 pounds (or 1,760  pounds for the passenger version) also surpasses most rivals.</p>, <p>All  ProMaster City versions come with a 178-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder  engine. Acceleration and fuel economy are both respectable for the class. On  the move, the ProMaster City rides well enough for a commercial van, but its  tall, narrow profile means turns should be navigated with some caution. This is  one reason we don't consider the ProMaster City Wagon a great alternative to a  five-passenger crossover SUV. A noisy cabin and limited safety features are  other reasons. </p>, <p>For  passenger van duty, the similarly priced Ford Transit Connect is a better  option. It has lower payload limits, but it comes in two different wheelbase  lengths. The passenger version also has additional amenities, including  seven-passenger seating and leather upholstery. You might want to check out the  Mercedes-Benz Metris, which we like because of its above-average interior  space. Overall, though, the ProMaster City is a solid option if you need an  affordable and capable cargo van for your business or organization. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 ProMaster City comes as a cargo  van, the Tradesman Cargo, and a five-passenger version known as the Wagon.  There are also base and SLT trim levels. The main differences between the base  and the SLT come in the form of standard equipment, better seats and a less  utilitarian appearance. Of course, the Tradesman Cargo Van version seats just  two passengers and the Wagon seats five. </p>]

[<p>Both the Tradesman Cargo and Wagon use a  2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (178 horsepower, 174 pound-feet). The engine is  mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission and is only available in  front-wheel drive. </p>, <p>Standard equipment  includes 16-inch steel wheels, keyless entry, power front windows, cloth  upholstery, air conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a front  overhead storage bin, a 60/40-split folding rear seat (Wagon only), Bluetooth,  a 5-inch touchscreen, and a four-speaker stereo with a USB port.</p>, <p>For the SLT trim  levels, all of the above equipment comes standard along with body-colored  mirrors and bumpers, power-adjustable heated mirrors, privacy glass, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver-seat lumbar adjustment, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, upgraded cloth upholstery and cruise control.</p>, <p>Available option  packages include the Popular Entertainment group (second-row power windows, a  six-speaker stereo, heated front seats), a Cargo Partition package, a Lights  and Wheels group (16-inch alloy wheels and foglights), and a tow package with a  Class III hitch.</p>, <p>Other ProMaster City  options include roof rails, a rear window defroster and wiper/washer, remote  start, rear parking sensors, a navigation system (in combination with the  5-inch touchscreen), window grates and satellite radio.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Ram ProMaster Window Van is the people-carrying version of the ProMaster  Cargo Van (reviewed separately). It's based on the Fiat Ducato from Europe,  which means it's front-wheel-drive. That's unusual since full-size vans are  traditionally rear-wheel-drive.</p>, <p>Because  of its front-drive layout, Ram can maximize the ProMaster's cargo and passenger  volume while keeping it lighter than the competition. The ProMaster also  benefits from a short hood, which lends itself to improved forward visibility, and the inherent traction advantage, especially when unladen with cargo.</p>, <p>The  downside to that front-wheel-drive architecture is the van's lower tow rating  than its rear-wheel-drive competition. But another and possibly more important  downside is the extra step buyers will need to take to outfit the ProMaster  with rear passenger seats. This Ram is sold with front seats only (or just a  driver's seat if you'd prefer) with no option of fitting rear seats from the  factory. That means the buyer will need to find a third party from which to buy  and install the seats.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ram ProMaster Window Van  comes in <strong>2500</strong> and <strong>3500 </strong>versions. Both have a high roof,  allowing adults to stand up inside the van, and a 159-inch wheelbase. The 3500  version, however, also has an extended-length body. (It's 250 inches long  versus 236 inches for the 2500 van.) Only front seats are provided since Ram  expects owners to outfit the van to their needs. Options and engine choices are  available equally on both the 2500 and the 3500.</p>]

[<p>Standard  on the Ram ProMaster Window Van is a 3.6-liter V6 engine that produces 280  horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels via  a six-speed automatic transmission. </p>, <p>Other  standard features include 16-inch steel wheels, a passenger-side sliding side  door, air conditioning, cloth bucket seats, power front windows, power locks,  keyless entry, a telescoping but oddly not tilt-adjustable steering wheel, a  rearview camera, a 5-inch touchscreen, and a four-speaker audio system with USB  and auxiliary audio inputs.</p>, <p>Available  options include alloy wheels, foglights, daytime running lights, a driver-side  sliding door, windows for the side and rear doors, power-folding and heated  sideview mirrors, rear parking sensors, cruise control, a cargo partition (with  or without a sliding window), heated seats, swivel seats, a suspension driver's  seat, adjustable lumbar support, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, interior  wall paneling, and various add-ons aimed at upfitters. You can also get  satellite radio and a navigation system. </p>, <p>Properly  equipped, the Ram can handle payloads of up to 3,930 pounds on the 2500 version  and 4,280 pounds on the 3500. Both vans can tow up to 5,100 pounds. The  ProMaster's payload capacity is competitive for the class, but its tow rating  is significantly lower than rear-wheel-drive competitors' ratings.</p>, <p>Standard  safety features for the 2018 Ram ProMaster Window Van include front, side and  side curtain airbags, antilock disc brakes, hill start assist, stability  control with trailer sway control and rollover mitigation, and traction  control. </p>]

[<p>With a tiny passenger compartment,  limited cargo room and underwhelming performance, the Smart Fortwo is never  going to be a mainstream vehicle. But considering it can fit into almost any  parking space and turn on a dime, it undoubtedly has niche appeal for consumers  living in dense urban areas. Well, now that niche is even smaller. Smart has  discontinued the gasoline-powered model from the current lineup, leaving only  the Fortwo Electric Drive version. </p>, <p>On the upside, we think the Electric  offers the better driving of the two. It doesn't have the gas model's  rough-shifting transmission, and it benefits from the electric motor's instant  torque and smooth acceleration. However, the Electric is more expensive than  the old gas model, and its maximum range of 58 miles is considerably less than  any other EV's. </p>, <p>All of this piles on to the Fortwo's  existing problems such as a punishing ride and a low-rent cabin. We strongly  recommend checking out other EVs in this price bracket for their better range,  greater utility and higher emphasis on passenger comfort.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Smart Fortwo Electric is a pint-size city car with seating for two (get  it?) and a surprising amount of passenger space inside. The Fortwo Coupe is  sold in three trims — <strong>Pure</strong>, <strong>Passion </strong>and <strong>Prime </strong>— while the Fortwo Cabrio (convertible) is  available in <strong>Passion </strong>and <strong>Prime </strong>levels. There isn't a huge price  differential between the trims, but the starting MSRP for this stylish two-door  EV is quite high. As with many cars produced by parent company Mercedes-Benz,  there are a number of available features packages and stand-alone options.</p>]

[<p>The  Fortwo Electric's 17.6-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and 60-kW motor (80  horsepower and 118 pound-feet of torque) drive the rear wheels directly. The  EPA estimates that the Smart Fortwo Electric can travel up to 58 miles before  it runs out of juice and takes three hours to charge an empty battery using a  240-volt power supply.</p>, <p>The  Fortwo Coupe's base <strong>Pure </strong>trim  includes 15-inch steel wheels with plastic covers, LED daytime running lights,  cruise control, power windows, a rearview camera, a driver information display,  cloth upholstery, automatic climate control, Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, and a two-speaker sound system with an auxiliary input and a USB  port.</p>, <p>Also  standard is the ability for iOS and select Android smartphone users to download  a free Cross Connect app that controls phone, audio, internet streaming radio,  vehicle information and a navigation system.</p>, <p>The <strong>Passion </strong>trim adds alloy wheels,  heated and power-adjustable mirrors, contrasting interior upholstery, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver seat, an additional  storage compartment in the center console, and a retractable cargo cover.</p>, <p>The <strong>Prime </strong>further dresses up the Smart with  foglights, cornering lights, a panoramic glass roof, automatic headlights and  wipers, leather upholstery, heated seats and interior ambient lighting. </p>, <p>Several  options packages are available for the Smart Fortwo Electric. The Cold Weather  package adds heated seats and additional cabin insulation, and the new Sport  package (Passion and Prime only) dresses up the Fortwo with 16-inch alloy  wheels and stainless steel pedals. The 10th Anniversary Edition pack is similar  to the Sport, but the wheels are of a different design and certain exterior  elements are painted blue. There's also the Smart Media System bundle, which  combines a 7-inch touchscreen, a navigation system and Android Auto  functionality. It can be ordered with or without a six-speaker JBL audio system.</p>, <p>Individual  options include rear parking sensors, a forward collision warning system,  imitation leather (premium vinyl) upholstery, a center armrest, and a phone  cradle that positions your smartphone in the middle of the dash so it can  function as a touchscreen controller.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our first drive of  the <strong>2017 Smart Fortwo Electric Prime</strong>,  as well as the full rating of the gasoline-powered<strong> 2016 Smart Fortwo Proxy </strong>(turbo 0.9L inline-3 | 6-speed automatic | FWD), which is no  longer available.</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Smart Fortwo lineup has received  some revisions, including the deletion of the gasoline-powered Fortwo model  starting this year. Our findings from the gas-powered version carry over to the  EV model, as well.</p>]

[<p>It doesn't seem that long ago that we  were cooing at the arrival of the Toyota-Subaru twins, a pair of almost  identical rear-wheel-drive sport coupes that were lightweight, beautifully  balanced, easy to drive, and quite simply a whole heap of fun. Well, it's been  five years, and we're still huge fans of the 2018 Subaru BRZ. And after two  consecutive years of upgrades, it's now easy to say that it's the more  appealing of the twins.</p>, <p>If you're only considering the cheapest  base versions of the twins, they're practically identical. But if you're  looking for extra equipment and extra performance, the Subaru is the way to go.  In terms of creature comforts, the BRZ Limited adds dual-zone climate control,  push-button start, heated seats and, for 2018, a new 7-inch touchscreen  complete with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. You also get access to the  Performance package, which adds upgraded Sachs dampers and Brembo  high-performance brakes for superior driving dynamics the 86 just can't match.</p>, <p>And then there's the new BRZ tS also  introduced for 2018. Limited to 500 units, it adds a variety of  chassis-stiffening components, a further-tuned suspension, and special exterior  and interior design elements. Plus, since it was tuned by Subaru's STI group, a  carbon-fiber pedestal wing is thrown in for good measure. </p>, <p>So, even if the BRZ is the better choice  between the Toyota-Subaru twins, there are still flaws and competitors to  consider. The engine is the main point of contention. Acceleration is fine on  paper, but there's little midrange punch and you have to keep the rpm high to  get the most out of it. That means listening to a lot of unrefined racket from  the four-cylinder boxer. Competitors are better in terms of power, refinement,  noise and even fuel economy. There's also something to be said for interior  space and quality, plus some missing safety features. Be sure to look around a  bit.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Subaru BRZ is a two-door sport  coupe available in three trim levels: Premium, Limited and low-production tS.  All of them come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and rear-wheel drive.  With the standard six-speed manual, the engine produces 205 horsepower and 156  pound-feet of torque. Those figures dip to 200 hp and 151 lb-ft with the  optional six-speed automatic transmission. </p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the <strong>BRZ Premium</strong> includes 17-inch wheels,  summer performance tires, LED headlights, a trunk spoiler, heated mirrors, a  height-adjustable driver seat, cloth upholstery, a leather-wrapped  multifunction steering wheel, a folding rear seatback, a 6.2-inch touchscreen,  Bluetooth, a variety of smartphone-streaming audio apps, a USB port, and an  eight-speaker sound system with a media player interface, an auxiliary audio  jack, a CD player and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>BRZ Limited</strong> nets you LED foglights, keyless ignition and entry,  dual-zone automatic climate control, simulated-suede upholstery with outer seat  portions in black leather, heated front seats, an enhanced trip computer  display, a second USB port, and a 7-inch touchscreen that brings with it  integrated TomTom navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. </p>, <p>Only the Limited can be fitted with the  optional automatic transmission. Its optional Performance package adds Sachs  performance dampers, Brembo high-performance brakes and gray-painted alloy  wheels.</p>, <p>The limited-edition <strong>BRZ tS </strong>adds various body-stiffening elements, different STI-tuned  Sachs dampers, black 18-inch STI wheels, the Brembo high-performance brakes,  Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, a pedestal-style carbon-fiber trunk spoiler,  underbody spoilers, special black finishings on various exterior components,  special Cherry Blossom Red accents exterior accents, and matching red leather  on those seat portions that are black in the Limited. It does not have the  Limited's LED foglights.</p>]

[<p>The Subaru Crosstrek was a surprise hit thanks to its rugged styling,  versatile size and affordable price. Nothing changes with the second-generation  2018 model: It continues to offer great value, nimble handling and a handsome  design. A much-improved interior gives the Crosstrek a higher-quality feel  inside while the revised suspension and stiffer chassis give a smooth ride in  all but the most extreme circumstances. </p>, <p>Unlike some other subcompact vehicles in  this class, the Crosstrek offers high-end options including a premium audio  system and a full suite of advanced safety features that Subaru calls EyeSight.  It includes automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and adaptive  cruise control. Higher-end trim levels also offer automatic high beams and  reverse automatic braking to avoid backing up into an unseen obstacle. No  matter how you spec it, the Crosstrek delivers strong value and plenty of  all-weather capability. </p>]

[<p>The Crosstrek is offered in three  levels of trim: <strong>2.0i</strong>, <strong>2.0i Premium</strong> and <strong>2.0i Limited</strong>. A 2.0-liter four-cylinder (152 hp) engine powers all  trim levels, and all-wheel drive is standard. A six-speed manual transmission  comes on the 2.0i and 2.0i Premium trims, but a continuously variable automatic  transmission (CVT) is optional. The CVT is standard on the Limited. For 2018,  the CVT gets a special driving mode that improves control in off-road  situations.</p>]

[<p>The base <strong>2.0i</strong> model is well equipped  for its price range. It features 17-inch wheels, a 6.5-inch touchscreen  dashboard display that offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto phone integration,  a 60/40-split folding rear seat, carpeted floor mats, auto up/down windows for  the driver and front passenger, a rearview camera and a driver information  display. </p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>2.0 Premium</strong> model adds a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, automatic headlights, heated seats  and mirrors, and Subaru Starlink features such as collision notification and  remote services. The 2.0i Premium models also offer additional options  including a sunroof, contrasting interior stitching, and Subaru's EyeSight  suite of advanced safety features with blind-spot detection and rear  cross-traffic alert.  <br> <br>The top-of-the-line <strong>2.0i Limited</strong> builds on the features of the Premium with 18-inch wheels, LED adaptive  headlights, a larger 8-inch dashboard display, leather seating, automatic  climate control, keyless entry and ignition, and a six-way power-adjustable  driver seat. A Harman Kardon audio system and navigation are optional along  with the EyeSight system, which adds automatic high-beam headlights as well.</br></br></p>]

[<p>A roomy cabin and good fuel economy make  the 2018 Subaru Forester a solid choice for a compact SUV. But it's the  standard all-wheel drive, powerful optional turbocharged engine and high ground  clearance for off-road adventuring that set the Forester apart from the pack. </p>, <p>One year after receiving significant  upgrades in styling, cabin comfort and safety aids, the Forester carries over  into 2018 with only minor changes. Most notable is the new 2.5i Black Edition,  which adds a black-out finish on wheels, body trim and grille and extends into  the cabin with black cloth upholstery and black gloss dashboard trim. </p>, <p>Last year's update included features such  as blind-spot monitoring and reverse automatic braking, enhanced sound  deadening for a quieter cabin, and interior options such as Saddle Brown  leather that help make the Forester more competitive in its class. </p>, <p>What hasn't changed, however, are the  qualities that have made the Forester a top pick since its last major overhaul  in 2014, and indeed since its introduction 20 years ago: standard all-wheel  drive, extra ground clearance, a spacious cabin with excellent outward  visibility, a large and versatile cargo area, and an optional turbocharged  four-cylinder engine. Many Foresters come equipped with a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT), which improves fuel economy, but you can still  order a classic six-speed manual for controlling your own shifts. The Forester  returns between 24 and 28 mpg combined, depending on which engine and  transmission you choose. </p>, <p>Although the compact crossover segment is  rich with compelling choices, the Forester stakes a legitimate claim to  leadership. </p>]

[<p>The all-wheel-drive 2018 Subaru Forester is a  five-seat compact crossover that offers a bit more off-road prowess than others  in its class. Six trim levels are available: <strong>2.5i</strong>, <strong>2.5i Premium</strong>, <strong>2.5i Limited</strong>, <strong>2.5i Touring</strong>, <strong>2.0XT Premium </strong>and <strong>2.0XT Touring</strong>. The 2.5i models come  with a 2.5-liter engine, while the more expensive 2.0XT models use a smaller  but more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter engine. All-wheel drive is standard on  every Forester. Subaru also offers a few option packages that help bridge the  gaps between certain trim levels.</p>]

[<p>As its name implies, the base <strong>2.5i</strong> is  powered by a 2.5-liter engine (170 horsepower, 174 pound-feet) matched to a  six-speed manual or optional continuously variable automatic transmission  (CVT). Standard equipment includes 17-inch steel wheels, cloth upholstery, a  height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding rear seatback, Bluetooth  phone and audio streaming, a driver information display, a rearview camera, a  6.2-inch touchscreen with Subaru's Starlink technology interface, smartphone  app integration and a four-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Optional  for the base 2.5i (with the CVT) is an Alloy Wheel package that includes  17-inch alloy wheels, roof rails and automatic up-down front windows.</p>, <p>Those  items come standard on the <strong>2.5i Premium</strong>,  which further adds a panoramic sunroof, power driver seat, reclining rear  seats, automatic climate control, larger 7-inch touchscreen, voice commands,  Starlink Safety Plus telematics (emergency assistance, automatic collision  notification and various remote services), and an upgraded six-speaker sound  system with satellite radio. </p>, <p>An  All-Weather package with heated front seats and heated side mirrors comes  standard on Premium trims with a manual transmission, but it's an extra-cost  option on CVT models. The All-Weather package opens the door to the EyeSight  safety package, however, which adds adaptive cruise control, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and  intervention, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. A  version of this package is available with foglights and an adjustable-height  power liftgate. These options aren't available for manual transmission models. </p>, <p>The <strong>2.5i Premium Black Edition </strong>bridges the Premium and Limited trims with 18-inch black-finish wheels, a black grille and  exterior trim, and black cloth upholstery. The Black Edition also adds the CVT and All-Weather package as standard equipment, as well as X-Mode enhanced  off-road traction, hill descent control, automatic and adaptive headlights with  automatic high-beam control and foglights. </p>, <p>The <strong>2.5i Limited</strong> builds on the Black  Edition features with a power liftgate, leather upholstery, an upgraded driver  information display and a cargo area cover. Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert and 17-inch wheels are also standard. </p>, <p>Optional  for the Limited is a technology package that bundles navigation with an  eight-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. The Limited's EyeSight package  includes the upgraded sound system, navigation, all features from the Premium's  EyeSight package, adaptive LED headlights with automatic high-beam control and  reverse automatic braking (to prevent collisions while backing up).</p>, <p>At the top  of the 2.5i line is the <strong>2.5i Touring</strong> with 18-inch alloy wheels, adaptive LED headlights, upgraded side mirrors with  integrated turn signals, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a heated steering wheel, driver-seat memory settings, an  upgraded sound system, navigation and one-touch folding rear seatbacks. The  EyeSight package is also standard. Black or Saddle Brown perforated leather  upholstery is optional. </p>, <p>If you  want more power, there's the Forester <strong>2.0XT  Premium</strong>. It has all the equipment of the 2.5i Premium plus a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (250 hp, 258 lb-ft) paired with a CVT. Other  XT-specific features include 18-inch alloy wheels, larger brakes, a sport-tuned  suspension, additional selectable driving modes, shift paddles, the All-Weather  package and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Note that the EyeSight package is  not available on this model.</p>, <p>The <strong>2.0XT Touring</strong> offers the same upgrades  as the 2.5i Touring and adds a power liftgate with adjustable height settings. </p>, <p>Auto-dimming  mirrors are optional for all Foresters, and all CVT-equipped Foresters can be  ordered with a remote engine start feature.</p>]

[<p>First off, if you're in the market for a  traditional compact car with the stable traction provided by all-wheel drive,  you can end your search with the 2018 Subaru Impreza. It's the only car in its  class to offer it. But you don't need to live in a climate with a lot of rain  or snow to appreciate the Impreza. Redesigned just last year, the  current-generation model's build quality and technology interface are vastly  superior to its predecessor's. Compared to other models in this class, the  Impreza is a standout for its stellar handling, roomy cabin, available  hatchback body style, and a number of widely available advanced driver aids. </p>, <p>Still, shortcomings in a few key areas  might give shoppers pause. The Impreza's most significant drawback is its  lackluster powertrain. Though 152 horsepower and 145 pound-feet of torque look  healthy on the spec sheet, we've found the Impreza is one of the slowest cars  in its class. Matters aren't helped by the car's continuously variable  automatic transmission. It isn't quick to react to driver inputs, and when it  does finally rev the engine high enough for a speed burst, there's not enough  power on tap to muster any meaningful acceleration. Constantly shoving the gas  pedal just to keep up with traffic means the Impreza also has a hard time meeting  its fuel economy estimates in the real world.</p>, <p>If you can overlook the Impreza's engine  and transmission deficiencies, though, you'll find a capable small car with  plenty of room, a comfortable ride and that enviable all-wheel-drive system. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Subaru Impreza as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best AWD Sedans">Best AWD Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>Like  many compacts, the 2018 Subaru Impreza is available as a sedan or a four-door  hatchback. Features on the four available trims are identical between the two  body styles. The <strong>base 2.0i</strong> is  sparsely equipped, but it does have power windows and a touchscreen with  Android Auto/Apple CarPlay capability. The <strong>Premium </strong>counts alloy wheels and heated seats among its additions. Upgrade to the <strong>Sport </strong>and you get larger wheels, sporty  suspension tuning, keyless entry and ignition, and a larger touchscreen. The <strong>Limited </strong>keeps some of the Sport's  luxury features and adds leather and automatic climate control.</p>]

[<p>Every  Impreza is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 152  horsepower and 145 pound-feet of torque. (The related, high-performance WRX and  WRX STI are <a href="//www.edmunds.com/subaru/wrx/2018/sedan/review/">reviewed separately</a>.) A five-speed manual transmission  is standard on the 2.0i and Sport models, and a continuously variable automatic  with wheel-mounted paddle shifters is optional on those and standard on Premium  and Limited trims.</p>, <p>The <strong>base 2.0i</strong> comes standard with  16-inch steel wheels, remote locking and unlocking, cloth upholstery, a  rearview camera, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a driver information  display, a height-adjustable driver seat, cruise control, a 60/40-split folding  rear seat, Bluetooth, a 6.5-inch touchscreen, and a four-speaker audio system  with a USB port and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility.</p>, <p>The <strong>Premium</strong> trim is better equipped,  with alloy wheels, automatic headlights and wipers, heated mirrors, a  windshield wiper de-icer, a sound-reducing windshield, heated front seats, <a href="http://www.subaru.com/engineering/starlink.html">Subaru Starlink</a> services and a six-speaker audio  system. The hatchback also adds roof rails and a cargo cover.</p>, <p>An  available package combines blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert,  cornering lights and Subaru's <strong>EyeSight </strong>suite  of driver aids (adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with  automatic braking, automatic reverse braking, and lane departure warning and  mitigation). A power sunroof is available as a stand-alone option or bundled  with the above package.</p>, <p>For  drivers who want a more exciting version of the Impreza, there's the <strong>Sport</strong>. It comes with 18-inch alloy  wheels, daytime running lights, a rear spoiler, unique suspension tuning,  keyless entry and ignition, an 8-inch touchscreen, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, unique interior and exterior trim, active torque vectoring for improved  traction, a CD player, satellite radio and two USB ports.</p>, <p>A  package with the blind-spot monitor and sunroof is also available; on the  Sport, it further adds an eight-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system.  This package can be ordered with or without EyeSight.</p>, <p>At  the top of the Impreza range, there's the <strong>Limited</strong> model. It combines the Premium's features with the Sport tech equipment,  further adding 17-inch alloy wheels, adaptive LED headlights, leather  upholstery, a six-way power driver seat and automatic climate control system.</p>, <p>EyeSight,  blind-spot monitoring and the sunroof are bundled into a package; it can be  ordered with or without the Harman Kardon system and navigation.</p>]

[<p>Thanks to the Legacy's all-wheel-drive  system, Subaru's midsize sedan makes a lot of sense for those living in areas  where the weather frequently makes the road slippery. But its available tech  and safety features will appeal to anyone.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is standard on every  Legacy. This is the car's biggest differentiator among its competitors; only  a few other cars in this class offer it. Otherwise, the Legacy features roomy  seating, a comfortable road-going demeanor and the latest in-car technology.  Every 2018 Legacy has a 6.5-inch display with standard Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration. A larger 8-inch system that supports  multitouch and navigation is optional. </p>, <p>The main drawback to the Legacy is engine  choice. The Legacy's 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is economical but not very  powerful. You get more power from the 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine, but it's  still not as quick as other sedans with upgraded engines, and it's thirsty.  Overall, though, we like the Legacy. Even if you live in a place where it's  sunny 365 days a year, the car's mix of features, interior room and safety  features makes it a worthwhile choice.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Subaru Legacy is a five-passenger midsize sedan available with two engines  and five trim levels: the base <strong>2.5i</strong>, <strong>2.5i Premium</strong>, <strong>2.5i Sport</strong>, <strong>2.5i Limited</strong> and <strong>3.6R Limited</strong>. Legacy 2.5i models  have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (175 hp and 174 lb-ft) while the 3.6R has  a 3.6-liter six-cylinder (256 hp and 246 lb-ft). All Legacys come with a  continuously variable automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>   The <strong>2.5i </strong>feature set includes  17-inch steel wheels, air-conditioning, a rearview camera, a 60/40-split  folding rear seat, Bluetooth, a 6.5-inch touchscreen interface, Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a four-speaker sound system with a  USB port, an auxiliary audio jack, a CD player, HD and satellite radio and an  iPod interface.</p>, <p>   The 2.5i <strong>Premium </strong>adds 17-inch alloy  wheels, an All-Weather package (heated front seats, heated mirrors and a  windshield wiper de-icer), dual-zone automatic climate control, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, an 8-inch touchscreen interface, an additional  USB port and six speakers for the sound system. </p>, <p>   The 2.5i <strong>Sport </strong>is pretty similar to  the Premium but has 18-inch wheels, LED foglights, a sunroof, keyless ignition  and entry, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a variety of exterior and  interior trim flourishes.</p>, <p>The <strong>2.5i</strong> <strong>Limited </strong>reverts to the Premium's styling but makes certain safety  tech standard, such as a blind-spot monitoring system and rear cross-traffic  alert. Also standard are an upgraded suspension, power-adjustable front seats,  driver-seat memory settings, heated rear seats, leather upholstery and a  12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. With the <strong>3.6R Limited, </strong>you also get the six-cylinder engine and  turn-adapting LED headlights.</p>, <p>   Optional  for the Legacy Premium and above is Subaru's <strong>EyeSight</strong> safety package. Depending on the trim, it can bundle  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high-beam  headlights, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and intervention,  and front and rear collision warning with emergency automatic braking. A  navigation system is also optional.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our First Drive of  the <strong>2015 Subaru Legacy Premium </strong>(2.5L  flat-4 | CVT automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Subaru Legacy has received some  revisions, including suspension and steering changes, larger and more capable  infotainment screens, and more extensive noise reduction measures.

[<p>There are a lot of choices in the SUV  segment. Read some of our reviews and you'll quickly learn they all have their  respective strengths and weaknesses. The 2018 Subaru Outback, though, is strong  in just about all areas you'll really care about, including fuel economy,  interior volume, off-road capability and standard in-car technology. </p>, <p>The Outback's standard 2.5-liter  flat-four engine gets an EPA-rated 28 mpg combined, which is pretty respectable  for a vehicle of this size. It also features a sophisticated all-wheel-drive  system, plus hill hold and hill descent control, to help get off the beaten  path with ease. And with 73.3 cubic feet of interior cargo volume, 60/40-split  fold-down rear seats, and standard roof rails, you'll be able to bring all your  toys and supplies while you're roaming the countryside. This year's Outback is  packed with the latest technology, too. Every 2018 Outback now comes with  Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as part of its updated touchscreen display.</p>, <p>But the Outback does have one weakness:  performance. While its four-cylinder engine may get good mileage, its  175-horsepower output is down on power compared to its class. (There is a six-cylinder  engine available, though.) The Outback is also not particularly crisp or  willing to drive with enthusiasm around turns. It's a compromise we  wholeheartedly accept, however. If you're looking for a capable crossover SUV  that's useful for just about any situation, give the Outback a look. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Subaru Outback as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Subaru Outback is a five-passenger wagon that comes in six trim levels: <strong>2.5i</strong>, <strong>2.5i Premium</strong>, <strong>2.5i Limited</strong>, <strong>2.5i Touring</strong>, <strong>3.6R Limited </strong>and <strong>3.6R  Touring</strong>. The base model covers the essentials (roof rails, Bluetooth),  while Premium and Limited trims include conveniences such as heated seats,  leather and satellite radio. Touring trims are fully loaded, and 3.6R models have  similar equipment but include a more powerful six-cylinder engine. <br> <br>  The base <strong>2.5i </strong>starts with a  2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (175 hp, 174 lb-ft) and a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT) that feeds power to all four wheels.

[<p>The <strong>2.5i Premium</strong> adds rear privacy  glass, heated exterior mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, foglights,  dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an  eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with two-way lumbar adjustment), heated  front seats, a cargo cover, a bigger 8-inch touchscreen, satellite radio, three  additional USB ports (one front and two rear) and six speakers for the sound  system. The Power Moonroof package adds the obvious plus an auto-dimming  rearview mirror. A power liftgate with memory height is also optional. </p>, <p>The <strong>2.5i Limited</strong> bundles the Premium  options plus 18-inch wheels, a blind-spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic  alert, a front bumper underguard, keyless ignition and entry, leather  upholstery, driver-seat memory functions, a four-way power passenger seat, rear  air vents, heated rear seats and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. Xenon  headlights are optional on the 2.5i Limited. </p>, <p>The <strong>3.6R Limited </strong>gets the xenon  headlights as standard equipment and a more powerful engine, but it is  otherwise the same as the 2.5i Limited. </p>, <p>The  Premium and Limited trims can be upgraded with Subaru's EyeSight system  (adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency  braking, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights and upgraded  gauges). Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are included in the  Premium version of EyeSight, and navigation can be bundled with this package.  The Outback Limited's version includes navigation, automatic braking for rear  collisions and steering-responsive LED headlights. Note that Subaru bundles  these items into one big package, so you can't order them individually.</p>, <p>The <strong>2.5i Touring </strong>and <strong>3.6R Touring</strong> trims include the standard  features and options from the Premium and Limited trims, as well as the Driver  Assist Technology package. Touring models also have different 18-inch wheels,  dark exterior trim, fixed low-profile roof rails without crossbars, premium  leather upholstery, wood grain interior trim, and a heated steering wheel. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Subaru WRX is among the swiftest and  best-handling compact cars around. It's not especially quiet or comfortable,  but it's a reasonably priced performance car you can drive daily. </p>, <p>You might  reasonably expect some rough edges in a car born of Subaru's decades-long  participation in rally racing, a form of motorsport largely run in dirt, mud  and gravel. But the real surprise is just how domesticated these cars really  are. The WRX and even-faster WRX STI are powered by turbocharged four-cylinder  engines optimized for performance but capable of decent fuel economy. The WRX  delivers 268 horsepower and an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined with the manual  transmission, while the STI wrings out 305 hp and 19 mpg combined. </p>, <p>The WRX  also offers a good serving of modern tech and convenience, either as standard  equipment or options, including a choice of two multimedia systems, two audio  systems, smartphone app integration, navigation, and driver aids such as blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency  braking. These attributes, plus comfortable seating, a roomy cabin and  excellent visibility, make the WRX a legitimately practical daily driver and  family car. </p>, <p>But  there's no denying that the WRX can be a loud and raucous car. You'll hear  plenty of road noise and feel plenty of road surface inside the cabin,  especially in the STI, which can drive from dealer lot to weekend rally race  and be instantly competitive. Key rivals such as the Volkswagen GTI and Ford  Focus ST far surpass the Subaru for daily civility. To be fair, Subaru says it  has made efforts to quiet the 2018 model with thicker glass, seals and  insulation. We haven't yet driven the most recent model to hear the difference.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Subaru WRX as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-awd-sedans/" title="Best All-Wheel-Drive Sedans">Best All-Wheel-Drive Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018  Subaru WRX is a five-passenger sedan offered in five trim levels: <strong>base</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong>, <strong>STI</strong> and <strong>STI Limited</strong>. The base model comes ready for action with 268  horsepower and performance tires, while the Premium adds larger wheels and  heated front seats. The Limited adds luxuries such as leather upholstery and  has more available options. STI models start with Limited equipment but add a  305-hp engine and performance brakes and suspension. The STI Limited goes all  in with sunroof, navigation, driver aids and more. </p>]

[<p><strong>Base </strong>WRX models start with a 2.0-liter  turbocharged four-cylinder engine (268 hp, 258 pound-feet of torque), a  six-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive. The standard equipment list  also includes 17-inch wheels, performance tires, heated side mirrors, cloth  upholstery, a rearview camera, 60/40-split folding rear seats, Bluetooth phone  and audio connection, and a six-speaker media system with a 6.2-inch touchscreen,  satellite and HD radio, CD player, USB and auxiliary inputs, and smartphone app  integration. </p>, <p>The WRX <strong>Premium </strong>adds 18-inch wheels, foglights,  a sunroof, heated front seats, windshield wiper de-icers, and a 7-inch  touchscreen. </p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> builds on that with LED  headlights and foglights, automatic high beams, a 10-way power-adjustable  driver seat, leather-trimmed upholstery, keyless ignition and entry, and an  optional continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) with paddle  shifters. </p>, <p>Options  for WRX Premium models with manual transmission include the 7-inch touchscreen,  an upgraded Harman Kardon audio system, and a new Performance package that  bundles Recaro front seats (including an eight-way power-adjustable driver  seat), upgraded brake pads, and red-painted brake calipers. This package  deletes the sunroof, however, in the interests of weight savings. </p>, <p>A  manual-equipped WRX Limited is eligible for options including navigation,  upgraded audio, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems,  while Limited models equipped with the CVT can add Subaru's EyeSight system,  which bundles features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency  braking, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, and adaptive  ("bending") foglights that help illuminate corners and curves. The  EyeSight system is not available with the stick shift, though. </p>, <p><strong>STI</strong> models come equipped like the WRX  Premium but with a bigger engine, 19-inch wheels, and no sunroof. The base STI  adds a more powerful 2.5-liter engine engine (305 hp, 290 lb-ft), Brembo  brakes, front and rear limited-slip differentials, and more aggressive  suspension tuning.

[<p>2018 is the first full year of production  for Tesla's Model 3. While at the time of this review the Model 3 comes in  basically one configuration — the single motor drive with a long-range  battery and a dark interior — we anticipate a dual-motor version, a  smaller capacity battery and a light-color interior to become available later  this year.</p>, <p>But  if you just can't wait, or you have an order already filed, you won't be  disappointed with the Model 3 that's on the road now. In many ways, it sets new  standards for a relatively affordable electric vehicle. It has a rated range of 310 miles, can cover 0-60  mph in 5.1 seconds, and will top out at 140 mph. All are best in class.</p>, <p>On  the inside, you'll likely appreciate its minimalist interior design highlighted  by a gigantic central touchscreen display. The touchscreen has some drawbacks,  though. Because Tesla routes almost all of the car's controls through it,  you'll often end up having to take your eyes off the road to use them.</p>, <p>Of  course, the Model 3 is compatible with Tesla's Supercharger network. Model 3  owners will have to pay for access, unlike owners of the larger Model S and  Model X. Still, once you're hooked up, you can get about 137 miles of range in  just 30 minutes. This greatly enhances the Model 3's long-distance driving  ability and is a distinct advantage compared to other similarly priced EVs.</p>, <p>We  will note that we've had some trouble with a 2017 Tesla Model 3 that we've bought  and are testing for a year. You can read about the maintenance issues we've  encountered in our <a href="/tesla/model-3/2017/long-term-road-test/">Tesla 3 Long-Term Road  Test</a>.  It's just a sample size of one, but we also encountered reliability problems  with our Tesla Model S and X test cars.</p>, <p>Then  again, Tesla has typically improved its cars' reliability over time. With a  more affordable standard-range model or a high-performance dual-motor model,  available later in 2018, it may not make sense to get the Model 3 right away.  Overall, though, we like the Model 3 and think it's a great choice for an EV.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Tesla Model 3 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/" title="Best Electric Cars">Best Electric Cars</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Tesla Model 3 is a five-passenger sedan powered by a single electric motor that is fed by a long-range lithium-ion battery pack. Total system output is 258 horsepower. A single-speed transmission drives the rear wheels, and its range is estimated at 310 miles. Tesla plans to introduce an all-wheel-drive (dual-motor) option, a higher-performance version (also with AWD and dual motors) and, finally, a more affordable Model 3 with reduced power and range, later this year.</p>]

[<p>The standard features for the rear-wheel-drive, 310-mile Model 3 include 18-inch wheels, automatic headlights and high beams, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, cloth upholstery, six-way manually adjustable front seats, and 60/40-split folding rear seats. </p>]

[<p>Until  Tesla came out with its Model S, electric vehicles were never thought of as  fully viable replacements for gasoline-powered vehicles, and they didn't have  much appeal beyond their potential eco-conscious benefits. Today, though, the  2018 Tesla Model S boasts tremendous acceleration, cutting-edge tech, and an  electric range that now resembles that of a gasoline car. It's well-suited for  just about any luxury vehicle buyer, not just EV converts.</p>, <p>Tesla  has made the 75D the base model, which means the Model S now has a minimum  EPA-rated range of 259 miles. That's significantly more than most other EVs.  And with the 100D model rated to cover 335 miles on a full charge —  combined with access to Tesla's Supercharger rapid charging stations  — the Model S is a legitimate long-haul road tripper. </p>, <p>Then  there's the range-topping P100D. When fully charged with electrons, this Model  S will rip from zero to 60 mph in just 2.5 seconds. That's quicker than many  exotic cars these days, and it's the kind of speed that can pin back your  eyelids and distort your sense of self-restraint. It'll also put a quick drain  on your battery and large loads on your drivetrain, so it's best to be  judicious. </p>, <p>Tesla  is a car company that operates like no other. It releases new firmware updates  — installing new features, optimizing software and fixing bugs  — that get beamed to your car over the air. Newer cars equipped with  the latest hardware will eventually have access to more functions over time. A  good example of this is the Full-Self Driving Capability option that's  available now, which should allow your Model S to drive itself someday when  technology and legislation allow. It changes the car-ordering experience a  little if you're paying for features that you can't use immediately, or may  never use. </p>, <p>Despite  its many upsides, the 2018 Tesla Model S may still feel a bit unpolished next  to some of its German contemporaries. The latest modern comforts such as cooled  and massaging seats, or even Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, don't appear  anywhere on the Tesla ordering sheet. Even so, this is a car that is a great  choice for an EV, a luxury sedan or both. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Tesla Model S as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/">Best Electric Cars</a> and the Model S P100D as one of the <a href="/sedan/articles/best-sport-sedans/">Best Sport Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Tesla Model S is a five- to seven-passenger luxury sedan available in  three variants: <strong>75D</strong>, <strong>100D</strong> and <strong>P100D</strong>. The digits refer to the kilowatt-hour capacity of its  battery, which directly impacts range. The D denotes the dual-motor,  all-wheel-drive models, which is standard for 2018. Effectively, there's a  single, feature-loaded Model S that buyers can then upgrade with several option  packages and increased battery performance. </p>]

[<p>Be  aware that Tesla updates the Model S on an ongoing basis rather than by model  year, so what follows might not necessarily reflect the most current offering. </p>, <p>The <strong>Model S 75D</strong> is EPA-rated for 259  miles of range. It comes standard with 19-inch wheels, all-season tires, an  adaptive air suspension, LED headlights, access to Tesla's Supercharger  network, a power liftgate, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 17-inch  touchscreen, a navigation system, a rearview camera, keyless entry, parking  sensors, power-folding and heated side mirrors, automatic wipers, blind-spot  warning, automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning.</p>, <p>Inside,  you'll find cloth and premium vinyl upholstery, power-adjustable front seats with  heating, 60/40-split folding rear seats, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering  column, Bluetooth connectivity, and a seven-speaker sound system with dual USB  ports (media and charging) and HD radio. A cellular connection, internet radio  and Wi-Fi connectivity are also included, as are a universal mobile connector  for charging (with 110-volt, 240-volt and J1772 adapters). </p>, <p>The  Premium Upgrades package includes adaptive LED headlights, an enhanced cabin  air filtration system, leather interior surfaces (when leather seats are  selected), LED ambient interior lighting, lighted door handles and LED  cornering lights, a premium 12-speaker sound system with satellite radio (when  paired with the sunroof), a full row of heated rear seats, a heated steering  wheel, wiper blade defrosters and washer nozzle heaters. </p>, <p>Enhanced  Autopilot comes with three extra cameras and upgraded sensors, and it allows  for limited hands-free driving of the Model S. This includes automatically  changing lanes by selecting the turn signal indicator, semiautonomous steering,  a parking-spot detection system, and hands-free parallel parking and summoning  functions. You can also get a further upgrade to the Full Self-Driving  Capability package that Tesla says will eventually support full autonomous  driving.</p>, <p>The <strong>100D</strong> uses a larger 100-kWh battery  pack for the most available range at 335 miles, quicker acceleration, and a  higher top speed of 155 mph.</p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>P100D</strong> uses the same  battery pack and a second electric motor on the rear wheels, yielding an  EPA-estimated 315 miles of range and an astonishing 0-60 mph time of just 2.5  seconds. The P100D also comes with all the features in the Premium Upgrades  package and the option of a carbon-fiber spoiler.</p>, <p>All  variants can be outfitted with optional fold-flat, rear-facing jump seats,  suitable for small children, which increases total passenger capacity to seven.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Tesla Model S P85D </strong>(dual electric  motors | direct drive | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Model S has received some revisions,  notably the discontinuation of the P85D trim. It's similar to the current 100D  and P100D, however, and our findings remain applicable to this year's Model S.</p>]
---http://edmunds.com/tesla/model-x/2018/review
[<p>A mixed bag of innovation and gimmickry,  the 2018 Tesla Model X is an unusual all-electric SUV. In fact, it's the only  one currently on the market. Its range, punchy acceleration and quiet  disposition are highlights, but its fundamentally compromised nature detracts  from its overall appeal.</p>, <p>The upward-swinging rear doors are the  source of the Model X's identity. Novel as they appear, they're also its single  biggest drawback. They're slow to open, often don't open far enough, are  incompatible with lowish garage ceilings, and are needlessly complex and heavy. </p>, <p>Furthermore, imagine you want to put a  roof-mounted cargo box or roof rack on your Model X. Nope — the rear  doors are incompatible with such devices. If you can't or don't want to stash  the stuff inside the cabin, that leaves only the trailer hitch as a means to  haul your bulky cargo. </p>, <p>On the plus side, there's no question the  Model X in its upper trim levels is an exceedingly fast vehicle. Its gigantic touchscreen responds  quickly and has sharp graphics. And some of Tesla's technology features are  genuinely compelling. </p>, <p>Perhaps you seek an SUV for its enhanced  functionality over a sedan. But when it comes to Teslas, the Model S sedan is  in many ways the more practical, quicker and compelling choice.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Tesla Model X as one of Edmunds' <a href="/electric-car/articles/best-electric-cars/" title="Best Electric Cars">Best Electric Cars</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>75D </strong>is the base trim level,  providing 237 miles of range from a 75-kWh (kilowatt-hour) battery. Despite  being the base model, it's not slow, doing 0-60 mph in a claimed 4.9 seconds.  An air suspension is standard on every Model X, as are keyless entry and start,  heated front seats, a power liftgate, navigation, a towing package, and  advanced driver safety features such as forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the <strong>100D </strong>gains you a  100-kWh battery that increases range to 295 miles and is marginally quicker,  too (0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds). For the ultimate in Model X performance, head  right to the <strong>P100D</strong>. Though range  drops slightly to 289 miles, this variant sprints to 60 mph in just 2.9  seconds.</p>, <p>Many optional features are available for all trim levels, including six- and  seven-passenger configurations. Other high-dollar stuff include the Premium  Upgrades package, which brings upgraded audio and climate systems, auto-opening  front doors, heated features for cold-weather driving, and satellite radio.  Other pricey options are upgraded cabin materials, 22-inch wheels and assisted  driving, aka Autopilot. To the latter, you can add the Full Self-Driving  Capability option, which includes additional cameras, but to date it does not,  in fact, provide self-driving capability. Think of it as paying now for  something that you might get at an unknown later date.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our road test of  the <strong>2016 Tesla Model X P90D Signature</strong>.</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Model X has received minor ongoing  revisions, including the addition and deletion of various battery sizes and  trim levels and the addition of optional fold-flat second row seats. Our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Model X, however.</p>]

[<p>The  Toyota 4Runner is an SUV in the traditional sense, with a body-on-frame  construction and a solid rear axle like a pickup truck. It is one of the last  SUVs built this way, giving it the rugged capability that made this type of  vehicle attractive in the first place. </p>, <p>While  serviceable as a daily driver, the 4Runner is home on adverse terrain. Off-road  prowess comes from its high ground clearance and available hardware such as a  locking rear differential, low-range gearing and Toyota's trick Kinetic Dynamic  Suspension System (KDSS). The latter consists of special stabilizer bars that  automatically adjust to allow for greater wheel travel (and therefore traction)  in off-road driving situations. </p>, <p>An  available third-row expands seating capacity to seven at the expense of some  cargo space and versatility. But really, don't get a 4Runner if all you need is  a mall crawler or family taxi. In that case, there are better choices,  including Toyota's Highlander. But the 4Runner is one of the few vehicles left  from the traditional SUV mold, and that's something to appreciate if you need a  vehicle for frequent off-road weekend excursions. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota 4Runner as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota 4Runner is a midsize SUV available in six trim levels: <strong>SR5</strong>, <strong>SR5 Premium</strong>, <strong>TRD Off-Road</strong>, <strong>TRD Off-Road Premium</strong>,<strong> TRD Pro</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong>. All share the same 4.0-liter V6 (270 horsepower, 278  pound-feet of torque), five-speed automatic transmission and 5,000-pound tow  rating. SR5 and Limited models are available in rear-wheel-drive or  four-wheel-drive configurations and two- or three-row seating configurations.  The remaining trim levels are 4WD-only and seat five. A low-range transfer case  comes on 4WD versions of the SR5, TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro trim levels.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>SR5</strong> is the base model but it's not  bare-bones. Standard features includes skid plates, foglights, a rearview  camera, a power liftgate (includes a power rear window), 17-inch wheels,  keyless entry, power-adjustable front seats, 40/20/40-split reclining and  folding second-row seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a 120-volt power  outlet in the rear cargo area. The standard infotainment system boasts a  6.1-inch touchscreen, eight speakers, a USB port and satellite radio. </p>, <p>Stepping  up to <strong>TRD Off-Road</strong> adds a locking  rear differential, 17-inch wheels that are 0.5 inch wider than the SR5's, and a  crawl control function. The interior wears additional TRD badging, and the  overhead console gains switches for controlling off-road settings. The KDSS  feature is optional. </p>, <p><strong>Premium </strong>variants of the SR5 and TRD Off-Road  get power-adjustable and heated outside mirrors, simulated leather upholstery,  heated front seats, navigation, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. </p>, <p>Serious  off-roaders should consider the <strong>TRD Pro</strong>,  which starts with the TRD Off-Road Premium and adds revised front springs, Bilstein  dampers with rear remote reservoirs, special all-terrain tires and a front skid  plate. </p>, <p><strong>Limited </strong>models top the 4Runner range and are  more luxury oriented. These models get a Torsen locking center differential  (4x4 models only), a separate suspension system Toyota calls X-REAS that's  designed to reduce roll without adversely affecting ride quality, plus a host  of features to make it better suited to on-pavement use: 20-inch wheels, a  sunroof, dual-zone climate control, parking sensors, leather seat upholstery,  heated and ventilated front seats, and a 15-speaker JBL audio system.  Power-deploying running boards are optional.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2014 Toyota 4Runner Trail </strong>(4.0L V6 |  5-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 4Runner has received very few  changes beyond minor adjustments to feature content and trim levels. Our  findings remain broadly applicable to this year's 4Runner.</p>]

[<p>It's easy to count the 2018 Toyota 86's  downsides. It's small inside, with limited cargo and passenger space; it's not  particularly comfortable, especially for taller drivers; and the technology on  offer feels totally outdated. The 86 has also only received modest power bumps  over the years, so it's slower than a lot of competitors. Also, Toyota's never  fixed the car's lack of midrange punch. </p>, <p>But there's no denying that the 86 still  succeeds at being a ton of fun to drive. It provides a sporty experience even  when you're just tooling around town. It's always engaging, and it's the kind  of car that begs to be driven harder — it's just too bad it runs out  of steam before too long. </p>, <p>Still, the market has evolved, and there  are a lot of great performance coupes on the road right now at comparable  prices. Today's 86 isn't as easy to recommend over the competition as the FR-S  was back when it first launched.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota 86 comes in two trim levels: the <strong>base</strong> and the <strong>86 GT</strong>.  Power comes from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 205 horsepower and  156 pound-feet of torque when paired to a six-speed manual transmission. Power  dips slightly to 200 hp and 151 lb-ft when equipped with the automatic  transmission. The 86 is rear-wheel-drive only. </p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment on <strong>base</strong> models includes  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, air conditioning, keyless  entry, a height-adjustable driver's seat, a leather-wrapped  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cruise control and a rearview camera. Tech  features include Bluetooth connectivity, a 7-inch touchscreen, voice commands,  and an eight-speaker sound system with HD radio, an auxiliary audio jack and a  USB interface. </p>, <p>Toyota  offers more than a dozen optional dealer-installed accessories for the base 86,  including larger wheels, upgraded braking and suspension components, a  performance exhaust, and a navigation system.</p>, <p>The <strong>GT </strong>is distinguished by a rear  spoiler, LED foglights, an aerodynamic underbody panel, heated leather front  seats with contrast stitching, push-button ignition, dual-zone automatic  climate control, and a 4.2-inch display that monitors performance driving parameters  such as real-time engine power use and cornering force. There's also a Black  package for the GT, which adds black exterior accents but is otherwise  identically equipped.</p>]

[<p>Combining comfort, quality and  impressive fuel economy, the 2018 Toyota Avalon ranks among the best large  sedans on the market. A cushioned ride and hushed cabin make the Avalon  well-suited for commutes and road trips, and its roomy interior offers plenty  of room to spread out. It even offers a dash of speed and performance that  befits its mission as a deluxe daily shuttle. </p>, <p>Starting  with a well-equipped base model, the Avalon offers a long list of desirable  standard features, including a V6 engine, leather upholstery, heated seats and  several driver assistance features. From there you can opt into progressively  more full-featured models with navigation, enhanced audio and luxury creature  comforts such as heated rear seats, upgraded leather and rear-seat climate  controls. </p>, <p>For  such a large and roomy car, the Avalon returns surprisingly good fuel economy.  On our evaluation test loop, the Avalon returned 28.6 mpg, well above its EPA  rating. In the remaining miles of mixed driving, we observed 24 mpg - right on the money with its EPA combined mpg rating. More impressive is that  this comes from a car with a large V6 engine that generates 268 horsepower and  helps the car accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds. The Avalon is no  sport sedan, but an available Touring trim with larger wheels and tighter  suspension tuning delivers more enhanced performance. </p>, <p>Overall,  we recommend the 2018 Avalon. While there are some other solid choices  available for a big sedan, including the Chevrolet Impala, Kia Cadenza and  Nissan Maxima, the Toyota Avalon continues to be a standout. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Avalon is available in five trim levels: <strong>XLE</strong>, <strong>XLE Plus</strong>, <strong>XLE Premium</strong>, <strong>Touring</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong>. All come with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (268 horsepower, 248  pound-feet of torque) and a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>]

[<p>The <strong>XLE</strong> is  well-equipped for a base trim and feels expertly assembled. A 3.5-liter V6  engine (268 horsepower, 248 pound-feet of torque) and six-speed automatic transmission  come standard, as do 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control,  a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, leather upholstery, and  heated and power-adjustable front seats. Additional conveniences include  keyless ignition and entry, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen  with Toyota's Entune interface and voice controls, and an eight-speaker audio  system. Toyota's Safety Sense package also comes standard and includes  automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning (with  pedestrian detection), automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and  lane keeping assist.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLE Plus</strong> adds a sunroof and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLE Premium</strong> offers more significant  upgrades such as driver-seat memory settings, a wireless smartphone charging  pad, navigation, a nine-speaker audio system, smartphone app integration,  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The <strong>Touring </strong>trim  is best for those seeking a measure of sport since it comes with 18-inch  wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a sport-tuned suspension and<strong> </strong>unique interior trim.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> bundles the same features from the Touring trim (minus the interior accents)  along with xenon headlights, auto-dimming side mirrors, automatic wipers,  ambient cabin lighting, tri-zone automatic climate control, upgraded leather  upholstery, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a rear power sunshade, <a href="http://www.toyota.com/safety-connect/">Safety  Connect</a> emergency notification and roadside assistance services, and an 11-speaker JBL  premium sound system.</p>]

[<p>Most of today's big family sedans  offer roomy interiors, plenty of standard features and large trunks. But none  offer the fuel efficiency of the 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid. That's because the  Avalon Hybrid uses a four-cylinder engine and electric motor combination to achieve  40 mpg in combined driving, according to EPA estimates. That's not quite as  much compared to what you can get from Toyota's Prius or Honda Accord Hybrid,  but it's nonetheless impressive given the Avalon Hybrid's size and its  substantial offering of useful features. No other large sedan or hybrid  crossover today can match it. </p>, <p>But  beyond its fuel efficiency, the Avalon Hybrid is simply an excellent large  sedan. Its cushioned ride and hushed cabin make it equally suited to commutes  and road trips, and its roomy interior offers plenty of room for five  passengers to spread out. And with standard features that include a sunroof,  leather upholstery and heated seats, even the base trim level Avalon Hybrid  comes well stocked. Opting up to the Limited trim brings near Lexus-like  appointments and luxury. As a five-passenger, full-size sedan that achieves  exceptional fuel economy, the Avalon Hybrid stands alone. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is available in three trim  levels: <strong>XLE Plus</strong>, <strong>XLE Premium</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong>. All Avalons have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired  with an electric motor fed by a trunk-mounted battery pack. Combined, the  engine and electric motor generate 200 horsepower, sent to the front wheels  through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). </p>]

[<p>Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, heated side  mirrors, a sunroof, a power rear window sunshade, keyless ignition and entry,  dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, heated and power-adjustable  front seats, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, a 7-inch touchscreen with Toyota's  Entune interface, voice controls, and an eight-speaker sound system with CD  player, satellite radio and a USB input. </p>, <p>The base Avalon also comes with driver aids that include  automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning (with  pedestrian detection), automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and  lane departure warning and intervention.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLE Premium</strong> offers upgrades that include foglights, driver-seat memory settings, a wireless  smartphone charging tray, and the Entune Premium Audio system, which bundles  navigation, a nine-speaker audio system, smartphone app integration, blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> includes the features listed above along with xenon headlights, automatic  wipers, tri-zone automatic climate control, upgraded leather upholstery,  ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, <a href="http://www.toyota.com/safety-connect/">Safety Connect</a> emergency notification and roadside  assistance services, and an 11-speaker JBL premium sound system.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid </strong>(2.5L inline-4  hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD) as well as a <strong>2017  Toyota Avalon Limited </strong>(3.5-liter V6 | 6-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Avalon Hybrid has received some  revisions, including a redesigned front end, the latest generation of the  Entune infotainment system, and the inclusion of standard driver assistance  features. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Avalon Hybrid. </p>]

[<p>It's no secret that Americans don't buy  hatchbacks and station wagons en masse anymore. But the last two decades have  revealed that people really like them if they ride a bit higher, have optional  all-wheel drive and look more like an SUV — i.e., a crossover. The  outrageously successful Toyota RAV4 is a prime example, and now Toyota is  hoping you'll have a similar affinity toward the all-new 2018 Toyota C-HR. </p>, <p>The C-HR is smaller and more affordable  than the RAV4. In fact, it was originally developed  for Toyota's now-defunct Scion brand, which largely explains the C-HR's  flamboyant styling and sporty handling. These two key attributes, along with  the extensive list of standard safety features, are the main reasons to  consider the C-HR in our opinion. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota C-HR as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-small-suvs/" title="Best Small SUVs">Best Small SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota C-HR comes in just two trim levels,  though you do get a lot of standard features on both. The well-equipped base <strong>XLE </strong>comes loaded with just about everything  the C-HR has to offer. Stepping up to the <strong>XLE  Premium</strong> involves a relatively modest price bump and adds a few more luxury  and safety features. Though  there are no stand-alone factory options, a number of dealer-installed  accessories are available, including a roof rack and cargo storage solutions. </p>]

[<p>Every C-HR  is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (144 horsepower, 139 pound-feet  of torque) matched to the front wheels through a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT). Standard features on the <strong>XLE </strong>include 18-inch wheels, automatic headlights with automatic  high-beam control, LED daytime running lights, a rear spoiler, remote locking  and unlocking, a driver information display, adjustable driving modes, a  rearview camera, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, height-adjustable front seats, a  60/40-split rear seat, a cargo cover, a 7-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and a  six-speaker audio system with HD radio and a USB port. Several advanced safety  and convenience features are also standard, including traffic-adapting cruise  control, brake hold at stoplights, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, and lane departure warning and intervention. </p>, <p>Upgrading  to the <strong>XLE Premium</strong> trim gets you  foglights, keyless entry and ignition, power-folding mirrors, heated front  seats with two-way power lumbar for the driver, and  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert.</p>]

[<p>The Camry is the archetypal midsize family sedan. Though it has grown larger  over many generations, the latest, redesigned 2018 model checks in at roughly  the same exterior dimensions as its predecessor. That's fine — it's  plenty big enough already, thanks. The 2018 Camry's styling is a big departure  from the norm, however.</p>, <p>You  can sense the difference from 10 paces away. The uninspiring styling we've come  to expect on the Toyota Camry has been replaced with a lower and sleeker look.  But sleeker doesn't mean reduced headroom and reduced visibility because the  seats, hood and side glass have dropped a similar amount. In fact, we figure  that interior space has been enhanced.</p>, <p>Much  of the credit goes to the stiffer platform and its double-wishbone rear  suspension, the key element that makes this Camry different from any produced  in the last 30-plus years. Past Camrys relied on a rear strut suspension  because of its low cost. But rear struts are bulky and compete for space with  the back seat and trunk. The more sophisticated rear suspension was recently  used on the Toyota Prius, and the positive effects on that car's ride comfort,  road noise, handling and even steering feel were substantial.</p>, <p>As  before, there will be three powertrain choices, all of which are either new or  significantly revised. The all-new 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine makes  203 horsepower, while the optional 3.5-liter V6 now cranks out a stout 301 hp.  Both come paired with a new eight-speed automatic transmission that further  helps improve fuel economy. The fuel-sipping Camry Hybrid (reviewed separately)  is new as well. </p>, <p>On the safety front, you'll find a common  array of features including 10 standard airbags and a rearview camera. But the  most impressive safety feature on this new Camry has to be the standard  inclusion of the Toyota Safety Sense-P, which means that even the cheapest 2018  Camry will have traffic-adapting cruise control, automatic emergency braking in  case of an imminent forward collision, lane departure warning and mitigation,  and auto-dimming LED headlights. </p>, <p>While we appreciate the Camry's newfound  attention to style, safety and handling precision, Toyota's Entune infotainment  and smartphone integration won't please many people. It just isn't as easy to  use as rival systems. It's the most glaring shortcoming of this otherwise  well-rounded family sedan. If you're in the market, the Camry is going to be  one of your best choices for 2018.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Camry as one of Edmunds' <a href="/sedan/articles/best-midsize-sedans/" title="Best Midsize Sedans">Best Midsize Sedans</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Camry is available in five distinct trim levels: <strong>L</strong>, <strong>LE</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>XSE</strong> and <strong>XLE</strong>. The  differences among them chiefly boil down to features, with the exception of the SE and the XSE that also include a sportier suspension calibration. All trims are  available with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that generates 203 hp and 184  pound-feet of torque (add 3 hp and 2 lb-ft for XSE models), and a 3.5-liter V6  (301 hp, 267 lb-ft) is optional on XLE and XSE models. </p>]

[<p>All Camrys are equipped with Toyota  Safety Sense, which is a suite of driver assistance features including adaptive  cruise control, a frontal pre-collision system, lane departure alert with  steering assistance, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>The base <strong>L</strong> sets the floor for the base price but won't be commonplace due to  its relative paucity of equipment. This Camry comes with 16-inch steel wheels,  automatic LED headlights, cloth upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  rearview camera, keyless entry, a 7-inch touchscreen interface, one USB port,  Bluetooth and a six-speaker sound system.</p>, <p><strong>LE </strong>models add a few key items that most drivers will  want: an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with two-way power lumbar  adjustment), 17-inch alloy wheels, a 60/40-split folding back seat and a car  alarm.</p>, <p><strong>SE </strong>variants mark a personality shift toward keener  driving dynamics courtesy of a sport-tuned suspension and a revised steering  calibration. They also receive 18-inch wheels and simulated leather upholstery  (SofTex) seats and paddle shifters.</p>, <p>You can think of the <strong>XLE </strong>and <strong>XSE </strong>trim levels  as versions of the LE and SE, respectively, with a variety of additional  comfort and convenience items. Highlights include larger wheels, dual-zone  automatic climate control, leather upholstery, a head-up display, blind-spot  monitoring, keyless ignition, a power-adjustable front passenger seat, extra  USB ports, a bigger 8-inch touchscreen, a premium JBL sound system and Qi  wireless smartphone charging.</p>, <p>Many of the features found on the upper  trim levels can be added to the lower trim levels as options. Other notable  options include a sunroof and a top-down parking camera system.</p>]

[<p>Redesigned  for 2018, the Toyota Camry Hybrid has catapulted itself right up to the head of  its class with several significant upgrades. </p>, <p>High  fuel economy is the primary reason to buy a midsize hybrid, and this year's  Camry Hybrid is more efficient than ever. All Camry Hybrids use an updated  version of the same 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired to an electric motor.  But various tweaks provide a leap in fuel economy and a slight increase in  power. The base LE is now rated at 52 mpg combined (up 12 mpg from last year),  which is impressively the same mpg you get from Toyota's Prius. The slightly  less frugal SE and XLE post a 46 mpg combined rating.</p>, <p>There's  also a new stylish look on the outside and several technology improvements. The  touchscreen has been updated with a 7-inch version of Toyota's Entune  interface, and advanced driver safety aids, such as adaptive cruise control and  forward collision mitigation, are now standard equipment. Underneath, the 2018  Camry Hybrid gets new suspension, which means a smoother ride over broken city  streets, a big plus for such a city-friendly sedan. </p>, <p>The  2018 Camry Hybrid has a few drawbacks stemming from its Entune infotainment  interface and drivability, but this new model is certainly an improvement over  last year's model. We definitely recommend taking one out for a test drive to  see the difference for yourself. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Camry Hybrid is offered in three trim levels: base <strong>LE</strong>, sporty <strong>SE</strong> and luxurious <strong>XLE</strong>.  All Camry Hybrids are powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with  an electric motor to produce a total of 208 horsepower. A continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT) is standard. The base LE trim uses a lighter and  more energy-efficient lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery pack, and the SE and XLE  hybrids use a nickel-metal hydride (Ni-mh) battery. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>LE</strong> starts off with features such as  16-inch steel wheels, automatic LED headlights, keyless ignition and entry, a  rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver  seat (with power lumbar adjustment), heated front seats, adaptive cruise  control, forward collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, a rearview  camera, lane departure warning and mitigation, and Toyota's Entune Audio  interface. Entune Audio includes a 7-inch touchscreen display, voice controls,  a USB port, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary  audio jack. </p>, <p>Right  in the middle of the lineup is the <strong>SE</strong> that adds 18-inch alloy wheels, sport-themed styling details, a rear spoiler,  simulated leather upholstery (with fabric inserts), and a leather-wrapped  steering wheel with shift paddles.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLE </strong>Hybrid gets all of the base LE's  equipment plus unique 18-inch alloy wheels, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  leather upholstery, a power-adjustable passenger seat, wireless smartphone  charging, a head-up driver display, two extra USB ports, blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert, and heated exterior mirrors.</p>, <p>Entune  Audio Plus is optional on all three trim levels and it adds an 8-inch  touchscreen, a smartphone-based navigation app, wireless smartphone charging, a  4G LTE connection with a Wi-Fi hotspot, Toyota Safety Connect, and a  nine-speaker audio system with satellite radio and HD radio. The LE and SE can  be equipped with the blind-spot monitoring and rear-cross traffic alert as  extras, and the XLE is available with automatic high-beam headlights and a  top-down parking camera system. All three trim levels can be had with a  sunroof.</p>]

[<p>With a low price tag and history of solid  reliability, it's easy to see why the Toyota Corolla has become one of the  world's best-selling vehicles over the last 50-plus years. The 2018 Toyota  Corolla builds upon the success of its ancestors with expressive styling, a  surprisingly roomy cabin, plenty of advanced safety features and comfortable,  supportive seats. But while the Corolla covers the basics well enough, a few  deficiencies make its rivals better picks overall.</p>, <p>The Corolla's cabin is fairly plain and  does little to make you think you've bought anything more than a basic small  car. Its underpowered engine and so-so handling mean it isn't much fun to  drive, either. Factor in a small trunk and poor smartphone integration and you  have a car that is difficult to recommend in a class stacked with more  desirable choices. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Corolla sedan is sold in  six trim levels. <strong>L</strong>, <strong>LE</strong>, <strong>LE Eco</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>XSE</strong> and <strong>XLE</strong>. Every  Corolla is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. Most models produce 132  horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque, though the LE Eco is a bit more  powerful with 140 hp and 126 lb-ft. Power is routed to the front wheels through  a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) on all models, though the  SE can be optioned with a six-speed manual.</p>]

[<p>Standard  equipment on the base <strong>L</strong> model  includes 15-inch steel wheels, LED headlights, LED daytime running lights,  adaptive cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a driver  information display, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split folding  rear seat,<strong> </strong>Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch  touchscreen and a six-speaker audio system with a CD player, a USB port and,  for iPhone users, the Siri Eyes Free voice control system. Standard safety  systems include a rearview camera, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with  steering assist (to nudge you back into your lane) and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>The <strong>LE </strong>adds 16-inch steel wheels, heated  mirrors, variable intermittent wipers, remote locking and unlocking, metallic  cabin accents, upgraded upholstery, a rear armrest and automatic climate  control.</p>, <p>The <strong>LE Eco</strong> starts with the LE's features  and adds engine and suspension tuning designed for maximum fuel efficiency,  15-inch steel wheels, a rear spoiler and enhanced aerodynamics.</p>, <p>The <strong>XLE </strong>builds upon the LE's set of  features, adding 16-inch alloy wheels, upgraded headlights, LED taillights,  bumper-mounted LED daytime running lights, a sunroof, keyless entry and  ignition, simulated leather upholstery (Toyota's SofTex), a power-adjustable  driver seat (with two-way power lumbar), heated front seats, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, an upgraded driver information display, a 7-inch touchscreen  display, an app-based navigation system (Scout GPS Link), and satellite and HD  radio.</p>, <p>The <strong>SE </strong>is the sporty Corolla, although  we use that term loosely. It starts with the LE's features and adds 17-inch  alloy wheels, unique front-end styling with a black mesh grille, a rear  spoiler, steering wheel with paddle shifters (for CVT automatic models), sport  front seats, SofTex upholstery with cloth inserts, and a sport-style gauge  cluster. Also included are the XLE's upgraded headlights, bumper-mounted LED  daytime running lights and leather-wrapped steering wheel. Opt for the manual  transmission and you'll also get a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, and the  upgraded infotainment system. </p>, <p>The <strong>XSE </strong>has the SE manual transmission's  extra features and adds heated front seats, the eight-way power-adjustable  driver seat, the paddle shifters and full SofTex upholstery.</p>, <p>A  few options packages are also available. LE and LE Eco models can select the  Premium package, which adds 16-inch alloy wheels, bumper-integrated LED running  lights and the upgraded infotainment system. A sunroof can be added to this  package for the LE (it's included with the package for the LE Eco).</p>, <p>The  Premium package for SE CVT automatic models includes keyless entry and ignition,  a sunroof and the upgraded infotainment system, while XLE and XSE models can  opt for an integrated navigation system and smartphone integration via the  Entune App Suite.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Toyota Corolla SE </strong>(1.8-liter inline-4 | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Toyota Corolla has received some  revisions, including the deletion of the SE 50th Anniversary Special Edition  (which will not affect this rating, as the trim was little more than an  appearance package for the XSE). Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's Toyota Corolla.</p>]

[<p>A compact sedan is an excellent choice if  good fuel economy, a low price and everyday ease of use top your list of  vehicular requirements. But the small dimensions naturally necessitate a  similarly compact cargo area, which is not great if you want to take a  spur-of-the-moment road trip with your friends. Luckily, most are available in  a more practical hatchback body style. The 2018 Toyota Corolla iM is  essentially a hatchback variant of the ubiquitous Corolla, and its single  available trim takes a lot of guesswork out of the shopping experience.</p>, <p>The Corolla iM carries many of the  sedan's benefits and pitfalls. On one hand, the ride and seats are comfortable,  materials quality is good, and the user interface is intuitive. Plus, you get a  ton of standard features for the money. Unfortunately, the cargo area is  smaller than competitors' and the back seat is pretty cramped. It's also not  much fun to drive, with painfully slow acceleration from its underpowered  four-cylinder. Overall, the Corolla iM is a decent choice that looks good on  paper thanks to its robust features list. But we think shoppers would be  happier paying a little extra for a more well-rounded small hatchback.</p>]

[<p>Introduced to the Scion brand in 2016 and  brought under the Toyota umbrella last year, the Corolla iM is essentially a  hatchback version of the Corolla sedan. Unlike the Corolla, the 2018 iM is sold  in a single trim level, but it's actually a little less expensive than a  comparably equipped Corolla. It's not quite as customizable, though, since your  only real choices are color, transmission and selection of dealer-installed  accessories. </p>]

[<p>Under  the hood of the 2018 Toyota Corolla iM is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine (137  horsepower, 126 pound-feet) that drives the front wheels through a six-speed  manual transmission or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).  Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights with auto  high-beam control, LED daytime running lights and taillights, a rear spoiler,  heated and power-folding mirrors, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, a driver information  display, a height-adjustable driver seat and 60/40-split folding rear seats.</p>, <p>With  the iM, you also get a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, and a  six-speaker sound system with a USB port and HD radio. Standard advanced safety  systems include lane departure warning and forward collision warning with  automatic braking.</p>, <p>The  are no factory options available, but notable dealer accessories include  interior ambient lighting, a navigation system and various sport body  enhancements. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Highlander is one  of the best picks available for a versatile three-row crossover SUV. Thanks to  a comfortable and quiet ride, abundant standard features and a just-right size,  it should serve you well as a do-all family hauler. </p>, <p>While  the Highlander isn't as big as traditional truck-based SUVs such as Toyota's  Sequoia, it's easier to maneuver around town, yet it still has three relatively  usable rows of seating. It also delivers above-average fuel economy for a three-row  SUV. The third row is a bit tighter than we'd like, but kids will fit just fine  back there. We also like how Toyota outfits every Highlander with its Toyota  Safety Sense bundle, which include adaptive cruise control, lane departure  intervention, and forward collision mitigation with automatic emergency  braking. </p>, <p>If  you need a crossover with a roomier third row, you'll probably be happier with  a Honda Pilot or Volkswagen Atlas. Toyota's also a bit behind the times in  smartphone connectivity &amp;mdash; you can't get Android Auto or Apple CarPlay  on the Highlander. Overall, though, this popular and well-rounded crossover is  certainly worth a test drive. </p>, <p>Notably,  we picked the 2018 Highlander as one of Edmunds' <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Highlander is a large  three-row crossover SUV with seating for eight, but optional second-row  captain's chairs reduce capacity to seven. Toyota makes six Highlander models:  the <strong>LE</strong>, <strong>LE Plus</strong>, <strong>XLE,</strong> <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>Limited </strong>and <strong>Limited Platinum</strong>.  The LE isn't a stripped-down model, but its standard four-cylinder engine is a  bummer. The LE Plus has key upgrades such as the V6 engine (optional on the  LE), a power liftgate and tri-zone automatic climate control, while the XLE,  Limited and Limited Platinum essentially slather on luxury features. The SE  stands out with unique styling and sportier driving dynamics.</p>]

[<p>The  standard powertrain on the base <strong>LE</strong> is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (185 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of torque),  a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. The 3.5-liter V6 (295  hp, 263 lb-ft) that's standard on all other trims is optional on the LE and  comes paired with an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive can be added to the  V6 as an option.</p>, <p>Other  standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, heated mirrors, a windshield  wiper de-icer, rear privacy glass, the Toyota Safety Sense bundle (automatic  high beams, adaptive cruise control, lane departure intervention, and Toyota's  Pre-Collision System, which bundles forward collision detection with automatic  emergency braking, a rearview camera, rear air conditioning, a  height-adjustable driver's seat, a 60/40-split second-row seat (slides,  reclines, folds), a 60/40-split third-row seat (reclines, folds), five USB  ports, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a  CD player.</p>, <p>The <strong>LE Plus</strong> adds a height-adjustable  power liftgate, a flip-up rear window, foglights, tri-zone automatic climate  control, upgraded upholstery and trim, a power-adjustable driver seat, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a higher-resolution 8-inch touchscreen,  satellite and HD radio, and a variety of smartphone-connection apps.</p>, <p>On  top of the LE Plus' equipment, the Highlander <strong>XLE </strong>adds a sunroof, roof rails, keyless entry and ignition,  blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, an upgraded instrument  panel, leather upholstery (first and second rows), simulated leather third-row  upholstery, heated front seats, a power-adjustable passenger seat, an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, second-row window sunshades, a 110-volt power  outlet, Driver Easy Speak (carries the driver's voice through the rear speakers  to distant passengers) and a navigation system. </p>, <p>The <strong>SE</strong> is equipped similarly to the XLE  but has LED running lights, sport-themed styling elements and suspension  tuning, 19-inch wheels and sporty interior trim. </p>, <p>The <strong>Limited </strong>starts with the XLE's  content and adds LED running lights, different 19-inch wheels, rear parking  sensors, a rear cargo cover, heated and ventilated front seats, driver-seat  memory settings, heated second-row captain's chairs (optional on the XLE) and a  12-speaker JBL audio system. </p>, <p>The<strong> Limited Platinum</strong> gains a panoramic  sunroof, automatic wipers, a 360-degree parking camera, front parking sensors,  Safety Connect emergency communications, a heated steering wheel and heated  second-row seats.</p>, <p>The  Limited and Limited Platinum can be optionally equipped with the second-row  bench. A rear-seat entertainment system is optional on all but the LE and LE  Plus.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2014 Toyota Highlander XLE </strong>(3.5L V6 |  6-speed automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Highlander has received some  revisions, including a new V6 engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission  and additional feature content. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this  year's Highlander.</p>]

[<p>The  name pretty much says it all. The 2018 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is simply a  more fuel-efficient version of the standard, three-row Highlander. We like the  Highlander, so it's certainly a compliment. </p>, <p>Like  the standard Highlander, the Hybrid is a relatively spacious, quiet and  comfortable crossover. It also comes with a lot of standard equipment,  including the latest in advanced driver safety aids. The big difference is the  Hybrid's powertrain. It combines a gasoline V6 and electric motors for a total  of 306 horsepower and 29 mpg combined.</p>, <p>Toyota  continues to be the only non-luxury automaker to offer a three-row midsize  hybrid crossover. If high fuel economy and utility are priorities, the  Highlander Hybrid is the obvious pick. Just note that the Hybrid costs more. If  you're buying one new, it's going to take you a few years to recoup the cost  (compared to a regular Highlander) in fuel savings alone.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a three-row SUV that comes standard with  eight- or seven-passenger seating configurations, depending on trim level.  Those include <strong>LE</strong>, <strong>XLE</strong>, <strong>Limited</strong> and <strong>Limited Platinum</strong> trim levels. The LE isn't exactly a stripped-down model, but the XLE has enough  universally desired extras that you'll likely want to pay extra for them. The  Limited and Limited Platinum slather on luxury features but in the process  receive luxury brand-like price tags.</p>]

[<p>Every  Highlander Hybrid comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with three  electric motors. Total system output is 306 horsepower, and all-wheel drive is  standard.</p>, <p>Starting  things off is the <strong>LE</strong>, which has  18-inch wheels, a windshield wiper de-icer, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane departure intervention, adaptive cruise  control, keyless entry and ignition, a rearview camera, tri-zone automatic  climate control, a height-adjustable driver seat, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch  touchscreen and a six-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>Our  trim level choice for the Highlander Hybrid is the <strong>XLE</strong>. You get the LE's equipment plus<strong> </strong>a sunroof, a height-adjustable power liftgate, a flip-up rear  window, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, power front  seats with heating, leather upholstery, second-row sunshades, upgraded interior  materials, a second-row 120-volt power outlet, an 8.1-inch touchscreen,  satellite and HD radio, and a navigation system. </p>, <p>If  you want more, there's the <strong>Limited </strong>with  19-inch wheels, LED running lights, rear parking sensors, heated and ventilated  front seats with perforated leather, driver-seat memory functions, second-row  captain's chairs, a rear cargo cover and a 12-speaker JBL sound system. At the  top of the range is the <strong>Limited Platinum</strong>with a panoramic sunroof, automatic  wipers, front parking sensors, a 360-degree parking camera system, heated rear  outboard seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>The  XLE and Limited can be equipped with a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser is a vehicle  intended to go literally anywhere. Any terrain, any climate, any country  — it can handle it. Warning stickers inside are even printed in  English, Japanese, Russian and Arabic, driving the point across that it can be  used by any adventurous driver.</p>, <p>Its immense capabilities stem from a  stout body-on-frame chassis, full-time four-wheel drive, Toyota's bag of  off-road tech tricks and a strong V8 engine. All of this is further backed up  by a legendary and hard-earned reputation for reliability based on decades of  service in every corner of the world. </p>, <p>So whether you're traversing a glacier in  Iceland or oven-baked sand in Death Valley, the Land Cruiser will get the job  done. It also does this while cosseting you in a leather-lined, fully loaded  cabin that makes this Toyota a fully fledged luxury vehicle.</p>, <p>However, if the only terrain you intend  to cross is the local interstate and perhaps a Costco parking lot, the Land  Cruiser doesn't make any sense. It gets only 15 mpg in combined city and  highway driving, which is terrible even by full-size SUV standards. It's big,  heavy and has slow steering, reducing its maneuverability and compromising its  on-road handling relative to a large crossover. </p>, <p>Then there's the cabin — the  second row is mounted a bit too low for comfort and its otherwise hilarious  degree of recline is reduced to almost nil when the third-row seats are folded  up against the cargo area walls. And, yes, that means the third row doesn't  fold into the floor. It, therefore, still takes up cargo space when not in  place, and when it is, it's not as if many humans will be able to comfortably  fit back there or easily reach it. "Compromised" would be the word to  sum it up best.</p>, <p>But, for a select few, the 2018 Land  Cruiser is an absolutely perfect tool for their adventurous lifestyles. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Land Cruiser is an eight-passenger luxury SUV offered in one fully  loaded trim level. Every Land Cruiser also comes with a 5.7-liter V8 engine  that produces 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of torque. It is paired to an  eight-speed automatic transmission and a full-time four-wheel-drive system. </p>]

[<p>Other  off-roading components include a locking center differential, Toyota's Kinetic  Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS, a decoupling stabilizer bar), Crawl Control (a  low-speed off-road cruise control), Multi-Terrain Select (off-road vehicle  settings), hill start assist, skid plates and tow hooks.</p>, <p>Standard  exterior equipment includes 18-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, automatic  high beams, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, automatic wipers, a  windshield wiper de-icer, roof rails, running boards, and an integrated towing  hitch receiver and wiring harness. </p>, <p>Inside,  you get a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, four-zone automatic climate  control, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front  seats, driver-seat memory functions, 40/20/40-split second-row seats (folds,  reclines and slides), 50/50-split third-row seats, a heated power-adjustable  steering wheel, and a cooler box under the front center armrest.</p>, <p>Tech  features include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, a surround-view parking  camera system, wireless smartphone charging, a USB port, a 9-inch touchscreen  interface, Bluetooth, a navigation system, voice controls, Toyota's Entune  smartphone app suite, and a 14-speaker JBL sound system with a CD player and  satellite radio. </p>, <p>The  only factory option is a rear-seat entertainment system that includes two  display screens mounted to the front seatbacks.</p>]

[<p>If you're looking to stop burning fossil  fuels for transportation but you don't find the driving range and recharging  times of battery electric cars to be sufficient, the 2018 Toyota Mirai may be  perfect. </p>, <p>Hydrogen  fuel cell vehicles, such as the Mirai, convert pressurized hydrogen into electricity  that is used to drive an electric motor. Because they are electrically powered,  there are no tailpipe emissions. Yet with its tanks full of hydrogen, the Mirai  can go about 300 miles, which is more than most other similarly priced battery  electric cars, and you can fill it up at a hydrogen refueling station in just a  few minutes. </p>, <p>The  main issue is that while you can quickly refuel a Mirai with hydrogen, the lack  of filling stations will curb your desire for one. For 2018, there are just a  handful of stations in California and none in the rest of the country. Also,  with seating for four and no fold-down rear seats, the Mirai might not be the  best for family use. </p>]

[<p>Sales of the 2018 Toyota Mirai are  restricted to California because the Golden State is the only state with a  hydrogen refueling infrastructure sufficient to support a reasonable driving  pattern. As a hydrogen fuel cell car, the Mirai is a laboratory on wheels.  Toyota is limiting the production of Mirais to a relatively small number, so  all Mirais will be equipped identically, with only one trim level and no  options. </p>]

[<p>It comes pretty well-equipped, though.  All Mirais have keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, parking sensors, a navigation  system, premium audio, eight-way power-adjustable, and heated seats and a  heated steering wheel. It's plenty comfortable.</p>, <p>The fuel cell electric powertrain  develops 151 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque. The EPA gives the Mirai a  66 miles per kilogram of hydrogen (mpkg) estimate.

[<p>If you want pure efficiency and  eco-friendly driving without the hassle of plugging in your car, the 2018  Toyota Prius remains at the top of the heap. Pretty much nothing short of a  plug-in hybrid will return better real-world results. </p>, <p>We've had a <a href="/toyota/prius/2016/long-term-road-test/">2016 Prius</a> in our long-term test car fleet, and after more than a year we averaged about  50 mpg, even with thousands of miles spent in brutal Los Angeles traffic. We  also appreciate the Prius' practicality and comfort, with its generous cargo  area and smooth ride quality. Of course, the Prius compromises on acceleration  and handling, proving less rewarding to drive than many traditionally powered  vehicles. There's also the question of Toyota's infotainment system, which  lacks some functionality, and the car's questionable styling.</p>, <p>If you're shopping for a hybrid, know  that there's more competition than ever. The Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid actually  claims slightly higher EPA-rated fuel economy than the Prius and offers a  longer warranty. It certainly has a more functional interior with better  technology, too. However, the Ioniq is even less satisfying to drive than the  Prius, and it's a less comfortable place to spend time. There's also the Kia  Niro hybrid, which has the look of an SUV, and a slew of midsize hybrid sedans  to consider. </p>, <p>Still, there's a reason the Prius remains  the king of the hybrid cars. If you put a premium on efficiency and value, you  won't be disappointed by the Prius.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Prius is a four-door hatchback that seats five passengers. It's  available in seven trim levels: <strong>One</strong>, <strong>Two</strong>, <strong>Two Eco</strong>, <strong>Three</strong>, <strong>Three Touring</strong>, <strong>Four</strong> and <strong>Four Touring</strong>.  The compact <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/toyota/prius-c/2018/">Prius C</a> and plug-in <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/toyota/prius-prime/2018/">Prius Prime</a> are different models covered in  separate reviews. </p>]

[<p>Power  for all Prius trims comes from a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and a pair of  electric motors/generators. Their combined 121 horsepower is sent through a  continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) to the front wheels.</p>, <p>The  Prius One and Two are similarly equipped, with the One missing a few minor  features, such as a rear window wiper. Otherwise, standard feature highlights  for both include 15-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights, LED running lights  and taillights, heated mirrors, keyless entry (driver door only) and ignition,  automatic climate control, dual 4.2-inch driver information screens, adaptive  cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth upholstery, a  height-adjustable driver seat, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat.</p>, <p>Also  standard is a 6.1-inch touchscreen display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, voice recognition with Siri Eyes Free, and a  six-speaker audio system with a USB port, an auxiliary audio jack and a CD  player. Standard safety features include automatic high beams, a rearview  camera, forward collision warning, forward collision mitigation with automatic  braking, and lane departure warning and intervention. </p>, <p>The  Prius Two also currently comes with the Safety Plus package as a no-cost  add-on, which includes blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, parking  sensors and automated parking assist.</p>, <p>The  more efficient Prius Two Eco is equipped with ultra-low-rolling resistance tires,  a lighter lithium-ion hybrid battery, an inflation kit instead of a spare tire,  and illuminated keyless entry. The rear wiper that comes standard on the Two  trims is not offered, nor is the Safety Plus package. It returns an impressive <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/38062.shtml">56 mpg combined</a> (58 city/53 highway).</p>, <p>Inside  the Prius Three, you'll find simulated leather on the steering wheel and  armrests, white interior accents, a wireless phone charging pad, and the Toyota  Entune premium infotainment system with a 7-inch touchscreen, navigation,  satellite radio, HD radio, and access to apps such as Pandora, iHeartRadio,  OpenTable and Yelp when paired with a smartphone running the Entune app. </p>, <p>The  Prius Four comes with automatic wipers, simulated leather upholstery with  contrasting white stitching, heated front seats, a power driver seat with  adjustable lumbar, seatback storage pockets and a rear cargo cover. </p>, <p>Standard  equipment on the Three Touring or Four Touring includes everything from the  corresponding Three or Four, plus 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, LED  clearance lights, unique rear bumper styling, and imitation-leather upholstery  with contrasting blue stitching. </p>, <p>Note  that the aforementioned Safety Plus package is also a no-cost add-on for the  Three and Four. The Prius Three and Four (but not the Touring versions) can  also be upgraded with the Advanced Technology package, which consists of a  sunroof and a head-up display. Finally, the Prius Four and Four Touring can be  equipped with the Premium Convenience package, which includes a 10-speaker JBL  audio system, a self-parking system and Safety Connect emergency services. The  Safety Connect system that can be added to Prius Four and Four Touring is  subscription-based (with a one-year free trial) and includes automatic  collision notification, stolen vehicle locator, and one-touch access to  roadside and emergency assistance.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2016 Toyota Prius Three Hatchback</strong> (1.8L inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Prius has received some revisions,  including adjustments to trim-level features and expanded availability of  active safety features. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's  Toyota Prius.</p>]

[<p>The  practical, economical compact hatchback is a staple of Toyota's lineup  — just ask anyone who grew up in the back seat of a Tercel. This  latest iteration of the formula, first launched in 2012, might not be as cheap  as a Tercel, but it's still one of the most affordable ways to get into a  hybrid. </p>, <p>While  the Prius C lacks Toyota's latest hybrid powertrain technology (it's used in  the newest version of the regular Prius), the C is still reliably frugal and  should surpass its EPA-estimated 46 mpg combined in real-world driving. It's also  a maneuverable little car that's a breeze to park, making it an ideal city  runabout for people who prize efficiency. You can also factor in Toyota's  reputation for reliability and low running costs as advantages.</p>, <p>Of  course it's still an entry-level vehicle. In spite of the recently updated  infotainment system and additional safety features, the Prius C is a pretty  basic car. The interior is full of hard plastics and doesn't offer much in the  way of sound insulation. The ride quality is often harsh. And with just 99  horsepower on tap, the Prius C is one of the slower cars on the road. But  overall we think the Prius C's advantages outweigh the compromises.</p>]

[<p>Every  trim comes standard with a limited version of Toyota's Safety Sense. In the  Prius C, this system includes forward collision alert with automatic braking,  lane departure warning and automatic high beams.</p>]

[<p>Beyond  this safety equipment, the Prius C <strong>One</strong> comes with 15-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, LED headlights and  taillights, power mirrors, keyless entry, automatic climate control, cloth  seats with a folding rear bench, and a tilting-and-telescoping adjustable  steering wheel. Entertainment duties are handles by a 6.1-inch touchscreen  system with voice commands, Bluetooth, a USB port and a four-speaker stereo.  Frontal collision warning with automatic emergency braking and lane departure  warning are also included.</p>, <p>The  Prius C <strong>Two</strong> upgrades the rear seats  to a 60/40-split folding bench and adds two-tone fabric upholstery, a center  armrest with a storage compartment, a height-adjustable driver seat, cruise  control and two additional speakers for the stereo. </p>, <p>With  the <strong>Three</strong>, buyers get proximity  entry with push-button start and an upgraded infotainment system. The Three retains  the 6.1-inch screen, but adds navigation, satellite radio and Toyota's Entune  app suite. A sunroof is available as an optional extra.</p>, <p>The  range-topping Prius C <strong>Four</strong> adds LED  foglights, heated power mirrors, the sunroof and simulated leather upholstery.  Sixteen-inch alloy wheels are also available.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions, although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the <strong>2012 Toyota  Prius C Three </strong>(1.5L inline-4 hybrid | CVT automatic | FWD). This rating has  been carried forward from a prior year because the current model has no  substantial differences. </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Toyota Prius C has received some  revisions, including upgraded infotainment and active safety technology, and a  cosmetic refresh. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's Toyota  Prius C, however.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid version of the regular Prius. It  has a bigger battery that you can recharge with an external power source. Doing  so gives you the ability to drive about 25 miles on all-electric power before  the car switches over to regular hybrid operation. After that, the Prime  returns an impressive 54 mpg in combined city/highway driving. </p>, <p>Like  a standard Prius, the Prius Prime can operate without ever being plugged in.  Simply refuel as you go and enjoy the long legs of your journey between  fill-ups. Or, if you're able to recharge frequently, you can use the Prius  Prime much as you would an all-electric vehicle.</p>, <p>The  Prime's styling is a bit different from the regular Prius' (we'd argue it's  less goofy-looking, actually), and the seating capacity is down from five  passengers in the standard Prius to four. But the driving experience is  similar. Still, the bigger battery adds  weight, and that has a detrimental effect on handling and acceleration. The  battery also reduces maximum cargo capacity compared to the regular Prius.</p>, <p>You'll  want to look at a couple of rivals if you're shopping for a plug-in hybrid. The  Chevrolet Volt is sportier to drive and has a longer electric range than the  Prime, but overall fuel economy with the Volt is lower and the price is higher.  Honda's new Clarity Plug-In Hybrid is another top contender. Overall, the 2018  Toyota Prius Prime is a solid pick if you're shopping for an efficient and  affordable plug-in hybrid.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Prius Prime is available in three trim levels: <strong>Plus</strong>, <strong>Premium </strong>and <strong>Advanced</strong>. All share the same hybrid  powertrain and perform identically, so the differences among them boil down to  features. That is, the Plus is obviously the value play of the range, but it  has a decent list of standard features. The Premium, meanwhile, brings a few  key comfort-oriented items. The Advanced trim level adds a lot of features that  will surely appeal to tech-savvy buyers, though they come at a big increase in  price. </p>]

[<p>All  Prius Primes have a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired to a plug-in hybrid  system. Total system output is 121 horsepower, which drives the front wheels  through a specialized continuously variable automatic transmission. The EPA  estimates the Prime can drive up to 25 miles using pure electric power. Fully  charging the battery takes 5 hours and 30 minutes using a 120-volt power source  or a little more than 2 hours with 240 volts.</p>, <p>The <strong>Plus </strong>trim level starts you out with  15-inch wheels, LED headlights, automatic climate control, keyless access  (driver's door only) and start, heated front seats, a 7-inch touchscreen,  Bluetooth, a USB port, and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio. A  suite of driver safety aids, called Toyota Safety Sense P, is also standard and  includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist, and  automatic high beams.</p>, <p>Stepping  up one rung to the <strong>Premium </strong>trim  level puts you into the Prius Prime's sweet spot. It includes a power driver's  seat, an 11.6-inch central touchscreen and upgraded infotainment system,  simulated leather (SofTex) upholstery, keyless entry on the other three doors,  satellite radio and wireless smartphone charging.</p>, <p>The <strong>Advanced </strong>trim level adds on a  premium audio system, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a  heated steering wheel, an auto-dimming mirror, a head-up display, a smartphone  app with a charge management system and remote-control climate operation, automatic  wipers and a semiautomated parking function.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota RAV4 represents the  current generation's sixth and likely final year since it was completely  redesigned. It's received a nip here, a tuck there, and a few extra safety  features over the years, but it's largely the same utility-focused vehicle it  always has been. And really, it's those standard safety features and its  enormous interior that help keep it relevant despite virtually all of its  competitors being redesigned. </p>, <p>Take a test drive of the RAV4 and some  other top crossovers and you'll likely notice that the RAV4 looks and feels a  bit behind the times. Its utility-focused interior lacks the refinement,  quality and style of key rivals that can feel borderline luxurious. You can't  even get the RAV4 with real leather upholstery. The RAV4 is also less engaging  to drive, with subpar handling and an engine that trails in terms of both  acceleration and fuel economy. Tech features can also be lacking —  yes, safety tech is standard, but Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and onboard Wi-Fi  are not available. </p>, <p>To be fair, these issues are most obvious  on the RAV4's upper trim levels. Less expensive RAV4s such as the XLE are  better able to showcase their space advantages and standard safety equipment.  If you're shopping in that price range, the 2018 RAV4 is certainly worth a look,  but we also suggest checking out higher-rated crossovers such as the Chevrolet  Equinox, Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 RAV4 is a five-passenger compact  crossover SUV. There are <strong>LE</strong>,<strong> XLE</strong>, <strong>Adventure</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>Limited </strong>and <strong>Platinum </strong>trim levels, all of which come standard with a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine (176 horsepower, 172 pound-feet of torque) and a six-speed  automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on all trim levels, and  all-wheel drive is optional. Unlike most competitors, the RAV4's various trim  levels do more than just vary in terms of feature content — they can  have slightly different styling and overall characters. For instance, the SE is  sportier while the Adventure is more outdoorsy. </p>]

[<p>The RAV4 <strong>LE </strong>comes standard with 17-inch steel wheels, rear privacy glass,  Toyota Safety Sense P (forward collision warning and automatic emergency  braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high  beams), a rearview camera, a height-adjustable driver seat, a 60/40-split  folding and reclining second-row seat, a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface, one  USB port, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and an  auxiliary audio jack. </p>, <p>The <strong>XLE</strong> adds 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, heated mirrors, upgraded interior trim, a  sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  more aggressively bolstered front seats and extending sun visors. Heated front  seats with a power-adjustable driver adjustment are optional. </p>, <p>The <strong>Adventure</strong> adds special styling flourishes, 18-inch black alloy wheels, a slightly raised  suspension (6.5 inches of ground clearance versus 6.1), fender flares,  all-weather floor mats, a leather-wrapped shift knob and a 120-volt  household-style outlet in the cargo area. The Cold Weather package, exclusive  to the Adventure, adds heated front seats, the power driver seat, a heated  steering wheel, and a windshield wiper de-icer. </p>, <p>The <strong>SE</strong> gets some of the same styling flourishes as the Adventure and the same ground  clearance hike, but from there, they differ. The SE adds automatic LED  headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, 18-inch silver alloy  wheels, sportier suspension tuning, an upgraded rearview camera, steering-wheel  shift paddles, the power driver seat (plus power lumbar adjustment), heated  front seats and SofTex simulated leather upholstery. </p>, <p>On the SE, you also get the Entune Audio  Plus with Connected Navigation package that adds satellite radio, HD radio and  a Scout GPS navigation app that works through your smartphone connection. It's  optional on LE, XLE and Adventure.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> reverts to the XLE's ground clearance, suspension tuning and styling, but keeps  its equipment upgrades. It also adds different 18-inch wheels, chrome exterior  trim, a height-adjustable power liftgate, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic  warning systems, keyless ignition and entry, driver-seat memory functions, an  auto-dimming mirror, and the Entune Premium Audio with Integrated Navigation  and App Suite package (optional on XLE and Adventure) that adds a 7-inch  higher-resolution touchscreen and a Toyota navigation system. </p>, <p>Most of the Limited's other functional  upgrades can be added to the XLE, Adventure and SE trim levels through a  variety of "extra value" packages.</p>, <p>At the top of the RAV4 lineup is the <strong>Platinum</strong>. It<strong> </strong>includes front and rear parking sensors, a hands-free liftgate,  fancier exterior trim, a 360-degree parking camera, a heated steering wheel,  and the Entune Premium JBL Audio with Integrated Navigation and App Suite  package (optional on SE and Limited) that adds an 11-speaker JBL sound system  to all the other items featured in the Entune packages. All of the Platinum's  extra functional upgrades can be added to the SE and Limited through an  Advanced Technology package.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2017 Toyota RAV4 SE </strong>(2.5L  inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, Toyota raised the SE's suspension, which could  alter the SE's handling, ride and off-road ratings. Our findings remain broadly  applicable, however. </p>]

[<p>If you're having trouble picking a  compact crossover, we don't blame you. There's a ton of them. They're all  pretty good, and they often even look alike. Among this group, the regular  Toyota RAV4 doesn't stand out much. In general, we've found rivals such as the  Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5 to be more refined, engaging and even luxurious. But  the 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid has something even those models lack: exceptional  fuel economy.</p>, <p>The higher fuel economy of the RAV4  Hybrid allows it to exit the shadows and draw attention to itself. That would  be, perhaps not surprisingly, its fuel economy of 32 mpg combined. None of its  conventionally powered competitors can match that and it doesn't come with an  overly prohibitive price premium. </p>, <p>When you consider that along with its  standard safety tech, huge interior, surprising acceleration and, yes, Toyota's  reliability reputation, the RAV4 Hybrid becomes one of the must-drive vehicles  in the segment. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is a  five-passenger compact crossover SUV powered by a gasoline-electric hybrid  powertrain. It consists of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and three motor  generators — one that powers various vehicle systems, one that powers  the front wheels and one that powers the rear wheels, effectively creating a  standard all-wheel-drive system. Total system output is 194 horsepower. There  are four trim levels: <strong>LE</strong>, <strong>XLE</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong>. The  regular RAV4's Adventure and Platinum trims are not available. </p>]

[<p>The new-for-2018 <strong>LE</strong> base trim comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic  headlights, heated mirrors, integrated blind-spot mirrors, rear privacy glass,  roof rails, keyless ignition and entry, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic  climate control, a height-adjustable driver seat, and a 60/40-split folding and  reclining second-row seat.</p>, <p>Also standard is Toyota Safety Sense P  (forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency  braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high  beams), a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface, Bluetooth, one USB port, and a  six-speaker sound system with a CD player, a media player interface and an  auxiliary audio jack. </p>, <p>The <strong>XLE</strong> adds foglights, a sunroof, an upgraded rearview camera, a leather-wrapped  steering wheel, and the Entune Audio Plus with Connected Navigation package  that includes satellite radio, HD radio, Siri Eyes Free and a Scout GPS  smartphone-based navigation system. Heated front seats with eight-way power adjustment for the driver is optional.</p>, <p>The<strong> SE</strong> adds sportier suspension  tuning, 18-inch wheels, special exterior styling, blind-spot monitoring and  rear cross-traffic alert systems (optional on XLE), automatic LED headlights,  LED running lights and taillights, a height-adjustable power liftgate, an  eight-way power driver seat with lumbar adjustment, heated front seats and  SofTex vinyl upholstery.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited </strong>reverts to the XLE's styling and suspension tuning, but includes the SE's  other upgrades. It further adds front and rear parking sensors, chrome exterior  trim, driver-seat memory functions, an auto-dimming mirror, and the Entune  Premium Audio with Integrated Navigation and App Suite (optional on the XLE and  SE) that includes a 7-inch higher-resolution touchscreen, a variety of  smartphone apps and an integrated hard-drive-based Toyota navigation system. A  hands-free liftgate is a stand-alone option.</p>, <p>An 11-speaker JBL audio system can be  added to the SE and Limited trim levels as either a stand-alone item or within  an Advanced Technology package that also includes a bird's-eye view parking  camera, and on the SE, the parking sensors and auto-dimming mirror. The XLE's  Hybrid Convenience package adds blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert, parking sensors, the power liftgate, and the Entune Premium Audio with  Integrated Navigation and App suite.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Sequoia is worth a look if your transportation needs require a  heavy-duty three-row SUV. It offers seating for up to eight people, legitimate  off-road and towing capabilities, and substantial cargo room. The Sequoia is  capable of doing just about anything.</p>, <p>But  the current-generation Sequoia has been around for 10 years without a redesign.  That's a long time in the automotive industry, and it's mostly apparent in the  Sequoia's dated interior design, lack of refinement and subpar fuel economy.  It's a tough sell when other big crossover SUVs can provide similar amounts of  interior room to the Sequoia but with superior fuel economy and a better  combination of ride comfort and secure handling.</p>, <p>Still, as traditional SUVs go, the Sequoia offers a more comfortable ride than  many in its class, especially when equipped with the Platinum trim's air  suspension. It's also pretty capable off-road thanks to its substantial ground  clearance, though obviously this isn't a vehicle you'll want to try to squeeze  down a tight, narrow trail. Overall, the Sequoia isn't our top pick for a big  three-row SUV, but there are enough positives that it's worth considering.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Sequoia comes in four  trims: <strong>SR5</strong>, <strong>TRD Sport </strong>(late availability), <strong>Limited </strong>and <strong>Platinum</strong>. They all come with  a 5.7-liter V8 (381 hp, 401 lb-ft) and a six-speed automatic transmission.  Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is optional. There are  significant price jumps between trims, but there are option packages for the  SR5 and Limited that help bridge the gaps. The SR5 and Limited models seat  eight passengers, while the second-row captain's chairs on Platinum reduce  seating to seven.</p>]

[<p>The base <strong>SR5 </strong>model comes stocked with a healthy number of standard features.  Highlights include 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, a sunroof, a power rear  window, tri-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver seat, a  40/20/40-split second-row bench seat (with sliding and reclining  functionality), a 60/40-split reclining and fold-flat third-row bench, second-  and third-row retractable sunshades, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a USB port,  a 6.1-inch touchscreen, and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player and  satellite and HD radio.</p>, <p>Standard safety features for the SR5  include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane  departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera,  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and traffic-adapting cruise  control.</p>, <p>An  optional SR5 Premium package bundles an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather  upholstery, a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated front seats, a power  liftgate, a power reclining and folding third-row seat, and an integrated  navigation system.</p>, <p>Complete  information on the <strong>TRD Sport</strong> was not  available as publication, but Toyota has said it will come with a sport-tuned  suspension, 20-inch wheels and special exterior styling details.</p>, <p>Compared  to the SR5, stepping up to the <strong>Limited </strong>model  gets you 20-inch wheels, power-folding and auto-dimming exterior mirrors,  upgraded gauges and everything from the SR5's Premium package.</p>, <p>A  seven-passenger option swaps the second-row bench for two captain's chairs. A  14-speaker premium JBL sound system (bundled with driver memory settings) is  optional, as is a rear-seat entertainment system with a Blu-ray player. </p>, <p>The  top-of-the-line <strong>Platinum </strong>trim level  comes standard with all of the above features, plus an adaptive air suspension  (with a load-leveling rear), ventilated front seats, heated second-row  captain's chairs (reducing seating capacity to seven), a second-row center  console and a power-adjustable steering wheel</p>]

[<p>For many people, the stigma of owning a  minivan is too much to bear. Instead, they turn their focus to the latest  crossover SUV. Shame really, since the minivan remains one of the most sensible  ways to move your family around. Sliding side doors, easy entry into all three  rows, and massive passenger and cargo space just make life easier. Crossovers  have their own charms, but they can't beat the overall versatility and  sensibility of vans such as the 2018 Toyota Sienna. </p>, <p>The  Sienna was last redesigned in 2010, but annual updates keep it competitive  against newer minivan rivals. For 2018, the Sienna gets a handful of key  updates. Notably, Toyota now includes its Safety Sense package on all trim  levels and no longer as an options group on midlevel and upper trims. These are  key safety and driver aids, too, and include automatic emergency braking, lane  departure warning and adaptive cruise control. </p>, <p>While  the Chrysler Pacifica, Honda Odyssey and Kia Sedona all boast newer and more  modern designs, the Sienna continues to be a solid pick for a versatile family  hauler. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Sienna minivan comes in five main trim levels: <strong>L</strong>, <strong>LE</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>XLE</strong> and <strong>Limited</strong>. The SE,  XLE, and Limited are further available in Premium subtrims. All Sienna trims  come with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (296 horsepower, 263 pound-feet of torque)  paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The LE and XLE come in  seven- and eight-passenger configurations: The L and Limited versions are  seven-passenger only, and the SE is eight-passenger only. </p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the base <strong>L </strong>include  17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, a wiper de-icer, tri-zone automatic  climate control, keyless entry, a rearview camera, a conversation mirror,  Bluetooth, smartphone-app navigation (Scout GPS Link), Siri Eyes Free, five USB  ports, a 7-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player,  media player interface and an auxiliary audio jack.</p>, <p>Toyota Safety Sense also comes standard starting with L trims. It includes  forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency  braking, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise  control, and automatic headlights.</p>, <p>The <strong>LE</strong> adds roof rails, power-sliding  rear doors, privacy glass, heated mirrors, an eight-way power-adjustable driver  seat, upgraded easy-clean fabric upholstery, rear sunshades, HD and satellite  radio, Entune apps (i.e., Pandora, iHeartRadio, Yelp) and telematics services,  and a Wi-Fi hotspot. All-wheel-drive versions get 18-inch wheels. </p>, <p>The <strong>SE</strong> is equipped similarly to the LE  but adds a sport-tuned suspension, sharper steering, 19-inch alloy wheels, a  unique front fascia (foglights, LED daytime running lights and a mesh grille),  a noise-reducing windshield and lower body skirting. The SE also has a power  liftgate, first- and second-row leather upholstery (the third row gets premium  vinyl), heated front seats, and unique gauges with a larger driver information  screen. </p>, <p>The <strong>SE Premium</strong> adds a sunroof, keyless  ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems,  a navigation system, a rear-seat entertainment system, and the Driver Easy  Speak system, which amplifies the driver's voice through the rear speakers. </p>, <p>The  Sienna <strong>XLE</strong> shares many of the SE  trim's comfort and convenience equipment, but it features similar suspension,  steering and styling to the LE. It also adds a power-adjustable front passenger  seat, imitation-wood trim, power-opening rear-quarter windows, keyless entry  and push-button start. The <strong>XLE Premium</strong> adds the SE Premium's features and rear parking sensors. </p>, <p>The  plush <strong>Limited</strong> includes the XLE  Premium's features (minus the rear entertainment system), along with 18-inch  alloy wheels, a different grille, LED daytime running lights, auto-dimming and  power-folding mirrors, front and rear sunroofs, noise-reducing side glass, and  front and rear parking sensors. Inside is first- and second-row premium leather  upholstery, driver-seat memory settings, a heated steering wheel, Toyota Safety  Connect emergency services, an in-dash navigation system, and an upgraded  10-speaker JBL surround-sound audio system. Front-wheel-drive models also get a  sliding center console between the first two rows, extendable footrests for the  second row, and a power-folding third row with faux leather upholstery. </p>, <p>You  can add even more with the <strong>Limited  Premium </strong>trim, which tacks on xenon headlights, automatic wipers, a  surround-view parking camera system, the rear-seat entertainment system and  upgraded third-row leather (AWD only).</p>, <p>Only  two option packages are available. For SE trims, the SE Preferred package adds  a sunroof, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, keyless ignition  and entry, the Driver Easy Speak system, and the in-dash navigation system. For  XLE trims, the XLE Navigation package adds rear parking sensors, Driver Easy  Speak and the in-dash navigation system. </p>]

[<p>If excellent utility and off-road ability  are priorities for your next vehicle, the 2018 Toyota Tacoma should be high on  your list. The wealth of available configurations means there's likely a Tacoma  that fits your needs, and some of them provide an impressive degree of  trail-busting capability.</p>, <p>Alongside those specialized off-road  Tacomas with their knobby tires, upgraded suspension and off-road driving aids,  there are street-oriented versions of the Tacoma, too. Notably, even the more  luxurious trim levels share their siblings' lifted stance. It creates a high  step-in height and a slightly unusual seating position, but it also means every  Tacoma is at least a little adventure-ready.</p>, <p>The Tacoma has some notable competition.  The Honda Ridgeline lacks the Tacoma's rugged look, but it offers all the  practicality of a pickup plus innovative storage options, a more carlike ride  quality and a roomier interior. There's also the Chevrolet Colorado, which  feels like a slightly scaled-down Chevy Silverado full-size truck in many  respects and has a superior engine lineup. Overall, though, we think the Tacoma  hits the spot for what most midsize pickup shoppers are looking for.</p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Toyota Tacoma as one of Edmunds' <a href="/truck/articles/best-pickup-trucks/" title="Best Midsize Trucks">Best Midsize Trucks</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The Tacoma is available in six trim  levels. The entry-level <strong>SR</strong> is the  work truck of the bunch, with the value-oriented <strong>SR5</strong> offering more equipment and more choices. Next up are the very  popular and well-equipped <strong>TRD Sport</strong> and <strong>TRD Off-Road</strong> variants. The two  are identical on the inside, but hardware differences make the TRD Off-Road  more capable when the going gets rocky. The more street-oriented <strong>Limited</strong> used to be the top dog, but  that honor now belongs to the <strong>TRD Pro</strong>,  a highly capable and fully equipped off-road machine.</p>]

[<p>Bare-bones isn't quite the right way to  describe the low-dollar <strong>SR</strong>, the most  modestly equipped Tacoma of the lot. Even so, it can be had with an extended  cab with a 6.1-foot bed or a crew cab with a 5-foot bed, and you can choose  between two-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive with a low-range transfer  case. Its 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine with 159 horsepower is paired to a  six-speed automatic transmission. For 2018, all trim levels including the SR  gain forward collision  warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure alert, automatic high  beams, and adaptive cruise control as standard equipment. </p>, <p>The SR is most easily identified by its  dark grille and 16-inch steel wheels. But even this basic Tacoma comes with a  sliding rear window, a tough composite bed that needs no bedliner, a movable  cleat tie-down system, and a backup camera fitted in the tailgate release  handle. Inside, the four-way-adjustable cloth seats have driver-side lumbar  adjustment, and the steering wheel tilts, telescopes, and has control buttons  that work with the basic Entune stereo, which supports Bluetooth and has a USB  interface. </p>, <p>For most buyers, the <strong>SR5</strong> is the better deal. In addition to the previous configurations  mentioned, you can also get a long-wheelbase version that pairs the crew cab  with the 6.1-foot bed. Outwardly, the SR5 gains a chrome rear bumper and a  flash of chrome on its charcoal-colored grille. It's got foglights set into its  front bumper, and the 16-inch steel wheels can be upgraded to alloys. Remote  keyless entry becomes standard, its steering wheel is wrapped in leather, and  the sliding rear window uses privacy glass. There's a 4.2-inch information  screen between the gauges, and the enhanced Entune audio system supports  satellite radio, smartphone-enabled navigation via the Scout GPS app, and Siri  Eyes Free voice control.</p>, <p>Next up is the <strong>TRD Sport</strong>. It is offered in the same cab and bed configurations as  the SR5, but it replaces the four-cylinder engine with a 278-hp 3.5-liter V6.  All rear-wheel-drive versions use the six-speed automatic, but four-wheel-drive  buyers can choose between the automatic and a performance-oriented six-speed  manual. </p>, <p>It comes with 17-inch alloy wheels,  body-colored fender flares and rear bumper, turn signals in the mirror housings  and, everyone's favorite, a hood scoop. There's a 400-watt power outlet in the  bed, and the crew cab's sliding rear window is power-actuated. Automatic  transmission-equipped trucks gain smart entry and push-button start, and all  TRD Sports make the jump to full navigation via the Entune premium audio  system's 7-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>The <strong>TRD  Off-Road</strong> offers the same configuration and engine options as the TRD Sport,  and its truck bed and interior and audio trimmings are identical. Visual  differences include a chrome rear bumper, textured black fender flares and the  absence of the Sport's hood scoop. Off-road performance changes loom large in  this trim, and these include knobby all-terrain tires on 16-inch alloy wheels, the  deletion of the front air dam, extra skid plates, a lockable rear differential,  Bilstein monotube shocks, and an advanced off-road traction control system with  multiple terrain settings and crawl control.</p>, <p>Both the TRD Sport and TRD Off-Road  crew-cab models can be upgraded with a few option packages. Feature highlights  include a sunroof, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring with rear  cross-traffic alert, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated seats, leather  upholstery, and a JBL speaker upgrade and a subwoofer. It's worth noting that  the stereo upgrade is not available on models with the manual transmission.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited</strong> is the most civilized version of the Tacoma. It is only offered as a V6-powered  crew cab with the short bed in either two- or four-wheel drive. It has  body-colored flares and rear bumper, and it rolls on 18-inch wheels with  lower-profile tires. It lacks the TRD Off-Road's specialized off-road upgrades  and is instead upgraded with just about all of the Off-Road and Sport's  optional features as standard equipment. </p>, <p>The <strong>TRD  Pro</strong> is sold only as a crew cab with a short bed, and it comes only in  four-wheel drive. The V6 engine is standard, but you can choose between the  manual and the automatic transmission. It's equipped like a loaded-up TRD  Off-Road but sets itself apart with special styling details, including a black  throwback grille with "Toyota" spelled out in capital letters. Most  notably, it has special Fox internal bypass shocks that give it more off-road  capability as well as a tougher stance that's an inch broader and an inch  taller.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically  comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based  on our full test of the <strong>2016 Toyota  Tacoma TRD Off-Road Crew Cab </strong>(3.5L V6 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Toyota Tacoma has received some  minor equipment revisions. Our findings are broadly applicable to this year's  Toyota Tacoma, however.</p>]

[<p>Shopping  for a full-size truck can be a challenge. Though there are only a few models to  choose from, deciding which is best can be daunting. Toyota's offering for  consumers is the 2018 Tundra. Some shoppers will undoubtedly appreciate the  Tundra's V8-only powertrains, and others will enjoy the relatively  straightforward ordering process compared to domestic rivals. And though the  Tundra doesn't have a wealth of bells and whistles to choose from, it does have  appealing core competencies. It can tow more than 10,000 pounds and is quite  capable on the occasional off-road trip.</p>, <p>But  rival full-size trucks have all benefited from recent overhauls, and the Tundra  hasn't seen an all-new revision since 2007, which means the 2018 Tundra lags in  advancements compared to the current segment leaders. Most manufacturers offer  a diesel engine option for efficiency and torque over long hauls or  turbocharged gasoline engines for superior performance and fuel efficiency.  Even suspension technology has increased such that most rival trucks ride more  comfortably.</p>, <p>Ultimately,  the made-in-America 2018 Toyota Tundra has its share of good qualities, but  it's not enough to push it to the top of the full-size truck category this  year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup that is available in one of four trim  levels: the worker-oriented <strong>SR</strong>, the  value-conscious <strong>SR5</strong>, the flexible <strong>Limited</strong>, and the upmarket <strong>Platinum </strong>and <strong>1794 Edition</strong>. Two engines are available, both V8s: a 4.6-liter (310  hp, 327 lb-ft) and a 5.7-liter (381 hp, 401 lb-ft). From there, you'll pick a  body style (the regular Double Cab crew cab or extra large CrewMax) and one of  three bed lengths (5.5-foot short bed, 6.5-foot standard bed and 8.1-foot long  bed). Note that Toyota limits certain combinations of the above, and feature  availability can also vary depending on the region of the country in which you  live. </p>]

[<p>Highlights for the base <strong>SR </strong>(Double  Cab body only) include 18-inch steel wheels, heated mirrors, a windshield wiper  de-icer, a damped tailgate, a rearview camera, an integrated trailer brake  controller, a tilt-only steering wheel, Bluetooth, a 6.1-inch touchscreen  interface, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and a USB port. Also  included is forward collision warning and mitigation (with automatic braking),  lane departure warning, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>Going with the <strong>SR5 </strong>gets you  foglights, variable intermittent windshield wipers and an upgraded tech  interface that includes a 7-inch touchscreen, HD and satellite radio, traffic  information and a navigation app. The crew cab adds a power-opening rear window  and an overhead console.</p>, <p>The  SR5's Upgrade package adds front bucket seats with a power-adjustable driver  seat, a center console (with storage and console shifter), a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a  larger 38-gallon gas tank when equipped with the 5.7-liter V8. There's also a  TRD Sport package that adds 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, a hood  scoop, body-colored mirrors and bumpers, LED headlights and foglights, TRD  shift knob, floor mats and graphics.</p>, <p>The <strong>Limited </strong>builds on the Upgrade  options package equipment with 20-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights,  movable tie-down cleats, automatic dual-zone climate control, leather  upholstery, an upgraded power driver seat and a power-adjustable passenger  seat, a power horizontal-sliding rear window (extended cab), a navigation  system and additional stereo speakers.</p>, <p>At the top of the heap, the <strong>Platinum </strong>trim  level comes with distinctive styling elements, LED daytime running lights,  power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors, a sunroof, heated and ventilated front  seats, driver-seat memory functions and a 12-speaker JBL sound system.</p>, <p>The <strong>1794 Edition </strong>really only differs  from the Platinum in terms of its exclusive exterior and interior styling  elements.</p>, <p>A TRD Off-Road package can be added to the SR5, Limited and 1794 Edition. It  includes 18-inch TRD wheels, off-road tires, LED headlights, trail-tuned shock  absorbers, skid plates and tow hooks.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2014 Toyota Tundra CrewMax 1794  Edition </strong>(5.7L V8 | 6-speed automatic | 4WD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Tundra has received some revisions,  including an upgraded infotainment system and new driver safety aids. Our  findings remain applicable to this year's Tundra, however.</p>]

[<p>Available  in two- or four-door body styles, Toyota's 2018 Yaris hatchback is ideal if  you're looking for a reliable vehicle with easy-to-park dimensions and a very  affordable price. But for that price, you do have to make some sacrifices. </p>, <p>On  the positive side, the Yaris' small overhangs and standard rearview camera make  maneuvering in parking lots and parallel parking a breeze. It's also one of the  few cars in its class to offer the latest in advanced driver safety aids,  including lane departure warning, automatic high-beam activation, and forward  collision warning and mitigation. All reinforce the Yaris' already good safety  scores. Of course, the Yaris is also a hatchback, so you can fit more cargo  than you could otherwise in a sedan. </p>, <p>And  though the Yaris is functional, it's not particularly enjoyable to drive. The  lack of a telescoping steering wheel means it's hard to find a comfortable  driving position. The Yaris, with its 106-horsepower engine and four-speed  automatic transmission lag, behind the competition, which offer more powerful  engines and smoother-shifting six-speed transmissions. And while a touchscreen  comes standard, you might be also dismayed at the lack of comprehensive  smartphone integration via Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p>Overall,  the Yaris is a perfectly usable subcompact. But with as much variety as there  is in this segment, you may find there are better choices in the class if you  want something more than basic transportation.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Toyota Yaris is a compact hatchback that is available in two body styles,  with just one engine and two transmissions. The Yaris <strong>L </strong>and <strong>LE </strong>are offered  with two or four doors; the <strong>SE </strong>trim  is offered only as a four-door. The two-door L and four-door SE are offered  with a five-speed manual transmission, while a four-speed automatic is optional  on those trims and standard on everything else. A 1.5-liter four-cylinder  engine (106 horsepower, 103 pound-feet of torque) is standard across all trims  and body styles.</p>]

[<p> Standard features on the <strong>L</strong> includes  15-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights and high-beam control, power door  locks and windows, air-conditioning, a height-adjustable driver seat, a  tilt-only steering wheel, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, Bluetooth, a  6.1-inch touchscreen, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, HD radio  and a USB port. Lane departure warning and forward collision warning with  automatic emergency braking are also standard. </p>, <p> The <strong>LE </strong>adds or substitutes 15-inch  alloy wheels, power side mirrors, remote locking and unlocking, cruise control  and enhanced interior trim. </p>, <p> For a more premium Yaris, go with the <strong>SE </strong>trim. It's only available as a four-door, and you'll get 16-inch alloy  wheels, projector-beam headlights, LED running lights, foglights, special  exterior styling elements, four-wheel disc brakes, a larger 7-inch touchscreen,  a leather-trimmed steering wheel and upgraded cloth upholstery.<br/></p>]

[<p>Take a long look at the 2018 Toyota Yaris  iA, especially at the back. Notice how it doesn't really look like other  Toyotas? Now, peek into the cabin. Apart from the badge on the steering wheel,  there's zero family resemblance. This is because the iA is designed and  produced by Mazda. Mazda doesn't have an equivalent to the iA in its lineup,  but take a look atits cars and  you'll quickly see where the iA's DNA really comes from. </p>, <p>We point this out because Mazda is quite  good at building small cars. If anything, this Toyota and Mazda partnership is  a best-of-both-worlds scenario. The iA benefits from Mazda's design approach  that results in a fun-to-drive nature, excellent fuel economy and stylish,  high-quality interior design. Yet, since it's sold by Toyota, the iA comes  standard with plenty of features (including advanced driver safety aids) and is  available to more people because of Toyota's larger dealer network. </p>, <p>But there are some reasons to think twice  about the iA. For starters, it doesn't have a lot of power — even for  a segment known for being on the slow side. Interior space can also be an issue  because backseat legroom and driver-seat adjustability are limited relative the  competition. Some may also lament that there's no hatchback body style or a  cheaper, lesser-equipped base model available.</p>, <p>In total, though, we think the 2018 Yaris  iA is a must-drive for anyone seeking an affordable subcompact sedan  — no matter which company makes it.  </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Yaris iA subcompact sedan  comes in just one trim level. Power is supplied by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder  engine (106 horsepower, 103 pound-feet of torque). A six-speed manual  transmission is standard, and a six-speed automatic is optional.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment includes 16-inch alloy  wheels, full power accessories (locks, windows and mirrors), keyless ignition  and entry, a rearview camera, a low-speed forward collision warning and  automatic braking system, cruise control, air conditioning, a height-adjustable  driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, the Mazda Connect tech  interface in all but name (7-inch display, knob-and-button controller,  touchscreen operation when parked), two USB ports, Bluetooth, and a six-speaker  sound system with an auxiliary audio jack, media player interface and HD radio.  There are no factory options beyond paint color and transmission.</p>]

[<p>The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of a <strong>2016 Scion iA</strong> (1.5L inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current iA has been renamed the Toyota Yaris  iA, but is fundamentally the same car with no significant changes. Our findings  remain applicable to this year's Yaris iA.</p>]

[<p>Designed and built in America to suit American  tastes, the 2018 Volkswagen Atlas is the three-row crossover SUV Volkswagen has  desperately needed for quite some time. The Touareg SUV that has been around  for a while doesn't offer third-row seating, and it's not as competitive on  price. The Atlas not only competes well with its rivals in terms of value, it  has the kind of passenger space American families typically shop for in a  family-hauling crossover. </p>, <p>Like other Volkswagens, the Atlas features an  interior design that's both simple and sophisticated. Base Atlas models have  easy-to-read gauges, intuitive controls and above-average quality materials.  The top-end SEL and SEL Premium offer plenty of technology features as well,  but their inclusion never makes the cabin seem overly complicated. </p>, <p>Our only real concern at this point is performance  on the open highway. Even with the optional V6, the Atlas doesn't feel  particularly powerful. The standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder is going to feel  even more taxed, especially under a full load of kids and cargo. To its credit,  the Atlas has a very refined ride quality and a quiet cabin, so if the engine  has enough guts for your tastes, you're not likely to find issue elsewhere. </p>]

[<p>The Atlas is offered in five trim levels — <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SE w/technology</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong> and <strong>SEL Premium</strong>. The first four trim levels can be paired with either  the base four-cylinder engine (235 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque) or the  optional V6 engine (276 hp, 258 lb-ft). The SEL Premium comes with the V6  engine as standard. Front-wheel drive is standard, and V6 models can also be  ordered with all-wheel drive (standard on the SEL Premium). For all Atlas  versions, an eight-speed automatic transmission is standard. </p>]

[<p>Base Atlas <strong>S</strong> models have cloth seating, a bench seat in the second row, LED headlights and  dual-zone manual climate control along with typical features such as power  mirrors, a rearview camera and cruise control. There's also a standard 6.5-inch  touchscreen interface that offers Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Bluetooth  connectivity. A limited run of Atlas S Launch Edition models will be offered  with the V6 engine only and the addition of a panoramic sunroof, HomeLink  programmable garage door opener and an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen with  satellite radio. </p>, <p>Upgrading to the <strong>SE</strong> adds simulated leather upholstery, push-button start, automatic  headlights, a power driver seat, heated front seats, rear sunshades, a  blind-spot monitoring system, a larger 8-inch touchscreen interface and the  option of captain's chairs in the second row. The <strong>SE w/technology</strong> builds on the SE's equipment list with the addition  of remote engine start, automatic three-zone climate control, a power rear  liftgate, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and automatic emergency  braking. </p>, <p>Moving up to the <strong>SEL</strong> adds a panoramic sunroof, power-adjustable front passenger  seats, park distance control and two available options: black 20-inch wheels  and the R-Line appearance package. The top-of-the-line <strong>SEL Premium</strong> adds several exclusive features. The most notable among  them is the Volkswagen Digital Cockpit, a display that replaces the standard  gauge cluster with a video screen that can be reconfigured to show a wide  variety of information beyond basic speed, fuel and temperature readings. All  SEL Premium models also get LED taillights, full leather seating, an upgraded  touchscreen display with navigation, and a parking assist system. The same  20-inch black wheels offered on the SEL are also optional on the SEL Premium,  but the R-Line package is not. </p>]

[<p>Few cars on the road are more iconic that  Volkswagen's Beetle. Yet the newest-generation model that debuted for the 2012  model year has never been a big seller in the way the original and the more  recent "New Beetle" were. That's really a shame because the 2018 VW  Beetle is an appealing little two-door that offers a compelling blend of style,  performance, comfort and features. </p>, <p>For 2018, things have been simplified a  bit in Beetle land. There are fewer trim levels with the demise of the  performance-oriented R-Line. But a new special-edition Coast trim level that  features special beach-themed styling has been added. OK, so some cutesy retro  pastiche lives on. There's also a new engine standard on every Beetle,  including the vaguely off-roadish Dune version. A 2.0-liter turbocharged  four-cylinder replaces the old 1.8-liter, and although both produce the same  output — 174 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque — the  new 2.0-liter nets an extra 3 mpg in combined city/highway driving. </p>, <p>Some familiar downsides are still around,  including less cargo space and a higher price than most other competing  hatchbacks. But if you're looking for a compact car with some character, giving  the Beetle a chance could definitely be worth it.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volkswagen Beetle is a two-door  hatchback that seats four people. There are four trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>Coast</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>Dune</strong>. The Dune boasts a slightly raised suspension for more ground  clearance, but otherwise all are mechanically the same. For 2018, that includes  in the engine bay as well. Every Beetle comes standard with a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine good for 174 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of  torque. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission available. </p>]

[<p>The base <strong>S</strong> comes standard with 16-inch alloy wheels, LED running lights,  heated mirrors, a rearview camera, height-adjustable front seats, cloth upholstery,  a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth, the Composition Color 5-inch  touchscreen interface, one USB port, and an eight-speaker sound system that  includes a CD player, an auxiliary audio jack and a media player interface.</p>, <p>The Style &amp; Comfort package for the S  adds 17-inch wheels, automatic headlights, automatic wipers, extra body-colored  exterior trim, keyless ignition and entry, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  leatherette upholstery, heated front seats, satellite radio, the Composition  Media 6.3-inch touchscreen, HD and satellite radios, and VW Car-Net App-Connect  (adds various smartphone-integration apps, most notably Android Auto and Apple  CarPlay). </p>, <p>The special-edition<strong> Coast </strong>trim includes all of the above plus a sunroof, blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems, and special design elements (a  unique Deep Sea Teal paint option, a surfboard-look dash pad, houndstooth cloth  upholstery and special floor mats). The Coast Light package adds bi-xenon  headlights and LED taillights. </p>, <p>The <strong>SE</strong> includes all of the Coast's extra equipment apart from the special design  elements. It also adds dual-zone automatic climate control and VW Car-Net  Security &amp; Service emergency communications. Its SE Premium package adds  18-inch wheels, front and rear parking sensors, the bi-xenon headlights, LED  taillights, a Fender audio system, and the Discover Media 6.3-inch touchscreen  that essentially adds a navigation system to the Composition Media system.</p>, <p>The Beetle <strong>Dune</strong> features extra ground clearance, a wider track, special  exterior design elements, 18-inch wheels, faux leather and cloth upholstery,  front sport seats, and all of the SE Premium's added elements apart from  Discover Media touchscreen, which is not available. Blind-spot monitoring and  rear cross-traffic alert systems, and VW Car-Net Security and Service are also  not available on the Dune.</p>]

[<p>It's not easy to find an inexpensive  convertible. Drop-tops are few and far between to begin with, and those on the  lower end of the price scale are an absolute rarity. Pleasingly, though, the  2018 Volkswagen Beetle Convertible is just such a vehicle. </p>, <p>True, as a Beetle, it comes with iconic  styling and a half-century's worth of reputation, expectation and even stigma  wrapped up in its kitschy package. It will never be for everyone. But judged  solely on its merits as a convertible, the Beetle is a comparatively sensible  choice.</p>, <p>First and foremost, it is larger and more  comfortable than its primary points of comparison: the Mini Convertible and the  barely-a-convertible Fiat 500C. Is its cabin spacious? No, but it's also not  clown-car-cramped. Its bigger size contributes to a greater sense of refinement  and better ride quality. Its ride isn't choppy like the Mini's and Fiat's. </p>, <p>Now, it certainly isn't the sharpest car  to drive (a Mini or Mazda MX-5 would be a better call if you're looking for  that), but it's hard to complain about the engine. New for 2018 is a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It produces the same 174 horsepower and  184 pound-feet of torque as last year's engine, but it is more fuel-efficient.  By comparison, a comparably priced Mini has 134 horsepower, while the Fiat 500C  has 101 hp. </p>, <p>Ultimately, the Beetle's combination of  size, refinement and power translates into a bigger-convertible feel at a  reasonable small-convertible price. You'll still be dealing with compromised  cargo space (which you will in almost every convertible) and limited rear  visibility (ditto), but based on its objective merits, the Beetle is a great  drop-top choice. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volkswagen Beetle is a two-door,  four-passenger convertible with a standard power-operated soft-top. There are  four trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>Coast</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>Dune</strong>.

[<p>When it launched for the 2015 model year,  this generation Golf was an outlier in the economy class. It offered  higher-quality interior materials and more refined ride and handling  characteristics than its competitors, along with the practicality of a  hatchback. In many ways, the 2018 Volkswagen Golf is better than ever. This  year, you get more standard features, including smartphone integration, LED  running lights and taillights, automatic headlights and wipers, and the option  of a new 8.5-inch infotainment touchscreen. </p>, <p>But even though the 2018 Golf retains its  old charms and adds more features, the rest of the small-car field has evolved.  The Honda Civic hatchback offers enjoyable performance and high fuel economy along  with a roomy back seat and a slew of technology and safety features available  across most of its lineup. Or you could check out the Mazda 3, which is  engaging on the road and can be had with an even more upscale interior than the  Golf. </p>, <p>It'll be worth your while to scout out  these rivals, or even the redesigned Hyundai Elantra GT. Still, the 2018 Golf's  positive attributes greatly outweigh its negatives. </p>]

[<p>The Volkswagen Golf is a four-door small  hatchback available in two trim levels. The base <strong>S</strong> is pricier than other base compact cars but comes standard with  some nice upgraded features, while the <strong>SE</strong> trim adds a few luxuries and active safety features. The Golf comes standard  with a turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder (170 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of  torque) and a five-speed manual transmission. A six-speed automatic is  available and bumps the Golf's torque up to 199 lb-ft if so equipped. </p>]

[<p>The base <strong>S </strong>comes standard with halogen headlights, LED daytime-running  lights and taillights, automatic rain-sensing wipers, heated side mirrors, and  15-inch alloy wheels. Inside, you get a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  manually adjustable seats with lumbar adjustment and power recline, cloth  upholstery, cruise control and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>Infotainment in the Golf S is handled by  a 6.5-inch touchscreen system with Bluetooth and USB connectivity, Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto, and an eight-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>Upgrading to the S adds heated washer  nozzles, 16-inch alloy wheels and a sunroof. Inside, the SE upgrades to  simulated leather upholstery, heated front seats, and keyless entry with  push-button start. You also get blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.  Pedestrian recognition will be added to the collision mitigation system later  this year. </p>, <p>The SE's infotainment system is upgraded  to an 8-inch touchscreen that adds a CD player and satellite radio, along with  VW's Security &amp; Service app.</p>]

[<p>With all-wheel drive, a cavernous cargo  area and familiar Golf goodness, the 2018 Volkswagen Golf Alltrack offers a  compelling alternative to similarly priced crossovers. If you like the idea of  a Golf wagon but need all-wheel drive, this is your option.</p>, <p>The formula is simple: Add 1 foot of  length to the Golf hatchback's cargo area and get 24 percent more space in  return. In real numbers, that means 66.5 cubic feet of space to carry stuff  with the rear seats folded. That's the kind of space usually afforded by  compact SUVs and crossovers. Add a powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine,  a low-key and ergonomically friendly interior, and traditional Volkswagen  comfort, and the Alltrack makes an excellent choice for the crossover-averse or  anyone who just prefers the sleeker wagon look.</p>, <p>Despite the name and rugged style, and  even the presence of an Off-Road drive mode, the Alltrack isn't a true  adventure machine built to take you far off the highway. It sits a little  higher off the ground than the Golf Sportwagen on which it's based, enough to  handle modest trails, but there are better choices — the Subaru  Outback, for example — if your needs include backcountry exploration.  But for overall comfort and utility without the traditional bulk or height of a  crossover, the Alltrack is a winner. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volkswagen Golf Alltrack comes  in three trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>SEL</strong>. The base S is pretty well-equipped and offers most all you  need for an active lifestyle car, including roof rails, heated seats and side  mirrors, a rearview camera, Bluetooth and smartphone integration. Stepping up  to the SE brings a big sunroof, keyless entry and ignition, and a better sound  system, while the SEL<strong> </strong>dials it up  with nicer wheels, power seats and a navigation system. </p>]

[<p>All  Golf Alltracks are powered by a turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine  (170 horsepower, 199 pound-feet torque) and come with all-wheel drive. The S  and SE come standard with a six-speed manual transmission (note that engine  torque is limited to 184 lb-ft here) and have a six-speed dual-clutch automatic  transmission (dubbed DSG in Volkswagen-speak) as an option. The automatic comes  standard on SEL. </p>, <p>Standard  features on the <strong>S</strong> include 17-inch  alloy wheels, automatic headlights, foglights, LED daytime running lights,  heated side mirrors, roof rails, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, simulated  leather upholstery, heated front seats with manual adjustment and power  recline, 60/40-split folding rear seats with a center pass-through, and ambient  cabin lighting. </p>, <p>Also  standard are a rearview camera, a 6.5-inch touchscreen infotainment display,  Bluetooth, VW's Car-Net communications, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  smartphone integration. The base audio system includes eight speakers, a CD  player, satellite and HD radio, and auxiliary audio, USB and SD card inputs. </p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>SE </strong>adds automatic wipers,  heated windshield washer nozzles, a panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and  ignition, a 115-volt outlet in the cargo area, and an updated infotainment  system with 8-inch touchscreen interface. Driver aids include forward collision  warning and automatic emergency braking. </p>, <p>The  top-level <strong>SEL </strong>builds on the SE  features with 18-inch alloy wheels, front and rear parking sensors, dual-zone  automatic climate control, a power-adjustable driver's seat, a navigation  system, and a Fender premium audio system, which adds a subwoofer and upgraded  sound. New for 2018 is a full complement of standard driver aids, including  adaptive cruise control, adaptive headlights that bend in the direction of the  car's turn, automatic high beams, lane departure warning and an automatic  parking system. </p>, <p>Blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is optional for the SE and the SEL,  but with delayed availability from VW.</p>]

[<p>One  drive in a 2018 Volkswagen Golf GTI and you'll understand why this model has  become something of an icon since its American debut in 1983. Like the standard  Golf on which it is based, the Golf GTI offers plenty of practicality and  interior materials that feel as if they were pulled from a more expensive  German car.</p>, <p>But  where the Golf emphasizes fuel economy and a competitive price, the GTI  ratchets up the excitement with a punchy engine, a quick-shifting automatic  transmission and stylish upholstery. As befits a performance car, the GTI sits  a little lower and rides a little stiffer than the regular Golf, which degrades  ride quality somewhat. The payoff, however, is heroic stability and grip in  turns.</p>, <p>The  GTI isn't the only choice among the so-called hot hatches; Ford, Mini and  Subaru also make convincing alternatives. The GTI isn't even VW's  top-performing hatch. For that, there's the much more hardcore (and expensive)  Golf R. But for drivers who prize fun and practicality, the GTI checks all the  right boxes. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volkswagen Golf GTI is a  four-door hatchback that seats five. It's available in three trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>Autobahn</strong>. The <strong>S</strong> comes well-equipped for a base model  (automatic headlights, heated front seats, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay/Android  Auto), but lacks some more common features and conveniences. The <strong>SE</strong> fills in the gaps with amenities  such as a sunroof, driver aids and upgraded entertainment. The <strong>Autobahn</strong> doesn't equip the GTI for life  on the famous German superhighway, but it does make life notably more  comfortable for the driver with leather upholstery, a premium sound system, and  even a self-parking system. </p>]

[<p>All GTI models are front-wheel-drive and  use a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (220 horsepower, 258  pound-feet of torque) paired with a six-speed manual or a six-speed dual-clutch  automatic transmission. </p>, <p>For  a base trim, the <strong>S </strong>comes with some  nice features, including 18-inch alloy wheels, high-performance tires, LED  foglights, heated mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, cloth upholstery, heated front  seats, ambient interior lighting, and a 60/40-split folding rear seats with a  center pass-through. Technology features include a 6.5-inch touchscreen  display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone  integration, and an eight-speaker sound system. </p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>SE</strong>, our recommended trim,  adds upgraded brakes (same as those on the Golf R), a limited-slip  differential, LED headlights, a sunroof, keyless entry, push-button ignition,  an 8-inch touchscreen display, an eight-speaker sound system with CD player,  satellite radio, and VW Car-Net Security and Service connected services. It  also gets driver assistance features that include forward collision warning,  automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert. </p>, <p>Leather  upholstery is the only option for SE models. It is, in fact, the only option  available for the whole 2018 GTI lineup. </p>, <p>Finally,  the <strong>Autobahn</strong> trim adds an adaptive  suspension, automatic high beams, a power-adjustable driver seat, a navigation  system, and a subwoofer-enhanced Fender sound system. The Autobahn also  showcases Volkswagen's most current driver assistance and safety features,  including adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, front and rear parking  sensors with Maneuver Braking (automatically applies the brakes if a collision  with nearby objects while parking seems likely), a self-parking system (Park  Assist), and a lane departure warning/lane keeping assist system. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Volkswagen GTI </strong>(turbo 2.0L  inline-4 | 6-speed dual-clutch automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Golf GTI has received some  revisions, including new infotainment systems, the addition of driver  assistance features, and more standard horsepower for 2018. Our findings remain  broadly applicable to this year's Golf GTI, however. </p>]

[<p>With an abundance of power, sporty handling and all-wheel-drive stability, the  2018 Volkswagen Golf R is a wildly entertaining car that will boost your pulse  rate. It's a star member of the hot-hatch club, which is fitting since VW  practically invented the hot hatch with its original 1983 GTI. This newest R  version packs 292 horsepower and improved handling and braking capability  compared to a 2018 GTI. Naturally, it also boasts a comfortable interior and  inherent hatchback versatility. </p>, <p>For  2018, the Golf R carries over largely unchanged, but with a few important  tweaks. There are new LED headlights, taillights and daytime running lights.  The new headlights are adaptive, meaning they swivel in the direction of turns.  There's a new 19-inch wheel design, an 8-inch touchscreen display, a  customizable gauge cluster display, pedestrian detection built into the forward  collision warning system, and VW's new six-year/72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper  transferable warranty. </p>, <p>Perhaps  most important is the availability of a new seven-speed dual-clutch automatic  transmission to accompany the six-speed manual transmission. A boon to the  performance enthusiast who loves the feeling of a manual transmission but faces  the reality of bumper-to-bumper commutes, the new automatic also achieves  slightly better fuel economy than the manual. </p>, <p>The  only real knock on the Golf R — and it's a big one  — is its lofty price tag. It's a hefty premium over the GTI,  which isn't quite as capable but is a blast to drive. You're also in V8-powered  muscle-car territory. Yet the Golf R is a top pick for any pragmatic  performance enthusiast who wants outstanding performance, impressive utility,  and a generous set of features.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volkswagen Golf R is the hot-rod edition of the Golf and GTI hatchbacks.  The four-door Golf R seats five and comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged  four-cylinder engine (292 horsepower, 280 pound-feet of torque). Power is sent  to all four wheels through either a standard six-speed manual transmission or  an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (called DSG).</p>]

[<p>Standard  features include 19-inch wheels with performance tires, an adaptive suspension,  adaptive LED headlights, heated mirrors, a rear spoiler, keyless entry,  push-button ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery,  a power-adjustable driver's seat and heated front seats. On the tech front, the  R comes with VW Car-Net communications, Bluetooth, a navigation system, a  digital gauge cluster, an 8-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, and an  eight-speaker Fender audio system with a CD player and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Advanced  safety and driver aids include front and rear parking sensors, forward  collision warning and mitigation, pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert, a lane departure warning system, automatic high  beams, and adaptive cruise control.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar.

[<p>Are you in the market for something very practical but not interested in a  compact SUV? The Golf SportWagen might be just what you're looking for. It  combines the high levels of fit and finish and excellent road manners found in  the standard Golf but with considerably more cargo space.</p>, <p>VW turned the already practical Golf into  an even more practical wagon by adding an extra foot of length to the cargo  area, resulting in 66.5 cubic feet of space with the seats down (up from the  standard Golf's 53.7 cubic feet). That's similar to what a lot of compact SUVs  can hold. The Golf SportWagen also boasts a smooth and efficient turbocharged  engine and an upscale interior. You can even get it with all-wheel drive, which  is a useful option if you frequently drive in inclement weather.</p>, <p>On the downside, you don't quite get that  elevated driving position like you do with an SUV, and the best small SUVs (the  Honda CR-V, for example) ultimately have more backseat space and cargo room.  Overall, though, we think the 2018 Golf SportWagen is a great alternative to  more mainstream offerings.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen comes  in four trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>S with 4Motion</strong>, <strong>SE</strong> and <strong>SEL</strong>. The base S  comes nicely equipped and offers most of what you need and comes in a 4Motion  version with all-wheel drive. The SE and the SEL add more convenience, luxury  and safety features. </p>]

[<p>All trim levels are powered by a  1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 170 horsepower and  199 pound-feet of torque (automatic transmission) or 184 lb-ft (manual  transmission).</p>, <p>On the S, you can get either a six-speed  automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission. Front-wheel drive  is standard. All-wheel drive, which VW calls 4Motion, is optional for the S  trim level and comes with either a six-speed manual or a different automatic  transmission, a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox called DSG in  Volkswagen-speak. The SE and SEL have the regular six-speed auto as standard.</p>, <p>Standard  feature highlights for the <strong>S</strong> include  15-inch alloy wheels, heated side mirrors, roof rails, a leather-trimmed  steering wheel, front seats with partial power adjustment, 60/40-split folding  rear seats with a center pass-through and a 115-volt outlet in the cargo area.</p>, <p>Also  standard are a rearview camera, a 6.5-inch touchscreen infotainment display,  Bluetooth, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and VW's Car-Net App-Connect and  Car-Net Security &amp; Service connectivity systems. The base audio system  includes eight speakers, a CD player, satellite and HD radio, and auxiliary  audio, USB and SD card inputs. </p>, <p>The <strong>S with 4Motion</strong> trim is the same but  has 16-inch wheels and heated front seats.</p>, <p>Moving  up to the <strong>SE </strong>gets you 16-inch  wheels, a panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and push-button ignition, simulated  leather upholstery, an 8-inch infotainment touchscreen, blind-spot monitoring,  rear traffic alert and forward collision warning with automatic emergency  braking.</p>, <p>The  top-level <strong>SEL </strong>builds on SE features  with 17-inch alloy wheels, silver roof rails, automatic dual-zone climate  control and a 12-way power-adjustable driver's seat. The SEL also includes  navigation and a powerful Fender audio system as well as adaptive cruise  control. </p>]

[<p>In previous generations, the Volkswagen  Jetta delivered a decidedly European driving experience and had refinement in  spades. In its current iteration, the 2018 Jetta is all about size — a large cabin and trunk are its standout features. Refinement and fun are  nowhere to be found. It's as if Volkswagen finally caved and traded the Jetta's  uniquely Germanic values for generic attributes in the search for mass-market  appeal.</p>, <p>Certainly, having a lot of interior space  is a good thing. And the Jetta boasts a couple of turbocharged engines that  provide strong acceleration and agreeable fuel economy. But your choices for a  small sedan are varied, and many of them surpass the Jetta in terms of style,  handling and features.</p>, <p>It's likely that Volkswagen will completely  overhaul the Jetta for the 2019 model year. In the meantime, might we suggest  taking a look at models such as the Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Mazda 3?  Volkswagen's Golf hatchback is a more desirable choice as well.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Jetta is available in six trim levels — <strong>S</strong>, <strong>Wolfsburg Edition</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SE Sport</strong>, <strong>SEL</strong> and <strong>GLI</strong>. All Jettas are four-door sedans  that seat five occupants, and all are offered exclusively with front-wheel  drive. The trim levels are differentiated mainly by engine and feature content. </p>]

[<p>The base S model is pretty sparse. It has 16-inch aluminum wheels, cloth  upholstery, manual seats, heated side mirrors, a height-adjustable driver seat,  a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 60/40-split rear seats, a rearview  camera, and a four-speaker sound system with a 5-inch touchscreen interface, a  CD player, a USB port, and an auxiliary audio jack. An optional Cold Weather  package adds heated front seats and windshield washer nozzles; this package is  standard on every other trim level. </p>, <p>A 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (150 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque) is  the only engine available in S, Wolfsburg Edition and SE trims. All three of  those trims have a standard five-speed manual or an optional six-speed  automatic transmission.</p>, <p>New for 2018 is the Wolfsburg Edition trim, which is largely similar to the S  trim save for a few additional features. It adds foglights, simulated leather  upholstery and driver lumbar, heated front seats, a backseat pass-through, and  a leather-wrapped transmission selector knob and parking brake cover. </p>, <p>SE models add a few goodies, including a sunroof, color-keyed mirrors and  chrome side window trim, blind-spot monitoring, keyless ignition and entry, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a 6.3-inch touchscreen, and Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration. </p>, <p>The SE Sport model is like an SE with more power. SE Sport models come with a  1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (170 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque) and a  six-speed automatic. A trunklid spoiler, 17-inch wheels, gloss black cabin  trim, and a black headliner and roof are part of the deal.</p>, <p>SEL models share their engine and transmission with the SE Sport and add a few  creature comforts such as automatic headlights, automatic wipers, a  power-adjustable driver seat, navigation, a premium Fender sound system,  dual-zone automatic climate control, and a cooled glovebox. Adaptive cruise  control and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking are also  included.</p>, <p>The GLI trim is where things get zesty. It gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (210 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque), a six-speed, dual-clutch  automatic transmission, larger brakes, 18-inch wheels, and unique body and  cabin trimmings. Standard equipment includes sport seats, a unique steering  wheel with shift paddles, parking alerts and a self-dimming mirror. Adaptive  cruise control and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking  are two notable deletions, however.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar.

[<p>If  the 2018 Volkswagen Passat looks exceedingly familiar, that's likely because  it's soldiered on with the same look since the current generation debuted six  years ago. That's a long time without a significant, or even subtle, update,  and most rival sedans have been redesigned during that time. But that's also a  testament to all that the Passat gets right: reserved but timeless style to  match its practical personality. </p>, <p>The  Passat isn't the go-to sedan if you're seeking flash and flair, but its roomy  cabin, large and useful shape of its trunk, and easy-to-drive nature make it an  excellent family shuttle, a car for around-town driving with friends or  colleagues, or long-distance road tripping in quiet comfort. And with six trim  levels, two available engines, and a solid set of features spread throughout  the lineup, there's a Passat right for all budgets. </p>, <p>For  2018, the Passat introduces an upgraded four-cylinder engine. The larger  2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (174 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of torque)  gains 4 hp and more miles of improved fuel economy, now 29 combined mpg (25  city/36 highway). This is still just average mpg for a midsize sedan, but what  the Passat lacks in fuel efficiency, it makes up for with lively performance  and pickup. The last four-cylinder we tested sprinted from 0 to 60 mph in 7.7  seconds, quick enough to make the optional V6 engine just that: optional. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volkswagen Passat comes in six trim levels: <strong>S</strong>, <strong>R-Line</strong>, <strong>SE</strong>, <strong>SE with Technology</strong>, <strong>GT</strong>,  and <strong>SEL Premium</strong>. </p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>S</strong> starts with a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (174 horsepower, 184 pound-feet of torque) and a  six-speed automatic transmission. Standard features include 16-inch alloy  wheels, automatic headlights, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate  control, a power-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats,  Bluetooth, a 5-inch touchscreen,<strong> </strong>and  a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, one USB port and an auxiliary  audio jack. The optional Driver Assistance package adds blind-spot monitoring,  rear cross-traffic alert, and forward collision warning with automatic  emergency braking.</p>, <p>The <strong>R-Line</strong> adds 19-inch alloy wheels<strong>, </strong>heated side mirrors, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel (with shift paddles), heated front seats,  simulated leather upholstery, a 6.3-inch touchscreen, HD and satellite radio,  VW's Car-Net smartphone integration (includes Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and  MirrorLink), and unique R-Line styling elements. The S trim's optional driver  aids are included, along with adaptive cruise control. An optional R-Line  Lighting package adds LED headlights and taillights. </p>, <p>The <strong>SE </strong>builds on the R-Line features  (minus R-specific styling and the large wheels) and further adds 17-inch  wheels, adaptive cruise control, a sunroof, keyless entry and ignition, a  sliding front armrest, rear air vents and added Car-Net functionality. </p>, <p>The  SE's optional <strong>Technology</strong> package  gets you 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, foglights, automatic  wipers, a hands-free trunk opener with foot sensor, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, front and rear parking sensors, remote ignition, heated rear seats,<strong> </strong>a navigation system, an eight-speaker  sound system, and an upgraded version of Car-Net. LED headlights and taillights  are optional on the SE. </p>, <p>The  new <strong>GT</strong> trim (delayed availability)  is a mashup of R-Line and SE trims, with 19-inch wheels, sport-tuned  suspension, sport front seats, and two-tone simulated leather upholstery among  its distinguishing features. Powered by a 3.6-liter V6 engine (280 hp, 258 lb-ft  of torque) and paired to a six-speed automatic transmission, think of the GT as  a Passat interpretation of the Jetta GLI. </p>, <p>The  top-trim <strong>SEL Premium </strong>bundles nearly  all features from the lower trims with 18-inch wheels, power-folding mirrors, a  power-adjustable passenger seat, driver-seat memory settings, leather  upholstery, automatic wipers, a premium Fender audio system, a separate ski  pass-through for the 60/40-split rear seats, an automated parallel-parking  feature, and a lane departure warning system. The four-cylinder engine comes  standard, and the V6 is optional.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar.

[<p>With the 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, it looks  like the German automaker is finally ready to offer a small crossover SUV that  many Americans will want. Though entertaining to drive, the previous generation  Tiguan fell short of the competition because of its small cargo space, mediocre  fuel economy and, more recently, a lack of now common driver safety aids such  as blind-spot monitoring and forward collision warning. The Tiguan's premium  price didn't help its case either. </p>, <p>For 2018, however, the Tiguan is  thoroughly overhauled.

[<p>With the 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, it looks  like the German automaker is finally ready to offer a small crossover SUV that  many Americans will want. Though entertaining to drive, the previous generation  Tiguan fell short of the competition because of its small cargo space, mediocre  fuel economy and, more recently, a lack of now common driver safety aids such  as blind-spot monitoring and forward collision warning. The Tiguan's premium  price didn't help its case either. </p>, <p>For 2018, however, the Tiguan is  thoroughly overhauled. It rides atop a new platform that underpins Volkswagen  models ranging from the compact Golf hatchback to the new three-row Atlas SUV.  This Tiguan even shares its new muscular shape and style with the Atlas. It's  also 10 inches longer than its predecessor, which VW uses for more cargo space,  more legroom, and an optional third-row seat that's small but handy if you need  to cart around a couple of extra kids. </p>, <p>Some of the Tiguan's traditional strengths  carry over, including a quiet and comfortable ride, top-notch cabin materials,  and a user-friendly tech interface that's now even easier and quicker to use.

[<p>After  nearly a decade on the market, it would be easy for the 2018 Volvo S60 to look  dated compared to its luxury-sedan rivals, but it's quite the opposite. Its  looks are still classy, and all of the modern safety equipment you'd expect from  Volvo is helping to keep this four-door Scandinavian competitor relevant. </p>, <p>Under  the hood, the S60 is available with two four-cylinder engines, one that is  turbocharged, the other turbocharged and supercharged. Front- and all-wheel  drive are both available, and the multiple safety features offered give the S60  a range of modern technology. The handling has varying levels of sportiness  depending on the trim level, and the ride is definitely a luxury-level quality.  Interior trimmings, as unfamiliar as they may seem to owners coming from other  brands, are upscale and pleasing to the touch. And while legroom is limited on  the standard S60, there's an available extended-wheelbase model called the  Inscription that adds about 3 inches of rear legroom. Essentially, the 2018  Volvo S60 has all the bases covered. Despite its age, it's a well-rounded sedan  that has a lot going for it. We recommend taking one out for a test drive. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volvo S60 is available in four different trim levels. The two  standard-wheelbase offerings are the <strong>T5 Dynamic</strong> and <strong>T6 AWD R-Design Platinum</strong>,  and the long-wheelbase trim levels are the <strong>T5 Inscription</strong> and <strong>T5 Inscription Platinum</strong>.  The T5 Dynamic comes with items such as power seats and Volvo's Sensus  smartphone app integration. Work your way up to the Inscription or Inscription  Platinum and you'll get the longer wheelbase, an upgraded sound system and a  slew of safety features. The T6 AWD R-Design is the sportiest and most powerful  S60. </p>]

[<p>The  T5 Dynamic and T5 Inscription are equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine (240 hp, 258 lb-ft) and an eight-speed automatic  transmission. The T6 AWD R-Design uses a turbocharged and supercharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (302 hp, 295 lb-ft). </p>, <p>Front-wheel  drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is an option on all trim levels, except  on the T6 AWD R-Design, which comes only with AWD. Every S60 uses the same  eight-speed automatic transmission. </p>, <p>The  base <strong>T5 Dynamic</strong> comes relatively  well-equipped with 18-inch wheels, a sunroof, xenon headlights, LED running  lights, headlight washers, heated mirrors, automatic climate control, leather  seats, an eight-way power-adjustable driver seat (with lumbar adjustment),  driver-seat memory settings, power-folding rear headrests, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and a 60/40-split folding rear seat.  Standard technology features include a low-speed forward collision warning and  mitigation system, a 7-inch display screen, Volvo's Sensus smartphone app  integration, Wi-Fi capability, Bluetooth, voice commands, and an eight-speaker  sound system with satellite radio and a USB interface.</p>, <p>The  midlevel <strong>T5 Inscription</strong> gets the  longer wheelbase (which increases rear legroom by 3 inches), side rear window  sunshades, a power rear window sunshade, a rearview camera, rear parking  sensors, a power front passenger seat, a configurable instrument display and an  auto-dimming rearview mirror, a multi-filter cabin air filtration system and  additional sound-deadening material.</p>, <p>The <strong>Inscription Platinum</strong> adds a  12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, turn-adapting headlights, revised seats,  wood interior trim, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and Volvo's Convenience  and Technology packages (explained below). </p>, <p>At  the top of the ladder, there's the <strong>T6  AWD R-Design Platinum</strong>,<strong> </strong>which has  all the Inscription Platinum features plus the more powerful engine, all-wheel  drive, 19-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, special exterior and interior  trim, navigation, sport front seats, adjustable steering effort and paddle  shifters.</p>, <p>Available  on all S60 Inscription models and standard on Platinum models, the Convenience  package adds power-folding mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, and a  grocery-bag holder. The <strong>Technology  package </strong>features adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlight  control, a more advanced forward collision warning and mitigation system, and a  lane departure warning and intervention system.\</p>, <p>Volvo's  optional <strong>Climate package</strong>, available  on all S60s except the Dynamic trim level, includes a heated windshield, heated  windshield washers, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel and an  active cabin air filter. The <strong>Sport  package</strong> (T5 Dynamic only) includes 19-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned  suspension, adjustable steering effort and paddle shifters. Also available is  the <strong>Vision package</strong>, which features  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, front and rear park sensors,  and keyless entry and ignition.</p>, <p>Other  notable options are an automatic parking assistance system and a rear-seat  entertainment system with dual displays.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2015 Volvo S60 T6 AWD Drive-E</strong> (turbo  and supercharged 2.0L inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | FWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Volvo S60 has received some minor  trim-level revisions. Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's  model, however.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 S60 Cross Country is Volvo's  unusual cut-and-paste creation. The company has taken the elevated ride height,  body cladding and all-wheel-drive system of its V60 wagon sibling and applied  it to its S60 sedan. It's definitely an oddball vehicle with limited appeal.  But it's also uniquely cool. </p>, <p>The Cross Country comes fully loaded in  one trim level and with only one engine choice: Volvo's punchy and reasonably  efficient turbocharged 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder. There's also only one  exterior color available (gray) and interior color scheme. That reduces  production complexity and makes the S60 CC financially viable for Volvo, though  it also obviously reduces customer choice and overall appeal. </p>, <p>So, too, does the fact that neither the  S60 sedan nor the V60 Cross Country is close to being class leaders. The S60 is  now in its ninth year since a full redesign, which is an eternity in car terms,  especially in the luxury segment. There have been two different Audi A4s in that  time period. As such, other luxury sedans and raised wagons should in theory be  more appealing. But then again, there is literally no other raised crossover  luxury sedan available. So if that's your thing, this is without question the  car for you. </p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volvo S60 Cross Country sedan  comes with the extra ride height, body cladding and standard all-wheel drive of  Volvo's mechanically related V60 Cross Country wagon. Unlike that model and the  regular S60, however, the S60 Cross Country has only one trim level and  powertrain available. The latter consists of a 2.0-liter turbocharged  four-cylinder engine (240 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed  automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. </p>]

[<p>Standard equipment includes 18-inch  wheels, a skid plate, forward collision warning with automatic braking,  adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and intervention, adaptive  xenon headlamps, automatic high beams, hill descent control, power-folding  mirrors, automatic wipers, rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, and keyless  ignition and entry. </p>, <p>Inside the cabin you'll find automatic  dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, a  digital gauge cluster, a 7-inch infotainment display with dash-mounted  controller, a navigation system, Bluetooth, one USB port and a 12-speaker  Harman Kardon sound system.</p>, <p>Blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert systems are bundled together as an option. Heated front  seats and a heated steering wheel can be bundled together. They can also be had  with the Climate package, which also adds heated rear seats, an air purifying  system and heated windshield washer nozzles. Stand-alone options include  19-inch wheels, a rear spoiler, and wood or piano black interior trim. </p>]

[<p>Scandinavian design is known for its simplicity and  functionality, and as the sole Swedish carmaker selling road-legal cars in the  U.S., Volvo puts this aesthetic front and center with the 2018 S90 sedan. From  the outside, there's a stately heft that used to be the domain of German car  companies. This year, that heft is further emphasized as the car is 4.5 inches  longer than the previous year. On the inside, it's elegantly simple, with  impeccable materials and an undeniable air of luxury.</p>, <p>The S90 also rides high on Volvo's reputation for  safety and comes with all of the latest advanced features found in other cars,  as well as a few that are unique to the brand. The sedan's appeal is further  bolstered by some of the most comfortable seats in the industry and a large,  ultra-modern central touchscreen that reminds us of the massive screen in Tesla  vehicles. </p>, <p>Pricewise, the 2018 Volvo S90 is in lockstep with  midsize luxury sedans that include the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz  E-Class. The S90 is quite a bit larger, however, approaching the dimensions of  those competing companies' flagship sedans, so it could be argued that you're  getting quite a bit more for your money. </p>]

[<p>The 2018  Volvo S90 is a large luxury sedan that is offered in either <strong>Momentum</strong> or <strong>Inscription</strong> trim levels with a choice of three powerplants. The <strong>T5</strong> models are powered by a turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (250 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque)  paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the front  wheels. The <strong>T6</strong> is both supercharged  and turbocharged (316 hp, 295 lb-ft) and comes standard with all-wheel drive.  The plug-in hybrid <strong>T8</strong> adds an 87-hp  electric motor to the T6 engine for a combined output of 400 hp, 472 lb-ft.</p>]

[<p>Standard  features for the <strong>T5 Momentum</strong> include  18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights with automatic high beams, LED foglights  with corner illumination, a panoramic sunroof, rear parking sensors, keyless  entry and ignition, selectable drive modes, leather upholstery, wood interior  trim, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, 10-way power-adjustable front seats with  driver seat memory functions and power-folding rear headrests.</p>, <p>On the  technology front, you also get Volvo On-Call remote feature control via a  smartphone app, an 8-inch virtual instrument panel, a 9-inch touchscreen with  Volvo's Sensus infotainment system, a rearview camera, a navigation system, and  a 10-speaker audio system with USB/auxiliary input, satellite radio and Apple  CarPlay/Android Auto.</p>, <p>Standard  advanced safety features include forward collision warning and mitigation with  pedestrian animal and cyclist detection, the Pilot Assist semiautonomous  driving system, a blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, Run-off  Road mitigation and protection, Oncoming Lane Mitigation, a drowsy driver alert  system, and a traffic sign reader. The <strong>T6  Momentum</strong> adds heated front seats and a 12-inch virtual instrument panel.</p>, <p>The <strong>T6 Inscription</strong> trim extends the  features list with 19-inch wheels, adaptive headlights, headlight washers,  four-zone automatic climate control, a cooled glovebox, interior ambient  lighting, upgraded wood interior trim, premium leather upholstery, leather  coverings on the dash and door panels, ventilated front seats, power-adjustable  front-seat side bolsters and thigh extensions, and power sunshades for rear  windows. <strong>T8</strong> models add a crystal  shift knob.</p>, <p>The  optional Convenience package is offered for all trims and includes front  parking sensors, an automated parallel and perpendicular parking system, heated  washer nozzles, a power trunklid, a surround-view camera system, a universal  garage door opener and a 12-volt power outlet. Stand-alone options include an  air-ride suspension, a head-up display, a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio  system and a heated steering wheel. The Inscription trim is eligible for  20-inch wheels and the Luxury package (massaging front seats, heated rear  outboard seats, ventilated rear seats, an upgraded rear-seat center armrest,  additional leather coverings and a suede headliner). </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the <strong>2017 Volvo S90 T6 Inscription Sedan</strong> (2.0L inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | AWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Volvo S90 has received some  revisions, including the switch to a longer-wheelbase version.

[<p>Volvo  has a history of making cool wagons and remains dedicated to them. A great  example is the 2018 Volvo V60. This compact wagon shares its engines, general  exterior dimensions and interior design with the company's S60 sedan but gives  you greater interior cargo space. Aside from that, the same premium qualities  of the sedan, including its comfortable seats and ride comfort, are all there  in the wagon. </p>, <p>An  all-wheel-drive powertrain is available to provide extra traction in inclement  weather. It's also useful for putting the power down in the T6 R-Design trim,  which cranks out a stout 302 horsepower. Regardless of trim, all V60s feature  40/20/40-split folding seatbacks with optional integrated child booster seats.  Also available is Volvo's Technology package, which includes safety features  such as Queue Assist and Distance Alert. </p>, <p>While  these features might draw you in, just be aware of the V60's compact size. It  could be a deal-breaker if you haul gear more frequently than people. While it  has more cargo space than the S60 sedan, the V60 is still outmatched by most  other luxury crossover SUVs. Also, the rear seating is a bit tight, and adults  won't want to be back there for too long. </p>, <p>Overall,  though, we like the V60. For shoppers looking for a stylish wagon, or just  something different than the luxury crossover norm, it's definitely worth  checking out. </p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volvo V60 is a five-seat luxury wagon available in multiple trims. The<strong> T5 Dynamic</strong> is the base model, and it  comes with leather seats, a turbocharged engine, and either front- or all-wheel  drive. Upping the power, the <strong>T6 R-Design</strong> features all-wheel drive, a sport suspension, and specific interior and  exterior trim pieces. </p>]

[<p>The <strong>T5 Dynamic </strong>is powered by a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (240 hp, 258 lb-ft) and sends power  to either the front or all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic  transmission. The T5 comes standard with 18-inch wheels, a sunroof, xenon  headlights, leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat  memory settings, and 40/20/40-split folding rear seats. Also standard is  Volvo's Sensus Connect infotainment system that includes a 7-inch central  display screen, Bluetooth, voice controls, a USB port, and an eight-speaker  audio system with a CD player and satellite and HD radio.</p>, <p>A  few option packages are available to augment the V60's set of features. The  Vision package comes with keyless ignition and entry, blind-spot monitoring  with rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, and a  digital gauge cluster display. Adding the Technology package nets you adaptive  cruise control, automatic wipers, lane keeping assist, forward collision  warning and mitigation, automatic high beams and a driver drowsiness monitor.</p>, <p>An  available Climate package adds heated windshield wiper nozzles, a heated  steering wheel, front and rear seats, and an interior air quality monitoring  system. This package also includes integrated rear booster seats. There's also  a package that gets you a navigation system and a premium Harman Kardon sound  system and a Sport package (includes 19-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension,  steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, and adjustable modes for the steering).</p>, <p>The <strong>T6 R-Design </strong>comes with a more  powerful turbo- and supercharged 2.0-liter engine (302 hp, 295 lb-ft) and  standard all-wheel drive. It includes most of the T5's option packages, such as  the Sport package, navigation and Harman Kardon system, and Technology and  Vision packages. The T6 also features R-Design-specific outer trim such as  grille, rear fascia, and silver window surrounds and roof rails.</p>, <p>Due  to the T6's large standard features list, the only options a buyer needs to  consider are the Climate package, integrated rear booster seats, blind-spot  monitoring, and front and rear park assist. </p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the <strong>2015 Volvo V60 T5 Drive-E Wagon </strong>(turbo  2.0L inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | FWD).</p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current Volvo V60 has received some  revisions, including a shuffling of options and trim packages.

[<p>The  2018 Volvo V60 Cross Country fits into a niche occupied by a small group of  vehicles such as the Audi A4 Allroad, Subaru Outback and Volkswagen Golf  Alltrack: It's a do-it-all wagon. These models start out as standard wagons,  but then the automakers give them increased ground clearance and standard  all-wheel drive to enhance their capability when the pavement ends.</p>, <p>The  V60 Cross Country has the same stylish interior as the V60 but comes with  unpainted wheel arch extensions and some body protection pieces to help  minimize scuffs and nicks from kicked-up rocks and branches. The V60 Cross  Country is no rock crawler, but the increased ground clearance and all-wheel  drive should help you in situations such as getting to a remote campsite or  just dealing with an unplowed driveway.</p>, <p>Just  as with the V60 wagon, though, the Cross Country's rear cargo and passenger  space are lacking. Most full-size adults won't want to spend too much time back  there. Also, the Cross Country doesn't handle as well as the regular V60.  Still, if you want a luxury wagon and require more ground clearance, the V60  Cross Country is a solid choice.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volvo V60 Cross Country is a five-seat wagon based on the V60 wagon. There  are two trims available: <strong>T5 </strong>and <strong>T5 Platinum</strong>.<strong> </strong>Both have a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (240 hp, 258 lb-ft of  torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>Standard equipment on the <strong>T5 </strong>includes 18-inch wheels, automatic  headlights, LED running lights, hill descent control, rear parking sensors, a  sunroof, power-folding heated mirrors, roof rails, rear privacy glass, front  and rear skid plates, dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable  front seats, driver-seat memory settings, leather upholstery, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a 40/20/40-split rear seat with  power-folding headrests, and a built-in cargo cover/dog safety divider. </p>, <p>Tech features include Bluetooth, Volvo On Call emergency services, the Volvo  Sensus infotainment interface with a 7-inch display, Sensus Connect smartphone  apps, a navigation system, and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player,  a USB audio interface and satellite radio. </p>, <p>The Convenience package adds a rearview camera and keyless ignition and entry.  The Technology package includes adaptive cruise control and a variety of  accident avoidance and driver alert technologies (e.g., forward collision  warning and mitigation as well as lane departure warning). </p>, <p>The <strong>V60 Cross Country Platinum T5 </strong>models  include the Convenience and Technology packages and add adaptive xenon  headlights with washers, auto-dimming mirrors and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon  sound system. </p>, <p>A few other options are available for both trims. The BLIS package comes with a  blind-spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alert and front parking  sensors. The Climate package adds an interior air-quality system and a  multitude of heated items, including the front and rear seats, steering wheel,  windshield and windshield washer nozzles. Integrated child booster seats come  with the Climate package and can also be picked as a stand-alone option.</p>]

[<p>Volvo's wagon-rich history is on display with the  2018 V90, but those expecting a classic Volvo wagon experience may be in for a  shock. The V90, like the related S90 sedan and XC90 SUV, is steeped in tech and  style. If you're a wagon enthusiast, this new midsize luxury wagon is something  you're going to lust after. </p>, <p>Based on exterior dimensions, the new V90 is very  similar to the Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon. But the V90's exterior styling  makes it look decidedly longer and sleeker than the E-Class. Inside, the V90  shares the same design and materials philosophy as the S90, with a large,  centrally located touchscreen display, attractive wood and leather materials  for the Inscription models, and carbon fiber and aluminum for the R-Design.  Ergonomics are great for long-distance driving, and Volvo offers fold-down  booster seats for the outer two rear-seat positions to help your young ones  transition from child safety seats to regular seats.</p>, <p>It's true that a crossover SUV will likely make more  sense from a practical standpoint. But here's the alternative if the idea of  driving around in a glorified box doesn't appeal to your visual senses. The V90  also provides a measure of exclusivity without compromising too much on  real-world use. If these attributes appeal to you, the 2018 Volvo V90 will be a  great choice.</p>]

[<p>All 2018  Volvo V90s come very well equipped, so you're basically paying for powertrains.  The <strong>R-Design T5 </strong>and <strong>Inscription T5</strong> start the lineup off  with the lowest power and front-wheel drive. Some may find the T5 underpowered  especially when fully loaded. The <strong>R-Design  T6 </strong>and <strong>Inscription T6</strong> provide  more power and all-wheel drive that better matches the suspension and chassis.  There's also a V90 Cross Country that features increased ground clearance and  all-wheel drive and the engine found in the T6. It's <a href="/volvo/v90-cross-country/2017/wagon/review/">reviewed here</a>.</p>]

[<p>The Volvo <strong>R-Design T5 </strong>and <strong>Inscription T5</strong> are equipped to nearly the same level and differ in  interior materials, seat designs and colors. They both are powered by a  2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (250 hp, 258 lb-ft) driving only  the front wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Inscription  comes standard with heated and ventilated Comfort seats, leather upholstery,  and its own exterior and interior visual trim package. The R-Design features a  unique sport suspension calibration, comes standard with paddle shifters, and  gets sport seats and R-Design specific interior and exterior trim, such as  front and rear fascias, wheels and roof rails. </p>, <p>They both  come standard with navigation, a panoramic roof and loads of safety tech such  as blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, emergency braking and lane  keeping assist. Optionally, you can add a Convenience package, which includes a  top-down camera system, heated washer nozzles, a flip-up partition in the trunk  area that holds grocery bags, and an automated parallel or perpendicular  parking system. </p>, <p>The <strong>R-Design T6 </strong>and <strong>Inscription T6 </strong>are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine  that's both turbocharged and supercharged. At maximum power, it produces a  stronger 316 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. And unlike the T5, the T6 comes with  all-wheel drive. Otherwise when it comes to the interior and exterior, the T5 and T6 are essentially the same.</p>]

[<p>Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our First Drive of the <strong>2017 Volvo S90 T6 Inscription Sedan </strong>(turbo  and supercharged 2.0L inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>Note: The  S90 and V90 share identical powertrains and interior and exterior elements.  Aside from the additional cargo volume in the rear, the two vehicles are  essentially identical. Our findings remain broadly applicable to the V90.</p>]

[<p>There's plenty to like about the 2018  Volvo V90 Cross Country. Beyond the good looks and clean, modern design, it  offers incredibly comfortable seats and a host of technology features from the  tabletlike infotainment system to a suite of driver aids. That said, we've  dinged the Cross Country for a harsher ride and noisier cabin than we expect  from a luxury vehicle at this price point and for feeling a little less sturdy  and solid than some similarly priced competitors. </p>, <p>It's also worth noting that while the  Cross Country comes with added ride height, not much extra effort has gone into  enhancing its off-road capability. The all-wheel-drive system certainly makes  it functional enough, but there's not much in the way of extra traction control  settings or hardware to help the car cope with primitive conditions. Of course,  that puts it in the same league as most SUVs, so it's certainly not <em>less </em>competent than most of the  competitive field. </p>, <p>If what you're looking for is luxury with  supreme off-road ability, it's worth biting the SUV bullet and going with the  Land Rover Discovery. The Disco is a little over  an inch longer than the V90, but it is more  capable off-road and has the added bonus of a third row of seating. Some appealing  wagons are also available. The Audi A4 Allroad is smaller than the V90, but it  provides a more engaging driving experience and some of the best technology  features and integration on the market. If your plans don't call for leaving  paved surfaces, the eminently classy Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon provides a  stunning all-around luxury experience along with all-wheel drive to handle  inclement weather.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volvo V90 is an all-wheel-drive  station wagon with seating for five. It's available in three trim levels,  starting with the still well-equipped but less powerful <strong>T5</strong>, and moving up to the more powerful <strong>T6</strong> and finally the specialized <strong>T6  Volvo Ocean Race</strong>. </p>]

[<p>Two engines are available. The T5 comes  standard with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 250 horsepower and 258  pound-feet of torque, while the T6 and Ocean Race trims come with a  turbocharged and supercharged engine making 316 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. All  trim levels come standard with all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic. </p>, <p>Standard equipment on the V90 Cross  Country <strong>T5</strong> includes LED headlights  with automatic high beams, 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic wipers, rear parking  sensors, a rearview camera, a hands-free liftgate, and proximity entry with  push-button start. Inside, the T5 comes with power-adjustable front seats,  leather upholstery, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and dual-zone climate  control. Infotainment duties fall to a 9-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto, satellite radio, navigation, USB inputs, and a 10-speaker  sound system. </p>, <p>The <strong>T6</strong> upgrades to adaptive headlights, headlight washer nozzles, 19-inch alloy  wheels, and noise-insulating laminated side windows. Interior upgrades include  heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and a reconfigurable digital gauge  cluster. </p>, <p>The new <strong>T6 Volvo Ocean Race</strong> trim adds a score of visual tweaks including  20-inch wheels, special white paint and orange accents, unique interior trim  with orange piping, a body-colored roof box, front parking sensors, waterproof  floor mats, an air suspension, four-zone climate control, and extra USB ports  for the rear seats. </p>, <p>Standard safety features and driver aids  for all trims include blind-spot monitoring, lane keeping assist, automatic  emergency braking, a drowsy driver warning system, and an adaptive cruise  control system. </p>, <p>The T6's gauge cluster display and  upgraded headlights, along with four-zone climate control and heated front  seats, are available as optional upgrades for the T5. Other notable options  include the Convenience package, which adds heated washer nozzles, a  surround-view parking camera system, a head-up display, and parking assist with  front parking sensors. Other optional upgrades are 20-inch alloy wheels, a  head-up display, and a premium Bowers &amp; Wilkins sound system. Integrated  booster seats are available for the rear seats. </p>, <p>For the T6, the Luxury package adds  ventilated front seats with massaging backrests and power-adjustable thigh  extensions, heated rear seats, four-zone climate control, rear side-door sun  shades, and upgraded leather upholstery. Air suspension is a stand-alone  upgrade for the T6.</p>]

[<p>Volvo has had much success with its  five-passenger XC60 and larger three-row XC90 crossover SUVs. In fact, they're  the brand's most popular vehicles. So if two is good, three is even better,  right? Volvo must think so because the company is rounding out its portfolio  with the all-new 2019 XC40. You might agree, too. If those other Volvos seem  too big or expensive, this smaller XC40 could be just the thing.</p>, <p>The 2019 Volvo XC40 successfully  translates the distinctive look of Volvo's larger SUVs into a smaller package.  You'll notice this as soon as you take a seat in the cabin. The steering wheel,  touchscreen and center stack design will be immediately familiar to those who  have driven an XC60. The front seats are wonderfully shaped and remain  comfortable for long periods — just as with other Volvos —  while passengers in the back enjoy a surprising amount of headroom and legroom.  Numerous cubbies throughout the interior are also suitable for storing small items,  and a removable cargo floor partition helps make the most of the smallish cargo  area.</p>, <p>As expected from a manufacturer whose  reputation was built on passenger safety, most of today's advanced driving aids  are standard or optional. Every XC40 is equipped with Volvo's City Safety  feature, which can warn the driver if it senses an imminent collision with a  vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist or large animal. It'll even apply the brakes if  you don't react quickly enough. The optional rear cross-traffic alert system  will also hit the brakes if a car is about to collide with you while backing  up. Other systems include headlights that turn as you rotate the steering  wheel, the semiautonomous Pilot Assist function and automated parking.</p>, <p>Not every luxury automaker has been able  to package its core strengths in a small, relatively affordable crossover. It's  a bit late to the party, but Volvo has done its homework with the 2019 XC40.  Even if you get the base model with no add-ons, this subcompact luxury  crossover is very competitive against rivals such as the BMW X1, the Jaguar  E-Pace and the Lexus NX 300.</p>]

[<p>The  2019 Volvo XC40 is a compact luxury crossover with seating for five. Two trim  levels are available: the <strong>Momentum </strong>and  the <strong>R-Design</strong>. Every XC40 comes  loaded with luxury and safety features, including LED headlights, leather upholstery,  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, lane keeping assist, and forward collision  warning and mitigation. Upgrading to the R-Design doesn't cost much more and  adds exterior styling enhancements (a black roof and black window surrounds,  among others), larger wheels and more luxury features. Each is also available  with several available features packages and stand-alone options. </p>]

[<p>Initially,  the XC40 will only be sold with the <strong>T5</strong> powertrain, featuring a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (248 horsepower,  258 pound-feet of torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel  drive. A front-wheel-drive version with less power — dubbed the <strong>T4</strong> — will be available later  in the model year.</p>, <p>The <strong>Momentum </strong>trim is well-equipped with  18-inch wheels, LED headlights, automatic high-beam control, roof rails,  automatic wipers, a power liftgate, automatic climate control, keyless  ignition, a power-adjustable driver seat, driver-seat memory settings,  60/40-split rear seats, leather upholstery and ambient interior lighting.</p>, <p>Also  included are three USB ports (two in front, one USB-C in the rear), a  configurable gauge cluster display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  functionality, Bluetooth, a Wi-Fi hotspot, a 9-inch touchscreen, and an  eight-speaker audio system with satellite radio. Standard safety features  include Volvo OnCall communications, a rearview camera, lane departure warning  and mitigation, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. </p>, <p>Selecting  the <strong>R-Design</strong> trim adds 19-inch  wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, LED foglights, a black roof, black exterior  trim, keyless entry, a hands-free tailgate, dual-zone climate control, a cooled  glovebox, steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, front-seat extendable thigh  cushions, a power passenger seat, leather upholstery with faux suede inserts,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror, upgraded ambient lighting, and a navigation  system. </p>, <p>Several  packages are available for both trims. The Premium<strong> </strong>package adds heated wiper blades, adaptive cruise control,  power-folding rear seats, a wireless charger, a storage bin under the driver's  seat, a removable cargo floor, power-folding rear headrests, and a nifty  feature that allows you to remotely control the rear child locks from the  driver's seat. Selecting this package on the Momentum also adds some of the  R-Design's features, including dual-zone climate control, the cooled glovebox,  a power passenger seat, upgraded ambient lighting, keyless entry and the  hands-free tailgate.</p>, <p>The  Vision<strong> </strong>package adds power-folding  and auto-dimming exterior mirrors, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert with automatic braking, front and rear parking sensors and an automated  parking system. The Advanced<strong> </strong>package  builds on top of the Vision pack with a 360-degree parking camera and  turn-adaptive headlights and LED foglights. The Momentum-only Multimedia<strong> </strong>package adds navigation and a  13-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, which is available on the R-Design as a  stand-alone option.</p>, <p>Other  stand-alone features include a panoramic sunroof, heated front seats and a  heated steering wheel, 20-inch wheels and adaptive suspension dampers (late  availability).</p>]

[<p>Volvo  debuted its small luxury crossover, the XC60, back for the 2010 model year.  Over the years, we've given it high marks for its powerful engines, roomy cargo  area and strong safety scores. For 2018, Volvo's got a fully redesigned XC60 on  offer. Much of the model's core appeal remains, but this year's model is more  stylish, has a bit more room for rear passengers and has new engine options. </p>, <p>The  2018 Volvo XC60 is essentially a scaled-down version of the larger three-row  XC90. And because of the similarities between both structures, the smaller,  lighter XC60 can actually use all of the same powertrains from the XC90 model  line. The XC60 T5 is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine,  but we like the 316-horsepower output of the midlevel T6. It's the best match  for the XC60, and it gives up only 1 mpg on average to the T5.</p>, <p>All-new  for 2018 is the T8 plug-in hybrid. It uses the T6's engine to drive the front  wheels and an electric motor to drive the rears. It delivers a big jump in  power (400 hp) with only a small benefit in fuel economy. It's also  considerably more expensive. Since the XC60's best strengths are in areas other  than soul-stirring performance, we don't see much appeal in the T8.</p>, <p>No  matter which powertrain you pick, though, you'll appreciate that Volvo has  upped the luxury factor in the XC60, especially when it comes to interiors and  amenities. It matches what you'll find inside an Audi or Mercedes-Benz, but  with a distinctly Swedish style. We are most impressed by the top Inscription  trim, which benefits from exquisitely formed wood inlays and a leather-wrapped  dashboard. The sport-focused R-Design comes exclusively with paddle shifters  and sport seats, and it sits in between the Inscription and base trim, which  Volvo now calls Momentum in lieu of Dynamic.</p>, <p>Although  the XC60 hasn't quite developed the dynamic chops to run toe to toe with the  sportier variants in segment, there's no doubt Volvo will attract new fans with  this XC60 generation.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volvo XC60 is available in three trims, which offer varied levels of  luxury and sport-focused amenities: <strong>Momentum</strong>, <strong>R-Design</strong> and <strong>Inscription</strong>. All trims can be paired with any of the available  powertrains designated by <strong>T5</strong>, <strong>T6</strong> and <strong>T8</strong>. The <strong>T5</strong> features a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (250 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of  torque), and the <strong>T6</strong> has a similar  engine but with turbo- and supercharging (316 hp, 295 lb-ft). The range-topping <strong>T8</strong> is a plug-in hybrid that combines  the T6 engine with a rear electric motor (400 hp, 472 lb-ft). All models are  equipped solely with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p>The  base <strong>Momentum</strong> trim is pretty nicely  equipped, featuring 18-inch alloy wheels (T6 models come standard with 19-inch  wheels), LED headlights and taillights, automatic high beams, automatic wipers,  integrated roof rails, and a power liftgate with programmable height.</p>, <p>Inside,  there's leather upholstery, aluminum interior trim, a panoramic sunroof,  automatic dual-zone climate control, an auto-dimming mirror, 10-way  power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat memory settings, 60/40-split folding rear  seats (with rear underseat storage), a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system,  a 10-speaker audio system, satellite radio, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto  smartphone integration, and Bluetooth connectivity. </p>, <p>On  the safety front, all XC60s are equipped with lane keeping assist, road  departure mitigation and protection, oncoming collision avoidance/mitigation  with bike/pedestrian/animal detection, driver attention alert, road sign  recognition, and a four-year complimentary subscription to Volvo On Call with  remote engine start.</p>, <p>The <strong>R-Design</strong> trim includes everything  above and adds 19-inch wheels, special exterior trim, LED front foglights and  cornering lights, keyless entry, a hands-free liftgate, illuminated door  handles, front sport seats with manual seat bottom extensions, navigation, a  12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, steering wheel paddles and selectable drive  modes.</p>, <p>The <strong>Inscription</strong> trim includes most of  the R-Design features but has different exterior and interior trim and lacks  the sport seats and steering wheel paddles. Instead, you get 20-inch wheels,  four-zone climate control, a leather-wrapped dash, ambient interior lighting  and a cooled glovebox.</p>, <p>A  number of small packages and stand-alone options are available on the base  Momentum trim if you don't need or want everything offered in R-Design or  Inscription trims. Features such as the digital gauge cluster, navigation  system, interior ambient lighting, and keyless entry are all available. </p>, <p>The <strong>Vision package</strong> is available to all  models and includes auto-dimming and folding side mirrors, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors  with semiautonomous parking assist. The <strong>Convenience  package</strong> adds adaptive cruise control, power-folding rear seat and  headrests, heated wiper blades, power child locks for the rear doors, HomeLink,  an additional 12-volt power outlet, and for Momentum models includes selectable  drive mode settings, keyless entry and a hands-free tailgate. Adding the <strong>Advance package</strong> equips all models with  turn-adapting LED headlights, a 360-degree parking camera system, headlight  washers and a head-up display. </p>, <p>The <strong>Luxury Seat package</strong> is offered  exclusively on Inscription models, and it helps elevate the XC60's amenities  above the competition. Included is premium leather upholstery, upgraded front  seats (heated, ventilated and massaging with power lower cushion extenders and  adjustable lateral support), heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>The  most significant stand-alone options include an adaptive air suspension that  provides adjustments in body height and damping and a 15-speaker Bowers and  Wilkins premium sound system. </p>]

[<p>If  there is one virtue that the 2018 Volvo XC90 possesses in spades, it's  elegance. From the extra classy exterior styling to the impressively  well-appointed interior, the XC90 exudes panache. It's a luxury crossover with  all the fancy vibes you could ever hope for. </p>, <p>More  than a good-looking car, though, the 2018 XC90 drives well and has precise  handling and a sense of stability on the road. It has plenty of room inside and  an abundance of high-tech safety features, both on the standard equipment sheet  and available as options. </p>, <p>All  of this adds up to a respectable and desirable crossover, but there are a few  drawbacks. Our main issue: the XC90's powertrains. While Volvo's turbocharged  (T5) and turbo-and-supercharged (T6) four-cylinder engines work fine in the  brand's smaller vehicles, they seem less ideally suited for the big XC90.  Performance and fuel economy suffer as a result. The T8 hybrid fares better,  but it's pricey. And we've found all XC90s can have a rather rough ride over  bumpy roads when fitted with the bigger optional wheels. That's not something  you expect, or want, in an SUV of this caliber. The XC90's flaws aren't fatal,  though. There is a lot to like about this upscale crossover, and if it ends up  on your short list, we recommend a test drive. </p>, <p>Notably, we picked the 2018 Volvo XC90 as one of Edmunds' <a href="/suv/articles/best-midsize-suvs/" title="Best Midsize SUVs">Best Midsize SUVs</a> for this year.</p>]

[<p>The  2018 Volvo XC90 is a luxury crossover SUV with three seating configurations and  four different trim levels: <strong>Momentum</strong>, <strong>R-Design</strong>, <strong>Inscription</strong> and <strong>Excellence</strong>.  Regular XC90s are referred to as the <strong>T5</strong> and <strong>T6</strong>, while the hybrid is called  the <strong>T8</strong> <strong>Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid</strong>. The Momentum trim level comes with  plenty of standard equipment such as a rearview camera, lane departure warning  and an impressive 9-inch touchscreen. The R-Design is the sporty version of the  XC90, while the Inscription and Excellence are more luxury-focused with  equipment such as ventilated front seats and an adaptive air suspension. </p>]

[<p>For  standard equipment, the <strong>T5 Momentum</strong> gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (250 hp, 258 lb-ft), an eight-speed  automatic transmission, 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, a panoramic  sunroof, a power tailgate, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, lane  departure warning, keyless entry and ignition, faux leather (premium vinyl)  upholstery, eight-way power front seats (with power lumbar adjustment),  driver-seat memory settings, 40/20/40-split second-row seats (with individual  slide and recline functions), a 50/50-split third-row seat and an auto-dimming  rearview mirror.</p>, <p>Technology  features for the T5 Momentum include Pilot Assist semiautonomous driving mode,  adaptive cruise control, a 9-inch central touchscreen, a navigation system,  voice controls, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and a  10-speaker sound system with satellite radio and a USB port.</p>, <p>The <strong>T6</strong> upgrades to a 2.0-liter  supercharged and turbocharged four-cylinder engine (316 hp, 295 lb-ft). The <strong>T8 Plug-In Hybrid</strong> uses the same  turbocharged and supercharged engine as the XC90 T6, but it adds an 87-hp  electric motor. Total output is 400 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque. With a 240-volt  charging station, fully recharging the pack takes only about 2.5 hours. The EPA  estimates pure-electric range at 14 miles. Both the <strong>T6</strong> and <strong>T8 Momentum</strong> models get 19-inch wheels, a larger digital driver information display, leather  upholstery, heated front seats, third-row seating and four-zone automatic  climate control. T8 Momentum models also receive LED adaptive headlights and  added interior illumination.</p>, <p>The <strong>R-Design</strong> trim level features 20-inch  alloy wheels, unique grille and exterior accents, a sport steering wheel with  shift paddles, upgraded sport seats (with power thigh support), leather  upholstery, illuminated step plates and aluminum mesh cabin accents.</p>, <p>The <strong>XC90 Inscription</strong> (available on T6  and T8) is similar to the R-Design but features its own wheels and interior and  exterior trim. It also has upgraded leather upholstery and rear side window  shades.</p>, <p>Available  only on the T8, the <strong>Excellence</strong> trim  level practically turns the XC90 into a four-seat luxury limousine. In place of  the rear bench seat, the Excellence adds two captain's chairs with footrests, a  rear center console with folding trays, a touchscreen controller, heated and  cooled cupholders and two crystal glasses. All four seats in the Excellence  come standard with ventilation, heat and massage functions. Additional upgrades  include bright exterior trim, 21-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension,  extended leather upholstery, additional sound deadening, a 19-speaker Bowers  &amp; Wilkins sound system, added rear seat USB ports and a refrigerator. </p>, <p>Options  for the XC90 are mainly grouped into packages. The <strong>Momentum Plus</strong> package includes the adaptive headlights, headlight  washers, the larger driver display, illuminated step plates and added interior  illumination. You can pick the <strong>Convenience  package</strong> to add front parking sensors, automated parking assist, a  surround-view camera, heated windshield washer nozzles and, in the cargo area,  a grocery bag holder and a 12-volt power outlet. The <strong>Luxury package</strong> (Inscription only) adds heated rear seats, a  simulated suede headliner, leather grab handles and sun visors, and a massaging  function for the fronts seats. </p>, <p>Individual  option highlights (depending on trim level) include 20-, 21- or 22-inch wheels,  an adaptive air suspension (with adaptive dampers), a heated steering wheel, a  head-up display, a built-in second-row child booster seat and a 19-speaker  Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio system.</p>]

[<p>Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the <strong>2016 Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription</strong> (turbocharged and supercharged 2.0L inline-4| 8-speed automatic | AWD). </p>, <p>NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current 2018 Volvo XC90 has received some  revisions, mostly including the addition of options packages and availability  of items such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Volvo XC90.</p>]
