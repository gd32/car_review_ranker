<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rdx/2018/">Acura RDX</a> carries over into the 2018 model year unchanged. The crossover will receive a redesign for 2019, built on a new platform and with a new turbocharged engine.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The RDX is currently <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/">Acura</a>’s smallest crossover slotting before the three-row MDX. Price-wise, the RDX starts above the ILX and TLX sedan. The smaller CDX crossover <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/report-acura-cdx-may-come-u-s/">might make its way to the U.S. in the next few years</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 RDX comes equipped with a 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 279 hp and 252 lb-ft of torque and is backed by a six-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard with available all-wheel drive. The front-wheel drive model delivers an EPA-rated 19/27 mpg city/highway and 20/28 mpg with all-wheel drive. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the RDX AWD hit 60 mph in a quick 6.2 seconds.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rdx/2018/">2018 Acura RDX</a> comes standard with a power liftgate, power moonroof, Jewel Eye LED headlights, leatherette-trimmed seats and interior trim, 10-way power driver’s seat, heated front seats, leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel, a 5.0-inch information display, and an audio interface with iPhone integration. Available features include sport seats with perforated leather, heated and ventilated front seats, a second display screen below the 8.0-inch navigation screen, ELS Studio premium audio system, Siri Eyes Free (but no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto), AcuraLink infotainment interface, and 3D view navigation.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 RDX was given the highest five-star rating for the crossover’s overall rating and is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ (the highest possible rating) for scoring the highest rating of Good in all five test evaluations (small overlap front, moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and head restraints and seats) and the highest rating of Superior in the front crash prevention evaluation. The RDX was able to reduce the speed of a 12 mph collision by 11 mph and a 25 mph collision by 16 mph thanks to the available Collision Mitigation Braking system in AcuraWatch Plus package. The package also consists of adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and a color multi-information display in the instrument panel. Other driver assist safety features include a forward collision warning system, lane departure warning, blind spot alert, and rear-cross traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rdx/2016/2016-acura-rdx-awd-first-test-review/">First Test</a> review of the refreshed 2016 Acura RDX, we praised the crossover for its acceleration, large cargo capacity, fuel economy, and low base price with so many standard features. However, we weren’t crazy about the conservative exterior and interior styling. “The 2016 RDX won’t speak to everyone, but it offers enough interior space, power, and features to please most buyers,” we said.</p>

<p>After spending a year with our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rdx/2013/2013-acura-rdx-awd-verdict/">long-term 2013 Acura RDX</a> (the current-gen crossover), we definitely enjoyed the crossover, but said, “Compared with the previous-generation RDX, basically everything in this 2013 version — styling, fuel economy, ride — is head and shoulders better. But there is still something missing — that deeper connection, that feeling of looking forward to driving it — in essence, a soul. The RDX does everything well, but there is nothing that wows you, nothing that excites you, nothing that makes you eager to go for a drive.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The RDX sports a respectable 8.1-inches of ground clearance and has up to 76.9 cubic feet of cargo room.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/nsx/2018/">2018 Acura NSX</a> is unchanged.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/nsx/2018/">Acura NSX</a> is a hybrid supercar and is the flagship vehicle of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/">Acura</a> brand. Unlike its rear-drive predecessor, the second-generation NSX is all-wheel drive.</p>

<p>Available only as a single trim, the 2018 NSX comes standard with a rear-view camera, magnetic dampers, keyless entry and start, full LED headlights, automatic climate control, perforated leather and Alcantara-trimmed sport seats, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, Bluetooth, an eight-speaker audio system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, two USB ports, staggered 19-inch front and 2o-inch rear alloy wheels, and high-performance Brembo brakes.</p>

<p>Optional extras include track-oriented performance tires, an 8.0-inch multi-information display, a nine-speaker ELS premium audio system, front and rear parking sensors, and carbon fiber exterior bits such as the front spoiler, rear diffuser and side sills.</p>

<p>The 2018 Acura NSX is powered by a hybrid system that combines a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6, three electric motors, a lithium-ion battery, and a nine-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission for a combined output of 573 hp and 476 lb-ft of torque. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/22 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The 2018 Acura NSX hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. There are no drive assistance features available on the 2018 NSX.</p>

<p>Behind the engine is a trunk that can hold 4.4 cubic feet of cargo.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/nsx/2017/2017-acura-nsx-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that with the help of the electric motors, the NSX accelerates smoothly and feels like a naturally aspirated vehicle. Despite its bold exterior styling, you can easily see out of the cabin but its infotainment system lacks a volume knob. Each drive mode is distinct from each other and in Track mode, the NSX comes alive. Steering, however, is numb and uncommunicative regardless of the mode you’re in.</p>

<p>The NSX won a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/nsx/2017/2017-acura-nsx-vs-nissan-gt-r/">2016 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/gt-r/2018/">Nissan GT-R</a> because it had a more superior ride and handling balance, and its nine-speed dual-clutch transmission is more responsive.</p>

<p>The Acura NSX is manufactured in Marysville, Ohio at <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a>’s Performance Manufacturing Center.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/">Acura</a> redesigned the MDX’s dual-screen interface with more menus and command structures, featuring a new 7.0-inch capacitive touchscreen with a 30-percent faster response time. The infotainment system now comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Basque Red and San Marino Red are two new exterior colors.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The MDX is Acura’s flagship crossover and the automaker’s only three-row vehicle. The MDX also has the third highest starting price out of the entire lineup, below the flagship RLX sedan and the NSX supercar. Those who find the three-row MDX too big might also consider the two-row RDX.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/mdx/2018/">2018 Acura MDX</a> is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 290 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque and comes paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission. The engine, with front-wheel drive, delivers an EPA-rated 20/27 mpg city/highway with the auto engine start/stop feature and 19/27 mpg without it. With all-wheel drive (AWD), the MDX delivers 19/26 mpg with auto start/stop and 18/26 mpg without it. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/mdx/2018/">Acura MDX</a> AWD hit 60 mph in 6.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a 121 feet, both respectable numbers for a three-row crossover.</p>

<p>The <strong>MDX Sport Hybrid</strong> comes standard with AWD and comes equipped with a hybrid powertrain consisting of a 3.0-liter V-6 mated to an electric motor for a total system output of 321 hp and 289 lb-ft of torque. The hybrid powertrain is backed by a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and delivers an impressive 26/27 mpg.</p>

<p>The 2018 Acura MDX comes standard with Jewel Eye LED headlights, LED taillights, power moonroof, heated side-view mirrors with reverse gear tilt-down function, a leather trimmed interior, 10-way power driver’s seat, eight-way powered front passenger seat, heated front seats, sliding second-row seats with one-touch third-row access, tri-zone automatic climate control, leather-wrapped steering wheel with power tilt and telescoping, ambient interior lighting, Hidden Cargo Storage with Smart Lid, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a 7.0-inch upper screen and 8.0-inch lower display screen.</p>

<p>Upgrade to the range-topping MDX with the Advance and Entertainment packages and your MDX will add perforated leather with contrast stitching and piping, heated and ventilated front seats, second-row heated captain’s chairs, second-row center console with sliding tray, a larger 9.0-inch center display screen, rear door sunshades, a 12-speaker surround sound audio system, heated steering wheel, two third-row USB ports, LED fog lights, Acura Navigation System with 3D View and HD traffic, and a 16.2-inch ultra-wide screen with split screen capability.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Acura MDX received the highest rating of five stars for the crossover’s overall safety rating from the NHSTA and is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ for receiving the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation. The Superior rating was issued because the MDX properly warned the driver of a possible collision and avoided a 12 mph and 25 mph frontal collision thanks to the Collision Mitigation Braking System found the AcuraWatch suite of driver assist safety features standard on all MDX models. AcuraWatch also includes adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and a road departure mitigation system. Additional driver assist safety features include a blind spot information system, a surround view camera system, front and rear parking sensors, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/mdx/2017/2017-acura-mdx-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the refreshed 2017 Acura MDX, we had mixed feeling about the new grille but liked the strong acceleration and braking power. We were impressed by the fuel economy and the handling of the AWD model (SH-AWD), “It has a surprisingly nice chassis on winding roads and one of the better FWD-architecture platforms in terms of steering, balance, and grip,” we said. “Good power and response from the engine. It has a nicely measured demeanor when driven hard.”</p>

<p>The biggest complaint is the nine-speed automatic that is very jerky at low speeds and when driven hard and is slow to respond. “It has a very quiet cabin and little or no wind noise at 75 mph,” we said. “On [the highway], the MDX is much more comfortable than the Q7 was. I sense no gut jiggle.”</p>

<p>“By placing the hybrid powertrain in the center of the underbody, Acura lowered the center of gravity by 26mm, giving the MDX Sport Hybrid less body roll. This was noticeable during our drive in the windy roads outside of Seattle, where the three-row SUV handled the curves with confidence,” we said in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/mdx/2017/2017-acura-mdx-hybrid-first-drive-review-small-piece-nsx/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid. The dual-clutch transmission shifts well, we liked the seven USB ports, and the easy to access third row (although it’s small for adults). We also liked the standard suite of driver assist features, AcuraWatch, and very comfortable and quiet ride. “With the addition of the new 2017 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid, the luxury brand is stepping up its game and trying to attract a younger generation looking for a capable and confident vehicle. The MDX hybrid’s quick torque delivery, good handling, and decent packaging set it apart without compromising any space.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The MDX Sport Hybrid’s electrified powertrain utilizes a port-injected (versus direct injection) 3.0-liter V-6 (<a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a>’s only 3.0-liter V-6) that produces 257 hp and 218 lb-ft of torque. However, thanks to the three electric motors, the powertrain makes more horsepower and torque than the non-hybrid MDX.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/tlx/2018/2018-acura-tlx-first-look-review/">refreshed 2018 Acura TLX performance luxury sedan</a> sits between the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/ilx/2018/">Acura ILX</a> compact sport sedan and larger <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rlx/2018/">Acura RLX</a> luxury flagship sedan in the premium Japanese automaker’s lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Power for the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/tlx/2018/">2018 Acura TLX</a> comes from either a 2.4-liter K24 I-4 making 206 hp and 182 lb-ft of torque mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission or an optional 3.5-liter J35 V-6 making 290 hp and 267 lb-ft backed by a nine-speed automatic transmission. Both transmissions feature paddle shifters. Front-drive is standard with both engines and features Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS), and the automaker’s Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive (SH-AWD) is available with the V-6 engine.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/ilx/2018/">2018 Acura ILX</a> gets a new Special Edition trim that comes with additional standard features including 18-inch alloy wheels, side sills, and a rear spoiler taken from the A-Spec package.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/ilx/2018/">Acura ILX</a> is a front-drive premium compact sedan that slots under the larger TLX.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/">Acura</a> ILX is powered by a 2.4-liter I-4 rated at 201 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque, and it comes paired exclusively to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 25/35 mpg city/highway. There’s 12.3 cubic feet of trunk space and it can be expanded via the folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, dual-zone climate control, keyless entry/start, heated front seats, LED headlights, leatherette upholstery, a multi-information display, a 5.0-inch screen, and Bluetooth connectivity. Options include 18-inch alloy wheels, navigation, a larger 8.0-inch screen, leather upholstery, a moonroof, fog lights, and an ELS premium audio system. The A-Spec package adds a rear spoiler, side sills, red instrument lighting, aluminum pedals, suede inserts on the seats, fog lights, and unique 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 ILX a five-star overall safety score (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 ILX but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the headlights test, where it received a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the ILX received a Superior rating after it reduced the impact speed of a 12-mph collision by 11 mph and the impact speed of a 25-mpg crash by 15 mph (Superior is the highest score for front crash prevention).</p>

<p>Available as a its own package, AcuraWatch bundles together forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and road departure mitigation. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are available as part of the Premium and Technology packages.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/ilx/2016/2016-acura-ilx-first-drive/">2016 First Drive</a>, we said that the 201-hp 2.4-liter I-4 offers plenty of power and the dual-clutch automatic fires off quick shifts to keep the car in its power band. The car’s steering is surprisingly well-calibrated and linear, making it easy to operate when driving through winding roads. Cabin noise levels are low thanks to the addition of noise cancelling tech in the car. However, the interior has minimal headroom as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/ilx/2016/2016-acura-ilx-a-spec-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>. The infotainment system, on other hand, has way too many buttons and can be finicky to use. Although it has folding rear seats, it only folds as a single piece, making it less practical than some of its rivals.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2.4-liter I-4 in the ILX first appeared in the larger TLX sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The RLX has been refreshed for 2018 with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/">Acura</a>’s new diamond pentagon grille, as well as a redesigned hood, wheels, LED taillights, dual exhaust finishers, and a gloss black rear diffuser. Inside, the RLX receives upgraded materials, redesigned seats featuring contrast piping and stitching, and a new Espresso interior color option. A new 10-speed automatic transmission backs the standard 3.5-liter V-6 (non-hybrid) and Brilliant Red Metallic and Majestic Black Pearl are new paint offerings.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The RLX is Acura’s flagship sedan, positioned above the ILX and TLX sedans. With the exception of the NSX hybrid supercar, the RLX is the automaker’s most expensive model, topping the three-row MDX crossover.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rlx/2018/">2018 Acura RLX</a>’s standard 3.5-liter V-6 produces 310 hp and 272 lb-ft of torque and comes paired to the automaker’s new 10-speed automatic that routes power to an all-wheel-drive system. The 2017 model (with the outgoing six-speed automatic) delivered an EPA-rated 20/30 mpg city/highway; we expect the new 10-speed to deliver slightly better fuel economy. The range-topping <strong>Sport Hybrid model</strong> with Acura’s Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive utilizes a hybrid system similar to the NSX’s that includes the above 3.5-liter V-6 paired to an electric motor (47 hp) and backed by a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Two additional rear electric motors (each 36 hp) power the rear wheels for a total system output of 377 hp and 341 lb-ft of torque. The 2017 model uses the same hybrid powertrain and returned 29/30 mpg; expect a similar figure for 2018.</p>

<p>Standard equipment on the base model will likely stay the same and include LED headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels, a Milano leather-trimmed interior, 12-way power front seats, a 7.0-inch multi-use display, an 8.0-inch multi-information display with navigation, and a 14-speaker ELS audio system. Standard equipment on the Sport Hybrid will include a surround view camera system, parking sensors, a Krell audio system, LED fog lights, remote engine start, ventilated and heated front seats, and heated rear seats and steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 RLX comes standard with a host of AcuraWatch driver assist safety features. New to AcuraWatch is Traffic Jam Assistant, a feature that works in conjunction with adaptive cruise control with Low-Speed Follow and works by keeping the sedan in its lane and will keep a set distance to the vehicle in front. AcuraWatch also includes the Collision Mitigation Braking system with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, lane keep assist, and Road Departure Mitigation. The 2018 model has yet to be crash tested, but the 2017 model received the highest five-star rating from the NHTSA and was considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick by the IIHS.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rlx/2014/2014-acura-rlx-first-test/">First Test review</a> of a 2014 model (before the 2018 restyle), we said: “Though the 2014 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rlx/2018/">Acura RLX</a> offers an impressive set of features, buyers of $50,000-$60,000 cars often seek something more emotionally satisfying than a spacious interior and innocuous styling. That’s where the RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD — if it’s well-received — might help.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rlx-hybrid/2014/2014-acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-sh-awd-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD, we enjoyed the way the sedan drove: “This RLX dances like a much smaller sporty car. Driven in Sport mode, the DCT is willing to downshift and hold gear without driver prompting. The rack-assist electric power steering is accurate but we’d welcome more feedback. An Electric Servo Brake system yields a very stiff brake pedal that simultaneously helps mask the handover from initial regenerative to more powerful hydraulic braking.”</p>

<p>Overall, we liked the premium hybrid and said: “Super-conservative styling aside, a car with Sport Hybrid SH-AWD, an estimated 30 combined mpg with 377 hp, a nicely trimmed cabin with gaggles of technology, and brand firsts such as the DCT, electronic gear selector, head-up display, and variable accelerator-pedal effort is a natural fit.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The non-hybrid RLX handles better thanks to the standard Precision All-Wheel Steer (rear-wheel steering) system.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The Stelvio is an all-new model from <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/">Alfa Romeo</a> that shares the same platform and powertrains as the Giulia sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Stelvio is Alfa Romeo’s sole crossover with a starting price higher than the Giulia sedan but lower than the 4C sports car.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/stelvio/2018/">2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio</a> and Stelvio Ti come standard with all-wheel drive and are powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that produces 280 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 22/28 mpg city/highway. The high-performance <strong>Quadrifoglio</strong> model utilizes a 505-hp, 443 lb-ft of torque 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6 that routes power to an all-wheel-drive system. Both powertrains are backed by an eight-speed automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the Stelvio Ti Sport hit 60 mph in a quick 5.4 seconds and the quarter-mile in 14.0 seconds at 97.3 mph.</p>

<p>The 2018 Stelvio comes standard with many features including HID projector headlights with LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, power folding and heated side view mirrors, an integrated rear spoiler, LED interior ambient lighting, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 7.0-inch color driver’s display, a 6.5-inch center display with a rotary controller, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, four USB ports, 10-way powered leather front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power liftgate, automatic up/down on all windows, Alfa DNA Drive Mode Selector, Brembo four-piston front brakes with one-piston rear brakes, and 18-inch wheels.</p>

<p>Available features include black roof rails, genuine Light Walnut Wood trim, leather-wrapped upper door panels and instrument panel with accent stitching, an 8.8-inch widescreen center display with 3-D navigation and rotary controller, a 14-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system, aluminum sport pedals, luxury leather seats with Cannelloni design, heated front seats and steering wheel, 110V auxiliary power outlet, hands free liftgate, trailer tow hitch, a mechanical limited-slip differential, an active suspension system, an 20-inch sport aluminum wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>Some of the driver assist safety features can be found in the Driver Assistance Static package (also available with front parking sensors), which includes blind-spot monitoring, Rear Cross Path detection, and auto-dimming exterior mirrors. The Driver Assistance Dynamic Plus package consists of Adaptive Cruise Control Plus with full-stop, Forward Collision Warning Plus (includes automatic emergency braking), Lane Departure Warning, and automatic high beams. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/stelvio/2018/">Alfa Romeo Stelvio</a> has yet to be crash tested, however, the 2018 Giulia (the sedan on which the crossover is based) is considered an IIHS 2017 Top Safety Pick+, the highest honor issued by the institution.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>“Although there are people haulers and people haulers that haul ass, none do the latter with such glamour as the Stelvio. Damn, this thing looks good. And I hate SUVs,” we said in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/stelvio/2018/2018-alfa-romeo-stelvio-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2018 Stelvio. We also loved the driving experience, “…I found the Stelvio to be a new contender for the best-handling SUV on the planet. Sure, <em>Motor Trend</em> recently <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/f-pace/2017/jaguar-f-pace-s-mercedes-amg-glc43-porsche-macan-gts-comparison/">tested top-end versions</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/macan/2018/">Porsche Macan</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a> GLC, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> F-Pace, which will scoot quicker, but if we’re looking at just base models, the Alfa could very well take the crown for most-fun-to-flog crossover.”</p>

<p>The crossover’s 5.4-second 0-60 time and 28 mpg highway are also impressive. However, we aren’t fans of the low-revving 2.0-liter turbo engine, red-lining at only 5,500 rpm. In a controlled panic stop, the Stelvio “dove to a quick stop without fuss” instead of triggering “an instant and uncomfortable <em>ka-dunk ka-dunk ka-dunk</em> from the ABS fighting for traction,” as in most vehicles (the Stelvio has standard Brembo brakes).</p>

<p>One drawback on the Stelvio is the lack of any kind of terrain driving modes for the all-wheel drive system in case the driver ventures off-road. We had a few complaints, “The engine drones a bit when cruising in the 2,500- to 2,800-rpm range. The navigation system cuts out all audio—rather than quieting it slightly—when it gives directions. The steering wheel requires manual tilt and telescoping adjustment rather than powered controls, which seems petty except that most luxury players offer it. The stop-start system is slow to react, and when it does, it’s with an unpleasant jolt (but it can be defeated, fortunately).” We concluded by saying, “But these are minor quibbles for a vehicle that is dynamically outstanding and does a good enough job of ergonomics and features while packaging it all in a beautiful wrapper.”</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/stelvio/2018/2018-alfa-romeo-stelvio-first-test-italian-bandwidth/">First Test review</a> of the 2018 Stelvio, we immediately called it the “sports cars of SUVs,” but it is a lot more than that. The Stelvio is the fastest four-cylinder SUV in its class and quicker than many V-6 (naturally aspirated or turbocharged) crossovers. Considering the starting price, it’s a speed-bargain. The Stelvio aces canyon roads as well thanks to its superb steering and transmission, “The Stelvio scythes through a canyon better than some legitimate sport sedans. It flows around curves like massage oil over bare flesh. The steering responds immediately and precisely as the body leans in like a star running back changing direction. Both the steering and the car feel light and delicate, dancing down the road with the slightest effort. The transmission is always in the right gear, and the engine is surprisingly linear in response. After every corner, you marvel at how fast the Stelvio was able to take it and resolved to take the next one even faster.”</p>

<p>The crossover is even comfortable for daily driving, “Left in ‘N’ mode, the Stelvio is more than happy to loaf gently through town. You have to try to make it spill your coffee. It’s as easy to drive in traffic or on a long highway commute as any luxury SUV.” During testing we experienced three electrical issues, worrying for a brand known for electrical problems. Also, the engine stop/start function is slow to restart the engine, the brakes have no feedback due to the brake-by-wire system, and the infotainment system got mixed reviews. “In that way, the Stelvio is everything we’ve come to expect from an Italian car. It’s shamelessly good-looking and drives with a passion normally reserved for expensive sports cars, but it’s got quirks you’re going to have to be willing to put up with.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>That Stelvio comes standard with a carbon fiber driveshaft, double wishbone front suspension, patented Alfa Link design with vertical rod link rear suspension, and Brembo four-piston front calipers clamping 13.0-inch rotors and single-piston rear calipers with 12.5-inch rotors.</p>

<p>The Coupe Track package (also available as the Spider Track package for the Spider) adds racing suspension with upgraded anti-roll bars, performance-tuned shock absorbers, a performance flat-bottom steering wheel with a microfiber insert, a carbon fiber rear spoiler, carbon fiber side view mirrors (Italian flag is optional), choice of leather seat color (black, red, Tobacco, or black with microfiber), and a choice of upgraded wheels. Individual optional features include an Akrapovic dual mode center-mounted exhaust system, a carbon fiber roof, satin side view mirrors, an upgraded Alpine audio system, and HID headlights.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/4c/2018/">2018 Alfa Romeo 4C</a> packs a 1.7-liter turbo-four engine that produces 237 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque and is backed a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that sends power to the rear wheels. The 4C delivers an EPA-rated 28/34 mpg city/highway, not bad for a sports car. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2015 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/4c/2018/">Alfa Romeo 4C</a> Coupe (same powertrain) hit 60 mph in a quick 4.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a very short 97 feet.</p>

<p>“While those are issues unacceptable in a $55,000 car, they’re just about inexcusable in a $69,545 car like our tester,” we wrote, “especially given how good the 4C’s competition, including the new Corvette Stingray and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/">Porsche</a> Cayman, is. That’s a lot of dough to throw at a car that would be borderline masochistic to drive every day. While an impressive performer, a treat on the track, and at home on glass-smooth surfaces, the Alfa 4C is ultimately tough to live with on a daily basis. Though the <em>Alfisti</em> will no doubt flock to it, I’m not convinced the buyers Alfa needs to give it a viable market in the U.S. will.”</p>

Additional new packages include the Driver Assistance Static with Front Park Sensors package for the base Giulia and Sport models and the Ti Sport Performance package for the Ti Sport model.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Giulia is the Italian automaker’s only sedan in the U.S market and Alfa’s entry-level vehicle, slotting before the more expensive Stelvio crossover and 4C sports car.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The standard engine in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2018/">2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia</a> is a potent 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 that churns out 280 hp and 306 lb-ft of torque and comes with an EPA-rating of 24/33 mpg city/highway with the Q2 rear-wheel drive model and 23/31 mpg with the Q4 all-wheel drive model. The powerful 505-hp, 443-lb-ft of torque 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6 is only available in the range-topping rear-wheel drive <strong>Quadrifoglio</strong> model and delivers 17/24 mpg. An eight-speed automatic backs both engines. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the Quadrifoglio hit 60 mph in an impressive 3.9 seconds and the standard 2.0-liter turbo engine with rear-wheel drive did it in a very quick 5.1 seconds.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2018/">Alfa Romeo Giulia</a> comes standard with HID headlights with LED daytime running lights and static bending, LED taillights, power-folding and heated side-view mirrors, LED interior ambient lighting, automatic dual-zone climate control, a 7.0-inch driver’s display, a 6.5-inch center display with rotary controller, 3 USB ports, 10-way powered leather front seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, automatic up/down for all windows, Alfa DNA drive mode selector, four-piston Brembo brakes painted in silver, and 10-spoke 17-inch wheels. Available features for the Giulia include genuine aluminum interior trim, an 8.8-inch widescreen display with 3-D navigation, a 14-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system, aluminum sport pedals, 12-way powered heated luxury leather front seats with Cannelloni design, a heated steering wheel, steering column-mounted aluminum paddle shifter, Brembo six-piston front and four-piston rear performance brakes, red/yellow/black painted calipers, a mechanical limited-slip differential, an active suspension system, and an assortment of 19-inch wheels.</p>

<p>The Quadrifoglio model receives unique features like an active aero front splitter system, front carbon fiber spoiler, Quadrifoglio badging, quad exhaust tips with rear diffuser, a carbon fiber hood and roof, carbon fiber rear spoiler, carbon fiber interior trim, a 200-mph speedometer, leather and Alcantara ultra high-performance Sparco carbon fiber racing seats, leather and Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel with accent stitching and carbon fiber inserts, Alfa DNA Pro drive mode selector (with race mode), ultra high-performance Brembo carbon ceramic braking system, a torque vector differential, a two-mode performance exhaust system, Quadrifoglio-tuned active suspension, Pirelli PZero Corsa “AR” high-performance tires, and a selection of staggered 19×8.5 inch front, 19×10-inch rear wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/">Alfa Romeo</a> Giulia is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS, the institution’s highest honor. The Giulia earned that designation by receiving the highest rating of Good in all five crash test evaluations and received the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test. That rating was achieved by properly warning the driver of a possible collision, for avoiding a 12 mph impact, and for reducing a 25 mph impact by 24 mph thanks to the Forward Collision Warning Plus driver assist safety feature. That tech is found in the Driver Assistance Dynamic Plus package, which also includes Adaptive Cruise Control Plus with full stop, Lane Departure Warning, and automatic high-beams. The Driver Assistance Static package includes blind-spot monitoring, Rear Cross Path detection, and auto-dimming exterior mirrors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-bmw-330i-audi-a4-mercedes-benz-c300-cadillac-ats-jaguar-xe-lexus-is-200t-volvo-s60-comparison/">Big Test</a> comparison of eight premium sedans, the Giulia came out on top. We were impressed with its incredible handling and comfortable ride, fast acceleration, good Real MPG fuel economy numbers, and value. We had issues with the interior, although styling, there were too many cheap aspects and poor ergonomics. In conclusion, we said, “Efficient, economical, quick, safe, and without question the most fun to drive, the Giulia is a car we’re willing to gamble on despite its reliability legacy and lack of cost-of -ownership data.” “Its incredible performance and driving experience make it the easy choice for us. We’re willing to look past the reliability question marks to experience the passion this Italian delight delivers. Without question, if it were our money, this would be the car we’d pick.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/2017-alfa-romeo-giulia-quadrifoglio-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia 2.0, we liked the sedan’s very quick acceleration, transmission, and throttle blips when the driver downshifts with the large aluminum shift paddles. We also loved the way the car drove, “Head out on a twisty road, and dial up Dynamic mode from the DNA selector, and from the first twirl of the smaller-than-usual steering wheel, you’ll enjoy the quick turn-in and feedback through the steering wheel rim. This reinforces the impression made by the eager engine’s snarl and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> lookalike steering wheel–mounted start button that this is a car that encourages aggressive driving.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the stability control system cannot be turned off, hurting the Giulia’s at-the-limit handling numbers. Regardless, we said, “Plying real-world roads with all systems engaged, few drivers reported any stability meddling, and nearly everyone who thrashed the Giulia agreed that its neutral balance and poise make it the best-driving sedan in the class.” Ride quality was also spot-on, “Several also praised its ride quality as approaching that of class leaders such as the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a>.” We felt the infotainment system was fine but needs some work. The interior was stylish but not first-class, “Interior styling meets Italian expectations and complements the gorgeous exterior, but some knocked the red leather for seeming a bit too pleathery. Others criticized the graining and gloss of some plastic bits.”</p>

<p>“So if not a slam dunk on space, comfort, and ergo-quirkiness, at least it’s darned competitive.” We concluded with questioning its unknown reliability, “It’s that third item that nobody can assess yet. This car behaved perfectly for two weeks but for an errant car alarm incident. Alfa Romeo as a company ranked near the bottom of J.D. Power’s 2016 Dependability Study for the U.K., reporting 235 problems per car—just behind <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> (196), Jag (173), and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> (169). But this is an all-new car. A fresh start? Nobody knows.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Giulia’s 2.0-liter turbo engine is direct injection, uses the automaker’s MultiAir 2 valve technology, is SOHC (unlike the usual DOHC), uses a direct-mount twin-scroll turbocharger with an electronic wastegate, and has an indicated red line of only 5,500 rpm with a max engine speed of 6,200 rpm.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/aston-martin/vanquish/2018/">Aston Martin Vanquish</a> has been reduced to a single model, the Vanquish S, which features a revised suspension setup, an updated transmission, a new carbon fiber front splitter and rear diffuser, and extra power thanks to larger inlet manifolds and a quad exhaust system.</p>

<p><strong>Trim Levels (Interior and Exterior Options)</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/aston-martin/">Aston Martin</a> Vanquish is a rear-drive luxury grand tourer that’s available as a coupe or a convertible. The car slots above the new DB11 and is available in a two-seat or a 2+2 configuration. Convertible variants come exclusively in a 2+2 configuration.</p>

<p>Standard features on the Vanquish S include 20-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power operated front seats, front and rear parking sensors, heated front seats, a rearview camera, a 6.5-inch screen, navigation, Bluetooth, a 13-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system, and a USB port.</p>

<p>Options include ventilated front seats, 20-inch alloy wheels in silver or gloss black finish, painted brake calipers, carbon fiber side mirror covers, a carbon fiber roof for the coupe, Alcantara upholstery, and lightweight sport seats.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>All 2018 Vanquish models come with a 5.9-liter V-12 with 580 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy is rated at 13/21 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Active driver assistance features aren’t available on the 2018 Vanquish.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>

<p>Trunk space on the 2018 Vanquish is 13 cubic feet.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/aston-martin/vanquish/2018/2018-aston-martin-vanquish-s-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>, we were impressed with the Vanquish S’ performance. The car’s high-revving V-12 engine revs smoothly and sounds epic doing it while the new eight-speed automatic transmission’s shifts are quick yet smooth and crisp. Handling, on the other hand, is excellent thanks to its retuned suspension and minimal body roll. Despite its agility, the Vanquish S rides comfortably and never gets harsh even in Sport mode. As with older generation Aston Martin vehicles, however, the Vanquish S has an outdated multimedia system and a small screen by today’s standards.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Alongside the Rapide S, the Aston Martin Vanquish was one of the first vehicles in Aston’s lineup to receive the eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p><strong>Trim Levels (Interior and Exterior Options)</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/aston-martin/">Aston Martin</a> DB11 is a high-end luxury grand tourer that’s available in coupe or convertible body styles.</p>

<p>Options include ventilated front seats, perforated leather upholstery, a glass key, a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system, an automatic parking system, 20-inch alloy wheels in Shadow Chrome, Silver, or Gloss Black finish, and Brogue interior detailing.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 DB11 comes standard with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 503 hp and 513 lb-ft of torque. A 5.2-liter twin-turbo V-12 with 600 hp and 516 lb-ft is optional. Both engines come exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 DB11 haven’t been released yet. We don’t expect the V-12 model to change much from the previous model year, which is 15/21 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/aston-martin/db11/2017/2017-aston-martin-db11-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we enjoyed the V-12-powered DB11  with its excellent steering, great handling and punchy engine. However, its no track car and is best experienced as a grand tourer that’s fun to drive and features an interior that’s beautifully appointed.</p>

<p>The less powerful DB11 V-8 is just as impressive and offers even better steering response, lighter weight, and superior weight distribution, making it more engaging to drive. On the road it’s more composed than the DB11 V-12 and it’s more tossable on winding roads, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/aston-martin/db11/2018/2018-aston-martin-db11-v8-first-drive/">2018 First Drive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The V-8-powered DB11 is the first Aston Martin vehicle to feature an engine sourced from <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-AMG.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s7/2018/">2018 Audi S7</a> gets new 20-inch alloy wheels as standard and a new 21-inch option.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s7/2018/">Audi S7</a> is one of two performance-minded variants of the A7, slotting below the larger S8. It comes standard with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s Quattro all-wheel drive system.</p>

<p><strong>S7 Premium Plus:</strong> The base Premium Plus trim is well-equipped with standard features including full LED headlights, four-zone climate control, a sunroof, leather upholster, heated front seats, navigation, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, Apple CarPlay and Android auto integration, a 14-speaker Bose audio system, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, Audi’s MMI interface with an 8.0-inch screen, and a hands-free tailgate.</p>

<p><strong>S7 Prestige:</strong> Move up to the Prestige trim and you get a corner view camera, a head-up display, soft-close doors, and interior ambient lighting. Optional features include multi-contour seats with ventilation and massage functions, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, and the S Sport package, which adds dynamic steering, a sport rear differential, black exhaust finishers, and red brake calipers.</p>

<p>The 2018 Audi S7 is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 450 and 406 lb-ft of torque paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy estimates are 16/24 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The 2018 S7 hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert come standard on the base Premium Plus trim. The Driver Assistance package adds adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane keeping assist, and high beam assist. Night vision and pedestrian and large animal detection is only available on the Prestige grade.</p>

<p>The 2018 S7 has 24.5 cubic feet of cargo space that can be expanded to 49.1 cubic feet with the standard split-folding rear seats down.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s7/2016/2016-audi-s7-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a>, we said that the S7 offers effortless acceleration and the engine stays quiet even at high speeds. Although the steering is responsive, it can be unpredictable at initial turn-in. Despite its size, the S7 handles well and stays neutral through turns. Interior quality is excellent and the cabin looks good with the Arras red option paired with red-accented carbon fiber interior trim.</p>

<p>Unlike the A7, the S7 deletes the rear center middle seat, limiting seating capacity to four.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/tt/2018/">2018 Audi TT</a> gets a new S Line competition package that adds brushed aluminum interior accents, red brake calipers, a sport-tuned suspension, leather/Alcantara sport seats, and a flat-bottom steering wheel. A Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system is now part of the optional technology package. Nappa leather seats are now available as part of an optional interior package for the TTS. Perhaps the most important addition to the TT lineup is the range-topping TT RS, which has 400 hp and is the most potent variant.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/tt/2018/">Audi TT</a> RS is a compact luxury sports car that’s available in a 2+2 coupe or two-seat convertible variant. All-wheel drive is standard. In addition to the base TT, the TTS and TT RS performance coupes are available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> TT including a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 220 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque in the base TT or 292 hp and 280 lb-ft in the TTS. The TT RS gets a 2.5-liter turbo-five with 400 hp and 354 lb-ft. The TT and TTS use a six-speed dual-clutch automatic and the TT RS gets a new seven-speed unit. EPA fuel economy ratings are 23/30 mpg city/highway for the TT regardless of body style, 23/27 mpg for the TTS, and 19/29 mpg for the TT RS. The coupe body style has a 12-cubic-foot cargo area in the hatch and can be expanded with the split-folding rear seats; however, the TT convertible only has 7.5 cubic feet of trunk space.</p>

<p>Standard features on the 2018 TT include full LED headlights, Bluetooth connectivity, the Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, a rearview camera, keyless entry/start, Audi Drive Select, 50/50 split-folding rear seats (coupe only), heated front seats, 18-inch alloy wheels, and parking sensors. Options include Nappa leather upholstery, navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system. The TT RS adds more performance goodies front carbon ceramic brakes, a sports exhaust system, and a fixed sport suspension plus a 174-mph top speed.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Audi TT. No active safety features are available in any variant of the Audi TT, but blind spot warning is available as part of a package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/tt/2016/2016-audi-tt-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said the new TT’s eye-catching exterior design and minimalist interior makes it even more distinctive. The car features nimble handling thanks to its excellent chassis but it still has the same numb steering feel typical of Audis. The more powerful TTS, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/tts/2016/2016-audi-tts-coupe-second-drive-review/">2016 Second Drive</a>, is even quicker. However, the gearbox could use a seventh gear to help it cruise at a lower rpm and minimize the sluggish response off the line.</p>

<p>The TT RS offers a nice balance between comfort and performance thanks to its combination of a good ride and excellent handling courtesy of the standard magnetic shocks. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/tt/2018/2018-audi-tt-rs-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>, we noted that the TT RS comes alive in the corners where you can throw it around and take advantage the all-wheel-drive system’s prodigious grip and its rear-wheel bias to allow it to rotate.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Like its A6-sedan sibling, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a7/2018/">2018 Audi A7</a> gets a slightly more powerful V-6 engine. Premium Plus trims now come with LED ambient lighting as standard while the Prestige model gets a corner view camera. The Competition package option adds red brake calipers, sport-tuned suspension, a sport differential, aluminum interior trim, a flat-bottom steering wheel with paddle shifters, and S Sport seats. High-performance S7 and RS 7 get a new 20- and 21-inch alloy wheel options, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a7/2018/">Audi A7</a> is a midsize hatchback that slots above the new A5 Sportback and comes standard with all-wheel drive. Two high-performance variants, the S7 and RS 7 are also available for those looking for more power.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 A7 comes with a standard 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 good for 340 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque; the engine is paired exclusively to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The <strong>S7</strong> is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 450 hp and 406 lb-ft and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The <strong>RS 7</strong> uses a more powerful version of the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 rated at 560 hp and 516 lb-ft in base trim or 605 hp and 516 lb-ft in the Performance model. Both variants of the RS 7 come exclusively with an eight-speed automatic. EPA fuel economy ratings stand at 20/29 mpg city/highway for the A7, 17/27 mpg for the S7, and 15/25 mpg for the RS 7. Cargo space behind the rear seats is 24.5 cubic feet</p>

<p>Standard features on the base Premium Plus include leather upholstery, heated front seats, the MMI interface with navigation and a 7.0-inch screen, a Bose premium audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a rearview camera, keyless entry/start, LED headlights, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, leather upholstery, and four-zone climate control. Options include heated rear seats, ventilated and massaging front seats, multi-contour front seats, and night vision assist. The S7 comes with additional go-fast goodies such as dynamic steering, a sport exhaust system, and a sport rear differential. Most of the go-fast options in the A7 and S7 come standard in the RS 7 except for a titanium exhaust system that’s only available in the RS 7 Performance trim.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> A7. Available active safety features include automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control with a stop-and-go function, and active lane keeping assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>The base 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 offers plenty of power, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a6/2016/2016-audi-a6-a7-30t-first-test/">2016 First Test</a> and acceleration comes with little drama thanks to the smooth engine and quick-shifting eight-speed automatic. Interior quality remains top notch and the MMI system is now easier to use compared to the infotainment systems found in its rivals. Ride quality, however, is jarring over less-than-perfect roads when the A7 is equipped with larger alloy wheel options.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s7/2016/2016-audi-s7-first-drive-review/">2016 S7 First Drive</a>, we said that it offers impressive acceleration and feels neutral through the turns with the available sport differential. Opt for the more powerful RS 7 and you’ll get blistering acceleration in a large hatchback that flies under the radar, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-7/2017/2016-audi-rs-7-performance-s8-plus-review/">2016 First Drive.</a></p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Audi A7 was previewed by the Sportback concept that debuted at the 2009 Detroit auto show.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s3/2018/">2018 Audi S3</a> gets a new S Sport package option. Two USB ports and heated front seats are now standard across the A3 and S3 lineup.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s3/2018/">Audi S3</a> is one of two performance variants of the A3, slotting below the more powerful RS 3. As with most performance-oriented Audis, all-wheel drive comes standard.</p>

<p><strong>S3 Premium Plus: </strong>The base Premium Plus trim comes standard with full LED headlights, leather upholstery, 18-inch alloy wheels, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a 7.0-inch screen, Bluetooth, keyless entry and start, a rearview camera, two USB ports, heated front seats, and a panoramic sunroof.</p>

<p><strong>S3 Prestige: </strong>The S3 Prestige adds a 14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, and navigation.</p>

<p>Options include 19-inch alloy wheels, S sport seats, and the S Sport package, which adds magnetic dampers and red brake calipers.</p>

<p>The 2018 Audi S3 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 292 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 22/28 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The 2018 Audi S3 received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 A3, the car on which the S3 is based, received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side front overlap test where it hasn’t been tested and the headlights test where it received an Average rating (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the A3 received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and a 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest rating on the front crash prevention test).  Standard active driver assistance features include blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist is standard only on the range-topping Prestige trim.</p>

<p>The 2018 S3 has a 10.0-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s3/2016/2015-audi-a3-2016-audi-s3-review-verdict/">2015 review</a> of our long-term S3, we concluded that the car offers smooth acceleration thanks to its powerful turbo engine and smooth transmission. We also noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s3/2015/2015-audi-s3-first-test/">2015 First Test</a> that the S3’s interior is simple but modern looking. Material quality is excellent and everything inside the cabin feels and looks expensive. Handling was agile but the S3’s steering feels artificial and with the optional 19-inch alloy wheels, the ride does get firm.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a6/2018/">2018 Audi A6</a> gets new standard equipment on the base Premium trim level including keyless entry/start and the MMI interface with navigation. Premium Plus models gets LED headlights as standard while the range-topping Prestige grade now comes with a 360-degree camera system. Cars with the optional V-6 now have more power and can be had with the Competition package, which adds black side mirror covers, red brake calipers, 20-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension, Quattro sport differential, aluminum interior trim, S Sport seats, and a three-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with paddle shifters.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the compact A4, the 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a6/2018/">Audi A6</a> is the brand’s midsize luxury sedan and is available in front- or all-wheel-drive configurations. In addition to the standard A6, there’s also a performance variant called the S6 that comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three engines are available in the 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> A6 and they’re paired exclusively to automatic transmissions.</p>

<p><strong>Model: A6, A6 Quattro</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 2.0-liter turbo-four – seven-speed dual-clutch automatic (A6) or eight-speed automatic (A6 Quattro)<br>
Power: 252 hp/273 lb-ft of torque<br>
EPA-Rated Fuel Economy: 25/34 mpg city/highway (A6), 22/31 mpg (A6 Quattro)</br></br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: A6 3.0T Quattro</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 – eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 340 hp/325 lb-ft<br>
EPA-Rated Fuel Economy: 20/29 mpg</br></br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: S6</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 – seven-speed dual-clutch automatic<br>
Power: 450 hp/406 lb-ft<br>
EPA-Rated Fuel Economy: 18/27 mpg</br></br></br></p>

<p>Standard features include keyless entry/start, Audi’s MMI interface with navigation and a 7.0-inch screen, a rearview camera, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, tri-zone climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, Audi Drive Select and HID headlights. Options include alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, heated rear seats, full LED headlights, a head-up display, ventilated and massaging front seats, and a power operated trunk. Trunk space on all A6 and S6 variants is 14.1 cubic feet. The S6 is available with more go-fast goodies such as a sport differential, a sport exhaust, and dynamic steering.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Audi A6 a five-star overall safety score (out of a possible five stars). It only received the Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS after it received a Good rating on all crash tests and a Marginal on the headlight test. In the front collision prevention test, the A6 received an Advanced rating after it reduced the impact of a 12-mph crash by 10 mph and a 25-mph crash by 1 mph.</p>

<p>Forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control with stop and go function, automatic emergency braking, automatic rear emergency braking, blind spot warning, active lane keep assist, and high beam assist are available on higher trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a6/2016/2016-audi-a6-20t-quattro-first-drive-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said that the 252-hp 2.0-liter turbo-four offers strong power but suffers from minor turbo lag. The A6 2.0T tends to understeer when pushed hard and the steering lacks feedback. Road noise, on the other hand, is minimal.</p>

<p>Even before it gained a bit more power, the V-6-powered A6 had prodigious power, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a6/2016/2016-audi-a6-a7-30t-first-test/">2016 First Test</a> and it delivers its might with little drama. However, ride quality does take a hit when the car is equipped with the larger 20-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>The more powerful S6 is essentially an Autobahn missile with gobs of power on tap from the twin-turbo V-8 that’s paired to a quick-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/cts-v/2016/comparison-audi-s6-4-0t-quattro-vs-cadillac-cts-v-sport-vs-lexus-gs-f/">comparison test against the Lexus GS F and Cadillac CTS VSport</a>, the S6 placed third due to its disconnected driving experience. Like every Audi, the S6’s interior is built with high-quality materials and feels luxurious.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s best-selling vehicle has been <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q5/2018/2018-audi-q5-first-look/">thoroughly redesigned for the 2018 model year</a> including a move to an updated version of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/">VW</a> Group’s MLB chassis, which reduced wright by nearly 200 pounds, despite larger dimensions. The Q5 and SQ5 also get revised engines for more power and increased fuel economy.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The midsize two-row <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q5/2018/">Audi Q5</a> and SQ5 crossover slots above the compact Q3 and full-size Q7 crossovers as well as the A3 Sportback e-tron and A4 Allroad models.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q5/2018/">2018 Audi Q5</a> is powered by a revised turbocharged 2.0-liter TSFI I-4 rated 252 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque – that’s 32 hp and 15 lb-ft more than before. Power for the SQ5 comes from a new turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 354 hp and 369 lb-ft. That’s 23 lb-ft more power than the previous supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine. Both engines are mated to the automaker’s seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and Quattro all-wheel-drive system.</p>

<p>With its 2018 update, the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/refreshing-revolting-2018-audi-q5/">Q5 finally gets the modern exterior styling</a> seen on the Q3 and Q7 crossover including the bold single-frame grille flanked by standard HID headlights and LED daytime running lights. LED headlights are optional. Around back, the Q5 sports LED taillights with dynamic rear turn signals.</p>

<p>Inside, the midsize crossover features premium materials as well as three-zone climate control and an updated MMI infotainment system with rotary and touchpad controls. Audi’s new signature digital virtual cockpit is also now available.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Audi Q5 and SQ5 are available with lots of advanced safety and driver assistance tech including adaptive cruise control with traffic-jam assist and the pre-sense city system.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think </strong></p>

<p>We were impressed with the luxury crossover in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q5/2018/2018-audi-q5-review/">2018 Audi Q5 Review</a>, saying, “the new turbo-four Q5 launches strongly off the line with little turbo lag. It continues to pull strongly through the powerband even with a relatively packed cabin of four adults and their gear….</p>

<p>“Audi has managed to hit a sweet spot with the standard suspension. Bumps and road imperfections were never jarring even with our tester’s large 20-inch wheels (18-inch wheels are standard). The body leans a tad through fast corners, but the chassis remained planted and never seemed to understeer. … Steering is what we’d expect from a high-riding crossover. There’s little feedback, but on-center feel is good, and the chassis responds well to steering inputs…</p>

<p>“Taller, stronger, and packed with fancy tech, the new <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q5/2018/2018-audi-q5-euro-spec-first-drive-review/">2018 Audi Q5</a> should continue to stand out in this über-popular segment. Audi is better-equipped to keep up with demand, too, thanks to its new plant in Mexico, which is responsible for global production of the Q5 (except for China, which gets its own production facility for vehicles sold in that country).”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/sq5/2018/">2018 Audi SQ5</a> is rumored to have a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/hear-drift-mode-craze-spreading-2018-audi-sq5/">drift mode</a>.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> Allroad gets blind-spot monitoring and rear auto emergency braking as standard on the Premium Plus grade. Prestige models get active lane assist, adaptive cruise control, high beam assist and traffic sign recognition as standard. Ventilated front sport seats are now part of the Warm Weather package in the Premium Plus grade.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Audi Allroad is a slightly raised wagon that’s essentially a more rugged version of the A4 Avant found in the rest of the world. All-wheel drive comes standard on all variants of the 2018 Allroad.</p>

<p><strong>Overview      </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Audi Allroad is powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 252 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is the only gearbox available on the 2018 Allroad. EPA fuel economy ratings are 22/30 mpg city/highway. With the standard 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats in place, the 2018 Allroad has 24.2 cubic feet of cargo space and it can be expanded to  58.5 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, HID headlights, tri-zone automatic climate control, interior ambient lighting, heated front seats, leather upholstery, a 5.0-inch multi-information display, Audi’s MMI interface with a 7.0-inch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth connectivity, and a panoramic sunroof. Options include memory function for the driver’s seat and side mirrors, a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system, keyless entry/start, front and rear parking sensors, a 360-degree camera system, front sport seats, navigation, a larger 8.3-inch screen, Audi’s Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, and heated steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Allroad received a five-star rating on the NHTSA’s side crash test (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Allroad received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front overlap test where it hasn’t been tested and the headlights test, where it got a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score). The Allroad received a Superior rating on the front crash prevention test after it avoided a 12-mph crash and reduced the severity of a 25-mph impact by 22 mph (Superior is the highest rating in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the 2018 Allroad received the IIHS’ 2017 Top Safety Pick rating.</p>

<p>Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking are standard on all 2018 Allroads. Higher trims can be had with turn assist, collision avoidance assist, adaptive cruise control, traffic jam assist, traffic sign recognition, active lane keeping assist, and high beam assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/allroad/2017/2017-audi-a4-allroad-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that despite the slightly higher ground clearance, the Allroad drives like a wagon with excellent ride and handling. Each of the five drive modes on the Audi Drive Select system are also distinct with Dynamic tightening up the whole car, particularly the steering, and Off-Road mode improving the way the Allroad performance on dirt roads.</p>

<p>Despite the additional weight it carries, the Audi Allroad offers plenty of power on tap, giving it strong acceleration. The seven-speed dual-clutch automatic shifts quickly and smoothly, keeping the engine in its powerband. Even with a slightly raised suspension, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/allroad/2017/2017-audi-a4-allroad-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> that the Allroad handles well with well-controlled body motions through turns and minimal understeer when pushed hard. The interior, on the other hand, is luxurious and well-appointed with high quality materials everywhere. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, however, could be improved if the car had a touchscreen since it currently forces you to use the MMI knob.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in an Audi but aren’t attached to the wagon body style, also consider the less expensive five-seat <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q5/2018/">Audi Q5</a> crossover.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Audi Allroad shares its 2.0-liter turbo-four with the A4, A5, A6, Q5, and Q7.</p>

Higher trims add rear seat lumbar, ventilation, and massage as part of the Executive package. The Black Optics package can now be had with 20- or 21-inch alloy wheels. The A8 gets redesigned <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2019-audi-a8-first-look-review/">for the 2019 model year</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a8/2018/">Audi A8</a> is the brand’s flagship sedan, slotting above the midsize A6 sedan and A7 four-door hatchback.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> A8 offers V-6 and V-8 engines including a 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 with 333 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque in the A8 L 3.0T and a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 450 hp and 444 lb-ft in the A8 L 4.0T. Go for the S8 Plus and the 4.0T engine gets upgraded to 605 hp and 517 lb-ft. Both engines are paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA ratings stand at 19/29 mpg city/highway for the A8 L 3.0T, 18/29 mpg for the A8 L 4.0T, and 15/24 mpg for the S8 Plus. Trunk space is 14.2 cubic feet for all variants.</p>

<p>Standard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights, four-zone climate control, leather upholstery, a Bose premium audio system, Audi’s MMI system with navigation and a 7.0-inch screen, keyless entry/start, a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, Audi Drive Select, and heated front seats.

Optional active safety tech includes active lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control with a stop-and-go function, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and high beam assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a8/2013/2013-audi-a8-l-first-test/">2013 First Test</a>, we said that the A8 feels lighter than it is when equipped with the base 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 and is more tossable than its size would suggest while still providing a comfortable ride even on less-than-perfect surfaces. With the optional 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8, the A8 is even quicker, offering acceleration rivaling some sports cars.</p>

<p>Should you need more speed, the S8 Plus allows you to fly under the radar. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-7/2017/2016-audi-rs-7-performance-s8-plus-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that the S8 Plus offers insane amounts of power and can easily get to Autobahn speeds with ease. Despite its prodigious power, the S8 Plus retains comfortable and stealthy thanks to its restrained exterior design.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s8/2018/">Audi S8</a> Plus shares its twin-turbo V-8 with the RS 7 Performance model.</p>

<p>All trim levels of the 2018 Audi A4 comes standard with automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning. Higher grade models come with lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control with stop and go function, blind spot warning, rear automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, and high beam assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>A 2017 Audi A4 placed second in <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-bmw-330i-audi-a4-mercedes-benz-c300-cadillac-ats-jaguar-xe-lexus-is-200t-volvo-s60-comparison/">a recent comparison test of compact luxury sport sedans</a> thanks to its slick tech features and solid driving dynamics. However, the Audi fell behind the winning <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2018/">Alfa Romeo Giulia</a> due to its lack of character and sterile personality on the road. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a4/2017/2017-audi-a4-20t-quattro-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we also noted that while the A4 handles well, but it doesn’t have the same level of driver engagement as some of the more sporting competitors in its class. The A4 Allroad, on the other hand, offers the same confident driving dynamics as the A4 sedan even with the slight increase in ride height. Inside, the A4 offers a conservative but luxurious cabin that’s packed with cutting-edge tech and high quality materials, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/allroad/2017/2017-audi-a4-allroad-first-test-review/">2017 A4 Allroad First Test</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s4/2018/">Audi S4</a></strong> kicks things up a notch with its powerful 354-hp 3.0-liter turbo V-6, a more aggressive suspension, and a torque vectoring differential that helps give it excellent road holding and even better handling. We noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s4/2018/2018-audi-s4-s5-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a> that the S4 always remains neutral, and that the car adds “a new level of interior and exterior sophistication to what were already competent—if a little bland—cars in their previous iterations.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Audi A4 Ultra, along with the front-drive A3 sedan, were the first Audi vehicles to utilize the high-fuel economy version of Audi’s 2.0-liter turbo-four.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a5/2018/">2018 Audi A5</a> represents the brand’s second-generation of its sexy coupe and convertible. For the first time, the U.S. market will also receive the A5 and S5 Sportback, a four-door hatchback body style that was once only available in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a5/2018/">Audi A5</a> is a compact luxury car that’s available as a coupe, convertible, or four-door hatchback. All A5 variants come standard with all-wheel drive. Two performance variants are available including the <strong>S5</strong> and <strong>RS 5</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> A5 offers three engines, and if you want a six-speed manual transmission, consider the A5 Coupe.</p>

<p><strong>Model: A5</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 2.0-liter turbo-four – six-speed manual (coupe only) or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic<br>
Power: 252 hp/273 lb-ft of torque<br>
EPA-Rated Fuel Economy: 24/34 mpg city/highway, 24/33 mpg (manual coupe)</br></br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: S5</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 3.0-liter turbo V-6 – eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 354 hp/369 lb-ft<br>
EPA-Rated Fuel Economy: 21/30 mpg, 20/29 mpg (S5 convertible)</br></br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model RS 5</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6 – eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 450 hp/443 lb-ft<br>
EPA-Rated Fuel Economy: Not Yet Rated</br></br></br></p>

<p>Standard features on the base Premium trim include HID headlights, tri-zone climate control, Audi’s MMI interface with a 7.0-inch screen, a rearview camera, keyless entry/start, Bluetooth connectivity, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats, Audi Drive Select, a panoramic roof, and 18-inch alloy wheels. Optional features include full LED headlights, navigation with a larger 8.3-inch screen, a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system, Audi’s Virtual Cockpit system, adaptive damping, a head-up display, and alloy wheels up to 19 inches in diameter. The S5 can be hand with dynamic steering, a sport rear differential, adaptive damping suspension, and red brake calipers.</p>

<p>Cargo space in the A5 coupe is 11.6 cubic feet, and the A5 convertible has 9.3 cubic feet. The A5 Sportback has the most cargo space at 21.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 35 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Audi A5. Automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning are standard on all 2018 A5s. Optional active safety features include adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go function, lane keeping assist, high beam assist, rear automatic emergency braking, and blind spot warning.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a5/2018/2018-audi-a5-s5-sportback-first-drive-logic-dose-passion/">2018 First Drive</a>, we said the the A5 Sportback has the same confident handling and overall driving dynamics as the A4 sedan. The interior, in typical Audi fashion, is high quality with excellent materials that feel expensive. The more powerful S5, on the other hand, offers plenty of power and excellent handling. However, the steering, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s4/2018/2018-audi-s4-s5-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>, doesn’t communicate with you. The adaptive damping suspension also helps keep the car composed.</p>

<p>In comparison to the car it replaces, the new RS 5 features a meatier power band that has more mid-range torque, meaning it’s not as rev-happy. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s5/2018/2018-audi-rs5-coupe-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>, we said that the RS 5 continues to offer prodigious grip levels and is a more restrained car than before — still quick, but now better able to travel “long distances at high speed without raising a sweat.” The dynamic suspension helps keep body motions in check especially at high speeds, where it keeps the car stable.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Audi A5’s base 2.0-liter turbo-four is shared with multiple Audi models including the A4, A6, Q5, and A7.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the compact Q5, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q7/2018/">Audi Q7</a> is a three-row crossover with seating for seven passengers and standard all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available on the 2018 Q7 including a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 252 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 with 333 hp and 325 lb-ft. Both engines are paired exclusively to an eight-speed automatic transmission and are EPA-rated at 19/25 mpg city/highway. Cargo space is 14.8 cubic feet behind the third row, 37.5 cubic feet behind the second row, and 71.6 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include HID headlights, tri-zone climate control, split-folding second and third rows, a 7.0-inch multi-information display, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s MMI system with a 7.0-inch screen, leather upholstery, keyless entry/start, Bluetooth connectivity, heated front seats, a panoramic sunroof, Audi Drive Select, a rearview camera, and 18-inch alloy wheels.

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Audi Q7 hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA but in IIHS evaluations it received the Top Safety Pick rating after it received a Good score on all crash tests (Good is the highest possible score). The crossover earned a Superior rating on the front crash prevention test after it avoided a 12-mpg collision and reduced the impact of a 25-mph impact by 23 mph (Superior is the highest possible score). On the new headlight test, the 2018 Q7 received a Marginal score, which prevented it from receiving the higher Top Safety Pick+ rating. Automatic emergency braking comes standard on all 2018 Q7s. Optional active safety tech include active lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control with a stop-and-go function, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and high beam assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/q7/2017/2017-audi-q7-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that the Q7 is supremely comfortable and, like all Audis, the interior is built with high-quality materials and the slick Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster. Although first- and second-row space is plenty for adults, the third row is best left for children, as there’s minimal head- and legroom back there. Tire noise was minimal and despite its size, the Q7 handles well with the standard or air suspension, but the latter does cause the car to get bouncy. Acceleration with the 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 is strong and makes it one of the quicker cars in its class with a <em>Motor-Trend-</em>tested 0 to 60 mph time of 5.7 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The second-generation Audi Q7 is the first seven-seat crossover from Audi to feature a standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-7/2018/">2018 Audi RS 7</a> gets standard sport exhaust and new five-spoke 21-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-7/2018/">Audi RS 7</a> is the second high performance variant of the A7, offering more power and a tighter suspension calibration. A performance-oriented all-wheel drive system comes standard.</p>

<p><strong>RS 7: </strong>The base RS 7 comes standard with full LED headlights, a power tailgate, four-zone climate control, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, a 14-speaker Bose audio system, navigation, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s MMI interface with an 8.0-inch screen, two USB ports, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and start, a head-up display, a rearview camera, and a corner view camera system.</p>

<p><strong>RS 7 Performance: </strong>The RS 7 Performance adds more go-fast goodies like Audi’s Dynamic Ride Control suspension and carbon ceramic brakes.</p>

<p>Options include ventilated and massaging front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a titanium exhaust system, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen surround sound system.</p>

<p>The 2018 Audi RS 7 is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 rated at 560 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque in the standard version or 605 hp and 553 lb-ft in the RS 7 Performance. An eight-speed automatic is the only gearbox available. EPA fuel economy ratings are 14/24 mpg city/highway for both variants of the RS 7.</p>

<p>Standard active driver assistance features include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking.

<p>The 2018 RS 7 has 24.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the split-folding rear seats up and 49.1 cubic feet with them down.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-7/2017/2016-audi-rs-7-performance-s8-plus-review/">2016 First Drive</a>, we said the RS 7 Performance offers prodigious acceleration thanks to its powerful engine and it comes with plenty of burbles and a sweet exhaust note. The standard RS 7 is no slouch as it accelerates explosively thanks to its twin-turbo V-8. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/luxury-super-sports-sedan-comparison/">2014 comparison test</a> that also included the previous-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/panamera/2018/">Porsche Panamera</a> Turbo and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-AMG CLS63 S, the RS 7 placed second because of its straight-line performance but its soft suspension held it back. Additionally, it understeers too much when pushed hard, especially on a track.</p>

<p>The RS 7 Performance is one of a number of Audi vehicles that’s available with carbon fiber interior trim that has colored accents embroidered within it.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/r8/2018/">2018 Audi R8</a> is now available with laser LED headlights and comes standard with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/r8/2018/">Audi R8</a> is the flagship supercar of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> brand. The car features a mid-engine layout, comes standard with all-wheel drive and comes in either coupe or convertible body styles.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>A 5.2-liter V-10 paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox is the only powertrain combination available. In the R8 V10 and R8 Spyder, it makes 540 hp and 398 lb-ft of torque or 610 hp and 413 lb-ft on the R8 V10 Plus. EPA fuel economy ratings stand at 14/22 mpg city/highway for all variants. Cargo space in the R8’s front trunk is 8.0 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Standard features include full LED headlights, Nappa leather upholstery, heated 18-way power adjustable seats, the Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, Audi’s MMI interface with navigation (in the instrument cluster), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, keyless entry/start, 19-inch alloy wheels, Audi Drive Select, a rearview camera, parking sensors, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system (optional on the R8 V10 Plus). Optional features include a dynamic steering system, a full leather interior, 20-inch alloy wheels, and contrast stitching for the seats. Audi will also allow you to customize your R8 with exclusive exterior colors for an extra charge.</p>

<p><strong>Safety<br/></strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Audi R8. Active safety tech isn’t available in any variant of the Audi R8.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/r8/2017/2017-audi-r8-v10-plus-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that despite the minimalist design, the R8’s cabin is well-built and packed with tech such as the Virtual Cockpit system. On the road, the R8 offers explosive acceleration especially the 610-hp R8 V10 Plus despite having a high-revving engine. Its handling is also excellent and its steering is crisp and sharp, making it great to drive on winding mountain roads. At the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mclaren/570/2016/2016-motor-trend-best-drivers-car/">2016 Best Driver’s Car </a>competition, however, the Audi R8 V10 Plus only placed seventh due to it being overly precise and clinical on the track. Additionally, the car had a tendency to understeer when pushed hard to its limit.</p>

<p>We recently <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/r8/2017/2017-audi-r8-v10-spyder-first-test-review/">tested a 2017 R8 Spyder</a> and found that even with the less powerful version of the 5.2-liter V-10, it has strong acceleration, just not as violent as the R8 V10 Plus when launching. In most driving situations, the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic shifts smoothly; however, in Sport mode it’s rougher and less refined. As with most supercars, the R8 Spyder offers excellent handling but the steering doesn’t have as much feel as one would expect. The interior, as with most Audi vehicles, is well built and features a minimalist design. In this case, the R8 Spyder lacks the traditional screen on the dash for the infotainment system, leaving only the Virtual Cockpit as the place where all information is displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Audi R8 is closely related to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lamborghini/huracan/2018/">Lamborghini Huracan</a> since both use the same V-10 engine and dual-clutch transmission.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s5/2018/">2018 Audi S5</a> is powered by a new turbocharged engine and is now available in a hatchback called the S5 Sportback.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s5/2018/">Audi S5</a> is the performance variant of the A5, slotting below the larger S7 hatchback. The car comes standard with all-wheel drive and is available in coupe, convertible, or four-door hatchback body styles.</p>

<p><strong>S5 Premium Plus: </strong>The base Premium Plus trim comes standard with 18-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights, heated front seats, Bluetooth, keyless entry and start, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, a 7.0-inch screen for the MMI interface, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display and two USB ports.</p>

<p><strong>S5 Prestige: </strong>Moving up to the Prestige trim adds features like <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, a 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, navigation, a 360-degree camera system, a larger 8.3-inch screen for the MMI interface, and a head-up display.</p>

<p>Optional features include ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, 19-inch alloy wheels, dynamic steering, and the S Sport package, which adds red brake calipers, adaptive dampers, and a sport rear differential.</p>

<p>The 2018 S5 is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged V-6 with 354 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/30 mpg city/highway for the S5 Coupe and Sportback, and 20/29 mpg for the S5 Cabriolet.</p>

<p>Not all body styles of the 2018 Audi S5 have been crash tested but the Sportback received a five-star rollover score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). When the IIHS tested the A5 Coupe and Sportback, both variants received a Good rating on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front overlap test where it hasn’t been tested and the headlights test where it received a Marginal score (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the S5 Coupe and Sportback received a Superior rating after both avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the severity of a 25-mph one by 22 mph (Superior is the highest score for front crash prevention). Both models earned a 2017 IIHS Top Safety Pick rating.</p>

<p>Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking come standard on all S5 models. The Driver Assistance package, which is only available on the Prestige trim, adds adaptive cruise control, active lane keeping assist, high beam assist and traffic sign recognition.</p>

<p>The 2018 S5 Coupe has 11.6 cubic feet of cargo space and can be expanded with the standard split-folding rear seats while the S5 Cabriolet has 9.3 cubic feet. The S5 Sportback has the most cargo capacity at 21.8 cubic feet behind the second row and 35 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a5/2018/2018-audi-a5-s5-sportback-first-drive-logic-dose-passion/">2018 First Drive</a>, offers strong acceleration and offers plenty of grip even in the wet thanks to its standard all-wheel drive system. The eight-speed automatic is quick to shift but the steering is disconnected even in its most aggressive setting. Build quality is excellent with solid materials throughout the interior and it’s complemented with slick tech features like Audi’s Virtual Cockpit.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>All 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> A3s get two USB ports and heated front seats. Blind spot warning now comes standard on the Premium Plus trim while the Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system is now bundled with navigation and the Virtual Cockpit system. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s3/2018/">Audi S3</a> gets a new S Sport package option that bundles together the magnetic ride system with red brake calipers. Plug-in hybrid models are now available with 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>In terms of cargo space, sedans have a 12.3-cubic foot trunk while the A3 E-Tron hatch has 13.6 cubic feet behind the second row. Both the sedan and hatchback come with split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Audi A3 received a five-star overall safety score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS evaluations, the 2018 A3 received a Good score on all crash tests, a Superior rating for front crash prevention after it avoided a 12- and 25-mph collision, and Average on the headlight test, giving it a Top Safety Pick+ rating (Good is the highest possible score). Standard on all Audi A3 models are forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Higher trim levels can be optioned with lane keeping assist, blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control, high beam assist, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We haven’t tested the Audi A3 with the new base engine but the 2.0T Quattro we evaluated in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a3/2015/2015-audi-a3-20t-quattro-first-test/">2015 First Test</a> offered strong power with minimal turbo lag and well balanced ride and handling. However, it suffered from excessive tire noise and cramped rear seats. As for the S3, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s3/2017/2017-audi-s3-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a> that it has generous amount of power, supportive seats, and comes with slick on-board technologies especially the Virtual Cockpit system. However, like lesser A3s, the S3 gets upset quickly by imperfect road surfaces.</p>

<p>The range-topping RS 3, on the other hand, offers excellent handling thanks to its retuned suspension, lighter weight, improved steering, and lower center of gravity. In a 2018 RS 3 <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s3/2017/2017-audi-rs-3-first-drive-review/">First Drive</a> we also noted at that the car feels like it’s rear-wheel drive with the front wheels only gaining traction to save you from a sticky situation.</p>

<p>The A3 E-Tron hatchback offers a better ride and stable handling despite the added weight of the plug-in hybrid powertrain. However, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a3/2016/2016-audi-a3-sportback-e-tron-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a> that the brakes have a “mildly gooey regen feel,” though we’ve driven plug-ins with worse braking feel.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The high-performance RS 3 sedan shares its turbocharged five-cylinder engine with the TT RS coupe and convertible.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The redesigned <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s4/2018/">2018 Audi S4</a> gets a new 3.0-liter turbo V-6 engine.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s4/2018/">Audi S4</a> is the performance variant of the A4 sedan, and it comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>S4 Premium Plus: </strong>The base Premium Plus trim comes standard with 18-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights, heated front seats, leather/Alcantara upholstery, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, a 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, keyless entry and start, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s MMI interface with a 7.0-inch screen, and two USB ports.</p>

<p><strong>S4 Prestige:</strong> Moving up to the S4 Prestige gets you navigation, Audi’s Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, a larger 8.3-inch screen for the MMI interface, and a head-up display.</p>

<p>Options include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, 19-inch alloy wheels, a dynamic steering system, and the S Sport package, which adds adaptive dampers, a sport rear differential and red brake calipers.</p>

<p>The 2018 Audi S4 is powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 rated at 354 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/30 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The 2018 S4 received a five-star rollover score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 S4 received a Good rating on all crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side front small overlap test where it hasn’t been tested yet and the headlights test where it received a Marginal score (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 S4 received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the severity of a 25-mph impact by 22 mph (Superior is the highest score in the front crash prevention test). The 2018 S4 earned the IIHS’ 2018 Top Safety Pick rating.</p>

<p>Standard active driver assistance features on the 2018 S4 include blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p>The 2018 S4 has a 13-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s4/2018/2018-audi-s4-first-test-review/">2018 First Test</a>, we noted that despite being the sportier model, the S4’s ride is still comfortable enough for everyday driving. The car accelerates quickly and handles well with good body control. The start/stop system is unrefined because it turns the engine off right before the car has come to a complete halt. As with most Audis, the S4’s interior looks sharp and the multimedia system has crisp graphics, especially on the head-up display. The S4’s exterior is a bit conservative, making it a sleeper.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s6/2018/">2018 Audi S6</a> is unchanged.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s6/2018/">Audi S6</a> is the performance variant of the A6 midsize luxury sedan slotting above the smaller S4 and below the larger S8. All-wheel drive comes standard on all S6 models.</p>

<p><strong>S6 Premium Plus</strong>: Base Premium Plus models come standard with full LED headlights, four-zone climate control, a sunroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s MMI interface with an 8.0-inch screen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, a 14-speaker Bose audio system, navigation, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, keyless entry and start, as well as front and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>S6 Prestige:</strong> Moving up to the Prestige trim adds LED interior lighting, a 360-degree camera system, a power-operated trunk, a head-up display, and a power rear sunshade.</p>

<p>Options include ventilated and massaging front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and the S Sport package, which adds dynamic steering, a sport rear differential, red brake calipers, and a sport exhaust system.</p>

<p>The 2018 Audi S6 is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 450 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard and the EPA rates its fuel economy at 16/24 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 S6 a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t crash tested the S6 but it has evaluated the A6, the car on which the S6 is based. The A6 received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front small overlap test where it hasn’t been evaluated and the headlights test where it got a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ forward collision prevention test, the 2018 A6 received an Advanced rating after in reduced the severity of 12- and 25-mph impacts by 10 mph and 1 mph, respectively (Superior is the highest score on the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert come standard on all S6 trims. The Driver Assistance package adds lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and high beam assist. Night vision, pedestrian detection, and large animal detection are optional only on the Prestige model.</p>

<p>The 2018 S6 has a 14.1-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/cts-v/2016/comparison-audi-s6-4-0t-quattro-vs-cadillac-cts-v-sport-vs-lexus-gs-f/">2016 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gs/2018/">Lexus GS</a> F and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/cts/2018/">Cadillac CTS</a> V-Sport, the Audi S6 placed third because it was too focused on straight-line performance. The car’s acceleration was excellent and the interior is typical Audi, quiet and well-appointed with high-quality materials. However, the S6 is heavy, its steering is sluggish, and it feels disconnected when driven enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/sq5/2018/">2018 Audi SQ5</a> has been redesigned with an updated exterior design, a new turbocharged V-6 engine, an optional air suspension, and the latest version of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s MMI interface.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/sq5/2018/">Audi SQ5</a> is the performance model of the Q5 model and comes standard with the automaker’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system.</p>

<p>Base Premium Plus models comes with 20-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights, a power tailgate, three-zone climate control, heated front seats, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensor, keyless entry and start, a 7.0-inch screen for the MMI interface, Bluetooth, and leather/Alcantara upholstery.</p>

<p>Moving up to the range-topping Prestige trim gets you a 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, an 8.3-inch screen for the MMI interface, navigation, Audi’s Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, and a head-up display.</p>

<p>Options include full leather upholstery, 21-inch alloy wheels, dynamic steering, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a Sport rear differential, and an adaptive air suspension.</p>

<p>The 2018 SQ5 is powered by a 3.0-liter turbo V-6 with 354 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy is 19/24 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The 2018 SQ5 hasn’t been crash tested, but the Q5, the car on which the SQ5 is based, received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS tests, the 2018 Q5 received a Good rating on all crashworthiness tests except the headlights test where it only got a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2018 Q5 received a Superior rating after it nearly avoided a 12-mph collision and completely avoided a 25-mph impact (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test). Because it didn’t receive an Average of higher rating in the headlights test, the 2018 Q5 only received the 2018 Top Safety rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Standard active driver assistance features include blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and forward and rear automatic emergency braking. On the range-topping Prestige trim, the Driver Assistance package adds adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, traffic sign recognition, and high beam assist.</p>

<p>The 2018 SQ5 has 26.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the split-folding rear seats and 60.4 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/sq5/2018/2018-audi-sq5-first-drive-young-love/">2018 First Drive</a>, we said that the new 3.0-liter turbo V-6 offers strong acceleration and quick response, easily getting you to highway speeds. Despite its height, the SQ5 is surprisingly nimble through the corners and feels light on its feet. The steering, however, isn’t very precise and the start/stop system’s operation is rough. At highway speeds, the cabin stays quiet and material quality is excellent.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-3/2018/">2018 Audi RS 3</a> is a new variant of the A3 that becomes the highest-performing model of the lineup.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-3/2018/">Audi RS 3</a> is the most potent variant of the A3, slotting above the S3. All-wheel drive is standard.</p>

<p>Available as a single trim, the 2018 RS 3 comes standard with full LED headlights, dual-zone climate control, Nappa leather upholstery, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, keyless entry and start, front and rear parking sensors, a 7.0-inch screen, Bluetooth, and a panoramic sunroof.</p>

<p>Options include navigation, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a>’s Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and the Dynamic package, which adds a sport exhaust, staggered high performance tires, and red brake calipers. You can upgrade the Dynamic package to the Dynamic Plus package to add a carbon fiber engine cover, carbon ceramic front brakes, a fixed sport suspension, and raise the top speed limiter to 174 mph.</p>

<p>The 2018 RS 3 is powered by a 2.5-liter turbo I-5 with 400 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 19/28 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 RS 3 a four-star rollover score (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 A3, the car on which the RS 3 is based, received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front small overlap crash where it hasn’t been tested and the headlights test where it received an Average rating (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention evaluation, the 2018 A3 received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest possible score for the front crash prevention test).  Forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking come standard on the 2018 RS 3. The Driver Assistance package adds adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and high beam assist.</p>

<p>The 2018 RS 3 has a 10.0-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/rs-3/2017/2017-audi-rs-3-first-test-review/">2018 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the RS 3’s commanding exhaust note that’s amplified by the optional sport exhaust. The 400-hp turbo five-cylinder engine offers strong acceleration, and the car’s steering was surprisingly precise, especially compared to the less powerful S3. Agility didn’t come at cost of ride comfort because although it was stiff, it proved reasonably compliant even on its most aggressive setting. Road noise does become excessive at higher speeds. Inside, the rear seats are tight like the other A3 variants but the multimedia system looks modern, especially when equipped with Audi’s Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster.</p>

<p>Along with the mechanically-related TT RS, the RS 3 is one of two vehicles in the U.S. sold with a gasoline five-cylinder engine.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/">Bentley</a> redesigned the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/continental/2019/2019-bentley-continental-gt-first-look/">Continental GT</a> Coupe for 2019 leaving the 2018 model as a convertible only and introduced the new Timeless Series and <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/set-sail-in-the-yacht-inspired-bentley-continental-gt-galene-edition/">Galene</a> limited-edition models.</p>

<p>The 2018 Continental GT is available as a convertible (the 2019 model is a coupe) and is part of Bentley’s lineup that also consists of the range-topping Mulsanne, the Flying Spur sedan, and the Bentayga SUV.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/continental-gt/2018/">2018 Bentley Continental GT</a> V8</strong>: The base GT V8 model comes standard with a twin-turbo V-8, 20-inch alloy wheels, air suspension with a continuous damping system, HID headlights with LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, dual stainless steel exhaust finishers, premium hide leather upholstery, Dark Fiddleback veneer, a leather and chrome-trimmed gear shifter, seating for four, Bentley embossed door sill plates, an 8.0-inch touchscreen with SiriusXM satellite radio, an eight-speaker audio system, and a four-layer insulated fabric top.</p>

<p><strong>2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/continental-gt/2018/">Bentley Continental GT</a> V8 S</strong>: The GT V8 S receives a more powerful version of the twin-turbo V-8 and increases the amount of available exterior colors to 17 (up from seven), increases the number of available interior roof colors to eight (up from four), increases the amount of available convertible tops to five (up from three), adds a choice of six two-tone interior color choices (up from one monotone color), and increases the amount of available interior leather colors to 17 (up from four). The V8 S adds LED taillights with special trim details inside the lamp, piano black veneer, a knurled sports gear shifter with leather, and a Beluga gloss front splitter, side sills, rear extension, and a diffuser.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Bentley Continental GT</strong>: The twin-turbo W-12 powered Continental GT adds a Burr Walnut veneer and optional features and packages that are not available on the GT V8 S such as the Mulliner Driving package, choice of six single-finish veneers, carbon fiber trim, a choice of two steering wheels, drilled alloy pedals, a neck warmer, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and seats by Mulliner.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Bentley Continental GT Speed</strong>: The GT Speed comes powered by a more powerful twin-turbo W-12 engine and adds sport-tuned air suspension with a continuous damping control system, 21-inch Speed dark alloy wheels, dark exterior accents, dark LED taillights, unique stainless steel exhaust finishers, unique GT Speed interior colors, Speed emblem stitching, piano black veneer, diamond quilted seats, a premium leather-wrapped Sports steering wheel, drilled alloy pedals, and the Mulliner Driving Specification package that includes an indented leather headliner and a choice of 21-inch wheels.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Bentley Continental Supersports</strong>: The range-topping Supersports is powered by 700-hp version of the W-12 engine and adds carbon ceramic brakes with red or black calipers, a torque vectoring system, 21-inch twenty spoke forged alloy wheels, black tint exterior trim, black logos and badges, black gloss exhaust finishers, carbon fiber front and rear bumper accents, hood vents, and side skirts, the Supersports two-tone interior with choice of 11 interior leathers and 18 accent colors, Supersports embroidered headrests, an Eliade cloth headliner, piano black veneer with high gloss checkered carbon fiber pattern (or a choice of three alternatives), an Alcantara and premium leather-trimmed Supersports steering wheel, a knurled gear shifter with Alcantara, and Supersports embossed door sill plates.</p>

<p>The Supersports can be optioned with a Supersports titanium exhaust system, carbon fiber exterior mirrors, a high-gloss carbon fiber engine cover, dark aluminum fascia panels, a Naim audio system, and personalized headrest embroidery and door sills.</p>

<p>The entry-level GT V8 is powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 that produces 500 hp and 487 lb-ft of torque, but the V8 S’ engine produces more at 520 hp and 502 lb-ft and delivers an EPA-rated 15/25 mpg city/highway and 14/24 mpg for the convertible (2017). The GT is equipped with a 582-hp, 531-lb-ft 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 engine and is rated at 12/20 mpg. The 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 engine in the GT Speed produces 633 hp and 620 lb-ft but the Supersports is tuned to produce a whopping 700 hp and 750 lb-ft. All engines are backed by an eight-speed automatic and are only available with all-wheel drive. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Bentley Continental Supersports hit 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 115 feet.</p>

<p>All Continental GT models feature an 8.0-inch multimedia touchscreen with a navigation system, SiriusXM satellite radio, a 30 GB hard drive, Bluetooth, and an available Wi-Fi hotspot. The standard 420-watt, eight-speaker audio system uses Balanced Mode Radiator speaker technology. The upgraded 1,100-watt Naim audio system features 11 Balanced Mode Radiator speakers.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/continental-gt/2017/2017-bentley-continental-supersports-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Bentley Continental Supersports, we noted that even though the car is the fastest Bentley road car in history, “it remains, above all, a luxury car.” “The Supersports rides 0.4 inch lower than regular Conti GTs. Spring and damper rates are stiffer—up 45 percent at the front, and 35 percent at the rear—and the rear stabilizer bar is 50 percent stiffer. Bushes throughout the suspension have been stiffened between 30 and 70 percent,” we said. “That W-12 engine is utterly magnificent, delivering imperious thrust that simply demolishes distances between corners. Artfully tuned exhaust rumble apart, the big Bentley is otherwise so smooth and refined you tend to arrive at corners carrying much more speed than you expect,” we continued. However, “it’s no track rat, the Bentley Continental Supersports— it’s simply too big, too heavy.” “It’s the last of the line, this Supersports. An all-new Continental GT, built using the very different front/mid-engine vehicle architecture shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/panamera/2018/">Porsche Panamera</a>, will make its debut later this year. But it’s the best of the lot,” we concluded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/continental-gt/2016/2016-bentley-continental-gt-speed-convertible-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Bentley Continental GT Speed, we said that “piloting the Continental GT Speed Convertible through the canyons is definitely entertaining, if not comical. We expected a clumsy mess, but instead got cool and composed.”</p>

<p>“While the canyons were fun,” we continued, “the Bentley excels on the open highway. The air suspension does an outstanding job of erasing road blemishes and there are zero hints of wind noise. We wouldn’t be surprised if that soft top were bulletproof. To get an idea of how quiet it is at highway speeds, ride in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/s-class/">Mercedes S-Class</a> while wearing earplugs. It’s that silent.” Unfortunately, “the tech, however, is woefully stuck in the early 2000s. The voice command system obeys just as well as a pug puppy and connecting Bluetooth devices requires a clumsy process done with the steering wheel controls and not the main touchscreen. USB ports? Zero,” we said. We concluded by saying, “Despite our test car’s technological shortcomings and eye-searing shade of paint, it’s very much a timeless cruiser and a rolling expression of economic privilege with an as-tested price of $289,795. That said, there are other options with just as much exclusivity, but a tad more tech.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/">Bentley</a> added plenty of updates for the Bentayga’s second model year including a seven-passenger seating option, new 21- and 22-inch wheel options, fluted seating, a Liquid Amber veneer option, an optional Breitling clock, a Blackline package, additional interior color options, and gloss black exhaust finishers.</p>

<p>The Bentayga is Bentley’s only SUV and part of the automaker’s lineup that includes the Continental GT coupe and convertible, the Flying Spur sedan, and the range-topping Mulsanne sedan.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/bentayga/2018/">2018 Bentley Bentayga</a>: </strong>The Bentayga is powered by a twin-turbo W-12 engine and comes standard with black-painted brake calipers, an air suspension system with four adjustable heights, 21-inch wheels, full LED adaptive headlights with high beam assist, LED taillights, large oval exhaust finishers, a panoramic sunroof, a leather headliner, Burr Walnut veneer, a premium leather-trimmed steering wheel, a leather and chrome-trimmed gear shifter, Bentley embossed door sills, and an 8.0-inch infotainment touchscreen with a navigation system and a 60 GB hard drive, SiriusXM satellite radio, a 10-speaker audio system, and the Mulliner Driving Specification package that includes diamond-quilted seats, drilled alloy pedals, Bentley emblems embroidered on the seats, and a full selection of leather, carpet, and color combinations.</p>

<p>The Bentayga can be customized or ordered in unique visual packages that include Molten Bronze, Big Skies, Quicksilver, Roulette, Stonecutter, and Alpine Air.</p>

<p><strong>2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/bentayga/2018/">Bentley Bentayga</a> Mulliner</strong>: The very well-equipped Bentayga Mulliner adds the Color Specification (two-tone interior color options), the All-Terrain Specification (adds four off-road driving modes and underfloor protection), the City Specification (a self-parking system, traffic sign recognition, pedestrian detection, a surround-view camera system, rear-cross traffic alert, and an automatic emergency braking system), the Touring Specification (adaptive cruise control, a head-up display, lane keep assist, a semi-autonomous driving system, and a night vision system), and the Sunshine Specification (electric sun blinds on the rear side windows and double sun visors). The Mulliner trim also adds 22-inch Mulliner wheels, Ombre Burr Walnut fade veneer, LED welcome lights, a console drink cooler, and the Naim audio system.</p>

<p>Unique visual packages include Monsoon, Dusk, Flare, Bamboo, Sterling, Cambric, and Sirius. Additional options include ambient lighting, a rear entertainment system, front and rear-seat ventilation with massaging function, a two-tone premium leather-trimmed steering wheel, and veneered rear foldable tables.</p>

<p>The Bentayga is powered by a 600 hp and 664 lb-ft of torque 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 engine back by an eight-speed automatic that routes power to a standard all-wheel drive system. The powertrain delivers an EPA-rated 12/19 mpg city/highway. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, a European-spec 2017 Bentley Bentayga hit 60 mph in a quick 3.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 119 feet. Look for an eight-cylinder model for the 2019 model year.</p>

<p>The Bentayga’s driver assist safety features are found in two packages: The City package consists of a self-parking system, traffic sign recognition, pedestrian detection, a surround-view camera system, and a low-speed automatic emergency braking system. The Touring package includes adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, a semi-autonomous driving system, and a night vision system.</p>

<p>In the Bentayga’s five-seat configuration, the SUV can hold 17.1 cubic feet of cargo behind the rear seats, 15.2 cubic feet behind its four-seat configuration, and 7.6 when equipped with the seven-seat option. When the rear seats of the five-seat configuration are folded down, the Bentayga can hold 62.6 cubic feet of cargo.</p>

<p>The Bentayga’s standard tech includes an 8.0-inch infotainment touchscreen with a navigation system, a 60 GB hard drive, SiriusXM satellite radio, and a 10-speaker audio system. The upgraded audio system is a 700-watt, 12-speaker system. The top 1950-watt Naim system utilizes 21 speakers, including a 300-watt subwoofer and two super tweeters. The rear entertainment system features two 10.2-inch displays with two wireless headphones with USB and micro SD ports. Two packages of driver assist safety features are available.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/bentayga/2017/2017-bentley-bentayga-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Bentley Bentayga, we were very impressed with the SUV’s very quick acceleration, the quickest we have ever tested at the time. The quiet interior is covered in premium leather and has a good driving position, outward visibility, and first-rate ergonomics. The transmission is “smooth as silk, but it lacks the quick-fire, perfectly imperceptible shifts that, for example, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s engineers make [a similar transmission] accomplish.” The W-12 engine is very smooth and delivers an exhaust note that “strikes the perfect balance of sporty and elegant.” We also liked the Dynamic Ride feature that keeps the Bentayga flat through the corners.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Bentayga looks and sometimes feels a little too much like the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> Q7 that it’s based on. Because it’s not based on another Bentley vehicle, the interior is missing “the massive width that defines Bentley’s coupes and sedans,” we said. “Although the rear buckets in our four-seat version, which are similar in design to the fronts, are comfortable, they present no luxurious sense of First Class.” The large wheels and low profile tires send sharp impacts into the cabin and steering is absent of any feel. The W-12 engine is strong but “under full throttle, the Bentayga rears back on its haunches and sprays the cars in front with photons from its superbright LED headlights. Under braking, the front end dives significantly,” we said.</p>

<p>“This might be the fastest, quickest internal-combustion SUV ever, but just like the ability to seat seven people, the 187-mph top speed is a marketing tool that most will never take advantage of. The reality is that the Bentayga isn’t going to sell on its cornering behavior; it’ll sell on its price and its looks,” we concluded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/bentayga/2017/2017-bentley-bentayga-second-drive-review/">Second Drive review</a> of the 2017 Bentley Bentayga, we enjoyed the SUV’s ride so much that “on the pristinely paved, undulating, and winding byways snaking through the rocky hills above Málaga, Spain, this 5,400-pound brute felt virtually indistinguishable from a Continental GT W12 from a dynamic standpoint.” The braking was “smooth, strong, fade-free whoa the whole way down out of the hills at the kinds of speeds one might expect with mobs of pitchfork-wielding commoners in pursuit, driving Grand Cherokee SRTs,” we said.</p>

<p>“Another observation: The auto-start/stop and cylinder deactivation features are among the least noticeable in the biz,” we added. Off-road, you probably won’t go “far enough into the wilderness to escape determined <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/">Land Rover</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/">Jeep</a> pursuers, but with the wheel articulation afforded by those active anti-roll bars, plus 9.6 inches of max ground clearance and the ability to wade through 19.7-inch-deep water, this truck will go farther than its owners ever would of their own accord.”</p>

<p>We concluded by saying, “Most of the gripes I was able to muster sound like plebian whining: Why must we pay an extra $7,870 for a package with active cruise control, lane keeping assist, a head-up display, and night vision? Why doesn’t that lane keeping assist system work as well as a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a>’s? Why, with 17 standard paint colors, do all the cool colors cost between $5,715 and $12,530?”</p>

<p>There are no significant changes to the Mulsanne for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p>The Mulsanne sedan is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/">Bentley</a>’s flagship model.</p>

<p><strong>2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/mulsanne/2018/">Bentley Mulsanne</a></strong>: A twin-turbo V-8 powers the large sedan, which comes standard with Bentley-branded brake calipers, air suspension with continuous damping control and four selectable modes, a choice of 25 exterior paint colors, 20-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights, LED taillights, oval stainless steel exhaust finishers, polished stainless steel exterior trim, a choice of 24 premium leather interior colors (can be monotone or two-tone), a leather headliner, a choice of five veneers, a leather-trimmed four-spoke steering wheel, a leather and chrome-trimmed shift lever, polished stainless steel Mulsanne embossed doors sill plates, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, SiriusXM satellite radio, and a 14-speaker, six-channel audio system.</p>

<p>You can customize your Mulsanne or order one of six visual packages called Nimbus; Dusk; Blue Skies, Bright Days; Fire and Passion; Power of Contrast, and Subtle Sensuality.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Bentley Mulsanne Speed</strong>: The Speed packs a more powerful version of the twin-turbo V-8 engine and adds a sports mode with a lowered ride height to the air suspension system, 21-inch painted Speed alloy wheels, full LED dark headlights, a choice of many interior color combinations including the unique Speed interior, Bentley embossed headrests, an indented leather headliner, a leather-trimmed knurled gear lever, diamond quilted seat design, and drilled alloy sport pedals. The Speed can be optioned with the Speed Premier package which includes 21-inch dark or polished Speed wheels, a Flying B radiator ornament, a valet key, a veneered iPod drawer and minor gauge panel, and two city umbrellas.</p>

<p>The Mulsanne Speed can be ordered in one of its visual packages, which are called Bullion, Red Mercury, Mercurial, Magma, Oceanic, and Cool Crystal.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Bentley Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase</strong>: The Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase adds 9.8 inches of legroom for the rear passengers and comes standard with the same features as the regular Mulsanne but adds unique optional features like rear airline style seats, a full rear center console with folding picnic tables, and a large rear sunroof with an Alcantara sunblind.</p>

<p>The Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase’s available visual packages include Synchronicity, Gun Metal, Voyage, Quiet Intensity, Mariana, and Velveteen.</p>

<p>Optional features for the Mulsanne include a choice of 21-inch wheels, a choice of extended range paints (including two-tone options), veneered door panels, ventilated front and rear seats with massaging function, lambswool front and rear floor mats, a Naim audio system, a rear seat entertainment system, a refrigerated bottle cooler, black rear curtains, a front corner view camera, and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>The Mulsanne and Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase are powered by a 6.8-liter twin-turbo V-8 that produces 505 hp and 752 lb-ft of torque. The Mulsanne Speed uses the same engine but tuned to produce 530 hp and 811 lb-ft. An eight-speed automatic routes power to the rear wheels and the sedan comes with an EPA rating of 11/18 mpg city/highway. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2015 Bentley Mulsanne Speed hit 60 mph in 5.0 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 110 feet.</p>

<p>The Bentley Mulsanne and Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase can hold 15.7 cubic feet of cargo in the trunk.</p>

<p>All Mulsanne models feature an 8.0-inch multimedia touchscreen with a navigation system, SiriusXM satellite radio, a 20 GB hard drive, Bluetooth, and a 14-speaker, two subwoofers, six-channel audio system. The upgraded 2,200-watt Naim audio system utilizes 20 speakers and is custom-made for the Mulsanne. The rear seat entertainment system consists of two 10.4-inch monitors that electronically deploy from the seat backs at the touch of a button. Adaptive cruise control and a front corner view camera system are optional.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/mulsanne/2017/2017-bentley-mulsanne-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the refreshed 2017 Bentley Mulsanne, we concluded our review by saying “the 2017 Bentley Mulsanne ups its game in all the right areas to keep it competitive with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/rolls-royce/">Rolls-Royce</a> Phantom at the top end of the ultra-luxury segment and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-Maybach at the entry-level end. To most of us, a sedan whose base model starts at $340,670 seems an extravagance that’s impossible to justify. But to those who can afford it, the fact the Mulsanne is painstakingly assembled by skilled craftspeople—it takes 150 hours to assemble an interior that, among other things, contains 480 individual pieces of leather and 40 bits of carefully matched and highly polished wood veneer—makes it more than just another car.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/mulsanne/2016/bentley-mulsanne-speed-vs-mercedes-maybach-s600/">comparison</a> between the 2016 Bentley Mulsanne Speed and the 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600, we said, “That’s where the Mulsanne Speed bests the Maybach S600, and why the price is essentially double. There are men in Crewe with bulging forearms holding chisels that perform the woodworking. The leather is crafted using a pre-1955 tanning process,” we said. “The Maybach, on the other hand, comes off the S-Class assembly line in Sindelfingen, using many of the same parts as the $95,000 model (can you even imagine?),” we continued.</p>

<p>The new Flying Spur V8 S Black Edition features 21-inch gloss black wheels, beluga exterior trim, dark tint headlights and taillights, red brake calipers, a sports steering wheel, and contrast stitching. Additionally, there is also a new design series by Mulliner.</p>

<p>The Flying Spur is the sedan version of the two-door Continental GT and is part of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/">Bentley</a>’s lineup which also includes the Mulsanne and Bentayga.</p>

<p>The Flying Spur V8 is powered by a twin-turbo V-8 that develops 521-hp, 487 lb-ft of torque and 521 hp and 502 lb-ft in the V8 S. The V-8 delivers an EPA-rated 13/22 mpg city/highway. The 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 develops 616 hp and 590 lb-ft in the Flying Spur and 626 hp and 605 lb-ft in the W12 S. The W-12 engines rated at 12/20 mpg. Both engines are backed by an eight-speed automatic that routes power to a standard all-wheel drive system. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2014 Bentley Flying Spur (with the same powertrain as the 2018 model) hit 60 mph in 4.3 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 106 feet.</p>

<p>The Bentley Flying Spur can hold 16.7 cubic feet of cargo in the trunk.</p>

<p>The Flying Spur features an 8.0-inch multimedia screen with a navigation system, SiriusXM satellite radio, and Bluetooth. The upgraded Naim audio system utilizes 11 Balanced Mode speakers. Other optional tech features include adaptive cruise control, a wireless privacy phone, a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, and a SIM card reader with Google Maps.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/flying-spur/2015/2015-bentley-flying-spur-v8-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the 2015 Bentley Flying Spur V8, we said that although the W12 model might be slightly quicker, the eight-cylinder variant “remains plenty swift, its throttle response noticeably more alert, and its thirst for premium petrol reduced by about 13 percent.” We liked the V-8 engine so much, in fact, that even if we hadn’t known how much money the eight-cylinder model saves, we’d still prefer that power plant.</p>

<p>“The rest of the car is pretty much the familiar W12 with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, plus all the same hyper-cosseted opulence inside. Lovely, lovely car,” we continued. We concluded by saying, “Bentley has used different badge colors before — black, red, green, and even yellow – to signal various engines and special editions. But in the case of the new Flying Spur V8, its red shouldn’t be seen as a signal to stop, but a green light to go get this version instead.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/flying-spur/2014/2014-bentley-flying-spur-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 12-cylinder 2014 Bentley Flying Spur, we were very impressed with the smooth and quick acceleration of the very heavy sedan: “The big Bentley rockets to 60 mph in just 4.3 seconds, and does so with little effort or drama.” We also felt the eight-speed automatic transmission was smooth and shifted quickly. Although the Flying Spur softly glides through roads most of the time, “there were a few occasions when the sedan couldn’t completely mask potholes and bumps. We’ll chalk that up to the large, two-piece, 21-inch rims and low-profile Pirelli P Zero tires.”</p>

<p>Out on the track, the steering was responsive and the brakes were strong, stopping in only 106 feet from 60 mph. The interior was one of the impressive ones we’d ever seen with high-quality materials and solid construction, but the infotainment system “still feels much more antiquated compared to the competition.”</p>

<p>“If your idea of special is punishing Mustangs while relishing old-school craftsmanship and comfort, then the Flying Spur is your car,” we concluded.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>For the 2018 7 Series, minor updates include the Active Driving Assistant as a standalone option on the 740 models, and the Driver Assistance Plus II package is no longer offered (its features are now in the Driving Assistance Plus package).</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The 7 Series is the flagship model for <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>, the largest and most expensive offered by the German automaker and is positioned above the 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Series models.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base <strong>740i</strong> (RWD) and 740i xDrive (AWD) models are powered by a 320-hp, 330-lb-ft of torque, 3.0-liter turbocharged I-6, and have an EPA-rating of 21/29 mpg city/highway and 20/29 mpg in RWD and AWD forms. The <strong>750i</strong> and 750i xDrive models pack a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 that produces 445 hp and 480 lb-ft and is rated at 16/25 mpg and 17/25 mpg for the xDrive. The <strong>740e </strong>xDrive iPerformance<strong> plug-in</strong> model utilizes a 255-hp, 295 lb-ft 2.0-liter turbo-four paired to an electric motor that has a combined power output 322 hp and 369 lb-ft and delivers 27 mpg combined. Thanks to the large battery pack, the 740e can drive up to 14 miles on all-electric power. The uber-luxurious <strong>Alpina B7</strong> xDrive uses the same 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 but tuned to produce 600 hp and 590 lb-ft and delivers 16/25 mpg. The range-topping <strong>M760i</strong> xDrive is powered by a 6.5-liter twin-turbo V-12 that churns out an impressive 601 hp and 590 lb-ft and is rated at 13/20 mpg. All engine are backed by an eight-speed automatic.</p>

<p>Like many flagships, the 7 Series comes standard with many premium options including 18-inch V-spoke light alloy wheels, adaptive LED headlights, Dakota leather upholstery, a 14-way power front seats, high-gloss Fineline wood trim, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround sound audio system, Display Key with a LCD touchscreen, leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.2-inch display screen with 3D navigation, Gesture Control, 4-zone climate control, panoramic moonroof, and the iDrive 6.0 system with touchpad controller. Standard equipment in the range-topping M760i consists of 20-inch double spoke light alloy wheels, Adaptive full LED headlights, M rear spoiler, 20-way power multi-contour front seats, Nappa leather upholstery, illuminated door sills with V12 logo, M leather steering wheel, full-color head-up display, parking assistant, and heated front and rear seats. If you expect to be driven around, opt for the rear executive lounge seating package and your 7 Series will receive adjustable rear comfort seats, adjustable rear foot rest, rear seat entertainment screens with a 7.0-inch Touch Command Tablet, a foldable table for the right rear passenger, and rear massaging seats.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 7 Series may not come standard with any driver assist safety features but it does include a system that will disconnect the alternator, fuel pump, and starter from the battery and will automatically open all doors and turn on hazard lights in the case of an accident. If the Active Protection system detects an imminent accident, the car will pretension the seat belts, close the windows and moonroof, and active post-crash braking. Most should opt for the Driving Assistance package that includes Active Driving Assistant Plus which includes active cruise control with stop and go ability, automatic forward braking, lane departure warning, frontal collision warning, city collision mitigation, and Pedestrian Protection. Traffic Jam Assistant and active lane keeping with side collision avoidance are also included.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/7-series/2017/2017-bmw-m760i-xdrive-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 BMW M760i xDrive, we loved the fast and effortless acceleration of the 2.5-ton sedan and the high amount of grip it provides through the curves. The interior was very impressive but not quite as good as the S65’s. The M760i is a great highway cruiser, providing plenty of luxury and stability.</p>

<p>“Although it’s loaded with technology and creature comforts, the materials aren’t quite as plush as the S-Class. And although it performed well in the 0–60-mph and quarter-mile tests, it lacked in terms of handling and athleticism. With tightened reflexes, the M760i starts to put some of the misgivings about the 7 Series’ performance to bed. But make no mistake: This is still a world-class luxury cruiser.”</p>

<p>At the end of our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/7-series/2016/2016-bmw-750i-xdrive-first-test/">BMW 750i xDrive First Test</a>, we said: “Many features in the BMW make it feel like a true experience, not just a vehicle. At the end of the day, though, that may not be enough of a reason to purchase the 750i over the S550.” We felt the 750i xDrive had vague steering and a good amount of body roll, and noted the S-Class provides a better ride.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>BMW claims that the M760i is the quickest 7 Series ever, hitting 60 mph in a blistering 3.6 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m5/2018/">2018 BMW M5</a> is new and now comes with all-wheel drive as standard. It also features more power, a more aggressive front fascia compared to the standard 5 Series, an adaptive suspension, and an active M differential.</p>

<p>The 2018 M5 is a high-performance luxury midsize sedan that slots above the compact M3 sedan.</p>

<p>Available as a single loaded trim, standard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, adaptive LED headlights, 20-way M multi-function front seats, leather upholstery, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, Bluetooth, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s iDrive system with a 10.2-inch touchscreen, navigation, a head-up display, a 12.3-inch instrument cluster display, a rearview camera, keyless entry and start, a power-operated trunk, a heated steering wheel, front and rear parking sensors, and heated front seats.</p>

<p>The Executive package adds heated rear seats, active parking assist, ventilated and massaging functions for the front seats, a surround-view camera system, soft close doors, a wireless charging pad, and four-zone climate control. Standalone options include Apple CarPlay, a rear entertainment system, a moonroof, a Bowers &amp; Wilkins surround sound system, night vision, and carbon ceramic brakes.</p>

<p>The 2018 M5 is powered by a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 600 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 15/21 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 M5. However, the 2018 5 Series sedan the M5 is based on received a Good score in all crashworthiness tests as well as in the headlights test in IIHS testing (Good is the highest possible score). In the IIHS’ front collision prevention test, the 2018 5 Series received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and a 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest score for the front crash prevention test). With its high scores, the 2018 5 Series received the 2018 Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS.</p>

<p>The Driving Assistance Plus package adds the Active Driving Assistant Plus, which bundles together blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist with side collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, rear cross-traffic alert, and traffic jam assist.</p>

<p>The 2018 M5 has 18.7 cubic feet of trunk space that can be expanded via the standard 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m5/2018/2018-bmw-m5-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive review</a>, we said the new M5 offers blistering acceleration and has regained its agile driving dynamics despite its massive footprint. The 2018 M5 features crisp turn ins and feels right at home on a race track. However, its size does hinder your ability to place it on the narrow roads. Ride comfort does suffer even in its softest setting and can get punishing in more aggressive settings. On the track, the 2018 M5 is right at home and can easily take on corners at high speeds with plenty of traction, allowing you to confidently go faster even with the electronic aids turned off.</p>

<p>The 2018 M5’s all-wheel-drive system is one of only a handful of systems that lets you put the car in full rear-wheel drive mode so that you can do smoky burnouts and drift to your heart’s desire.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Minor updates for the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/4-series/2018/">2018 BMW 4 Series</a> include stiffer suspension for greater handling, new front and rear bumper valence, wheel offerings, and two new exterior colors: Sunset Orange and Snapper Rocks Blue.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/4-series/2014/2014-bmw-435i-convertible-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2014 BMW 435i convertible (before the car was refreshed with a revised engine), we said: “With all of those added bells and whistles, the 4 Series is a very nice, luxurious, and impressive car, but it never feels special. You can assign it a larger number, but at the end of the day, the 435i is still mostly a 3 Series. If you happen to like the 3 Series, and want one in convertible form, you’ll be very pleased with the 435i. If you just like having the wind in your face, you can probably think of a few other options you could buy with [our car’s $65,775 as-tested price].”</p>

<p>“The numbers show the M4 has it when it counts. But just driving the thing around? Feels like a plain old luxury car. Refined and nice enough but not the be-all, end-all of hot Germanic muscle machines,” we said in a comparison between the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro/2016/comparison-2015-bmw-m4-vs-2016-chevrolet-camaro-ss/">first place Chevrolet Camaro SS and the second place BMW M4</a>. “It’s time for BMW to either rethink or reclaim ye olde Ultimate Driving Machine. Times done changed.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>BMW’s TwinPower Turbo technology does not mean a twin-turbo set-up but instead means that it uses a single twin-scroll turbocharger.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x4/2018/">BMW X4</a> did not receive any significant changes for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p>The X4 is one of two coupe-like SUVs in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s lineup, positioned below the X6. In BMW’s SUV lineup, the X4 slots above the the new X2 and X3, but below the larger and more expensive X5 and X6.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x4/2018/">2018 BMW X4</a> xDrive28i</strong>: the entry-level model comes standard with four driving modes (Eco Pro, Comfort, Sport, Sport+), all-wheel drive (xDrive), variable sport steering, 19-inch Y-spoke alloy wheels, LED fog lights, Xenon adaptive headlights with LED headlight-rings, satin aluminum exterior trims, eight-way power front seats, SensaTec upholstery, Fineline anthracite wood trim with pearl gloss chrome accent, iDrive infotainment system with a rotary controller, Bluetooth and HD radio. Also standard is automatic climate control, front and rear parking sensors, a power moonroof, and interior ambient lighting.</p>

<p><strong>2018 BMW X4 M40i</strong>: The M40i upgrades the engine to an M Performance turbocharged inline-6 unit, adds a Sport exhaust, Dynamic Damper control, 19-inch double-spoke light alloys wheels, Shadowline exterior trim, Ferric Gray mirror caps, an aerodynamic kit, 14-way power front Sport seats, Nevada leather upholstery, brushed aluminum exterior trim, and a 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround sound system.</p>

<p>For additional comfort, opt for the Cold Weather package that consists of heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, and retractable headlight washers. The M Sport package, optional on the xDrive28i, includes 19-inch M double-spoke wheels, a selection of wood trim with gloss chrome highlights, an aerodynamic kit, Sport seats, Shadowline exterior trim, and an M steering wheel. The Parking Assistance package comes with a surround view camera system and a self-parking system and the Lighting package includes adaptive Full LED lights and automatic high beams.</p>

<p>The X4 xDrive28i is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine that produces 240 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque and is backed by an eight-speed automatic transmission. With standard all-wheel drive, the powertrain delivers an EPA-rated 20/28 mpg city/highway. The X4 M40i’s 355-hp, 343-lb-ft of torque 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 also comes paired with an eight-speed automatic and delivers 18/25 mpg. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the X4 M40i hit 60 mph in 4.9 seconds (xDrive28i in 6.2 seconds) and stopped from 60 mph in 120 feet (xDrive28i in 123 feet).</p>

<p>The X4 does not come standard with any driver assist safety features but opt for the Driving Assistance package and receive the Active Driving Assistant system (lane departure warning, frontal collision warning, <strong>city</strong> emergency automatic braking, and pedestrian protection), a head-up display, blind-spot monitoring, and speed limit information. The Driving Assistance Plus package adds adaptive cruise control with stop and go functionality and <strong>extended</strong> automatic braking but the Driving Assistance package is required.</p>

<p>The BMW X4 xDrive28i offers 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats up and 49.4 cubic feet with the rear seats down, the exact same amount of cargo space as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> GLC300 4Matic Coupe. Front passengers in the X4 receive 40.4 inches of front seat legroom and 34.8 inches in the rear seats.</p>

<p>The X4 comes equipped with BMW’s iDrive system with Bluetooth, HD Radio, USB port, and a rotary controller. A navigation system, Apple CarPlay, SiriusXM satellite radio, and a Wi-Fi hotspot are optional. The standard sound system is a nine-speaker, 205-watt system but it can be upgraded to a 600-watt Harman Kardon surround sound system. A wireless charger and iPad holder are available. BMW’s ConnectedDrive customer portal is standard.</p>

<p>In 2018 Motor Trend <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/bmw-x4-2018-suv-of-the-year-contender/">SUV of the Year testing</a>, we enjoyed the X4’s quickness and cargo room (surprisingly) but not handling, ride, or steering feel. We didn’t care much for the interior’s low-quality leather and design. We concluded, “We know BMW can build a fun-to-drive, sporty SUV. Unfortunately the X4 misses the mark.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x4/2015/2015-bmw-x4-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2015 BMW X4 xDrive28i, we enjoyed the quick acceleration but not the ride quality.</p>

<p>“If you’ve gone through the mental gymnastics necessary to arrive at the X4,” we wrote, “you won’t be disappointed in what’s delivered. In the end, though, you’re paying significantly more money for a vehicle that’s slightly faster than the SUV it’s based on but slower than the cars it also shares parts with, not to mention the fact it’s less practical than either and less accommodating to passengers. But, what the heart wants, the heart wants.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 X5 receives an updated eight-speed automatic transmission on non-plug-in models. Also, the X5 35i and 35d models receive standard trapezoidal tailpipes. New optional equipment now includes 21-inch M wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>In size, the X5 is currently <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s largest SUV above the X1 and X3, as well as the more coupe-like X4 and X6. In price, the X5 is more expensive than other BMW SUVs except the X6. BMW is preparing a larger SUV with a bigger interior, for those who need a more comfortable third row.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The X5 sDrive35i (RWD) and X5 xDrive35i (AWD) come equipped with the standard 3.0-liter turbocharged I-6 that produces 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque and delivers 18/25 mpg city/highway for the sDrive and 18/24 for the xDrive. Opting for the X5 xDrive35d will increase fuel economy to 23/29 mpg thanks to the 255-hp, 413-lb-ft 3.0 turbodiesel I-6. The xDrive50i packs a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 that produces 445 hp and 480 lb-ft of torque and has an EPA-rating of 15/24 mpg. The X5 xDrive40e plug-in hybrid is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 paired to an electric motor that produces a total output of 308 hp and 332-lb-ft. The X5 xDrive40e can drive up to 14 miles on all-electric power and has a combined fuel economy rating of 24 mpg, close to the diesel’s 25 mpg combined. The range-topping and high-performance X5 M also utilizes a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 but tuned to produce an impressive 567 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque and delivers 14/19 mpg.</p>

<p>Standard features for the X5 include 19-inch V-spoke wheels, adaptive HID headlights with the Corona headlight rings, LED fog lights, 14-way power and heated front seats, Poplar wood trim, Black SensaTec upholstery, dynamic cruise control, a 10.2-inch display screen with BMW navigation, The iDrive system with touchpad controller, panoramic moonroof, front and rear parking sensors, and interior ambient lighting.  The contents of the Executive package increase luxury with soft-close automatic doors, head-up display, wireless charging and WiFi Hotspot, rear manual side window shades, and ceramic controls. If you want upgraded leather in your X5, make sure to get the Ivory White Interior Design package (or the Mocha Design Interior package) that includes Ivory White Nappa leather upholstery, Black Nappa leather dashboard, and contrast stitching on the seats and dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The X5 earned a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (five stars is the highest possible rating). The IIHS issued the highest rating of Good for the X5’s moderate overlap front and side crash tests, but the remaining three crash tests have not been conducted.</p>

<p>For the front crash prevention evaluation, the X5 received two ratings. The SUV earned the rating of Advanced for reducing a 12-mph impact by 9 mph and reducing a 25-mph impact by 7 mph thanks to the optional Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation. However, the highest rating of Superior was issued to the X5 equipped with the optional Frontal Collision Warning with Extended Collision Mitigation for completely avoiding both 12- and 25-mph frontal collisions. City Collision Mitigation is included in the Active Driving Assistant system that is part of the Driving Assistance Plus Package. Extended City Collision Mitigation is part of the ACC Stop and Go + Active Driving Assistant system that can be added to the Driving Assistance Plus package that also consists of blind spot warning, a surround-view camera system, and a speed-limit indicator.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x5/2014/2014-bmw-x5-first-test/">First Test</a> review of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x5/2014/">2014 BMW X5</a>, we said that “the refreshed X5 is a nice update on the old truck. It’s a little quicker and it’s got more features and a better interior. On the whole, though, it still feels like it’s stuck in a midlife crisis. Does it want to be a two-row midsizer, or three-row full-size? Or does it want to be a sport wagon with a lift kit? We’re not really sure, and it doesn’t seem like BMW is, either.”</p>

<p>When we tested the 2016 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x5/2018/">BMW X5</a> xDrive40e plug-in hybrid in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x5-plug-in/2016/2016-bmw-x5-xdrive40e-plug-in-hybrid-first-test/">First Test</a> review, we didn’t like how the charging power tops out at 3.5 kilowatts, meaning owners can’t benefit from the 6.6 kW Level 2 public chargers. The plug-in can run up to 14 miles on all-electric power, not very impressive thanks to the 5,200-pound curb weight, but about even with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/xc90/2018/">Volvo XC90</a> T8 (14-mile range), <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> GLE550e (12 miles), and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/cayenne/2018/">Porsche Cayenne</a> S e-hybrid (14 miles). What the electrified powertrain did provide is quick acceleration, with a <em>Motor-Trend</em>-tested 0-60 mph time of 6.2 seconds. The X5’s gasoline engine kicks on smoothly when need and the SUV provides a comfortable ride. We said, “The X5 xDrive40e plug-in hybrid shows that anyone (with a lot of money) can get their hands on a spacious and tall four-cylinder BMW matched with 315mm-wide rear tires and sports car-like weight distribution, and it can drive more than 10 miles without using any gas.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In <em>Motor Trend’s</em> Real MPG testing, the plug-in X5 was rated at 18.5/26.3 (21.3 combined) mpg combined driving, lower than the EPA’s rating of 23/25 mpg (24 mpg combined).</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of a reorganized package and options structure, the X1 did not receive any significant changes for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p>The X1 is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s smallest and most affordable crossover, positioned below the new X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6.</p>

<p><strong>2018 X1 sDrive28i/xDrive28i</strong> <strong>xLine Design</strong>: The base xLine Design trims includes black high-gloss trim with pearl chrome accent, black SensaTec leather, 18-inch Y-spoke wheels, three driving modes (Eco Pro, Comfort, and Sport), satin aluminum roof rails, matte chrome exterior trim, eight-way power front seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, automatic climate control, power liftgate, a 6.5-inch center screen with iDrive and a controller, Bluetooth, and HD radio.</p>

<p><strong>2018 X1 sDrive28i/xDrive28i</strong> <strong>M Sport Design</strong>: The M Sport Design comes equipped with high-gloss roof rails, a sport automatic transmission, an aerodynamic kit, M steering wheel, Sport seats, 18-inch M double-spoke wheels, Shadowline exterior trim, and aluminum hexagon interior trim with Estoril Blue matt highlight.</p>

<p>Available on the xLine Design, the Luxury package comes with a choice of different Oyster Dakota leather color combinations and a choice of different fine-wood Oak grain trim with a pearl chrome accent. Both trims are also available with sliding and reclining rear seats, wireless charging, a Wi-Fi hotspot, Apple CarPlay, a Harman Kardon surround sound system, Sport seats (xLine Design), and M Sport suspension (M Sport Design).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x1/2018/">2018 BMW X1</a> is powered by a 228-hp, 258-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 backed by an eight-speed automatic and delivers an EPA-rated 23/32 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive (sDrive) and 22/31 mpg with all-wheel drive (xDrive). In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2016 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x1/2018/">BMW X1</a> xDrive28i hit 60 mph in a quick 6.8 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 122 feet.</p>

<p>In IIHS testing, the 2018 X1 received the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests and the second-highest rating of Advanced for front crash prevention for reducing the speed of a 12-mph collision by 10 mph and reducing the speed of a 25-mph collision by 7 mph thanks to the optional <strong>city</strong> emergency automatic braking system found in the Driving Assistance package. The <strong>extended</strong> emergency automatic braking system that comes with the optional adaptive cruise control system with stop &amp; go was not tested. The X1 is not considered a Top Safety Pick because the crossover received the second-lowest score of Marginal for the headlights evaluation. The Driving Assistance package comes with Active Driving Assistant that consists of lane departure warning, frontal collision warning, pedestrian protection, city emergency automatic braking and automatic high beams. The adaptive cruise control system with <strong>extended</strong> emergency braking is also available in that package for an additional cost.</p>

<p>The X1 crossover offers 27.1 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats up and 58.7 cubic feet with the seats down. Front passengers receive 40.4 inches of legroom and rear passengers get 37.0 inches.</p>

<p>The X1’s iDrive infotainment system is displayed on a 6.5-inch center screen with a rotary controller and comes with Bluetooth, HD radio, ConnectedDrive customer portal, and a USB port. A 205-watt audio system is standard along with remote engine start. A navigation system with a touchpad controller, SiriusXM satellite radio, Apple CarPlay, a wireless charger, and a head-up display are optional. Also optional is a 12-speaker Harman Kardon premium surround sound system, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and Remote Services. With Remote Services, you can use a smartphone app to control various functions of your vehicle like remote start with climate control, lock/unlock the doors, locate your vehicle, flash the lights, and access vehicle information and status.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x1/2017/2017-bmw-x1-xdrive28i-first-test-review/">First Test</a> of the 2017 BMW X1, the interior received mixed reviews—some found that many components felt and looked cheap while others liked the cabin. Same goes for the driving dynamics: certain editors enjoyed the nimble handling but others felt it was subpar with not enough grip and dull steering. However, most editors liked the powertrain that provides quick acceleration as well as fast and smooth shifts.  Most editors also commended the X1’s off-road performance. We concluded by saying, “It’s not as terrible as some editors made it out to be or as good as others defended it as. For an entry-level luxury crossover designed and marketed to customers who have no idea which wheels are driven or why it matters, the X1 is perfectly adequate.”</p>

<p>During Motor Trend’s <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/bmw-x1-2017-suv-of-the-year-contender/">SUV of the Year testing</a>, we liked the powertrain, interior room, and off-road performance. However, the narrow and unsupportive front seats, certain cheap interior components, and an unsure chassis keep the X1 from earning finalist status. “In all, we found the X1 confusing and unsure of itself. Is it a proper BMW? A Mini by way of Savile Row? Is it a nice little luxury crossover or badge engineering gone awry? One thing we could agree on: There was no consensus to advance it to the finals.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x2/2018/">BMW X2</a> compact crossover is new from the German automaker, adding another model to their lengthy lineup of premium crossovers. The X2 shares the same platform as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x1/2018/">BMW X1</a> but is shorter and lower.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s crossover lineup, the X2 is positioned above the X1 in price but below the larger X3, X4, X5, and X6. The X2 is the sportier and bolder version of the X1, but the new crossover lacks the extreme fastback styling of the bigger coupe-like X4 and X6 models.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The new <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x2/2018/2018-bmw-x2-first-look-review/">2018 BMW X2</a> will initially be offered in a single model called the X2 xDrive28i powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 that produces 228 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque and is backed by an eight-speed automatic that routes power to an xDrive all-wheel-drive system. BMW claims the X2 can hit 60 mph in 6.3 seconds, and we look forward to testing one soon.</p>

<p>Standard features for the 2018 X2 xDrive28i include the Driving Dynamics Control drive modes (Comfort, Eco Pro, and Sport), full LED headlights and taillights, 18-inch Y-spoke wheels (19-inch are available), SensaTec upholstery, adjustable interior ambient lighting, the sixth-generation of the iDrive infotainment system, a rear spoiler, and a 6.5-inch freestanding center display. Available features include Dynamic Damper Control (0.4 inches lower ride height), a panoramic moonroof, Dakota leather upholstery, and an 8.8-inch touchscreen display with navigation, a full-color head-up display, a Wi-Fi hotspot and Apple CarPlay compatibility. The X2 M Sport X package adds 19-inch M double-spoke wheels (20-inch are available), a sport-tuned transmission with paddle shifters, and exterior trim finishers with accent strips. An M rear spoiler and M Sport suspension are available with the M Sport X package.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>Driver assist safety features can be found in the Driving Assistance package that includes lane departure warning, speed limit information, automatic high beams, frontal collision warning, pedestrian warning, and the City Braking feature (automatic emergency braking). Additional driver assist safety features include adaptive cruise control and Active Driving Assistant that work together to keep the vehicle at a safe and predetermined distance to the vehicle ahead at speeds between 19 and 87 mph. A self-parking feature dubbed Parking Assistant (to help with parallel parking) and parking sensors are also optional. Although the IIHS has yet to test an X2, the BMW X1 — the crossover on which the X2 is based — is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Although the X2 has the same wheelbase as the X1, the X2 is 3.2 inches shorter and rides 2.8 inches lower, resulting in a more aggressive and sportier stance and improved driving dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>In addition to adding an updated iDrive multimedia system and standard LED headlights, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m4/2018/">2018 BMW M4</a> gets a new CS variant with more power as well as a specially tuned active M differential and adaptive suspension.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m4/2018/">BMW M4</a> is a compact rear-drive high performance coupe or convertible that slots above the M2 and below the M6.</p>

<p>Regardless of the body style, the 2018 M4 comes standard with LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, adaptive suspension, an active M differential, 10-way power front M Sport seats, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, keyless entry and start, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s iDrive interface with an 8.8-inch screen, cloth/leather upholstery and navigation.</p>

<p>Options include 19-inch alloy wheels, full leather upholstery, front and rear parking sensors, automatic parking assist, side and top view camera, a head-up display, carbon ceramic brakes, a heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay, a wireless charging pad and a moonroof.</p>

<p>The 2018 M4 is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo I-6 rated at 425 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque and can be paired to a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Opting for the Competition package increases total output to 444 hp. The most powerful version is the M4 CS, which is rated at 454 hp and 442 lb-ft.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the M4 coupe are 17/25 mpg city/highway with the manual and 17/24 mpg with the automatic. The M4 convertible is rated at 17/25 mpg with the manual and 16/22 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>Blind-spot monitoring is a standalone option as is the Active Driving Assistant, which bundles together forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, and lane departure warning.</p>

<p>The 2018 M4 coupe can hold 15.8 cubic feet of stuff, and that space can be expanded via the split-folding rear seats. Convertible models have 13.1 cubic feet of trunk space with the roof up and 7.8 cubic feet with the roof down.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m4/2015/2015-bmw-m3-m4-first-test/">2015 First Drive</a>, we said that the M4 drives identically to its M3 sedan sibling, offering excellent driving dynamics especially on the track. The ride, however, is stiff regardless of the suspension mode. Although the M4 has precise steering that’s weighted well, not much is communicated from the front tires.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rc-f/2015/2015-bmw-m4-vs-2015-lexus-rc-f-comparison/">2014 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rc/2018/">Lexus RC</a> F, the BMW M4 won because it was more engaging to drive. The M4’s engine gave it an edge over the RC F because of its torque-rich power band. Its lighter weight and minimal body roll also meant that the M4 was easier to drive fast. However, the M4’s higher performance threshold means it takes more time to get comfortable with its limits.</p>

<p>As with most BMW M vehicles, the M4 coupe features a carbon fiber roof to make it lighter; however, it gets deleted if you opt for the sunroof.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m3/2018/">2018 BMW M3</a> gets standard LED headlights and an updated iDrive multimedia system. A new CS variant with a m0re aggressive suspension setup and more power has been added, but only 550 units will be available for the U.S. market. The coupe version of the M3 is called the M4.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m3/2018/">BMW M3</a> comes in a single trim with a decent number of standard features that include an adaptive suspension, the active M differential, 18-inch alloy wheels, 14-way heated M sports seats up front, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s iDrive system with an 8.8-inch screen, navigation, a rearview camera, and keyless entry and start.</p>

<p>Options include a head-up display, side and top view camera, a heated steering wheel, automatic parking assist, front and rear parking sensors, 19-inch alloy wheels, a moonroof, Apple CarPlay, and a wireless charging pad. The M3 CS gets go fast extras like a specially-tuned adaptive suspension and active M differential, and cosmetic changes like a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic front splitter and rear diffuser.</p>

<p>The 2018 BMW M3 is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo I-6 rated at 425 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. With the Competition package, output increases to 444 hp. A six-speed manual is standard and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional. The M3 CS is the most powerful M3 available with 453 hp and 443 lb-ft. EPA fuel economy ratings ate 17/25 mpg city/highway with the manual and 17/24 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>The 2018 M3 hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. However, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/3-series/2018/">2018 BMW 3 Series</a>, the car on which the M3 is based, received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 3 Series received a Good score in crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side front small overlap impact where it hasn’t been tested yet and the headlights test where it received an Average score (Good is the possible highest score).</p>

<p>In the front crash prevention test, the 3 Series received an Advanced rating after it reduced the severity of a 12-mph and 25-mph impact by 7 mph and 6 mph respectively (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test) As a result, the 2018 3 Series received the Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Active drive assistance features are available as part of different optional package or as standalone extras. Blind-spot monitoring is available as a standalone option while automatic high beams are part of the Executive package. The Driving Assistance package adds speed limit info, and the Active Driving Assistance, which bundles together forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning.</p>

<p>The 2018 M3 has a 17-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m4/2015/2015-bmw-m3-m4-first-test/">2015 First Drive</a>, we were impressed with the M3’s on-track performance, offering excellent handling, flat cornering with nearly no body roll and plenty of power from its 3.0-liter twin-turbo. However, even with the adaptive suspension in its softest setting, the ride is firm on public roads, and there’s not enough feedback from the steering wheel.</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m3/2015/2015-bmw-m3-long-term-verdict/">Long-Term Verdict review of a 2015 model</a>, we concluded that the M3 is a fun sports sedan that works well as a daily driver thanks to its large trunk and spacious seating. Despite the squeaky carbon ceramic brakes, the M3 offered strong track performance when they got to the right temperature; however, for those who won’t take the car to the track, we’d recommend sticking with the standard pads.</p>

<p>In addition to the M3’s carbon fiber roof, the 2018 M3 CS has a carbon fiber hood to reduce the car’s overall weight and lower its center of gravity.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The M550i xDrive and the electrified 530e iPerformance join the 5 Series lineup for the 2018 model year. Full Merino leather and an Anthracite Alcantara headliner are now available and a leather dashboard is now a stand-alone option. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> also revised and added some equipment packages to the lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The 5 Series sedan slots right in the middle of BMW’s sedan lineup, above the 3 Series but below the flagship 7 Series. In price, the 5 Series is positioned above the 4 Series lineup but below the more expensive 6 Series Gran Coupe and convertible.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The entry-level <strong>530i</strong> and 530i xDrive (AWD) come powered by a 248-hp, 258-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine that delivers an EPA-rated 24/34 mpg city/highway and 23/33 mpg respectively. The <strong>530e</strong> and 530e xDrive plug-in models are rated at 29 mpg combined and 28 mpg combined and can drive up to 16 miles and 15 miles on all-electric power respectively. Both plug-in models are equipped with a 180-hp, 255-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 paired to an electric motor that produces a combined power output of 248 hp and 310 lb-ft. A 335-hp, 332-lb-ft 3.0-liter turbocharged I-6 powers the <strong>540i</strong> (20/30 mpg) and 540i xDrive (20/29 mpg). The <strong>M550i</strong> xDrive model packs a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 that churns out a potent 456 hp and 480 lb-ft of torque and delivers 16/25 mpg. All engines are backed by an eight-speed automatic, and an <strong>M5</strong> model is on the way.</p>

<p>Standard features for the 2018 5 Series include 18-inch double spoke light alloy wheels, adaptive LED headlights and LED fog lights, 16-way power adjustable driver’s seat, an 8.8-inch digital cluster, a 205-watt 12-speaker audio system, iDrive 6.0, BMW navigation with a 10.2-inch touchscreen, and interior ambient lighting with 11 colors to choose from. For driving enthusiasts, the available Dynamic Handling Package on the M550i includes Integral Active Steering, an adaptive system that increases steering speed at low speeds and decreases it at high speeds in addition to rear-wheel steering. The package also consists of the Active Roll Stabilization system and the Adaptive M Suspension plus that delivers a great combination of comfort and handling.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/5-series/2018/">BMW 5 Series</a> received a five-star rating from the NHTSA for the sedan’s overall score (out of a possible five stars) and the IIHS’ top honor of a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ for scoring the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests (small overlap front, moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and head restraints and seats) and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention. The 5 Series was able to avoid 12- and 25-mph forward collisions thanks to the available Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation found in the Driving Assistance Plus package. The package also includes the self-parking system, Parking Assistant Plus, a surround view camera system with 3D view, blind spot warning, daytime pedestrian protection, lane departure warning, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/5-series/2018/2018-bmw-530e-edrive-plug-in-hybrid-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the new 2018 530e plug-in, we enjoyed all the green-coaching displays, improved efficiency over the last 5 Series hybrid, the sedan’s decent handling on twisty roads, good levels of grip on wet roads, and steering effort, although there was little to no feel. The best part about the sedan was the extra price for the plug-in over the regular 530i — just $200. We said, “So, what is it? A darned good bargain if A) you can resist its zillion packages and options, B) you feel guilty rattling around in that 4,500-square-foot house just the two of you, and you’re determined to make carbon amends, and C) you aren’t expecting the Ultimate Driving 5 Series.”</p>

<p>After reviewing the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/5-series/2017/2017-bmw-540i-m-sport-first-drive-closing-door/">2017 BMW 540i M Sport</a>, we said: “Bestowed with interior perfumes, the highly functional iDrive 6.0, gesture control, and a generous overhaul with quality cabin materials, the substantially more fanciful G30 cabin will be a major contributor to positive acclaim.” The driver assist features and semi-autonomous system were impressive, the driving dynamics were spot-on, and acceleration was stout.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The sedan’s available Display Key uses the Remote Control Parking feature to maneuver the 5 Series into or out of a parking space while standing outside the vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 M6 is only available in two body styles: the convertible and the coupe-like sedan called the Gran Coupe. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> has discontinued the M6 Coupe.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m6/2018/">2018 BMW M6</a> is a high-performance, rear-drive convertible or sedan that slots above the smaller M3 and M4. It’s available as a single loaded trim.</p>

<p>Standard features include 20-inch alloy wheels, an Active M differential, a performance-tuned suspension and drive model selector, full LED headlights, heated 20-way power adjustable front multi-contour seats. a 16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, Bluetooth, BMW’s iDrive interface with a 10.2-inch screen, navigation, a rearview camera, keyless entry and start, parking sensors, ambient lighting, a wireless phone charging pad, and leather upholstery.</p>

<p>Options include Individual two-tone leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, a 16-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, heated rear seats (Gran Coupe only), active front seats, power rear and side sunshades, a surround-view camera system, Apple CarPlay, carbon ceramic brakes, and night vision.</p>

<p>The 2018 M6 comes with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 560 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual or a seven-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission are the two gearboxes available. Output increases to 600 hp when equipped with the Competition package.

For more cargo capacity, the M6 Gran Coupe has 16.2 cubic feet with the split-folding rear seats in place and 44.7 cubic feet with them folded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m6/2013/2012-bmw-m6-convertible-first-test/">2013 First Test</a>, we said that the M5 offers strong straight-line performance and, for such a large car its stopping ability is impressively short. Despite its size, the M6 handles in a neutral manner but is also capable of big smoky power slides thanks to its potent turbocharged engine. The interior is well-appointed and the convertible’s soft top can be raised and stowed at speeds of up to 25 mph.</p>

<p>The BMW M6 is currently the only M vehicle available as a four-door coupe-like sedan called the Gran Coupe.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x3/2018/">BMW X3</a> has been redesigned for 2018 and the lineup now features an M Performance model, the X3 M40i. The available head-up display is 75 percent larger and the standard 10.25-inch touchscreen is available with Gesture Control technology. Active Protection pre-crash accident detection system is standard along with sport seats and three-zone automatic climate control. Aerodynamics were improved with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> Active Kidney Grille, underbody cladding, a roof spoiler with aero blades, and Air Curtains.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The X3 slots in the middle of BMW’s SUV lineup above the entry-level X1 but below the larger X5. The X3 is also positioned before the X4 and X6 SUV coupes. If you’d consider a wagon or hatchback, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/3-series/2018/">BMW 3 Series</a> is offered as a wagon and spacious four-door hatchback.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>At first, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x3/2018/">2018 BMW X3</a> will be offered in two models, but expect more to join the lineup later. The standard X3 xDrive30i is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 that produces 248 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The quicker and more expensive X3 M40i utilizes a 3.0-liter turbocharged I-6 that cranks out 355 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. An eight-speed automatic backs both engines and all-wheel drive is standard.</p>

<p>The 2018 BMW X3 will come standard with the new iDrive 6.0 system with the iDrive Controller and 10.25-inch touchscreen.  BMW Gesture Control, which involves making gestures with your hand to control various features (such as adjusting volume or skipping to the next track) is optional.

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In <em>Motor Trend’s</em> <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx200t/2015/the-big-test-2015-luxury-compact-crossovers/">2015 Big Test of luxury crossovers</a>, the BMW X3 xDrive28i (a last-generation model) came in second out of five contenders. We didn’t like some interior materials, the average ride quality, and felt there wasn’t enough outside sound reduction. However, the SUV was fun to drive, had good value and decent fuel economy compared to the rest of the pack. We said, “Scary days await the competition if BMW ever decides to sex up its interiors.”</p>

<p>Stay tuned to MotorTrend.com — we’ll update this space as soon as we have a chance to drive the 2018 X3.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>BMW claims the X3 M40i can hit 60 mph in 4.6 seconds, which is quick for the segment.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/3-series/2018/">2018 BMW 3 Series</a> received the highest five-star rating from the NHTSA for the sedan’s overall safety rating. The 3 Series is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS (the organization’s highest honor) for getting the highest score of Good in all crash evaluations and the score of Advanced for front crash prevention with the available Frontal Collision with City Collision Mitigation. The 3 Series was able to reduce the speed of a 12 mph collision by 7 mph and the speed of a 25 mph collision by 6 mph. That safety feature is part of the Driving Assistance package that includes speed limit information and the Active Driving Assistant that consists of lane departure warning, pedestrian warning, and the previously mentioned forward collision warning with City Collision Mitigation. Blind spot warning, front and rear parking sensors, and adaptive cruise control are standalone options.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In an <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-bmw-330i-audi-a4-mercedes-benz-c300-cadillac-ats-jaguar-xe-lexus-is-200t-volvo-s60-comparison/">eight-way premium car Big Test comparison</a>, the 2017 BMW 330i came in second to last place due to lack of fun driving dynamics, dated interior with average quality, and the fact that it was not a leader in any category. However, we did like the ride comfort and zingy engine. “How the mighty have fallen. The reigning winner and standard-bearer of the class suffers from old age, dulled dynamics, and a lack of personality.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xe/2017/bmw-335i-m-sport-vs-jaguar-xe-s-comparison/">Head-2-Head comparison</a> between the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xe/2017/">2017 Jaguar XE</a> S and the 2015 BMW 335i M Sport (an upgraded and revised version became the 340i), the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> came out the victor due to its sexier design, strong power, impressive suspension set-up, light-footed feeling, and the overall fun, sporty, and scalpel-like driving dynamics. “I appreciate the BMW’s solid, confident, and accommodating persona that has kept it at the top with customers and journalists for decades. But to me, sportiness is key. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xe/2018/">Jaguar XE</a> S is every bit as good as the BMW 335i while being more fun to drive. All I can add is, ‘Amen’.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>BMW’s straight-six engine is a rarity in today’s market. The single-turbo unit used in the M3 produces 406 lb-ft of torque from just 1,850 rpm all the way to 5,500 rpm, where the engine hits its max power output of 425 hp.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m2/2018/">2018 BMW M2</a> gets standard LED headlights, replacing the HID units.</p>

<p>The 2018 M2 coupe comes in a single trim with standard features including 19-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights,  14-way power adjustable front sports seats, leather upholstery, a Harman Kardon audio system, Bluetooth, the iDrive interface with an 8.8-inch screen, navigation, a rearview camera, keyless entry and start, and a rear spoiler.</p>

<p>Options include Apple CarPlay, a moonroof, and the Executive package, which adds adaptive headlights, a wireless charger, rear parking sensor, and a heated steering wheel.</p>

<p>The 2018 M2 is powered by a 3.0-liter turbo I-6 with 365 hp and 343 lb-ft of torque paired to a standard six-speed manual or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 18/26 mpg city/highway for the manual and 20/26 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>The 2018 M2 hasn’t been rated by the NHTSA and IIHS. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/2-series/2018/">2018 BMW 2 Series</a>, the car on which the M2 is based, received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side front overlap test where it hasn’t been tested yet and the headlights test where it received an Acceptable rating (Good is the highest possible score). On the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 2 Series received an Advanced rating after it reduced the severity of a 12-mph impact by 10 mph and a 25-mph impact by 7 mph (Superior is the highest rating on the front crash prevention test). As a result, the 2018 2 Series received the 2018 Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>The 2018 M2 has a 13.8-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2016-bmw-m2-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the M2’s performance, which nearly matches the larger, more powerful M4 in acceleration and grip. Despite being on the heavier side, the M2 is fun to drive with excellent steering feel, a playful chassis, and surprisingly precise manual transmission. The stiff suspension does mean ride quality suffers and there’s no adaptive suspension option that lets you soften it.</p>

<p>The new 2018 i3s model features a sport chassis, wider track, and more power. For the 2018 model year, the i3 also receives an exterior refresh, the latest iDrive 6 interface, and standard full LED headlights. There is also a new cloth-leather trim combination called Giga Brown with natural leather and Carum Spice Grey cloth and two new exterior colors: Melbourne Red Metallic and Imperial Blue Metallic.</p>

<p>The i3 hatchback is one of two <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> i EVs along with the much more expensive and quick i8.</p>

<p><strong>2018 i3</strong>: The i3 comes standard with 19-inch i Turbine light alloy wheels, LED headlights, power-folding and heated side view mirrors, black mirror caps, Kenaf interior dash and door panels, the Deka World interior, manual adjustable front seats, and a 6.5-inch center display with the latest iDrive system, BMW Navigation Business, Bluetooth, SiriusXM satellite radio, HD radio, and a USB port. Also standard is automatic climate control, rear parking sensors, heated front seats, and fast-charging capability.</p>

<p><strong>2018 i3s</strong>: The i3s sports trim adds a more powerful electric motor, sport suspension, 20-inch i double spoke bicolor light alloy wheels, flared wheel arches, and a black A-pillar and roof trim.</p>

<p>Interior environment options include the standard Deka World, but for an additional cost, Mega, Giga, and Tera World interiors are available. Each one has its own unique color combination, seat fabric, and renewable material sources. The only available package is the Technology + Driving Assistant package that consists of BMW Navigation with ConnectedDrive Services, real-time traffic information, and adaptive cruise control with Active Driving Assistant. Options include a moonroof, Apple CarPlay, and a blue seatbelt strap (i3s only).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/i3/2018/">2018 BMW i3</a>’s powertrain consists of a 33 kWh battery pack that powers a 170-hp, 184-lb-ft of torque rear-mounted electric motor that routes power to the rear wheels through a one-speed automatic. The i3s packs the same electric motor but with more power output, 184 hp and 199 lb-ft of torque. Without the range extender engine, the 2017 i3 has an EPA-rated driving range of 114 miles on a full charge and 118 mpge combined driving. The optional range extender engine is a small 0.6-liter two-cylinder engine that produces 38 hp and 41 lb-ft of torque and supplements the battery pack once all electricity is drained (has no mechanical connection to the rear wheels). When equipped, the full-electric range drops to 97 miles and 111 mpge but the total driving range increases to 180 miles. Using a Level 2 charger will take about 4.5 hours to charge a depleted battery. Once 2018-model-year fuel economy numbers are released for the i3s, we will update this section. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the i3 with the range extender hit 60 mph in 7.0 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 125 feet.</p>

<p>In IIHS testing, the i3 received the highest rating of Good in four crash tests and the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the head restraints and seats evaluation. Front crash prevention was given the second-highest rating of Advanced because the hatchback reduced a 12 mph collision by 9 mph and reduced a 25 mph collision by 7 mph thanks to the optional emergency automatic braking feature found in the Technology + Driving Assistant package. Besides the previously mentioned technology features, the package also includes adaptive cruise control with stop and go functionality and Active Driving Assistant that consists of emergency automatic braking, frontal collision warning, pedestrian detection, and speed limit information. The standard BMW Assist eCall includes emergency request (SOS button) and enhanced automatic collision notification, and BMW Remote Services includes stolen vehicle recovery, remote door unlock and BMW Connected App compatibility. Front and rear parking sensors are optional.</p>

<p>Cargo space is not one of the i3’s fortes, as the small hatchback offers 15.1 cubic feet with the seats up and 36.9 cubic feet with the seats down. Front passengers receive 40.5 inches of legroom and rear passengers get a tight 31.9 inches. With the rear seats up, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2018/">Chevrolet Bolt EV</a> has a similar 16.9 cubic feet of cargo space, but with the seats down, that increases to 56.6 cubic feet. The Bolt EV has 41.6 inches of front legroom and 36.5 inches of rear legroom.</p>

<p>The i3 comes equipped with BMW Navigation Business and iDrive systems with a rotary controller and a 6.5-inch center display screen. The system also includes Bluetooth, SiriusXM satellite radio, HD radio, and a USB port. A 16-speaker Harman Kardon surround sound audio system, Apple CarPlay, and a self-parking system are optional. The optional upgraded BMW Navigation system with ConnectedDrive services takes in all relevant factors into account when routing the i3, including battery charge level, driving style, traffic, and elevation changes. The i3 is capable of DC fast charming (7.4 kW) and comes with an occasional use chagrin cable (1.2 kW).</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/i3/2017/2017-bmw-i3-range-extender-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/i3/2018/">BMW i3</a>, we felt that the renewable materials in the interior were “painfully hipster L.A.,” but the seats were comfortable, outward visibility was good, and the hatchback offered an SUV-like driving position. Like most EVs, the i3 is quick off the line and offers pretty quick acceleration, but because of the very narrow tires, the braking distance is a little long and handling dynamics are not fun. We look forward to finding out if that changes at all with the new 2018 i3s model.</p>

<p>Additionally, in our review of a 2017 model, we found that the narrow tires coupled with quick steering make highway travel uneasy and ride quality deteriorates. When the range extender engine turned on while on the highway, it was seamless, but when at a stop, it was obvious with vibration and a generator-like noise. “Although decidedly not the way forward, ” we concluded, “the BMW i3 still marks an important step in society’s transition from the internal combustion engine to electrification. Like the Ryan FR-1 Fireball, the U.S. Navy’s first jet airplane, which supplemented the jet turbine with an old-fashioned piston-powered propeller, the i3 REx will ultimately go down as a Wikipedia oddity that helped forward the march of progress. In the meantime, though, the 2017 i3, like the MiG-21, might be outgunned by the latest and greatest EVs, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a place for it in an ever-expanding electrified market.”.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> refreshes the 2 Series with new LED headlights and taillights, and an updated interior including new instrument panel stitching and a new instrument cluster.

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The IIHS gave the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/2-series/2017/">2017 BMW 2 Series</a> its highest honor of 2017 Top Safety Pick+ for scoring the highest score of Good for all crash evaluations (small overlap front, moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and head restraints and seats) and for the second highest score of Advanced for front crash prevention. The 2 Series was able to reduce the speed of a 12 mph frontal collision by 10 mph and the speed of a 25 mph collision by 7 mph thanks to the optional Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation driver assist safety feature found in the available Driving Assistance Plus package. That package also consists of lane departure warning and Pedestrian Protection, a feature that can detect pedestrians and automatically brakes if needed to avoid a collision. Speed Limit Info and automatic high beams are also included in the above package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/2-series/2014/2014-bmw-228i-coupe-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2014 BMW 228i (the 228i has been replaced by the 230i), we enjoyed the premium sports coupe for its fun driving dynamics and usable but small size. We said, “The 2 Series is superior to the previous 1 Series in every way with its more streamlined looks, better performance and fuel economy, and more livable dimensions,” and, “The bottom line is that the 2 Series is a huge win for BMW enthusiasts everywhere, and even if it isn’t the reborn 2002 that BMW’s marketing campaign says it is, it still marks a return to form for the roundel brand.”</p>

<p>We had a blast driving the 2014 M235i during our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/2-series/2014/2014-bmw-m235i-first-test/">First Test review</a> because the car is reminiscent of the discontinued, fun-to-drive and compact 1 Series M (or 1M). About the car that has been replaced by the M240i, we said: “The M235i is one of the best-driving BMWs in recent memory, on par with the 1M and the last-generation M3 not only in performance standards, but also in how much it makes you smile.”</p>

But as the BMW is about 95 percent as capable as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> (identical 0.94 max g, too), but offers so much more in desirability, craftsmanship, and that all-important X-factor, we’re calling it the winner.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/6-series/2013/2013-bmw-640i-gran-coupe-first-test/">2013 First Test review</a>, we enjoyed the driving dynamics and styling of the Gran Coupe but felt the car was too expensive and had tight rear seats, “Problem for the [Gran Coupe], though, is that the A7 and CLS are quicker, and the Panamera is more engaging and dynamically capable. Moreover, our well-equipped tester exited the checkout line at $99,645. Ouch.”</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/regal/2018/">Buick Regal</a> is a midsize car that’s available in front- or all-wheel-drive configurations. Two body styles are available including the <strong>TourX </strong>wagon and a sedan-like hatchback called the <strong>Sportback</strong>. There’s also a performance-oriented model called the Regal GS, which comes standard with all-wheel drive but is only available in the Sportback. All Regal TourX wagons come standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/">Buick</a> Regal is available with two engine choices including a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 250 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque on front-drive models, or 295 lb-ft on all-wheel drive variants. This engine comes paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission in front-drive guise or an eight-speed unit in all-wheel-drive cars. A 3.6-liter V-6 with 310 hp and 282 lb-ft is exclusive to the Regal GS and comes only with the nine-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 22/32 mpg city/highway for the front-drive Regal Sportback and 21/29 mpg for the all-wheel-drive variant and the Regal TourX wagon. Go for the all-wheel-drive Regal GS and the fuel economy ratings are 19/27 mpg.</p>

<p>Both variants offer excellent cargo space at 31.5 cubic feet with the split-folding rear seats up and 60.7 cubic feet with them down. Should you need more space, the Regal TourX wagon has 32.7 cubic feet behind the split-folding rear seats and 73.5 cubic feet with them folded.</p>

<p>Available active safety features include automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane change assist, blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, pedestrian detection, lane keeping assist with lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a 2018 <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/regal/2018/2018-buick-regal-quick-drive-review/">Quick Drive</a> review, we noted that the Regal Sportback with the 2.0-liter turbo-four accelerates merely adequately and the transmission shifts smoothly. The larger TourX wagon drives similarly but feels its size. With its more powerful engine, the Regal GS accelerates with more authority and the engine has a pleasing sound. The nine-speed automatic shifts smoothly and the Continuous Damping Control system smoothens out the ride on uneven road surfaces.</p>

<p>Changes to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2018/">2018 Buick Encore</a> include an available ionizing interior air cleaner, HD radio, a standard capless fuel filler, and a new exterior color – Coppertino Metallic.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Encore is the smallest crossover in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/">Buick</a>’s lineup, positioned before the large and more expensive Envision and Enclave and is the automaker’s most affordable vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2018/">Buick Encore</a> utilizes a 1.4-liter turbocharged I-4 with two different power outputs. The standard multi-port injection version makes 138 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque and has an EPA-rating of 25/33 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 24/30 mpg with all-wheel drive (AWD). The optional direct-port injection version churns out 153 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque and delivers 27/33 mpg with front-wheel drive and 26/31 mpg with AWD. A six-speed automatic is the only available transmission. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, a 2017 Buick Encore Sport Touring with front-wheel drive hit 60 mph in 8.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 119 feet.</p>

<p>Standard equipment includes an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, a 4.3-inch driver’s display, 2 USB ports, Quiet Tuning with active noise cancellation, OnStar with a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, a six-way power driver’s seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, LED daytime running lights, and 18-inch wheels. Available features include dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a seven-speaker Bose audio system, heated leather-appointed front seats, a heated steering wheel, LED headlights, Buick’s IntelliLink infotainment system with navigation, and a power moonroof.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2017 Buick Encore performed well in IIHS crash test evaluations by scoring the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests. The lowest rating of Basic was given for the front crash prevention evaluation due to the crossover’s ability to warn the driver of a possible collision, but the Encore does not have tech that will automatically brake for the driver. The NHTSA issued the 2017 Encore the highest five-star rating for the crossover’s overall score. A rearview camera is standard and available driver assist safety features include rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot warning, front and rear parking sensors, forward collision alert, and lane departure warning.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2017/2017-buick-encore-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the refreshed 2017 Buick Encore, we liked the power increase from the standard engine and said, “The Encore no longer saunters off the line from a stop but instead eagerly zips forward to plug a gap in traffic like a good city car ought to.” Ride and body control are good and steering is nice, but at high rpms, things start to vibrate in the cabin.</p>

<p>The interior has been improved, is quiet, and offers a good infotainment system: “The new Buick Intellilink infotainment system (which is identical to <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a>’s Intellilink and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevy</a>’s MyLink) is among the most intuitive in the industry, and it really allowed Buick’s designer’s to reduce clutter in the cabin by eliminating all of the old infotainment system’s buttons.”</p>

<p>“Not many in the segment save for maybe the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-3/2018/">Mazda CX-3</a> can rival the Encore’s balance of luxury and performance,” we said near the end of our review. “With value like that, it’s easy to envision the Encore continuing to lead Buick’s sales charts.”</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2017/2017-buick-encore-sport-touring-first-test-review-premium-non-premium/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Buick Encore Sport Touring, we were impressed with the standard features of the affordable crossover but not on “some not-so-premium qualities that include partially powered front seats (manual recline), lack of a front passenger armrest (driver gets one), an intrusive and annoying automatic start/stop that can’t be turned off, a rough-shifting transmission, and moaning engine. Not to mention the tiny rear seat that practically makes it a four-seater with adults as passengers.”</p>

<p>We enjoyed the ride and the quiet interior the crossover provided but not the lack of fun driving dynamics. The Encore received good crash safety scores, but we wish it had automatic emergency braking. At the end of our review we liked the Encore but felt the Buick was not a true premium vehicle but instead a tweener and said: “The Encore’s fast and intuitive IntelliLink infotainment system, two USB ports, very quiet interior, good fuel economy, comfortable ride quality, nice outward visibility, urban-friendly dimensions, OnStar, and affordable price tag results in a very appealing package for the A-to-B driver that prefers a high-riding cute-ute with premium qualities. So if the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> is too much and the HR-V’s luxury just doesn’t cut it, go for the Buick tweener.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Encore shares the same platform as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">Chevrolet Trax</a>, Spark, Sonic, and Europe’s Opel Mokka.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The LaCrosse now comes standard with a more fuel efficient eAssist light electrification hybrid powertrain, a nine-speed automatic now backs the available V-6, all-wheel drive (AWD) has been expanded to the Essence model, and three new exterior colors are now available: Satin Steel Metallic, Dark Slate Metallic, and Red Quartz Tintcoat.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The LaCrosse is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/">Buick</a>’s flagship and is now the only sedan in the automaker’s lineup, positioned above the Regal Sportback hatchback and Regal TourX wagon. The LaCrosse has a lower starting price than the Envision crossover.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Buick Lacrosse’s powertrain consists of a 2.5-liter I-4 engine paired to a small electric motor and backed by a six-speed automatic transmission with front-wheel drive. The combined power output is 194 hp and 187 lb-ft of torque, the sedan delivers an EPA-rated 25/35 mpg city/highway. The optional 3.6-liter V-6 produces 310 hp and 268 lb-ft and delivers 21/30 mpg with front-wheel drive and 20/29 with AWD and is only paired to the nine-speed automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, The V-6 powered 2017 LaCrosse hit 60 mph in 6.3 seconds with front-wheel drive and in 6.2 seconds with all-wheel drive (those LaCrosses used an eight- and not nine-speed automatic).</p>

<p>The 2018 LaCrosse comes standard with LED interior lighting, OnStar with a 4G LTE WiFi-hotspot, Quiet Tuning with active noise cancellation, remote vehicle start, 8-way power front seats with leatherette trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, HID headlights, active grille shutters for improved fuel efficiency, 18-inch wheels, dual zone climate control, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Buick’s IntelliLink infotainment system with Apple Carplay/Android Auto. Available features include a Continuous Damping Control system, perforated leather-appointed seats, massaging front seats, heated steering wheel, Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound system with HD radio, a head-up display, wireless charging, articulating HID lights, panoramic moonroof, power rear sunshade, and 20-inch wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/lacrosse/2018/">2018 Buick LaCrosse</a> received the highest five-star rating from the NHTSA for the sedan’s overall rating. The 2017 LaCrosse is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick (the second highest honor) for receiving the highest score of Good in all crash evaluations and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention (the “+” designation was missed due to a Poor score in headlights). The Superior rating was issued because the sedan properly warned the driver of a possible collision, avoided a 12 mph collision, and reduced the speed of a 25 mph collision by 24 mph thanks to the front automatic braking feature found in the Driver Confidence Package 2. That package also includes adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection and automatic park assist. The Driver Confidence Package 1 includes rear-cross traffic alert and blind spot warning with lane change warning. Forward collision warning and a following distance indicator are additional driver assist features. A rearview camera, safety seat alert, and rear parking sensors are standard.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest problems for the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/lacrosse/2018/">Buick LaCrosse</a> is the interior. In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/lacrosse/2017/2017-buick-lacrosse-first-test-review/">First Test review</a>, we said, “It looks very nice, until you get up close. Numerous editors complained about cheap materials on the dashboard and center console. It also took a lot of heat for fake wood that wouldn’t fool a toddler and fake stitching on the dash top that isn’t even carried around the corners, much less actually joining anything. The rubberlike buttons were picked on, too.”</p>

<p>The large rear seat lacked some head room: “The rear seat, although praised for its leg, hip, and shoulder room, also lost a noticeable inch of headroom.” However, the new chassis provided good and sporty handling for a big sedan, much better than the last, and the updated V-6 powertrain improved performance stats across the board, hitting 60 mpg in a respectable 6.2 seconds. We also enjoyed the good fuel economy for a big sedan and the long list of standard features.</p>

<p>“The new Buick LaCrosse is fundamentally a good car and a strong update from the previous model. It’s a letdown, unfortunately, due to a failure to sweat the small details, and that’s a pity because it’s so close to being a home run. It’s a good car, but we’ve come to expect better from Buick.”</p>

<p>The LaCrosse provides a very comfortable ride, even with the optional 20-inch wheels. “The ride is comfortable, but it’s nearly as good and almost as quiet with the 20-inch wheels that only 20 or so percent of buyers will choose. Those 20s not only make the car more attractive but also improve steering feel and add an upgraded suspension with continuous damping control on front-drive cars,” we said in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/lacrosse/2017/2017-buick-lacrosse-first-drive-review-playing-strengths/">First Drive review</a>. We enjoyed the large and comfortable rear seats and the wider opening rear doors. We ended our review by saying, “Not everyone wants to drive (or can afford) a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es/2018/">Lexus ES</a>. When you want something semi-premium and spacious, consider the new LaCrosse.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the QuietTuning technology, Buick took many steps to quiet the LaCrosse including standard active noise cancellation, acoustic wheel well liners, acoustic-laminated windows, triple-sealed doors, improved body noise sealing, and windshield wiper set below the hood line for reduced noise.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/cascada/2018/">2018 Buick Cascada</a> is now available in three new colors, Rioja Red Metallic, Dark Moon Blue Metallic, and Carrageen Metallic. The Dark Effects package for the Sport Touring trim is now available with the Ebony Twilight Metallic and Summit White exterior colors, in addition to Sport Red. Two new roof colors include Malbec and Sweet Mocha.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/cascada/2018/">Buick Cascada</a> is a front-drive, four-seat convertible and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/">Buick</a>’s first drop top since the Reatta, which was produced from 1988 to 1991.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Buick Cascada is powered by a 1.6-liter turbo-four with 200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque that comes paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. Torque rises to 221 lb-ft when the engine goes into overboost for a short period of time. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/29 mpg city/highway. With the roof up, there’s 13.4 cubic feet of trunk space but that shrinks to 9.8 cubic feet with the roof down.</p>

<p>Standard features include 20-inch alloy wheels, rear parking sensors, leather upholstery, HID headlights, 10-way power adjustable front seats, dual-zone climate control, a seven-speaker audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, Buick’s IntelliLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, a heated steering wheel, 4G LTE connectivity, and a rearview camera. Options include front parking sensors, fog lights, alloy sport pedals, and the Dark Effects package, which includes red contrast stitching in the interior, Piano Black trim, gloss black side mirror covers, and body-colored fog light accents and rear accent moldings.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Buick Cascada received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). Forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and automatic headlight control are available as part of the Driver Confidence package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/cascada/2016/2016-buick-cascada-convertible-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a>, we said that the Cascada is a cruiser and is best driven as such. The six-speed automatic is slow to respond and its fuel economy isn’t very good because of its curb weight of right around two tons. The interior is quiet quiet even with the top down and even with the 20-inch alloy wheels, the Cascada rides reasonably well. In a straight line, the Cascada isn’t quick even with 200 hp and 207 to 221 lb-ft of torque on tap due to its curb weight.</p>

<p>As we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/cascada/2016/2016-buick-cascada-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, some interior materials look cheap and don’t belong in a car that’s aimed at premium-branded cars.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Buick Cascada is manufactured in Poland.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/envision/2018/">Buick Envision</a> enters the new model year without any significant changes.</p>

<p>The Envision is positioned right in the middle of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/">Buick</a>’s crossover lineup, above the entry-level Encore but below the larger and more expensive Enclave.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Envision 1SV</strong>: The base Envision comes standard with an 8.0-inch center touchscreen with Buick Infotainment System that features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 4.2-inch  driver’s display, dual-zone climate control, QuietTuning with active noise cancellation, OnStar 4G LTE with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, two USB ports, eight-way powered and heated cloth and leatherette front seats, rear one-touch flat-folding seats, a hands-free power liftgate, express up and down windows (all), rearview camera, rear parking sensors, 18-inch aluminum wheels, and automatic headlights.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Envision Preferred</strong>: Unlike the base model that does not offer any additional options or packages and is only available in Summit White, the Preferred trim offers the same standard features as the base model and five additional packages, many optional features, and a selection of exterior colors to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Envision Essence</strong>: The Essence trim is the next step up and adds leather-appointed seating, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, tri-zone automatic climate control, rear cross-traffic alert, lane change assist with blind-spot monitoring, 18-inch polished aluminum wheels, and chrome roof rails.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Envision Premium</strong>: The Premium trim kicks up the power and luxury with the upgraded 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, all-wheel drive, 19-inch Manoogian Silver wheels, HiPer Strut front suspension, an 8.0-inch driver’s display screen, a seven-speaker Bose audio system, lane keep assist with lane departure warning, forward collision alert, front and rear parking sensors, Safety Seat Alert, dual exhaust with bright tips, and automatic windshield wipers.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Envision Premium II</strong>: The range-topping trim comes standard with a head-up display, a navigation system, heated and cooled front seats, Automatic Parking Assist (self-parking system), and articulating HID headlights.</p>

<p>For additional safety opt for the Driver Confidence package that consists of forward automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and a surround vision camera system.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2018/">2018 Buick Encore</a> comes standard with a 2.5-liter I-4 that produces 197 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 22/29 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 21/27 mpg with all-wheel drive. The available 252-hp, 260 lb-ft 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 (standard in the Premium model) is only available with all-wheel drive and comes with a rating of 20/26 mpg. A six-speed automatic backs both engines. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/envision/2017/">2017 Buick Envision</a> T AWD (turbo) hit 60 mph in 7.1 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 120 feet, both respectable numbers for the segment.</p>

<p>The 2017 Buick Envision received top honors from both the NHTSA and IIHS. The Envision received the highest possible overall rating of five stars from the NHTSA and is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ for receiving the highest score of Good in all five crash tests and the second highest score of Advanced for the front crash prevention test. The Advanced score was earned because the crossover properly warned the driver of a possible collision, avoided a 12 mph collision and reduced the speed of a 25 mph collision by 9 mph thanks to the front automatic braking feature found in the Driver Confidence package. That package also includes adaptive cruise control with full-range speed and a surround vision camera system. The Top Safety Pick+ rating was also issued because the Envision received the second highest score of Acceptable for the headlights evaluation. Other available driver assist safety features include forward collision alert, following distance indicator, lane keep assist with lane departure warning, rear-cross traffic alert, blind-spot monitoring, and lane change alert. A rearview camera is standard and the Safety Seat Alert is standard on the Premium trims.</p>

<p>The 2018 Buick Envision offers a healthy 26.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second-row and a maximum of 57.3 cubic feet with the seats down. Not bad, but the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rdx/2018/">Acura RDX</a> offers a similar 26.1 cubic feet with the seats up and a whopping 61.3 cubic feet with the seats down. Legroom for the Envision totals 40.9 inches for the front seats and 37.5 inches for rear passengers.</p>

<p>All Envision models come equipped an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Buick Infotainment System (Preferred II trim comes with navigation), Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and two USB ports for smartphone connectivity and charging. SiriusXM satellite radio, OnStar Guidance, OnStar 4G LTE, and OnStar Basic are additional standard tech features. The standard configurable driver’s display screen is 4.2 inches but the available one is a sizable 8.0 inches. The seven-speaker Bose sound system and a head-up display are optional, as is the Automatic Park Assist self-parking system. The three standard 12-volt outlets and the available 110-volt power outlet (and the two USB ports) will make sure all your electronic devices are charged up.</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/envision/2017/2017-buick-envision-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the Buick Envision, we found the power from the 2.5-liter to be adequate but the engine works hard to move the crossover, and Buick did not do a good job of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) control. The 2.0-liter turbo-four provides much better acceleration and with less NVH. The standard six-speed automatic is good and “Buick deserves credit for how smartly tuned the six-speed automatic is; it shifts quickly, is willing to downshift, and doesn’t hunt gears.”</p>

<p>The driving experience is decent at best, the suspension is soft but transfers too much hardness over rough roads and at highway speeds. Wind and tire noise is obvious; this crossover is not quiet. The interior is luxurious with a good infotainment system and huge backseat, but, “look past the wrapper, though, and the Buick is pretty disappointing. Most of the materials below the armrests are grainy economy-grade plastics, the kind that makes the cringe-inducing scratching sounds as you run your fingernails along it. The same hard plastic frustratingly even covers the back of the front seats instead of the usual practice of wrapping the entire seat in fabric. Above your beltline, the materials aren’t up to snuff, either. The wood trim, though it looks stellar, is lacquered to the point that it feels like plastic.”</p>

<p>At the end of our review, we said, “…In a day and age where luxury crossover buyers have more choice than ever before, the Buick’s bourgeois pretensions won’t be enough to stop more informed buyers from walking down the street and driving off with a more complete package that offers up a much more luxurious experience for their buck.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/xts/2018/">2018 Cadillac XTS</a> gets a revised front fascia, updated suspension tuning, atwo-tone upholstery option that’s exclusive to the Platinum trim, and a new version of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>’s CUE infotainment system. With the 2018 XTS’ revised front and rear styling, the updated car is actually 1.1 inches shorter than the pre-facelift model.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/xts/2018/">Cadillac XTS</a> is a full-size luxury sedan that slots below the flagship CT6 and is available in front- or all-wheel drive configurations. In addition to the standard XTS, there’s a more performance-oriented version called the XTS VSport that’s offered and it comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Cadillac XTS comes with two engine options including a base 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 304 hp and 264 lb-ft of torque or a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V-6 with 410 hp and 369 lb-ft. Both engines are paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 19/28 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 17/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. The more powerful XTS VSport is the least efficient model rated at 16/23 mpg. Trunk space is a generous 18 cubic feet and can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include a rearview camera, keyless entry/start, remote start, Cadillac’s CUE infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth connectivity, four USB ports, a 5.7-inch multi-information display an eight-speaker Bose premium audio system, dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, LED headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels, and wireless phone charging. Options and features available on higher trims include heated and ventilated front seats with massage function, heated outboard rear seats, a 360-degree camera system, navigation, a 14-speaker Bose premium audio system, a heated steering wheel, a head-up display, tri-zone climate control, a 12.3-inch multi-information display, a panoramic sunroof, 20-inch alloy wheels, and automatic parking assist.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 XTS received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 XTS but the 2017 model received a Good score in the three crashworthiness tests for which it was tested (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Cadillac XTS received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the speed in a 25-mph impact by 12 mph (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Available as part of the Driver Awareness package are active safety features such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, blind-spot warning, lane change alert, and following distance indicator. The Driver Assist package further adds more features such as rear automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/xts/2013/2013-cadillac-xts-4-platinum-first-test/">2013 First Test</a>, we said that the standard Brembo front brakes on the XTS give it excellent stopping performance; however, the base 3.6-liter V-6 could use more mid-range torque to help move the heavy car around. The six-speed automatic doesn’t always want to downshift when you ask for it, but for its size, the XTS handles respectably (though the steering could provide more feedback). Ride comfort is excellent thanks to the available Magnetic Ride Control system. The XTS’ interior is well-made with high-quality materials throughout the cabin. Although the front seats are somewhat flat, they’re comfortable for long drives and the rear seats can easily seat three across.</p>

<p>The more powerful XTS VSport offers up strong acceleration and is more responsive than the base 3.6-liter V-6. On winding roads, the XTS VSport is more responsive and handles better than the standard XTS, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/xts/2014/2014-cadillac-xts-vsport-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>. The improved handling, especially with the optional 20-inch alloy wheels, makes the ride stiffer and causes more tire noise.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Cadillac XTS VSport’s 3.6-liter twin-turbo V-6 first appeared on the rear-drive CTS VSport.</p>

Apple Watch integration is now available and auto-heated seating is standard.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The ATS is the smallest model offered by Cadillac, positioned below the CTS, XTS, and CT6 sedans. The high-performance ATS-V slots below the larger CTS-V.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The standard engine for the 2018 ATS is a 272-hp, 295-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbo-four, with an available 335-hp, 285-lb-ft of torque 3.6-liter V-6. The 2.0-liter turbo-four delivers an EPA-rated 22/31 mpg city/highway when paired to the eight-speed automatic and rear-drive (22/30 with all-wheel drive) and 20/29 mpg with the six-speed manual. The naturally aspirated V-6 is rated at 20/30 mpg with rear drive and 19/27 mpg with all-wheel drive.  The ATS-V is powered by a 464-hp, 445-lb-ft 3.6-liter twin-turbo V-6 and is rated at 17/25 mpg with the eight-speed and 16/23 mpg with the six-speed manual.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 ATS received the NHTSA’s highest rating of five stars for the sedan’s overall crash performance. The IIHS has not crash tested the ATS, but 2013-2017 ATS cars received the highest front crash prevention rating of Superior for properly warning the driver of a possible accident, avoiding a 12-mph collision, and reducing the speed of a 25-mph collision by 15 mph thanks to the optional automatic braking system. Without that system, the sedan scored the lowest rating of Basic for properly warning the driver of a possible collision. The Safety and Security package on the 2018 ATS consists of the Safety Alert Seat, forward collision alert with lane departure warning, Following Distance Indicator, lane keep assist, blind-spot monitoring, lane change alert, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high-beam headlights, rain-sensitive wipers, and rear thorax air bags. For additional driver assist features, opt for the Driver Assist package that includes full-speed-range adaptive cruise control, automatic safety belt tightening, front and rear automatic braking, and a full-color head-up display.</p>

<p>However, performance numbers do not stand out from its competitors: “Although it feels like one of the best-handling cars in its class, its numbers aren’t quite at the top of the game.” The ATS’ transmission isn’t as responsive as it could be, the rear seat is very small, and  the sedan’s value depreciates quickly: “This is the car you’d buy if the driving experience is far more important than any other factor.”</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Escalade is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>’s flagship SUV, positioned above the XT5 crossover. With the exception of the high-performance CTS-V, the Escalade has the highest starting price in the automaker’s lineup and is Cadillac’s only body-on-frame vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/escalade/2018/">Cadillac Escalade</a> is powered by a 6.2-liter V-8 that produces 420 hp and a healthy 460 lb-ft of torque that comes paired to a new 10-speed automatic and delivers an EPA-rated 14/23 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and 14/21 mpg when equipped with four-wheel drive. <strong>The extended-length variant, the ESV</strong>, offers a 14-inch longer wheelbase for additional third-row and cargo room. In <em>Motor Trend </em>testing, the 2015 Cadillac Escalade Platinum (4WD) hit 60 mph in a very quick 5.9 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 133 feet. The Escalade’s towing capacity is between a hefty 7,900 and 8,300 pounds.</p>

Ordering the top Platinum trim will result in some of Cadillac’s most luxurious options including premium Semi-Aniline leather seating surfaces for the first two rows and Mulan leather for the third, leather-wrapped instrument panel, console, and upper door trim, sueded-mircofiber headliner and door pillar trim, 18-way power adjustable front massaging seats, a center console cooler, 22-inch premium wheels, premium floor mats, illuminated Platinum door sills, two 7.0-inch rear entertainment screens, and power-retractable running boards.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Cadillac Escalade received a four-star overall rating out of a possible five stars from the NHTSA. The IIHS only tested front crash prevention and issued a score of Basic for properly warning the driver of a possible collision, the automatic braking feature was not tested. Standard safety features include OnStar with automatic crash response, front and rear parking sensors, Automatic Parking Assist (a self-parking system), a surround-view camera system, Teen Driver, and a rear seat reminder feature. For driver assist safety, make sure to get the Driver Awareness package that includes Forward Collision Alert, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, Lane Change Alert with Side Blind Zone Alert, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, automatic high beams, and Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking.</p>

<p>At the end of our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/escalade-esv/2015/2015-cadillac-escalade-esv-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2015 Cadillac Escalade ESV, we said, “Aside from fuel economy (duh), CUE is really the big Caddy’s only glaring negative. The new Escalade is quick (0-60 mph in 6.1 seconds for the big dog, and the shorty wheelbase will probably be under 6); handles great for such a massive truck (go magnetic shocks, go); comfortable, luxurious, still plenty spacious (especially in ESV guise); handsome, intimidating (especially in black); and perhaps most importantly, looks like a big pile of money on dubs. No surprises then that the 2015 Cadillac Escalade picks up exactly where the last one left off.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/escalade/2015/the-big-test-large-luxury-suvs/">Big Test comparison of large premium SUVs</a>, we liked the Escalade’s fast acceleration and the engine’s rumble but not the long braking distance or stiff ride. The Cadillac’s interior was the best but the infotainment system is sluggish and needs work. Regardless, the Escalade came in first place out of six contenders, we concluded, “The best looking, the best interior, the best sounding, and the quickest in our test. The Cadillac Escalade Platinum stole our hearts.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Cadillac Escalade (non-ESV) has an almost even weight distribution of 51/49 percent (front/rear).</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The midsize XT5 is currently Cadillac’s smallest crossover, positioned below the full-size Escalade. Factoring in sedans, the XT5 has a higher starting price than the ATS but starts lower than the CTS sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Overvie </strong></p>

<p>Powering the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/xt5/2018/">2018 Cadillac XT5</a> is a 310-hp, 271-lb-ft of torque 3.6-liter V-6 paired to an eight-speed automatic. The engine sends power to the front wheels (EPA-rated 19/26 mpg city/highway) or to an all-wheel drive system (18/25 mpg). The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/xt5/2018/">Cadillac XT5</a> FWD hit 60 mph in quick 6.4 seconds (6.5 with AWD) and stopped from 60 mph in a somewhat lengthy 128 feet (but the AWD model stopped in a much shorter 111 feet). The crossover’s towing capacity is 3,500 pounds.</p>

<p>The 2018 Cadillac XT5 comes well equipped with 18-inch wheels, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, power liftgate, Okapi deco wood trim, eight-way driver and six-way passenger powered seats, the CUE infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Andriod Auto, an eight-speaker Bose premium audio system, dual-zone climate control, wireless charging, and OnStar with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity. The top Platinum model adds AWD as standard, a reconfigurable 8.0-inch gauge cluster, semi-aniline leather seats, leather-wrapped instrument panel and door trim, microsuede headliner, a head-up display, hands-free liftgate, rear camera mirror, tri-zone climate control, heated rear seats, a multi-camera visibility system, Unique Platinum grille, and 20-inch polished wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The Cadillac XT5 is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick from the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all five crash test evaluations and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention for properly warning the driver of a possible accident, avoiding a 12 mph collision, and reducing the speed of a 25 mph collision by 24 mph thanks to the optional Front Automatic Braking driver assist safety feature found in the Driver Assist package. With only the optional Low-Speed Automatic braking equipped (found in the Luxury Driver Awareness package or standard on the Premium Luxury model), the second highest score of Advanced was issued because the crossover was only able to reduce the speed of the 25 mph collision by 9 mph. In NHTSA crash testing, the 2018 XT5 AWD received the highest five-star overall rating and the FWD version received a four-star overall rating. The Driver Awareness package (available on lower trims) also consists of IntelliBeam headlights, Forward Collision Alert, a flowing distance indicator, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, and Front Pedestrian Detection. The Driver Assist package also includes automatic seat belt tightening, Automatic Park Assist (self-parking system), Front and Rear Automatic Braking, and adaptive cruise control with full-range speed capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/xt5/2017/2017-cadillac-xt5-awd-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the redesigned 2017 Cadillac XT5, we liked the improved handling thanks to the lighter and improved chassis. The XT5 provides a larger and more comfortable cabin than the outgoing SRX it replaced. We were also impressed with the long list of standard features. “Not only is the all-new 2017 Cadillac XT5 a worthy replacement for Cadillac’s best-selling model, but the new SUV shouldn’t have any issue competing in showrooms against rivals from Europe and Japan.”</p>

<p>During <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/cadillac-xt5-2017-suv-of-the-year-contender/">2017 SUV of the Year testing,</a> we found the “sleepy transmission’s gears too widely spaced. The lack of accelerative chutzpah feels out of place with the sharp steering and good handling balance on winding roads,” we said. The great handling is accompanied by a great ride: “As for ride, the XT5 aced the crumbling-freeway test. Jason Cammisa described it as the best of any SUV in the test: ‘Hands down. The surface ripples were just … gone.’”</p>

<p>Judges did not like the XT5’s electronic shifter and the improved CUE infotainment system was still aggravating to use.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In China, the XT5 comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The myCadillac mobile app can now integrate with Apple Watch, and two additional USB ports have been added to the rear console. A <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/smart/">smart</a>-heating steering wheel and a new Satin Steel Metallic color are also new for 2018.</p>

<p>The CTS sedan is positioned above the ATS, alongside the larger but less fun-to-drive XTS, and below the CT6 in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>’s sedan lineup.</p>

In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2016 Cadillac CTS V-Sport hit 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a short 107 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 CTS received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA for rear-wheel and all-wheel drive models (the CTS-V received a four-star overall rating). In IIHS testing, the 2018 CTS received the second-lowest rating of Marginal for the driver-side small overlap front crash test and the highest rating of Good in the other crash test evaluations. The highest rating of Superior was issued for the front crash prevention test because the CTS avoided a collision in a 12-mph test and reduced the speed of a 25-mph collision by 12 mph thanks to the automatic emergency braking system found in the Driver Assist package, which also includes full-speed adaptive cruise control, automatic rear braking, and automatic safety belt tightening. The Driver Awareness package (standard on the Luxury, Premium Luxury, and V-Sport) consists of blind-spot monitoring, lane change alert, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, rear-cross traffic alert, automatic high beams, a rain-sensing windshield, and a rear seat alert system.</p>

<p>The Cadillac CTS, which can carry up to 13.7 cubic feet of cargo in its trunk, offers 42.6 inches of front seat legroom and 35.4 inches of rear seat legroom. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/5-series/2018/">BMW 5 Series</a> beats the CTS with 18.7 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk.</p>

The Driver Assist package and the larger 12.3-inch instrument cluster display are standard on the V-Sport Premium Luxury trim.</p>

<p>Watch the 2017 Cadillac CTS-V go up against the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> E63 sedan in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtsmVu2ufVY">episode 97 of <em>Head 2 Head.</em></a></p>

<p>After one year with our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/cts/2014/2014-cadillac-cts-vsport-review-verdict/">long-term 2014 Cadillac CTS V-Sport</a>, we appreciated that the car didn’t require any unscheduled trips to the dealer and that our average fuel economy was slightly higher than the EPA’s figure. We concluded by saying, “A year later, the CTS V-Sport continues to be everything we wanted it to be. It’s a quiet, comfortable, and refined luxury sedan that seamlessly morphs into a powerful, precise cornering machine at the drop of a hat. It’s immensely fun to drive at all times yet never feels crude or punishing, and it’s one of the few press cars I’ll truly miss.”</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-cadillac-cts/">2014 Motor Trend Car of the Year testing</a>, we liked the CTS’ value, its design inside and out, the economical 2.0-liter turbo-four engine option, and the superb chassis.</p>

<p>“More than just a great performer, the CTS is a refined commuter. Noise, vibration, and harshness from the powertrain and suspension are notably absent, with only the slap of the tires to remind you of the world outside.”</p>

<p>Cadillac built a sedan worthy of its German rivals, and the CTS became <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-cadillac-cts/">our 2014 Car of the Year</a>:  “…The CTS’ intended function is to take the fight to <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-Benz, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/">Audi</a> — and win. It had to beat them on style, on performance, on comfort, and on quality. It has,” we said. “The CTS demonstrated superior advancement in design, performance, handling, and experience over the other two. The CTS’ ride and handling compromise was unmatched, as were cabin noise and isolation. Were the Cadillac to give ground, it would only be on rear-seat space.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Trax</a> gets three new exterior colors that include Storm Blue Metallic, Sandy Ridge Metallic, and Cajun Red Tintcoat. A new <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-red-line-editions-rev-up-chicago-auto-show/#chevrolet-trax-redline-front-three-quarters">Redline edition model</a> is now available and gets black 18-inch alloy wheels with red accent strips, black side mirrors, a black grille, black Bowtie badges, Black cloth/leatherette upholstery, and a black Trax badge with red outlines. Premier models now come standard with forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and a sunroof.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">Chevrolet Trax</a> is a subcompact crossover that’s available in three trims and in front- or all-wheel-drive configurations. The small crossover slots below the larger Equinox.</p>

<p><strong>Trax LS: </strong>The base LS trim comes standard with a rearview camera, cloth upholstery, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 16-inch steel wheels with covers, two USB ports, and a 3.5-inch instrument cluster display.</p>

<p><strong>Trax LT: </strong>Moving up to the LT grade adds LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, projector headlights, 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, remote start, upgraded cloth upholstery, and a storage bin under the front passenger seat.</p>

<p><strong>Trax Premier: </strong>Range-topping Premier models add fog lights, 18-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry and start, heated front seats, leatherette upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a sunroof, and a seven-speaker Bose audio system.</p>

<p>The 2018 Trax is powered by a 1.4-liter turbo-four with 138 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 25/33 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 24/30 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p>The 2018 Trax received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Trax received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front small overlap test where it received an Average rating (Good is the highest rating).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Trax received a Basic rating for its available forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating. Forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert come standard on the Premier trim and part of the optional Driver Confidence package on the LT grade. Automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and pedestrian detection are not available on the 2018 Trax.</p>

<p>The 2018 Trax has 18.7 cubic feet with the standard split-folding rear seats in place. Fold them down and the crossover can hold 48.4 cubic feet of cargo.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2017/2017-chevrolet-trax-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that the availability of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay gives it a better infotainment system that’s easy to use. Ride quality is good with the 16-inch alloy wheels but the car’s handling doesn’t feel sporty and its acceleration isn’t as punchy. In city driving, the Trax easily keeps up with traffic.</p>

<p>The pre-facelift Trax placed fifth in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/xv-crosstrek/2015/the-big-test-2015-2016-subcompact-crossovers/">2015 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/hr-v/2018/">Honda HR-V</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Juke, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-3/2018/">Mazda CX-3</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/renegade/2018/">Jeep Renegade</a> and the previous-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>. That 2015-model-year crossover’s 1.4-liter turbo-four suffered from plenty of turbo lag and the six-speed automatic always wanted to stay on the highest gear. On the road, we found there was excessive body roll through turns, and interior quality lagged behind the competition.</p>

<p>The 2018 Trax is closely related to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2018/">Buick Encore</a> and the European-market Opel Mokka.</p>

<p>With the exception of a new color (Sandy Ridge Metallic) the Malibu Hybrid does not receive any significant changes for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p>The Malibu is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s second largest and most expensive sedan, positioned above the Cruze but below the Impala. The Malibu is Chevrolet’s only other electrified sedan; the automaker also offers the Volt plug-in and Bolt EV hatchbacks.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Malibu Hybrid</strong>: The Malibu Hybrid’s single trim is well-equipped with Chevrolet’s MyLink system displayed on a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth, SiriusXM, OnStar 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hotspot, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Malibu also comes standard with an eight-way power driver’s seat, a 3.5-inch instrument panel driver’s display, a hybrid-specific instrument cluster, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch aluminum wheels, automatic headlights, OnStar Guidance, OnStar Basic, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p>A six-way power passenger’s seat, leather upholstery, heated front seats, and a Bose premium audio system can be added with the Leather package. The Convenience and Technology package adds remote engine start, auto-dimming rearview mirror, an 8.0-inch touchscreen display, and wireless charging.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Malibu</a>’s hybrid powertrain consists of a 122-hp, 130-lb-ft of torque 1.8-liter I-4 paired with two electric motors that have a total combined power output 182 hp and 277 lb-ft. A CVT transmission routes power to the front wheels. The EPA rates the Malibu Hybrid at 49/43 mpg city/highway with an impressive 598-mile driving range. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Malibu Hybrid hit 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 121 feet.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Malibu Hybrid the highest overall safety rating of five stars. In IIHS testing, the non-hybrid 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu/2018/">Chevrolet Malibu</a> is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick for receiving the highest rating of Good in five crash test evaluations and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation thanks to the emergency automatic braking system found in the Driver Confidence Package II. That package is available on the non-hybrid Premier trim but not on the Malibu Hybrid, which offers a low-speed emergency automatic braking system in the Driver Confidence package. With just the Driver Confidence package, the 2018 Malibu received the second-highest rating of Advanced for avoiding a 12 mph collision and reducing a 25 mph impact by 9 mph.</p>

<p>The Malibu did not receive the 2018 Top Safety Pick designation because the sedan received the second-lowest rating of Marginal in the new passenger-side small overlap front crash test. The previously mentioned Driver Confidence package also includes front pedestrian braking, automatic high beams, front and rear parking sensors, lane change alert with blind-spot monitoring, lane keep assist, following distance indicator, forward collision alert, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p>The Malibu Hybrid offers 11.6 cubic feet of cargo space in the truck (the non-hybrid model has 15.8 cubic feet) and 42 inches of legroom for the front passengers and 38.1 inches for the rear passengers. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2018/">Ford Fusion</a> Hybrid wins in each category with 12.0 cubic feet of cargo room in the truck and 44.3 inches of front seat legroom and 38.8 inches of rear seat legroom.</p>

<p>The 2018 Malibu Hybrid comes standard with plenty of technology including a 7.0-inch touchscreen with the Chevrolet MyLink system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, SiriusXM, Bluetooth, and a USB port (dual USBs are available). OnStar Guidance, OnStar 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hotspot, and OnStar Basic are also standard. A larger 8.0-inch touchscreen with navigation and a nine-speaker Bose premium audio system are optional. Additional feature include remote engine start, a wireless smartphone charger, and a package of driver assist safety features.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu-hybrid/2016/2016-chevrolet-malibu-hybrid-quick-test-review/">Quick Test review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu-hybrid/2016/">2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid</a>, we liked our initial driving experience and said, “The electric motor provides plenty of low-end grunt off the line, though the 1.8-liter engine felt coarser as it climbed up the rev range compared to the gas-only turbo engine options. The steering is nicely weighted for the class and provides a linear and predictable feel, and the suspension is nicely tuned for a balance between ride comfort and handling.”</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-malibu-2016-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-contender/">2016 <em>Motor Trend</em> Car of the Year testing</a>, we enjoyed the luxury, ride, and comfort of the Malibu Hybrid and said, “It rides great and is way quieter than the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a6/2018/">Audi A6</a> on the road.” We were also impressed with all the standard technology: “The car can be a mobile hotspot with 4G connectivity, and it provides Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It also has techno-safety features such as adaptive cruise control, active headlight controls, and front pedestrian alert.” We concluded by saying that “overall, the Malibu is vastly improved, and the new hybrid is one of the best in the segment.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/tahoe/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Tahoe</a> gets a new RST Edition model with a more powerful engine and 10-speed automatic transmission that’s available on the LT and Premier grades. LS models can now be had in Custom Edition form and all models now come standard with LED daytime running lights. Two new exterior colors, Havana Metallic and Satin Steel Metallic, have been added. A Borla exhaust system and Brembo front brakes are now available as dealer-installed options.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/tahoe/2018/">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> is a full-size SUV that slots above the Traverse and below the larger and mechanically related Suburban. The Tahoe can seat up to eight passengers in rear- or four-wheel drive configurations. Three trim levels are available.</p>

<p><strong>Tahoe LS:</strong> The base LS trim comes standard with 18-inch alloy wheels, tri-zone climate control, remote start, rear parking sensors, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth, a six-speaker audio system, cloth upholstery, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, keyless entry, and 60/40 split-folding second- and third-row seats.</p>

<p><strong>Tahoe LT:</strong> Moving up to the LT trim gets you a programmable power liftgate, heated front seats, leather upholstery, and a nine-speaker Bose audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Tahoe Premier:</strong> The range-topping Premier trim adds fog lights, HID headlights, 20-inch alloy wheels, keyless start, front parking sensors, 12-way power front seats, ventilated front seats, power-operated folding second- and third rows, Magnetic Ride Control, navigation, a 10-speaker Bose audio system, wireless phone charging, and heated second row seats.</p>

<p>Notable options like RST Edition package adds 22-inch alloy wheels, black bowtie badges, a unique grille, body-colored door handles and headlight accents, black side mirror caps, beltline moldings and roof rails, and black name badges. The RST Performance package gets you a 6.2-liter V-8, 10-speed automatic, a 170 amp alternator, a high-capacity air cleaner, a 3.23 axle ratio, and an integrated trailer brake controller. Options such as navigation, a rear seat entertainment system, and a sunroof are available as part of a package. The LT trim is available with the Z71 Off-Road package, which gets you skid plates, all-terrain tires, a 3.42 rear axle, a two-speed transfer case, hill descent control, an off-road-tuned suspension, and black side steps.</p>

<p>The 2018 Tahoe is available with two V-8 engines, a base 5.3-liter with 355 hp and 383 lb-ft of torque and an optional 6.2-liter with 420 hp and 460 lb-ft, which is available only on the RST Edition. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard with the 5.3-liter and the 6.2-liter comes with a 10-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 16/23 mpg city/highway for the rear-drive 5.3-liter and 16/22 mpg with four-wheel drive. With the 6.2-liter the Tahoe’s fuel economy estimates drop to 14/23 mpg for rear-drive models and 14/22 mpg with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe received a four-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t crash tested the 2018 Tahoe but it received a Basic rating in the front crash prevention test for having a forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Available as part of the Enhanced Driver Alert package on the LS trim are a host of active safety features including forward collision warning, low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, a safety alert seat, and automatic high beam headlights. The Enhanced Driver Alert package is standard on the LT and Premier grades. Additional safety tech are available as part of the Luxury package on the LT trim and as standard on the Premier trim include rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot monitoring and lane change alert. Adaptive cruise control is only available on the Premier trim and it comes bundled with an enhanced automatic emergency braking system that works at higher speeds.</p>

<p>With the third row in place, there’s 15.3 cubic feet of cargo space and it can be expanded to 51.7 cubic feet with the second row down and 94.7 cubic feet behind the front seats when the second and third rows are folded down.</p>

<p>With the optional Trailering package, the 2018 Tahoe can tow up to 8,600 pounds in rear-drive guise or 8,400 pounds with four-wheel drive. The more powerful RST Edition is limited to 8,400 pounds for rear-drive models or 8,100 pounds on four-wheel-drive-equipped variants.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-chevrolet-suburban-second-drive/">2015 First Test</a>, we said that the Tahoe offers excellent visibility but the 5.3-liter V-8 is merely adequate to haul around a massive SUV. The throttle pedal is also slow, making the Tahoe feel sluggish. As for the six-speed automatic, its efficiency-minded tuning means it always wants to get to the highest gears quickly. As in the larger Suburban, the cylinder deactivation system is seamless. The Tahoe’s brake pedal is surprisingly firm and ride quality is generally good but you do feel big bumps. Not much noise enters the cabin, keeping it well insulated and making conversations easy.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/tahoe/2018/2018-chevrolet-tahoe-rst-performance-edition-first-test-review/">2018 First Test</a>, we noted that the 6.2-liter V-8 and a quick-shifting 10-speed automatic makes the Tahoe RST accelerate quicker. However, even with the optional Brembo front brakes, its stopping performance isn’t any better than other Tahoes. The Magnetic Ride Control system helps it handle better and eliminates nearly all traces of body roll.</p>

<p>The 2018 Tahoe placed third in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/expedition/2018/ford-expedition-vs-chevrolet-tahoe-vs-dodge-durango-vs-toyota-sequoia-vs-nissan-armada/">recent comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/durango/2018/">Dodge Durango</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/expedition/2018/">Ford Expedition</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/armada/2018/">Nissan Armada</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/sequoia/2018/">Toyota Sequoia</a>. Its six-speed automatic transmission is lazy and its lack of an independent rear suspension meant it also rode worse than its rivals. Off-road was where the Tahoe performed well, easily able to crawl through the rough stuff. Third row accommodations are tight in the Tahoe but its infotainment system is easy to use and has a lot of USB ports to keep mobile devices charged.</p>

<p>The 10-speed automatic transmission in the Tahoe RST was co-developed with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> and is also found in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2018/">Ford F-150</a> and Expedition.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado LT: </strong>Jumping up to the LT grade gets you 17-inch alloy wheels, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, keyless entry, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a two additional USB ports, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, cruise control, a 4.2-inch instrument cluster display, and cloth upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado Z71: </strong>One of two off-road-oriented models, the Z71 adds an off-road suspension setup, an automatic locking rear differential, a transfer case shield for four-wheel-drive models, automatic climate control, leather upholstery, an EZ Lift &amp; Lower tailgate, hill descent control, a power-adjustable front passenger’s seat, heated front seats, and remote start.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado ZR2: </strong>The most capable model in the Colorado lineup, the ZR2 is only available with the V-6 or diesel I-4 and comes with a more aggressive off-road suspension setup that’s raised for extra ground clearance, Multimatic DSSV dampers, all-terrain tires, integrated trailer brake control, a unique front bumper, wider front fenders, a black rear bumper, and ZR2-specific leather upholstery.</p>

<p>Optional extras include a wireless phone charger, navigation, and a seven-speaker Bose audio system. Chevrolet also offers some exterior appearance packages like the Midnight package, which adds 17-inch black-painted wheels, a spray-on bedliner, a body-colored grille, black Bowtie badges, and Goodyear all-terrain tires.</p>

<p>The 2018 Colorado comes standard with a 2.5-liter I-4 that produces 200 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque. A 3.6-liter V-6 with 308 hp and 275 lb-ft and a 2.8-liter turbodiesel I-4 with 181 hp and 269 lb-ft are optional. A six-speed manual is standard with the base 2.5-liter I-4 and a six-speed automatic is available. Diesel-powered models come exclusively with a six-speed automatic and the V-6 is paired to General Motors’ in-house-designed eight-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the base 2.5-liter I-4 are 20/26 mpg city/highway for rear-drive models regardless of transmission choice and 19/24 mpg with four-wheel drive. The more powerful V-6 engine is rated at 18/25 mpg in rear-drive guise and 17/24 mpg with four-wheel drive. Diesel-powered Colorados are the most efficient at 22/30 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 20/28 mpg when you opt for four-wheel drive. ZR2 models are the least efficient at 19/22 mpg for the diesel and 16/18 mpg with the V-6.</p>

<p>The 2018 Colorado received a four-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the crew cab variant received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front overlap test where it hasn’t been tested (Good is the highest possible score). Extended cab models had slightly worse scores because they only received an Average rating on the passenger side front small overlap test and the side impact test. Both body styles got a Poor score on the headlights test.</p>

<p>Both cab styles of the 2018 Colorado received a Basic rating on the front crash prevention test for having an available forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating on the forward collision prevention test). Lane departure warning and forward collision warning are available only on the LT trim.</p>

<p>Depending on the cab style, engine and drivetrain configuration, the 2018 Colorado can carry up to 1,574 pounds of payload and tow up to 7,700 pounds. Max payload drops to 1,100 pounds on the ZR2 and towing capacity goes down to 5,000 pounds.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/colorado/2018/2018-chevrolet-colorado-zr2-gas-diesel-first-test-review/">2018 First Test</a>, we said that the Colorado ZR2 model offers even better off-road performance thanks to its upgraded suspension, better departure angles, and all-terrain tires. However, the ZR2’s added weight does slow down straight-line acceleration. Despite the off-road kit, the Colorado ZR2 doesn’t sacrifice on-road handling and still drives as well as other variants. Once you do get off the pavement, the ZR2 models can crawl through nearly anything.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/2500/2017/chevrolet-colorado-zr2-vs-ford-f-150-raptor-vs-ram-2500-power-wagon/">2017 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/2500/2018/">Ram 2500</a> Power Wagon and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> F-15o Raptor, the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 placed second thanks to its agility, small size, and a suspension that works well on all types of terrain. However, the V-6 engine needs revs to generate its power and the eight-speed automatic kept upshifting to the highest gear.</p>

<p>The 2018 Colorado’s optional diesel engine is shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/canyon/2018/">GMC Canyon</a> and is built by VM Motori.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/sonic/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Sonic</a> gets a new exterior called Ivy Metallic. Black bowtie badges are now part of the RS package. The Fun and Sun package now comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, and on models with the optional turbocharged engine, it also adds a sunroof.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/sonic/2018/">Chevrolet Sonic</a> is a front-drive subcompact sedan and hatchback that slots below the compact Cruze and above the smaller Spark city car. The car is available in three trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Sonic LS: </strong>The base Sonic LS comes with 15-inch steel wheels, Bluetooth, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, a four-speaker audio system, a USB port, cloth upholstery, and LED daytime running lights.</p>

<p><strong>Sonic LT: </strong>Moving up to the LT grade adds 15-inch alloy wheels, heated side mirrors, cruise control, upgraded cloth upholstery, power windows, steering wheel-mounted controls, remote start, and a six-speaker sound system.</p>

<p><strong>Sonic Premier: </strong>The range-topping Premier grade comes with leatherette upholstery, a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, keyless entry/start, a heated steering wheel, a sport exhaust with a chrome tip, and an upgraded multi-information display. Models with the manual transmission comes with the RS package, which adds a body kit, fog lights, black bowtie badges, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a piano-black-accented instrument panel.</p>

<p>Rear parking sensors are available as part of the Driver Confidence package on the LT and Premier grades. Offered on the LT and Premiere trims, a Performance package adds a lowered suspension and a performance exhaust system that bumps the optional 1.4-liter turbo-four’s output to 148 hp and 163 lb-ft.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sonic comes standard with a 1.8-liter I-4 with 138 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque, which can be paired to a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. A 1.4-liter turbo-four rated at 138 hp and 148 lb-ft is optional and comes with a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the Sonic equipped with the standard 1.8-liter I-4 are 26/35 mpg city/highway with the manual or 25/34 mpg with the automatic. Variants with the 1.4-liter turbo-four are EPA-rated at 28/37 mpg with the manual or 27/35 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Sonic a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Sonic received a Good score for all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front small overlap test where it hasn’t been tested yet (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>On the LT and Premier grades, the Driver Confidence package adds forward collision warning and lane departure warning.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sonic sedan has 14.9 cubic feet of trunk space and can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats. In case you need more room, the hatch has 19 cubic feet behind the second row and 47.7 cubic feet behind the front seats when the second-row seats are folded down.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/sonic/2014/2014-chevrolet-sonic-rs-sedan-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>, we said that the Sonic drives well, offering well-weighted steering with good feedback and a manual shifter that’s easy to operated. The 1.4-liter turbo-four offers enough power for the highway and passing quick-moving traffic but you need to shift frequently because the gears are tightly spaced. Ride and handling balance is good, so the car is nimble without making it rough for daily driving. Even with its small size, the sedan’s trunk is surprisingly spacious.</p>

<p>The optional 1.4-liter turbo-four in the 2018 Sonic is also used in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2018/">Buick Encore</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">Chevrolet Trax</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette/2018/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> is the quintessential rear-wheel drive American sports car and is available as a coupe with a removable roof or a convertible. In addition to the standard model, other models from this generation of Corvette have included Grand Sport and the higher-performance Z06.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of the rumored mid-engine Corvette, the most anticipated variant of the iconic sports car is the Corvette ZR1, which will likely be the most powerful model to date, with more grunt than the Z06, which is currently rated at 650 hp. If the next Corvette ZR1 debuts for the 2018 model year, expect it to feature a full aero package to help it handle better and stick to the road. The car should also come with wider tires, and an even more aggressive suspension setup, Magnetic Ride Control, and an actie rear spoiler for additional downforce.</p>

<p>We’ll update this space as soon as we have official info on the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Corvette</a> — until then, check out <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/spied-mid-engine-chevrolet-corvette-caught-winter-testing-zr1/"><strong>spy shots</strong></a> of the mid-engine Corvette alongside a ZR1 prototype <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/spied-mid-engine-chevrolet-corvette-caught-winter-testing-zr1/"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The new LT Driver Confidence package includes rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic alert, and blind-spot monitoring. Vinyl now wraps the steering wheel and shift knob on the LT model and two new colors are available: Green Mist Metallic and Cajun Red Tintcoat.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevy</a>’s electrified lineup, the all-electric Bolt EV has a higher starting price (not including tax incentives).</p>

<p><strong>2018 Volt LT</strong>: The base Volt LT trim comes well-equipped with an 8.0-inch LCD instrument panel driver’s display, an 8.0-inch center touchscreen display with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> MyLink and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, satellite radio, 2 USB ports, OnStar Guidance, and OnStar 4G LTE with Wi-Fi hotspot. Also standard are six-way manual adjustable front seats, four drive modes (Normal, Sport, Mountain, and Hold), remote engine start, LED headlights and taillights, LED interior lighting, and 17-inch aluminum wheels.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Volt Premier</strong>: The top Premier trim adds leather-appointed seats, heated front and rear seats, leather-wrapped and heated steering wheel, a self-parking system, front and rear parking sensors, wireless phone charging, a Bose premium sound system, and 17-inch ultra-bright machined aluminum wheels with painted pockets.</p>

<p>For additional safety, the Premier trim is available with two driver assist packages—learn more about them below.</p>

<p>The Volt’s electric drive system consists of a 101-hp, 103 lb-ft of torque 1.5-liter I-4 engine paired to an electric motor for a total system output of 149 hp and a potent 294 lb-ft of torque. A CVT routes power to the front wheels. The Volt can drive up to an EPA-rated 53 miles on all-electric power (106 mpg-e) and delivers 43/42 mpg city/highway when in hybrid mode. Charging a depleted battery takes approximately 13 hours using a 120-volt (Level 1) charger and 4.5 hours using a 240-volt (Level 2 charger). In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Volt Premier hit 60 mph in a quick-for-a-hybrid 7.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 116 feet.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/volt/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Volt</a> is an IIHS 2018 Top Safety Pick for receiving the highest rating of Good in all five conducted crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation by avoiding 12- and 25 mph frontal collisions thanks to the optional forward automatic braking system that comes with the available adaptive cruise control system and is part of the Volt’s features-list if you have both Driver Confidence packages. When the Volt is only equipped with the low speed forward automatic braking system found in the Driver Confidence package II, the car avoided the 12 mph collision in IIHS testing and reduced speed in a 25 mph collision test by 5 mph. The LT Driver Confidence package adds three driver assist features: rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic alert, and blind-spot monitoring with lane change alert. The previously mentioned Driver Confidence package II also includes forward collision alert, lane keep assist, a following distance indicator, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p>The Volt only offers 10.6 cubic feet of cargo space thanks to the large battery pack. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">Toyota Prius</a> Prime, which has an EV range of only 25 miles before the gas engine kicks in, almost doubles that with 19.8 cubic feet of cargo space. The Volt has 42.1 inches of front seat legroom and 34.7 inches of rear legroom, the Prius Prime offers 43.2 inches of legroom for the front passengers and 33.4 inches for the rear.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/volt/2018/">Chevrolet Volt</a> comes well-equipped with Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment system displayed on an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, satellite radio, and two USB ports. The Volt also comes standard with an 8.0-inch LCD driver’s instrument panel screen, four driving modes (Normal, Sport, Mountain, and Hold), remote engine start, OnStar Guidance, OnStar 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hotspot, and OnStar Basic. Available technology includes a self-parking system, Chevrolet MyLink with Navigation and SiriusXM Nav Traffic, and an eight-speaker Bose premium audio system.</p>

<p>When we compared the Chevrolet Volt to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius-prime/2018/">Toyota Prius Prime</a> in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2017/hyundai-ioniq-hybrid-vs-toyota-prius-chevrolet-volt-vs-prius-prime-bolt-ev-vs-ioniq-ev-vs-honda-clarity-vs-mirai/">large alternative fuel vehicle comparison</a>, we commended the Volt’s long 53-mile all-electric driving range, planted handling, and comfortable ride. However, the interior packaging is bad, leaving very little headroom for the rear passengers. In the end, the Prius Prime won the comparison: “So despite the Prius Prime’s peculiarities (the recorded piano accompaniment to ingress and egress sounds like the sappy soundtrack to a daytime soap opera), its usability, packaging, acceptable EV range, and much better hybrid-mode mileage give it the edge.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/volt/2016/2016-chevrolet-volt-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Chevrolet Volt, we liked the Volt’s longer electric range, lighter weight, good brake feel for a hybrid, and modern design. We were surprised by the very agile handling when testing is around the figure-eight course, “The car moves as a coherent whole, balanced, responsive, reminding me of how suited a properly integrated electric drivetrain is for serious driving.” We concluded by saying, “This isn’t just another Volt, a second one, a slightly better one, a $1200 cheaper one. Or one to kinda ignore because we’ve been there, done that, and the i3 and Mirai seem more, <em>au current</em>. This Volt is a whole new deal, as revolutionary as anything else out there. Try it again.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Malibu</a> gets a special Redline Edition model based on the LT trim that gets black bowtie logos, black nameplates with red highlights, 19-inch black alloy wheels with red accents, black side mirror covers, and a black grille. A new exterior color, Sandy Ridge Metallic, has been added for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu/2018/">Chevrolet Malibu</a> is a front-drive midsize sedan that slots above the compact Cruze and below the full-size Impala. In addition to the gas-powered variant, the 2018 Malibu is also available as a hybrid. Gas-powered models are available in four trims while the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu-hybrid/2018/">Malibu Hybrid</a> in a single grade.</p>

<p><strong>Malibu L: </strong>The base Malibu L gets 16-inch steel wheels, a six-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, keyless entry/start, a 3.5-inch instrument cluster info display, and daytime running lights.</p>

<p><strong>Malibu LS: </strong>Moving up to the LS grade gets you 16-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, a USB port, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, as well as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration.</p>

<p><strong>Malibu LT: </strong>Jumping up to the LT model adds 17-inch alloy wheels, ambient lighting, an eight-way power-operated driver’s seat, and LED daytime running lights.</p>

<p><a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu-hybrid/2018/"><strong>Malibu Hybrid</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Positioned as the second highest model, the Malibu Hybrid comes with the same equipment as the LT trim plus its own unique instrument cluster and dual-zone climate control.</p>

<p><strong>Malibu Premier: </strong>Currently the most powerful model and the range-topper, the Malibu Premier adds LED taillights, a powerful 2.0-liter turbo-four, 18-inch alloy wheels, remote start, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, a nine-speaker Bose premium audio system, two additional USB ports, a wireless charging pad, ventilated front seats, six-way power adjustable front passenger seat, leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, navigation, and 4.2-inch instrument cluster info display.</p>

<p>Available features include a panoramic sunroof, 19-inch alloy wheels, front and rear parking sensors, an electric parking brake and automatic parking assist.</p>

<p>The 2018 Malibu comes standard with a 1.5-liter turbo-four with 163 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque and it’s paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. A 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 250 hp and 260 lb-ft is available only on the Premier trim and is paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Malibu Hybrid features a 1.8-liter I-4 paired to an electric motor, a lithium-ion battery, and a CVT with a combined output of 182 hp.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 27/36 mpg city/highway for the 1.5-liter turbo-four, 22/32 mpg for the 2.0-liter turbo-four, and 49/43 mpg for the hybrid.</p>

<p>The 2018 Malibu received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Malibu received a Good rating on all crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side front small overlap impact and headlights test where it got a Marginal and Poor score respectively (Good is the highest possible score). In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Malibu received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the severity of a 25-mph impact by 24 mph (Superior is the highest score for front crash prevention test). As a result, the 2018 Malibu received the IIHS’ 2017 Top Safety Pick rating.</p>

<p>Available on the LT and Premier trims is the Driver Confidence package, which adds automatic high beams, following distance indicator, forward collision warning, lane change alert, blind spot warning, lane keeping assist, pedestrian detection, and low-speed automatic emergency braking. The Driver Confidence II package, which is available only on the Premier trim, adds adaptive cruise control and an automatic emergency braking system that works at higher speeds.</p>

<p>The 2018 Malibu has a 15.8-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats. Hybrid variants have less trunk space at 11.6 cubic feet.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu/2016/2016-chevrolet-malibu-15t-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said that the low-rolling resistance tires hurt its braking performance. Its limit handling takes a hit because of the eco-focused rubber but it rides comfortably and steering feel is reasonably good for a midsize sedan focused on comfort. The 1.5-liter turbo-four isn’t very powerful but it has plenty of usable power for daily driving. Interior quality on lower trims, however, is disappointing with plenty of hard plastics and cloth that feels cheap. Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment system is easy to use and the rear seats are spacious.</p>

<p>The more powerful Malibu 2.0T offers plenty of power on tap even with passengers in the car. Its handling is also much improved thanks to its wider tires, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu/2017/2017-chevrolet-malibu-20t-premier-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>. There’s also a generous amount of tech available on the Malibu such as wireless phone charging, multiple USB ports and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, which should make it easy to stay connected.</p>

<p>We were impressed with the Malibu Hybrid in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu-hybrid/2016/2016-chevrolet-malibu-hybrid-second-drive-review/">2016 Second Drive review</a> thanks to its linear-feeling brakes and a hybrid system that operated smoothly, and didn’t call attention to itself when the gas engine and electric motor were interacting. There’s enough power on tap but you have to bury your foot into the accelerator so that the car knows you want full power. Like its more powerful 2.0-liter turbo-four-equipped sibling, the Malibu Hybrid handles reasonably well for a midsize sedan with precise steering, good body control, and minimal understeer, all while maintaining a comfortable ride. Tire noise, however, can get excessive and some of the plastics in the cabin feel cheap.</p>

<p>The current-generation Chevrolet Malibu was the first to utilize GM’s new 1.5-liter turbo-four, a more powerful version of which is now found on the Equinox and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/terrain/2018/">GMC Terrain</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/traverse/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Traverse</a> is all-new and rides on a new platform for midsize and large crossovers. It sports exterior styling that’s less rounded than its predecessor.</p>

<p>The 2018 Traverse is a full-size three-row crossover that slots below that larger Tahoe and above the smaller Equinox, and can seat up to eight passengers. Front-wheel drive comes standard and all-wheel drive is optional on all trims except the range-topping High Country trim, where AWD is standard.</p>

<p><strong>Traverse L: </strong>Well-equipped from the start, the base L trim comes standard with a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, 18-inch alloy wheels, HID headlights, six USB ports, a 3.5-inch multi-information display, keyless entry/start, tri-zone climate control, and the Teen Driver feature that monitors your teenager’s driving habits.</p>

<p><strong>Traverse LS: </strong>The LS adds tinted glass on top of the L’s long list of standard features.</p>

<p><strong>Traverse LT Cloth: </strong>The LT Cloth trim adds fog lights, roof rails, second-row captain’s chairs, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and Bright Silver 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Traverse LT Leather: </strong>Moving up to the more upscale LT Leather trim gets you rear parking sensors, a 360-degree view camera system, navigation, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, heated front seats, leather upholstery, remote start, a programmable power liftgate, a Bose premium audio system, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, and 20-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Traverse RS: </strong>As the sportier trim of the Traverse, the RS adds dark 20-inch alloy wheels, black badges, black roof rails, and black window surrounds in addition to all the standard features found on the LT Leather grade. The Traverse RS also gets a powerful turbo-four instead of the V-6 on other trims.</p>

<p><strong>Traverse Premier: </strong>One of two luxury-oriented trims, the Traverse Premier adds 20-inch metallic alloy wheels, a wireless device charger, LED headlights, a hands-free power liftgate, memory settings for the driver’s seat, a heated steering wheel, perforated leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, and heated second-row captain’s chairs.</p>

<p><strong>Traverse High Country: </strong>The range-topping High Country grade adds polished 20-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, a power-folding third row, a heavy-duty cooling system, trailer hitch, and a two-tone black and brown leather upholstery.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/traverse/2018/">Chevrolet Traverse</a> is powered by either a 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 310 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque or a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 255 hp and 295 lb-ft. However, the four-cylinder is available exclusively on the RS trim and isn’t available with all-wheel drive. Both engines are paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission that General Motors co-developed with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>. EPA fuel economy ratings are 18/27 mpg city/highway for V-6-powered front-drive models and 17/25 mpg with all-wheel drive. The turbo-four is the most efficient at 20/26 mpg.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Chevrolet Traverse. On the LT Cloth trim, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are available as part of the Convenience and Driver Confidence package or standard on the LT Leather and higher grades. Low speed automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, IntelliBeam headlights, following distance indicator, lane keeping assist, and lane departure warning are available on the Premier trim via the Driver Confidence II package, and they come as standard on the High Country model. Adaptive cruise control and an automatic emergency braking system that works at higher speeds is available exclusively on the High Country trim where they come as standard features.</p>

<p>When properly equipped, the 2018 Traverse can tow up to 5,000 pounds of payload. Cargo space is generous at 23 cubic feet behind the third row, 58.1 cubic feet behind the second row, and 98.2 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/traverse/2018/2018-chevrolet-traverse-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>, we noted that the 3.6-liter V-6 moves the Traverse with ease and that the nine-speed automatic does its job without much drama. Despite its size, the 2018 Traverse possesses surprising good handling with minimal body roll. Interior space is generous, especially for cargo, thanks to the addition of underfloor storage. Passenger space in the third row, however, is cramped and forces occupants to sit with their knees up higher.</p>

<p>We noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/traverse/2018/2018-chevrolet-traverse-awd-first-test-review/">2018 First Test</a> that despite its newfound handling prowess, the Traverse continues to offer a smooth ride thanks to its upgraded suspension with new shock absorbers. Although it has plenty of cargo space, the Traverse is still no match for a minivan, which offers more usable space.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Traverse shares its platform with a number of General Motors vehicles including the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/acadia/2018/">GMC Acadia</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/enclave/2018/">Buick Enclave</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/spark/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Spark</a> gets a new exterior color called Sorbet.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/spark/2018/">Chevrolet Spark</a> is a subcompact front-drive city car available in four trim levels including a crossover-like variant with additional ground clearance called the Spark Activ.</p>

<p><strong>Spark LS:</strong> The base LS trim comes standard with a USB port, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, 4G LTE connectivity, 15-inch steel wheels, a four-speaker audio system, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>Spark 1LT:</strong> Moving up to the 1LT adds cruise control, power windows and locks, keyless entry, steering wheel controls for the infotainment system, a six-speaker audio system, fog lights, 15-inch alloy wheels, and power mirrors.</p>

<p><strong>Spark Activ:</strong> The crossover-like Spark Activ adds a slightly raised suspension, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, roof rails, a unique grille and rear fascia, 15-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, and heated front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Spark 2LT:</strong> The range-topping 2LT grade adds keyless start, chrome exterior and interior door handles, rear parking sensors, and an instrument cluster info display.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Spark is powered by a 1.4-liter I-4 with 98 hp and 94 lb-ft of torque that can be paired to either a five-speed manual transmission or a CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 Spark are 29/39 mpg city/highway with the manual and 30/38 mpg with the CVT. The Spark Activ is slightly less efficient at 29/38 mpg with the manual and 30/37 mpg with the CVT.</p>

<p>The NHTSA hasn’t crash tested the 2018 Chevrolet Spark. In IIHS testing, the 2018 Spark received a Good score on the moderate front overlap and side impact test (good is the highest possible score).Optional on the 2LT trim, the Driver Confidence package adds forward collision warning and lane departure warning.</p>

<p>Cargo space is limited to 11.1 cubic feet with the standard split-folding rear seats in place and 27.2 cubic feet with them folded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/spark/2016/2016-chevrolet-spark-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we liked the Spark’s quirky interior and bright exterior color options, giving it more character. The car handles surprisingly well with good grip for a city car and the ride is comfortable despite its size. However, large imperfections easily unsettle it and there’s plenty of road and engine noise on the highway. The lack of power becomes most apparent at highway speeds with four passengers, where the Spark struggles to get up to speed. Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment system offers Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity options, making onboard navigation redundant as long as you have reception on your cell phone.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Spark is one of three vehicles manufactured my General Motors in Korea. The other two are the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">Chevrolet Trax</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/encore/2018/">Buick Encore</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV</a> gets sliding sun visors for the driver and front passenger and an automatic heated steering wheel that’s standard on the Premier trim and part of the optional Comfort and Convenience package in the base LT model.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2018/">Chevrolet Bolt EV</a> is a front-drive compact all-electric hatchback available in two trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Bolt EV LT:</strong> The base LT trim comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, HID headlights, a rearview camera, single-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry/start, an 8.0-inch reconfigurable display, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 10.2-inch touchscreen, 4G LTE connectivity, two USB ports, a six-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, and cloth upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>Bolt EV Premier:</strong> Moving up to the Premier trim adds roof rails, leather upholstery, a 360-degree view camera system, a heated steering wheel, ambient lighting, heated front and rear seats, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p>Notable options include a seven-speaker Bose audio system, a wireless charger, and two additional USB charging ports for rear passengers.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV is powered by an electric motor with 200 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque backed by a single-speed transmission and a 60-kWh lithium-ion battery. On a single charge, the 2018 Bolt EV can travel up to 238 miles according to the EPA.</p>

<p>On a standard level 1 charger (a household outlet) the 2018 Bolt EV can regain 4 miles of range per hour. A level 2 charger will allow the car to fully charge from empty in a little over 9 hours while a level 3 DC fast charger allows it to gain up to 90 miles of range in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash-tested the 2018 Bolt EV. In IIHS testing, the 2017 Bolt EV received a Good score on all crash tests except for the headlights test where it got a Poor rating and the passenger’s side small front overlap test where it hasn’t been tested (Good is the highest possible score). The 2017 model also received a Superior rating on the front crash prevention test after it avoided a 12- and a 25-mph collisions (Superior is the highest rating on the front crash prevention test). As a result, the 2017 Bolt EV received the Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Lane change assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert are available on the base LT trim as part of the Driver Confidence package and are standard on the Premier trim. The Driver Confidence II package, which is only available on the Premier trim, adds lane keeping assist, forward collision warning, low-speed automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, lane departure warning, and a following distance indicator.</p>

<p>The 2018 Bolt EV has 16.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the 60/40 split-folding rear seats. That space can be expanded to 56.6 cubic feet when you fold down the rear seats, and there’s a two-level false floor for additional flexibility.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2017/the-automobile-2-0-chevrolet-bolt-ev-premier-vs-nissan-leaf-sl-vs-tesla-model-3-long-range/">comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/">Tesla Model 3</a> and the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Leaf, the Chevrolet Bolt EV ranked second. We were impressed with its nimble handling and how easy it was to drive the Bolt EV with just one pedal. We were also impressed with the Bolt EV’s range and how it felt like a completely normal car. The car’s brakes feel linear and seamlessly blend regenerative and mechanical brakes.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2017/2017-chevrolet-bolt-ev-range-test-review/">2017 Range Test</a>, we liked the punchy electric motor and were impressed by how much range it can regain while regenerating when driving downhill. The Chevrolet Bolt EV was the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-bolt-ev-2017-car-of-the-year/">2017 <strong><em>Motor Trend</em></strong> Car of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV’s battery pack is mounted under the passenger compartment, giving it a low center of gravity, which in turn helps improve its handling.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/impala/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Impala</a> gets keyless entry/start on all trims, standard LED daytime running lights and remote start on the LT trim, a Sunroof and Spoiler package, and a heated steering wheel on the LT grade. Three new exterior colors—Nightfall Gray Metallic, Graphite Metallic, and Cajun Red Metallic—have been added.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/impala/2018/">Chevrolet Impala</a> is a front-drive full-size sedan that slots above the midsize Malibu and is available in three trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Impala LS:</strong> The base LS comes with keyless entry/start, 18-inch alloy wheels, cloth/leatherette upholstery, three USB ports, a multi-information display, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, and eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat.</p>

<p><strong>Impala LT:</strong> Moving up to the LT grade gets you remote start, four-way power adjustable passenger’s seat, dual-zone climate control, LED daytime running lights, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.</p>

<p><strong>Impala Premier:</strong> On the range-topping Premier trim, additional standard features include rear parking sensors, heated front seats, eight-way power adjustable front passenger’s seat, HID headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels, navigation, an 11-speaker Bose audio system, wireless device charging, and chrome side mirror covers.</p>

<p>Notable features include a memory function for the driver’s seat, 20-inch alloy wheels, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a power tilt and telescoping steering wheel.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Impala comes standard with a 2.5-liter I-4 rated at 197 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque. Optional on the LS and LT trims and standard on the range-topping Premier model is a 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 305 hp and 264 lb-ft. Both engines are mated exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 22/30 mpg city/highway for the 2.5-liter I-4 and 19/28 mpg with the V-6. An E85 ethanol capable variant of the V-6 is rated slightly lower at 18/28 mpg on gas and 14/20 mpg on E85.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Impala a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Impala received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the small front overlap crash test where it received Acceptable rating for the driver’s side and hasn’t been test for the passenger side (Good is the highest possible score). The car also received a Poor rating on the headlights test. In the front crash prevention test, the 2018 Impala received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the speed of a 25-mph impact by 10 mph (Superior is the highest possible rating for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>On the LT trim, the available Driver Confidence package adds rear parking assist, lane change assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. The Driver Confidence package comes standard on the Premier trim. Available only on the Premier trim, the Premier Confidence package adds forward collision warning, lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>The 2018 Impala has an 18.8-cubic-foot trunk and can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/impala/2016/2016-chevrolet-impala-ltz-v6-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said that even with the V-6, you need to bury your foot into the gas pedal to get it going, as the powertrain feels like it was tuned for maximum fuel economy. Despite the large alloy wheels, the Impala’s ride remains comfortable and its interior is spacious enough to hold five adults comfortably. Surprisingly for a large car, it handles securely and doesn’t understeer too much when pushed hard. The cabin stays well-insulated on the road and the comfortable front seats further hint at the Impala’s main mission, which is to coddle occupants.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Suburban</a> gets standard LED daytime running lights on all models and two new exterior colors called Havana Metallic and Satin Steel Metallic. Like the smaller Tahoe, the 2018 Suburban gets a special RST Edition package but it is limited to the LT and Premier trims only. The RST Edition gets 22-inch gloss black wheels, black bowtie logos, a black sport grille, body-colored door handles and headlight accents, black side mirror covers and roof rails, an air suspension with leveler, and black name badges. Brembo brakes and a Borla exhaust have been added as new dealer-installed accessories.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban/2018/">Chevrolet Suburban</a> is a large SUV that slots above the Tahoe and has seating for up to nine passengers. The truck-based SUV comes in three trim levels and is available in rear- or four-wheel-drive configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Suburban LS:</strong> The base LS trim comes standard with a rearview camera, split-folding second and third rows, tri-zone climate control, rear parking sensors, remote start, LED daytime running lights, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a six-speaker audio system, cloth upholstery, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, keyless entry, cloth upholstery and 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Suburban LT:</strong> Moving up to the LT trim adds a nine-speaker Bose audio system, a programmable power liftgate, leather upholstery on the first- and second-row seats, and heated front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Suburban Premier:</strong> As the most luxurious trim, the Premier trim adds 12-way power adjustable front seats, ventilated front seats, HID headlights, front parking sensors, 20-inch alloy wheels, Magnetic Ride Control, a hands-free programmable power liftgate, navigation, a 10-speaker Bose audio system, a wireless charging pad, keyless start, power-folding second- and third-row seats, a sunroof, and heated second-row seats.</p>

<p>Power folding second- and third-row seats are available, as is a hands-free programmable tailgate.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Suburban is powered by a 5.3-liter V-8 rated at 355 hp and 383 lb-ft of torque and comes paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 16/23 mpg city/highway for rear-drive variants and 15/22 mpg for models with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Suburban received a four-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t crash tested the 2018 Suburban but the 2017 model received a Basic rating for the front crash prevention test for its available forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest score for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>The LS’ Enhanced Driver Alert package includes low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, and a safety alert seat. Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane change alert are available as part of the Luxury package in the LT trim and standard on the Premier grade. Adaptive cruise control is available on the Premier trim and is bundled together with an automatic emergency braking system that works at higher speeds.</p>

<p>Behind the third row, the 2018 Suburban has 39.3 cubic feet of cargo capacity that can be expanded to 76.7 cubic feet behind the second row, and 121.7 cubic feet when the second- and third-row seats are folded. When properly equipped, the 2018 Suburban can haul up to 8,300 pounds in rear-drive guise or up to 8,000 pounds in four-wheel drive models.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban/2015/2015-chevrolet-suburban-gmc-yukon-xl-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, we said that the Suburban feels truck-like on the road and it drives as big as it looks. The six-speed automatic needs to downshift multiple times to get the necessary passing power. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban/2015/2015-chevrolet-suburban-2015-gmc-yukon-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>, we liked the Suburban’s cylinder deactivation system, which turns four cylinders on and off seamlessly. Ride comfort is excellent despite the Suburban’s truck-based roots. The multimedia system is also easy to use and is available with 4G LTE, allowing the Suburban to turn into a mobile hot spot.</p>

<p>The standard 5.3-liter V-8 in the 2018 Suburban is also used in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500/2018/">Chevrolet Silverado 1500</a> and Tahoe, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/yukon/2018/">GMC Yukon</a>, Yukon XL and Sierra 1500.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong> A rearview camera and a 7.0-inch touchscreen are now standard on the <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-2500hd/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD</a>. The Z71 and High Country models get a new grille design, and the tire pressure monitor on all models now has a tire fill alert system. Three new exterior colors, Cajun Red Tintcoat, Havana Metallic, and Iridescent Pearl, are now available.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong> Slotting below the Silverado 3500HD, the 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-2500hd/2018/">Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD</a> is the smaller of the two heavy-duty trucks sold by <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is optional. In addition to two bed lengths, the Silverado 2500HD is available in three cab styles.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong> Two engines are available in the 2018 Silverado 2500HD, a 6.0-liter V-8 rated at 360 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque or an optional 6.6-liter turbodiesel V-8 with 445 hp and 910 lb-ft. Both engines are paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. Opting for the diesel engine, however, adds over $10,000 to the truck’s base price, making it an expensive proposition. The Silverado 2500HD can tow up to 3,534 pounds of payload or haul up to 18,100 pounds when properly equipped. Standard features include Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, a 3.5-inch multi-information display, Bluetooth connectivity, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, 17-inch steel wheels, an automatic locking differential and a 60/40 split-folding rear seats on dual- and crew cab models. Higher trims can be had with cloth or leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, a wireless device charging pad, a Bose premium audio system, dual-zone climate control, and remote start.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong> The NHTSA gave the 2018 Silverado 2500HD a four-star overall rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t tested the 2018 Silverado 2500HD. On higher trims, the Driver Alert package is available. and it adds lane departure warning, forward collision warning, the Safety Alert Seat, and parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong> In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-2500hd/2015/2015-chevrolet-silverado-hd-gmc-sierra-hd-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>, we noted that the Silverado 2500HD rides surprisingly well and that the interior features a user-friendly infotainment system. Even before it received additionally power, the optional diesel engine offers plenty of grunt on tap and remains quiet. We also noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-2500hd/2015/2015-chevrolet-silverado-2500hd-ltz-first-test/">2015 First Test</a> that the interior is well-built and well-insulated, with minimal noise entering the cabin. The truck’s ride has also improved substantially and has minimal bucking and porpoising compared to older heavy-duty pickups.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong> The 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD’s diesel engine is shared with the larger Silverado 3500HD and the <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-2500hd/2018/">GMC Sierra 2500HD</a> and 3500HD.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Camaro</a> receives a new variant of the powerful Camaro <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/the-2017-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-is-capable-of-200-mph/">ZL1</a> called the Camaro <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2018-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-1le-supercharged-z28-successor/">ZL1 1LE</a>, a track-focused variant with a full aero kit to keep the car planted. The Camaro ZL1 1LE also features special wheels and tires to keep it light, and an adjustable suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro/2018/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> is a rear-drive sports car that slots below the Corvette and is available in a number of variants including the track-oriented 1LE model. In addition to the coupe, a convertible variant is available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2017 Camaro lineup includes four engines that can be paired to a manual or automatic transmission. As soon as we learn more about the 2018 Camaro aside from the new ZL1 1LE model, we’ll update this space (we don’t expect the lineup to change much, if at all).</p>

<p><strong>Model: Camaro LT 2.0T</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 2.0-liter turbo-four – six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 275 hp/295 lb-ft</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: Camaro LT V6; Camaro V6 1LE</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 3.6-liter V-6 – six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 335 hp/284 lb-ft</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: Camaro SS, Camaro SS 1LE</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 6.2-liter V-8 – six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 455 hp/455 lb-ft</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: Camaro ZL1, Camaro ZL1 1LE</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 6.2-liter suparcharged V-8 – six-speed manual or 10-speed automatic<br>
Power: 650 hp/640 lb-ft</br></br></p>

<p>Standard and available features include Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0- or 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, a wireless charging system, a Bose premium audio system, keyless entry/start, remote start (automatic-equipped cars only), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, a heated steering wheel, and heated and ventilated front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Active and passive safety features available on the 2018 Camaro will include blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane change alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro/2017/2017-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-first-test-brute-squad-goals/">2017 First Test</a>, we said the Camaro ZL1 offers impeccable performance, with strong acceleration and the same excellent handling that the current generation Camaro is known for. Additionally, the car is at home at the track, even without the 1LE package, making it an excellent all-around high-performance sports car.</p>

<p>The less powerful Camaro V6 1LE paced fourth in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/124-spider/2017/chevrolet-camaro-1le-bmw-m2-ford-focus-rs-fiat-124-spider-abarth-porsche-718-boxster-s-toyota-86/">2017 comparison test</a> due to its long brake pedal travel and shifter that’s not as crisp as the one found on the SS 1LE. It also lacks Mgnetic Ride Control and the electronically operated limited-slip differential, which means it doesn’t have the same level of capability as its V-8-powered bretheren. However, the car is exceptionally neutral and it’s hard to make it understeer, giving it great balance and confident handling.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang/2016/comparison-2016-chevrolet-camaro-rs-vs-2016-ford-mustang-ecoboost/">2016 four-cylinder pony car comparison test</a> with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang/2018/">Ford Mustang</a> EcoBoost, the Camaro with the 2.0-liter turbo-four lost due to it wearing all-season tires, which was what dragged the car down, particularly its handling and braking. The car’s engine, on the other hand, is energetic and isn’t as laggy as the 2.3-liter turbo-four we’ve experienced in the pre-2018 Mustang EcoBoost.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Camaro rides on GM’s Alpha platform shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/ats/2018/">Cadillac ATS</a> and CTS.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Redesigned for the 2018 model year, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox/2018/">Chevrolet Equinox</a> features a new exterior design reminiscent of the Malibu, Cruze, and Volt. The car also receives a new engine lineup that includes a diesel option and an available suite of active safety technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting below the larger three-row Traverse but above <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2017/2017-chevrolet-trax-first-look-review/">the smaller Trax</a>, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Equinox</a> can seat up to five and can be had with front- or all-wheel-drive configurations. Compared to the crossover it replaces, the new Equinox is about 400 pounds lighter.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two new turbocharged four-cylinder gas engines are available including a 1.5-liter unit estimated to have 170 hp and 203 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter with around 252 hp and 260 lb-ft. A 1.6-liter turbodiesel I-4 will also be available and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> expects it to have 136 hp and 236 lb-ft. The smaller 1.5-liter turbo-four and the 1.6-liter turbodiesel I-4 come paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and the 2.0-liter turbo-four is coupled to a new nine-speed automatic. EPA fuel economy estimates haven’t been released yet, but the diesel-powered Equinox will be the most efficient at approximately 40 mpg on the highway. Gas-powered variants with front-wheel drive are expected to achieve up to 31 mpg on the highway with the 1.5-liter and up to 28 mpg with the 2.0-liter.</p>

<p>Cargo space in the 2018 Equinox, according to Chevrolet’s estimates, is slightly less than in the car it replaces at 29.9 cubic feet with the split-folding second row in place and 63.5 cubic feet with them down (versus 31.5 and 63.7 cubic feet), not bad for a vehicle that’s 4.7 inches shorter than the vehicle it replaces. New features include an updated version of Chevrolet’s MyLink multimedia interface with a seven-inch touchscreen as standard or an optional eight-inch touchscreen with navigation. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard on both systems.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Equinox is now available with a full suite of active safety tech that includes the Safety Alert Seat, a multi-camera parking system, forward collision warning with following distance indicator, a low-speed automatic emergency braking system, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. A rear seat reminder can remind you to check the second row if you’ve left anything. The NHTSA and IIHS have yet to safety test the 2018 Equinox.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We haven’t driven the 2018 Equinox yet but wonder if the top-seller might be an improvement over the current generation, which we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox/2016/2016-chevrolet-equinox-ltz-awd-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a> as having a harsh, naturally aspirated base engine that struggled going up freeway onramps.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Equinox’s gas engines are shared with the current-generation <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/malibu/2016/2016-chevrolet-malibu-15t-first-test-review/">Malibu midsize sedan</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Silverado 1500</a> gets a rearview camera and tire fill alert on all models. WT models now get a standard MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen. LTZ models are now available with the eAssist mild hybrid system and the Custom trim is now available on crew cab models.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500/2018/">Chevrolet Silverado 1500</a> is a full-size truck slotting above the midsize Colorado and below the larger heavy Silverado 2500. Three cab styles are available and two bed lengths are offered. Rear-wheel drive is standard while four-wheel drive is optional. A number of special-edition packages help make the 2018 Silverado 1500 more distinctive including the Black Out Edition, Special Ops Edition, and Redline Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Silverado 1500 WT:</strong> The base WT comes well equipped with 17-inch alloy wheels, HID headlights, a full-size spare tire, a 3.5-inch instrument cluster info display, vinyl upholstery, a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, a USB port, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, and a six-speaker audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Silverado 1500 LS: </strong>Moving up to the LS grade adds keyless entry, 4G LTE connectivity, chrome front and rear bumpers, and a grille with chrome surrounds.</p>

<p><strong>Silverado 1500 Custom:</strong> The Custom model adds 20-inch alloy wheels, body-colored headlight bezels and grille surrounds, a locking tailgate, and front recovery hooks.</p>

<p><strong>Silverado 1500 LT:</strong> LT variants get more features like bright alloy wheels, the EZ Lift &amp; Lower tailgate, a 4.2-inch instrument cluster info display, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cloth upholstery, and 40/20/40 split-folding bench seat.</p>

<p><strong>Silverado 1500 LTZ:</strong> One of two more upscale trims, the LTZ comes with bright 18-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, 10-way power adjustable front seats, remote start, a 110V outlet, and chrome door handles, side mirror covers, door moldings, and beltline moldings.</p>

<p><strong>Silverado 1500 High Country:</strong> The luxury-oriented High Country grade gets you a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, 12-way power adjustable front seats, a spray-on bedliner, 20-inch alloy wheels, a Bose audio system, navigation, a wireless phone charger, and a two-tone Saddle and Black interior.</p>

<p>One notable option is the Z71 package, which is available on the LT and LTZ trims. The Z71 package adds an off-road-tuned suspension with Rancho monotube shocks, hill descent control, a high capacity air cleaner, a heavy duty automatic locking differential, underbody skid plates covering the transfer case, and an appearance package that adds unique door plates, gauge clusters, a different grille, and a unique lower front bumper.</p>

<p>The 2018 Silverado 1500 is available with three engine options including a 4.3-liter V-6 with 285 hp and 305 lb-ft of torque, a 5.3-liter V-8 with 355 hp and 383 lb-ft, and a 6.2-liter V-8 with 420 hp and 460 lb-ft. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard on the V-6 and the 5.3-liter V-8, while an eight-speed automatic is optional on the latter. Silverado 1500s with the 6.2-liter V-8 come exclusively with the eight-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the base V-6 engine are 18/24 mpg city/highway in rear-drive form and 16/21 mpg with four-wheel drive. Move up to the 5.3-liter V-8 and those numbers drop to 16/23 mpg for rear-drive trucks and 16/22 with four-wheel drive. Models with the 5.3-liter V-8 and the optional eight-speed automatic aren’t as efficient at 16/21 mpg for rear-drive trucks and 15/20 mpg with four-wheel drive. An eAssist mild hybrid system is available with the 5.3-liter V-8, bumping fuel economy ratings up to 18/24 mpg for rear-drive models but four-wheel-drive-equipped variants are rated at 16/21 mpg. The 6.2-liter V-8 is the least efficient at 15/20 mpg for rear-drive models and 15/19 mpg on four-wheel-drive-equipped trucks.</p>

<p>The 2018 Silverado received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Silverado 1500 received a Good score on all but headlights test where it received a Poor rating and front small overlap test where extended cab models received an Average rating and the crew cab model received a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2018 Silverado 1500 received a Basic rating since its active safety features haven’t been tested yet (Superior is the highest rating on the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Higher trim levels are available with lane keeping assist, forward collision warning, and low-speed automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p>When properly equipped, the 2018 Silverado 1500 can tow up to 12,500 pounds; however, that’s limited to rear-drive double cab and crew cab models. The truck can also carry up to 2,250 pounds of payload provided you choose the rear-drive double cab model.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500/2017/2017-chevrolet-silverado-1500-z71-4wd-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that on-road ride comfort is a weak point because the Silverado 1500 easily gets unsettled over the smallest road imperfections. Off-road, however, the truck shines and can easily get through obstacles thanks to the additional ground clearance of the Z71 package’s off-road-tuned suspension. The interior is well-insulated and doesn’t get too noisy on the highway, but the available 5.3-liter V-8 isn’t especially quickest.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong> The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-3500hd/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD</a> gets a standard rearview camera and 7.0-inch touchscreen. High Country and Z71 models get new grille designs, and the tire pressure monitoring system now comes with tire fill alert. Three exterior colors, Cajun Red Tintcoat, Havana Metallic, and Iridiscent Pearl Tricoat, are now available.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong> The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-3500hd/2018/">Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD</a> is the largest truck <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> makes, slotting above the smaller Silverado 2500HD. Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional.  There are three cab styles, two bed lengths and either single or dual rear-wheel configurations available in the 2018 Silverado 3500HD.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong> Two engines are available in the 2018 Silverado 3500HD, a 6.0-liter V-8 with 360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque and an optional 6.6-liter turbodiesel V-8 with 445 hp and 910 lb-ft. Opting for the diesel engine, however, adds nearly $10,000 to the Silverado 3500HD’s base price. Both engines are paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. The truck can haul up to 7,153 pounds of payload, and when properly equipped, the 2018 Silverado 3500HD can tow up to 23,300 pounds. Standard features on the base WT trim include a rearview camera, Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, 60/40 split-folding rear seats on the double- and crew-cab models, an automatic locking differential, 4G LTE connectivity, a 3.5-inch multi-information display, Bluetooth connectivity, 18-inch steel wheels, and vinyl upholstery. Higher trims can be had cloth or leather upholstery, navigation, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, heated and ventilated front seats, a larger 4.2-inch multi-information display, a heated steering wheel, a Bose premium audio system, and a wireless device charger.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong> The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD. On higher trim levels, buyers can opt for the Driver Alert package, which adds forward collision warning, lane departure warning, the Safety Alert Seat, and parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong> We’ve yet to test the 2018 Silverado 3500HD, but in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-2500hd/2015/2015-chevrolet-silverado-hd-gmc-sierra-hd-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a> we said that the truck’s interior features a similar look to that of the smaller Silverado 1500, excellent build quality, and a user-friendly infotainment system. Ride comfort, on the other hand, is firm, but it’s much improved over the past-generation heavy-duty trucks. Even before it received a power upgrade, the optional diesel engine, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-2500hd/2015/2015-chevrolet-silverado-2500hd-ltz-first-test/">2015 First Test</a> of the smaller Silverado 2500HD, offered plenty of power for accelerating and hauling payloads and trailers.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong> The Chevrolet Sierra 3500HD shares its underpinnings and powertrain options with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-3500hd/2018/">GMC Sierra 3500HD</a>, which is slightly more premium, especially in Denali trim.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Cruze</a> gets a new exterior color, Satin Steel Gray Metallic. Additionally, hatchback models are now available with the diesel engine.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/2018/">Chevrolet Cruze</a> is a front-drive compact sedan and hatchback slotting below the midsize Malibu and above the subcompact Sonic. Four trim levels are available.</p>

<p><strong>Cruze L: </strong>The base L trim gets 15-inch steel wheels, Bluetooth, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>’s MyLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a four-speaker audio system, a USB port, cloth upholstery, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>Cruze LS: </strong>Moving up to the LS trim adds a compass, a center console armrest and floor mats.</p>

<p><strong>Cruze LT: </strong>The LT trim adds 16-inch alloy wheels, a six-speaker audio system, cruise control, LED daytime running lights, and 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p><strong>Cruze Diesel: </strong>Diesel-powered models come standard with heated front seats, an eight-way power-operated driver’s seat, keyless entry/start, and remote start on automatic models. The manual-equipped Cruze Diesel hatchback also comes standard with the RS package, which adds a body kit, fog lights, a roof spoiler, 18-inch alloy wheels, and a Watt’s Link rear suspension for improved ride quality.</p>

<p><strong>Cruze Premier: </strong> Range-topping Premier trim comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, ambient lighting, a heated steering wheel, leather upholstery, a Watt’s Link rear suspension, and a USB charging port for rear passengers.</p>

<p>Options include a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, a sunroof, a nine-speaker Bose audio system, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, heated rear seats, automatic climate control, and wireless phone charging. Most of the available options are available on automatic-equipped models while some are limited to the range-topping Premier trim. Diesel models miss out on features such as navigation, wireless phone charging, and heated rear seats.</p>

<p>The 2018 Cruze comes standard with a 1.4-liter turbo-four with 153 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque, which can be paired to a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. A 1.6-liter turbodiesel I-4 with 137 hp and 240 lb-ft is also available and can be paired to either a six-speed manual or a new nine-speed automatic that General Motors co-developed with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 Cruze sedan are 27/40 mpg city/highway for the manual and 29/40 mpg with the automatic. Premier models are less efficient at 29/39 mpg. The hatchback is rated at 27/38 mpg with the manual and 29/38 mpg with the automatic. As in the sedan, the Premier trim on the hatch takes a hit in fuel economy and is rated at 28/37 mpg.</p>

<p>Diesel-powered models are the most efficient, with the EPA rating the Cruze sedan at 31/47 mpg with the manual and 30/52 mpg with the automatic. Hatchback variants powered by the diesel engine are a smidge less efficient at 29/48 mpg with the manual or 30/45 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>The Chevrolet Cruze received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS evaluations, the 2018 Cruze has only been tested in side and moderate front overlap impact tests where it received a Good rating (Good is the highest possible score). It also received a Basic rating on the IIHS’ front crash prevention test for having an available forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest score for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Lane change assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert are available as part of the Driver Confidence package on the LT, Premier, and automatic-equipped Diesel models. The Driver Confidence II package, which is only available on the Premier trim, includes following distance indicator, forward collision warning, automatic high beams, lane departure warning, and lane keeping assist. Adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and pedestrian detection are not available on any trim of the 2018 Cruze. Diesel-powered models equipped with an automatic transmission are available only with the Driver Confidence package.</p>

<p>The 2018 Cruze sedan has a 13.9-cubic-foot trunk and can be expanded via the available split-folding rear seats from the LT trim and higher. For extra practicality, the hatchback has 22.7 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 47.2 cubic feet with them folded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2016/2016-2017-big-test-compact-sedans/">2016 Big Test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2018/">Honda Civic</a>, Mazda3, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/sentra/2018/">Nissan Sentra</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2018/">Toyota Corolla</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/elantra/2018/">Hyundai Elantra</a>, and the previous-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2018/">Volkswagen Jetta</a>, the Chevrolet Cruze placed second thanks to its comfortable ride, buttoned down chassis, and tightly controlled body motions. However, its low-speed ride was busy compared to its rivals. Its interior was finished in a cool two-tone color scheme but had quality issues such as a rocking driver’s seat. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/2016/2016-chevrolet-cruze-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the Cruze’s infotainment system, which was easy to use and easily integrates smartphones. Road noise, on the other hand, does get excessive with the larger alloy wheel options.</p>

<p>With the standard six-speed manual transmission, the Cruze’s fun to drive factor doesn’t really get amped up. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/2017/2017-chevrolet-cruze-lt-hatchback-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we noted that the manual feels vague with long throws, poor clutch engagement. With the standard 16-inch alloy wheels wrapped in tires with plenty of sidewall, the ride is plenty comfortable and easily soaks up road imperfections. Handling is still reasonably secure but it won’t provide you with the same level of confidence as more sporting compact hatchbacks.</p>

<p>Diesel-powered models offer a comfortable ride and secure handling, but we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/2018/2018-chevrolet-cruze-td-hatchback-first-test/">2018 First Test</a>, the car can get unsettled over large road imperfections with the optional 18-inch alloy wheels. The turbodiesel I-4’s generous low-end torque also means it doesn’t feel underpowered and can easily pass slower traffic on the highway; however, it does suffer from turbo lag. Although the nine-speed automatic is no longer stingy with downshifts, it gets confused in traffic and is often changing gears. Interior quality is mixed, with a number of large panel gaps and hard plastics surround soft-touch areas where your arms fall.</p>

<p>The 1.6-liter turbodiesel I-4 is also used in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox/2018/">Chevrolet Equinox</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/terrain/2018/">GMC Terrain</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2018/">2018 Chrysler Pacifica</a> gets rear parking sensors and blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert as standard. A new entry-level L trim has also been added to the gas-only Pacifica, and the plug-in hybrid gets a Touring Plus variant. All models get an updated version of FCA’s UConnect infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration. New cosmetic options include new alloy wheel designs, bright side moldings, and a chrome roof rack.</p>

<p>Touring Plus variants get remote start standard and Touring L models get standard perforated leather upholstery. The Touring L trim can now be had with a Premium group with the 13-speaker Alpine audio system and a larger 8.4-inch touchscreen. Touring L Plus variants add a panoramic sunroof option, and the Harman Kardon premium audio system is now a standalone option in the gas-only Limited model. A new S Appearance package is now available and it comes with gloss black grille surrounds, black 20-inch alloy wheels, black <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> badges, and black seats with Light Diesel Gray accents.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2018/">Chrysler Pacifica</a> is a minivan that can seat up to eight passengers when equipped with the second-row bench seat. In addition to the standard gas-only Pacifica, there’s also the Pacifica plug-in hybrid, which offers better fuel economy. However, the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica-plug-in/2018/">Pacifica Hybrid</a> is only available with a seven-seat configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Chrysler Pacifica is powered by a 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 287 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque, and the engine is paired exclusively to a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Pacifica plug-in hybrid pairs the same 3.6-liter V-6 to an electric motor, a CVT, and a lithium-ion battery for a combined output of 260 hp.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the gas-only Pacifica are 19/28 mpg city/highway on models with the engine stop/start system and 18/28 mpg on those without it. Plug-in hybrid variants are capable of traveling up to 33 miles on a single charge. With a full tank and a full charge, the Pacifica Hybrid is rated at 32 mpg combined and has a driving range of 570 miles.</p>

<p>Both variants of the 2018 Pacifica offer excellent cargo capacity at 32.3 cubic feet behind the third row, 87.5 cubic feet behind the second row and 140.5 cubic feet behind the front seats. However, only the gas-powered Pacifica is rated for towing and when properly equipped it can tow up to 3,600 pounds.</p>

<p>Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, FCA’s UConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, a rearview camera, keyless entry, and rear parking sensors. Options include a 360-degree multi-camera system, remote start, keyless start, automatic parking assist, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, premium audio systems from Alpine or Harman Kardon, a larger 8.4-inch touchscreen, navigation, a rear seat entertainment system, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, HID headlights, an onboard vacuum, and tri-zone climate control.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Pacifica a five-star overall safety score (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 model but the 2017 Pacifica received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and Average on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Pacifica received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest rating in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Chrysler Pacifica received the 2017 Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>A suite of active safety features available on higher trims of the Pacifica includes lane departure warning, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is standard on all 2018 Pacifica variants.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2017/2017-chrysler-pacifica-limited-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> of the range-topping Limited trim, we were impressed with its excellent build quality, which is a big step up compared to its predecessor, the Town &amp; Country. The nine-speed automatic is a transmission we’ve experienced issues with in other Fiat-Chrysler vehicles, but in the Pacifica, it works well with the 3.6-liter V-6, offering strong acceleration for a minivan. However, in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2017/2017-chrysler-pacifica-touring-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> of the mid-level Touring trim, we found the transmission was hunting for gears on a few occasions. The easy-to-operate Stow ‘n Go second-row seats provide an additional layer of flexibility.</p>

<p>Despite having less power and more weight than the regular model, the Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid offers strong acceleration. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica-plug-in/2017/2017-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-first-test-charging-ahead/">2017 First Test</a>, we noted that the brakes were squishy and the brake pedal had a long travel. In terms of handling, the Pacifica plug-in hybrid is surprisingly well composed for a minivan and the cabin stays quiet on the highway. Opting for the plug-in hybrid means not having Stow ‘n Go second-row seats or an eighth seat (since the second-row bench isn’t available on the Pacifica Hybrid).</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The second- and third-row seats on the Chrysler Pacifica can be stowed into a bin under the floor to create a flat cargo floor.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018<br/></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2018/">2018 Chrysler Pacifica</a> Plug-In (also known as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2018/">Chrysler Pacifica</a> Hybrid) gets an updated UConnect infotainment system with a larger 7.0-inch touchscreen as standard and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. All trims now come standard with rear parking sensors and blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. Two new exterior colors — Copper Pearl Coat and Ocean Blue Metallic — have also been added. Touring L variants get remote start and perforated leather upholstery as standard.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> Pacifica Hybrid is the plug-in hybrid variant of the Pacifica minivan and it comes with seating for up to seven passengers. Unlike the gas-only Pacifica, the plug-in hybrid variant doesn’t come with the Stow N’ Go second-row seats.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In is powered by a 3.6-liter V-6 coupled to a lithium-ion battery, an electric motor and a CVT for a combined output of 260 hp. Despite its large interior, the Pacifica Plug-In is still good for an EPA-rated 32 mpg combined. With a full battery charge, the minivan can travel up to 33 miles before the gas engine turns on. On a full tank and a full charge, the Pacifica Plug-In can travel up to around 570 miles.</p>

<p>Since its batteries are mounted under the second-row, the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In has the same cargo capacity at 32.3 cubic feet behind the third row, 87.5 cubic feet behind the second row and 140.5 cubic feet behind the front seats. However, the Pacifica Plug-In isn’t rated for towing like the gas-only Pacifica.</p>

<p>Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, three-zone climate control, cloth upholstery, FCA’s UConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a rearview camera, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p>Options include a 360-degree camera system, 18-inch alloy wheels, a rear-seat entertainment system, remote start, keyless entry/start, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, leather upholstery, a larger 8.4-inch touchscreen, navigation, a tri-pane panoramic sunroof, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, front parking sensors, and automatic parking assist.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Pacifica Plug-In but the non-hybrid Pacifica received a five-star overall rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the gas-powered Pacifica received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and Acceptable on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Pacifica received a Superior rating after it avoided a collision in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest rating in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Pacifica was given the 2017 Top Safety Pick+ award by the IIHS.</p>

<p>Available as an option on the Limited trim is a full active safety suite that includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control automatic high beams, lane keeping assist and lane departure warning. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is standard on all Pacifica Plug-In models.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica-plug-in/2017/2017-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-first-test-charging-ahead/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that even though the Pacifica plug-in hybrid is heavier and not as powerful as the standard Pacifica, the engine-upgrade model offers strong acceleration for a minivan. Its handling is surprisingly good thanks to its low center of gravity, which makes it feel planted on the road. The brake pedal, however, feels squishy and has a long travel. Ride comfort is excellent with its suspension soaking up bumps well. Even though it’s a mainstream minivan, the Pacifica Plug-In in higher trims has an interior that feels premium thanks to extensive use of high-quality materials. However, even though its interior is spacious the Pacifica Plug-In isn’t as flexible as the gas-only Pacifica since it doesn’t have the Stow N’ Go second-row seats and it can only seat up to seven passengers (instead of the eight-passenger seating offered on the non-hybrid).</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In’s battery is placed under the floor where the second-row Stow N’ Go bins are normally located.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/300/2018/">2018 Chrysler 300</a> gets a new base Touring trim with 17-inch alloy wheels and cloth upholstery, and two new exterior colors, Green Metallic Clear Coat, and Ocean Blue Metallic Clear Coat. All 300C models mode come standard with the 5.7-liter V-8 and the Limited model is now available with 20-inch alloy wheels. The Harman Kardon premium audio system, navigation, power sunshade, and the dual-pane sunroof are now available as standalone options in the 300 Limited and 300C. Touring models can now get the Sport Appearance and Chrome Appearance packages while the 300S now has the Beats audio system and the Alloy package as available options.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/300/2018/">Chrysler 300</a> is a full-size sedan that’s available in rear- or all-wheel-drive configurations. The 300 is the only sedan in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a>’s lineup, now that the 200 midsize sedan has been discontinued.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Chrysler 300 is available with two engine choices a 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 292 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque (300 hp and 264 lb-ft in the 300S) or a 5.7-liter V-8 with 363 hp and 394 lb-ft. Both engines come paired exclusively to an eight-speed automatic transmission; however, all-wheel drive is only available with the V-6. EPA fuel economy ratings are 19/30 mpg city/highway for rear-drive models with the V-6 and 18/27 mpg with all-whee drive. The more powerful 5.7-liter V-8 is the least efficient at 16/25 mpg.<b> </b>Trunk space is generous at 16.3 cubic feet of cargo space and can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base trim include 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, dual-zone climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power-operated drive’s seat, a six-speaker audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, FCA’s UConnect infotainment system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a rearview camera, and keyless entry/start. Options included alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, HID headlights, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, and remote start. The 300S is further distinguished by a sportier suspension tune compared to other trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Chrysler 300 received a four-star overall safety score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 300 but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the front small overlap test and the headlights test where it received a Marginal and Poor rating respectively (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Chrysler 300 received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the severity of a 25-mph impact by 14 mph (Superior is the highest rating in the front crash prevention test)</p>

<p>Active safety features such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control are available only on higher trims as part of an optional package. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available  as part of another package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/300/2018/2018-chrysler-300-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>, we said that the fit and finish of the luxury-oriented 300C is excellent — nearly as luxurious as a midsize sedan with a luxury badge. The sportier 300S, on the other hand, has a slightly stiffer suspension but doesn’t sacrifice the car’s comfortable ride; however, it’s difficult to tell the difference in handling. With the optional V-8, the 300 offers strong acceleration and the eight-speed automatic shifts quickly and smartly.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/">Dodge</a> adds the SXT Plus and GT Plus trims to the Charger lineup, and GT trims now come standard with 300 hp, the Performance Pages feature on the infotainment screen, and 19-inch alloy wheels.

In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the V-6 powered Charger hit 60 mph in 6.4 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 110 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Dodge Charger received in the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA in both rear- and all-wheel-drive forms. In IIHS testing, the 2018 Charger received the second-lowest score of Marginal for the small overlap front crash test and the highest score of Good in the other crash tests. The Charger received the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation by avoiding a collision in a 12-mph test and reducing the speed of a 25-mph collision by 12 mph thanks to the optional automatic emergency braking system found in the Premium and Technology packages. The Technology package adds other driver assist safety features including adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with lane keep assist, a rain-sensitive windshield, and automatic high beams.

The six-speaker system can be upgraded to a 10-speaker Beats Audio system or a 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system. A 7.0-inch instrument cluster display is standard on all trims.</p>

<p>After one year with our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/charger/2016/2016-dodge-charger-srt-hellcat-review-long-term-verdict/">long-term 2016 Dodge Charger</a> SRT Hellcat, we felt that this 707-hp sedan was a normal car in many ways: “It’s roomy, it’s surprisingly comfortable, the Uconnect infotainment system works pretty much OK, and the back seats are good for three adults, fantastic for two. But if any of the above figures into your decision to go out and purchase a Charger Hellcat—a $73,725 purchase that I highly recommend—you’re doing it wrong.”</p>

<p>However, the Hellcat is not a normal car in many other ways: “You get yourself a 707-hp Charger so that when you’re virtually parked in traffic you can relieve tension by spinning the back wheels a bit. Not a big smoky burnout, but just enough to make everyone around you nervous. It helps both relieve the tension and break up the monotony. You buy yourself a Charger Hellcat because it’s as close to a concealed carry permit as there is in the automotive world. Just like a .357 Magnum under your coat, you always know the immense power is there, mere inches away.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/charger/2016/2016-dodge-charger-sxt-blacktop-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the six-cylinder <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/2016/">2016 Dodge Challenger</a> SXT Blacktop, we felt the heavy sedan needed a little more power and sound from the engine, but “despite the lack of solid power, the Charger SXT Blacktop shined in other areas. The brakes were strong and confident whether stopping abruptly or gradually. Handling was top-notch with excellent grip in sharp, quick corners and stiff steering. The ride itself was smooth, and road imperfections were barely felt.”</p>

<p>We were not fans of the hard plastic used throughout the interior, but the infotainment system was easy to use. We concluded by saying, “The 2016 Dodge Charger SXT Blacktop is ideal for customers looking for a little more edge in their daily driver. This large sedan is a great alternative to traditional sedans, offering plenty of cargo room, passenger room, and technology. Although the performance may not be where we would like, it likely won’t be a hindrance to those buying the SXT.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/durango/2018/">2018 Dodge Durango</a> gets a high-performance SRT model, an updated infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, a new steering wheel with paddle shifters, and two new exterior colors: B5 Blue and In Violet Metallic. All models get a 7.0-inch touchscreen and rearview camera as standard equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/durango/2018/">Dodge Durango</a> is a midsize three-row SUV that slots above the smaller Journey and is available in rear- or four-wheel drive configurations. Unlike its rivals, the Durango is available with a V-8 engine option and a performance-oriented variant.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/">Dodge</a> Durango is available with three engines including a 3.6-liter V-6 with 293 hp (295 hp in models with dual exhausts) and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 5.7-liter V-8 rated at 360 hp and 390 lb-ft, and a 6.4-liter V-8 with 475 hp and 470 lb-ft. All engines come exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 19/26 mpg city/highway for V-6-powered rear-drive models and 18/25 mpg with four-wheel drive. Move up to the 5.7-liter V-8 and fuel economy drops to 14/22 mpg for both rear- and four wheel drive models. The Durango SRT with its 6.4-liter V-8 is the least efficient at 13/19 mpg.</p>

<p>Cargo space is 17.2 cubic feet behind the third row, 47.7 cubic feet behind the second row, and 84.5 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the V-6 models can haul up to 6,200 pounds while the 5.7-liter V-8 can tow up to 7,400 pounds in rear-drive guise or 7,200 pounds with four-wheel drive. The Durango SRT can haul the most at 8,700 pounds when properly equipped.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base model include 18-inch alloy wheels, a 7.0-inch reconfigurable multi-information display, cloth upholstery, two USB ports, FCA’s Uconnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, keyless entry/start, and three-zone climate control.</p>

<p>Options include a larger 8.4-inch touchscreen, navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, power-operated heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, HID headlights, leather upholstery, second-row captain’s chairs, heated second-row seats, a Beats premium audio system, and a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Durango received a four-star rating in the NHTSA’s front crash test and in the rollover test, three stars with all-wheel drive and four stars with rear-wheel drive (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 Durango but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the small overlap test and the headlights test where it received a Marginal rating (Good is the highest rating).</p>

<p>Optional on all but the base SXT trim is a suite of active safety features that includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available as part of an available package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/durango/2014/the-big-test-2014-three-row-crossovers/">2014 comparison test</a> that included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe/2018/">Hyundai Santa Fe</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/pathfinder/2018/">Nissan Pathfinder</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">Toyota Highlander</a>, and the previous generations of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/pilot/2018/">Honda Pilot</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2018/">Mazda CX-9</a>, the spacious Durango won even though it can get quite pricey. On the road, the Durango doesn’t feel underpowered even with its base 3.6-liter V-6 and with its massive 24.5-gallon fuel tank, it has excellent cruising range. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/durango/2014/2014-dodge-durango-limited-awd-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>, we also noted that the Durango’s independent suspension gives it a comfortable ride and surefooted handling for an SUV its size. The car’s UConnect infotainment system is user-friendly and getting into the third row is a breeze thanks to easy to use sliding second row seats.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Durango SRT’s 6.4-liter V-8 is also found in the Challenger and Charger SRT 392 and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/grand-cherokee/2018/">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> SRT.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The news on the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/2018/">2018 Dodge Challenger</a> is the outrageous 808-hp dragstrip brute, the Challenger SRT Demon, certified by the National Hot Rod Association as the quickest quarter-mile production in the world. The Demon is capable of producing 840 hp and 770 lb-ft of torque on high-octane race fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>With the discontinuation of the Viper, the Challenger becomes the only coupe offered by <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/">Dodge</a> and one of two non-SUV cars, with a starting price set below the Charger sedan. The Challenger is now the automaker’s sportiest car with a wide range of models, limited editions, and appearance packages.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/2018/">Dodge Challenger</a> will likely come with a choice of the previous four engine options along with the addition of the new Demon supercharged engine. The V-6 and Demon engines can only be paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and the rest of the engine options have an available six-speed manual. Power is routed to rear wheels with the exception of the new-for-2017 all-wheel-drive GT model. Once we have official info on the rest of the non-Demon 2018 Challenger lineup, we’ll update this space.</p>

<p>Here’s how the 2018 Challenger lineup will likely look:</p>

<p><strong>Model: Challenger SXT, Challenger SXT Plus, Challenger GT</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 3.6-liter V-6 – eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 305 hp/268 lb-ft of torque</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: Challenger R/T, Challenger R/T Plus, Challenger T/A, Challenger T/A Plus, Challenger R/T Shaker, Challenger R/T Plus Shaker</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 5.7-liter V-8 – six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 372 hp/400 lb-ft (automatic); 375 hp/410 lb-ft (manual)</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: Challenger R/T Scat Pack, Challenger T/A 392, Challenger SRT 392, Challenger 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: 6.4-liter V-8 – six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 485 hp/475 lb-ft</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: Challenger SRT Hellcat</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 – six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic<br>
Power : 707 hp/650 lb-ft</br></br></p>

<p><strong>Model: Challenger SRT Demon</strong><br>
Engine and Transmission: supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 – eight-speed automatic<br>
Power: 808 hp/717 lb-ft (91-octane gas), 840 hp/770 lb-ft (100-plus high-octane race fuel)</br></br></p>

<p>Equipped with only a driver’s seat, the new SRT Demon is built for the dragstrip. Even so, the front passenger and rear seats can be purchased for $1 each. The Demon’s wheels are 18 by 11 inches with Demon-branded 315-40R18 Nitto street-legal drag radials (on all four corners) with NTO 5R compound. Owners can order a personalized Demon crate with the buyer’s name, VIN, and serial number. The crate can fit in the trunk and contains narrow front runner aluminum drag wheels for track use, tools, jacks, and performance parts like the powertrain control module that allows the engine to operate on high-octane race fuel. It’s the first factory production car with Drag mode suspension tuning, a Drag mode assist that helps prevent wheel hop, and the largest functional hood scoop on a production car at 42.5 square inches. On a prepared drag strip surface, Dodge claims the 2018 Challenger SRT Demon can hit 60 mph in 2.1 seconds, a 100 mph 5.1, and reaches the quarter mile in 9.65 seconds at 140 mph (making it illegal to race on a track without a roll cage, not offered by Dodge).</p>

<p>As the Challenger SRT Demon takes its place at the top of the Dodge performance lineup, the Challenger lineup should continue to offer plenty of other packages and options when you’re considering a car with <em>under</em> 800 hp. On the 2017 model, the Blacktop package consists of 20-inch Gloss Black aluminum wheels, black grille with a Blacktop badge, dual Blacktop stripes along the top of the coupe from hood to trunk, a performance steering wheel, and Gloss Black interior accents. The R/T Classic package features 20-inch Hyper Black aluminum wheels, Nappa leather-trimmed sport seats with suede inserts, HID headlights, and Challenger script badge with dual black or red side stripes. Expect to see interior features like the latest edition of Dodge’s Uconnect infotainment system in addition to available features like the Harman Kardon premium audio system, remote start, and heated/ventilated front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>Opt for the Technology Group that will likely return and your Challenger will come equipped with Automatic High Beam Headlamp Control, Rain Sensitive Windshield Wiper system, Adaptive Speed Control (not available with manual transmission), and Forward Collision Warning. Blind Spot Monitoring and the rearview camera are additional safety features.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/2015/2015-dodge-challenger-srt-hellcat-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat, we loved the whine from the engine bay and said, “The supercharger whine can double as an air raid siren.” The Hellcat is a burnout machine: “Honestly, if big smoky burnouts are your top car-buying priority, stop researching. The Hellcat creates stinky, juvenile white clouds better than any other new car.”</p>

<p>Handling is on the poor side, but that is not what the Hellcat is built for. When you boil everything down, the Hellcat is a straight-line monster: “Get some fatter, stickier rear meats for the Challenger Hellcat and it really does have the intestinal fortitude to embarrass cars costing double and triple the price.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/2017/2017-dodge-challenger-gt-awd-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the six-cylinder-powered all-wheel-drive 2017 Challenger GT, we said that “the Challenger GT had no issues accelerating or braking in the snow, but we noticed it felt particularly slow in passing maneuvers on a wet two-lane highway. It made us wish we had the all-wheel-drive option with the more powerful Hemi V-8 engines.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Challenger SRT Demon has an Eco mode that limits the horsepower output to 500, starts the coupe in second gear, and will short-shift the remaining gears for maximum fuel economy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/journey/2018/">2018 Dodge Journey</a> lineup has been reduced to four trims and gets three-row seating as standard on all models. Crossroad models get black 19-inch alloy wheels as standard and the Blacktop package’s availability has been expanded to the SE trim, in addition to the SXT and GT.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/journey/2018/">Dodge Journey</a> is as compact three-row crossover with seating for up to seven passengers and slots below the larger Durango. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional on models equipped with the available V-6 engine.</p>

<p>Journey SE: The base SE trim comes with 17-inch steel wheels, cloth upholstery, a 4.3-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, a USB port, a six-speaker audio system, and keyless entry/start.</p>

<p>Journey SXT: Building on the SE trim, the Journey SXT adds fog lights, body-colored side mirror covers, and 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>Notable options include navigation, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, remote start, a second-row entertainment system, and the Blacktop package, which adds cosmetic tweaks such as a gloss black grille, headlight bezels, roof rails, and on certain trims, gloss black 19-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>The base engine in the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/">Dodge</a> Journey is a 2.4-liter I-4 rated at 173 hp and 166 lb-ft of torque paired to a four-speed automatic transmission. A 3.6-liter V-6 with 283 hp and 260 lb-ft coupled to a six-speed automatic is optional. EPA fuel economy ratings are 19/25 mpg city/highway for four-cylinder models, 17/25 mpg for front-drive models with the V-6 and 16/24 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Dodge Journey a four-star rating for the front crash and rollover tests (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 Journey but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the headlights and driver’s side front small overlap test, where it received a Poor score (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>Cargo space is acceptable at 10.7 cubic feet behind the third row, 37 cubic feet behind the second row, and 67.6 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the 2018 Journey can tow 1,000 pounds with the base four-cylinder or up to 2,500 pounds with the optional V-6.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/journey/2017/2017-dodge-journey-gt-awd-blacktop-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that even with the optional 3.6-liter V-6, the Journey is slower than expect due to its 4,405-pound curb weight. Ride comfort isn’t very good—when you go over potholes, the car gets easily unsettled. The rear suspension is also prone to shuddering even at moderate speeds on smooth roads. There’s also excessive powertrain jerkiness due to the six-speed automatic not shifting very smoothly. Second-row seating in the Journey is tight and the third row is best left folded since it is extremely cramped. The version of FCA’s UConnect interface in the Journey is also dated and not as responsive as units found in newer FCA vehicles but thankfully it’s sharp and user-friendly. The Journey also features plenty of small storage cubbies including a space under the front passenger seat. Unlike other three-row crossovers, the Journey costs under $25,000 making it one of the least expensive vehicles that offers seating for up to seven.</p>

<p>The optional 3.6-liter V-6 is shared with a number of FCA vehicles including the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/cherokee/2018/">Jeep Cherokee</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2018/">Chrysler Pacifica</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Fiat reconfigures the Lusso and Abarth model’s packaging for more flexibility, adds a new Red Top Edition to the Lusso model, and offers Puro Bianco Perla (Tri-Coat White Pearl), Grigio Chiero (Silver Metallic), and Blu Scuro (Dark Blue Metallic) exterior colors.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The 124 Spider is Fiat’s only non-hatchback and rear-wheel drive model. With the exception of the 500e EV, the Fiat 124 Spider has the highest starting price of any Fiat.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Fiat 124 Spider is powered by a 1.4-liter turbocharged I-4 that produces 160 hp (164 for the Abarth model) and 184 lb-ft of torque, and delivers an EPA-rated 25/36 mpg city/highway with the six-speed automatic or 26/35 mpg with the six-speed manual transmission. Power is routed to the rear wheels of this two-seater. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 124 Spider hit 60 mph in 6.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 108 feet. The 124 Spider is based on the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/miata/2018/">Mazda Miata</a>.</p>

<p>The base 124 Spider Classica model comes standard with independent front and rear suspension, electronic locking differential, 16-inch alloy wheels, dual stainless steel exhaust tips, two USB ports, a black soft top, and leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The Lusso model adds 17-inch premium wheels, fog lights with automatic headlights, dual chrome exhaust tips, a 7.0-inch touchscreen display and command dial, automatic temperature control, heated leather-trimmed front seats, and a rearview camera. The range-topping Abarth model adds a sport mode selector, a mechanical limited slip differential, Bilstein front and rear performance suspension with strut tower bar, 17-inch gunmetal wheels, a unique body-color sport fascia, a sport-tuned quad-tipped chrome exhaust, heated leatherette and microfiber performance seats with red accent stitching, a perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum accent sport pedals, and mirror caps, roll bar cover, and windshield surround in a Gunmetal finish. For more features, order the Luxury Collection with Sirius that consists of a nine-speaker Bose audio system, sport leather seats, auto-dimming and heated exterior mirrors, automatic headlight leveling system, Fiat Connect with navigation, headlight washers, LED headlights, and SiriusXM satellite radio.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Fiat 124 Spider offers some driver assist safety features including blind-spot monitoring, Rear-Cross Path Detection, and Rear Park Assist (rear parking sensors), in addition to adaptive front headlights (they turn as you steer).</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/124-spider/2017/chevrolet-camaro-1le-bmw-m2-ford-focus-rs-fiat-124-spider-abarth-porsche-718-boxster-s-toyota-86/">six-way sports car comparison</a>, the 2017 Fiat Spider Abarth topped the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m2/2018/">BMW M2</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro/2018/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> (V-6), <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/focus/2018/">Ford Focus</a> RS, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/718-boxster/2018/">Porsche 718 Boxster</a> S, and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/86/2018/">Toyota 86</a> because it was the most fun car to drive in the group. We said, “In this group, the Fiat 124 Abarth had the least powerful engine, but it was also the king of back-road perma-grin. The top-down motoring is enjoyable, but the Fiat is also willing to give it all. To wit: In its driver’s seat, I followed the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> M2, being pushed to its absolute limit by back-road demon Scott Evans (the guy who hated the Fiat.)”</p>

<p>“Not once in 30 miles of tight, twisty road could he, in the 365-hp M2, pull away from me in the 164-hp Fiat. This isn’t because Evans isn’t a fast driver (he is), because the BMW isn’t quicker (it is), or because it doesn’t handle better (it does.) The Fiat kept up with a much more capable car because it earns its driver’s trust. That meant I could turn off its overly intrusive stability control and throw it into every corner without fear.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/124-spider/2017/2017-fiat-124-spider-abarth-first-test-review/">First Test</a> of all three Fiat 124 Spiders, we concluded, “Among the three Fiats, it’s no surprise to learn that the Lusso is by far the most comfortable; its cushier seat even makes it seem like it rides smoother than the Classica despite its 17-inch wheels. It also seems more posh and comfy than any available trim level of MX-5. Clearly, if you’re looking for a boulevardier roadster, this is your choice. The Classica on 16s feels like it subdivides the other two—not quite as sharp as the Abarth or as pillowy as the Lusso. As such, for many it may be the Goldilocks choice and the one that seems to most closely match the Miata’s demeanor. Choose this one if you really just prefer the Fiat’s styling. Folks planning to track their roadster will be best served by the harder-edged Abarth, especially if they’re willing to aggressively shop the Abarth/Mopar go-fast catalogue. Any turbo engine can be tweaked to produce more power, so those who’ve longed for a Mazdaspeed Miata can make their wishes come true in the Fiat aftermarket.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 124 Spider uses the same 1.4-liter turbocharged I-4 found in the 500 Abarth but produces a little more power thanks to the 22 psi boost rating versus the 500 Abarth’s 18 psi rating.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Fiat updates the 500L’s exterior with a new front and rear fascia, new exterior side moldings, new wheel designs, and new daytime running light lens and rear side reflector designs. Inside, the 500L gets a new instrument cluster display, a redesigned center console with relocated cup holders, a new gear shifter, parking brake handle, an additional USB port, LED interior lighting, and a new steering wheel. New standard equipment includes a rearview camera and the Uconnect 4 system with a 7.0-inch center display screen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. Blue Denim, Arancio Pastello (Pastel Orange), and Bronzo Metallizzato (Metallic Bronze) are new exterior colors.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The 500L is Fiat’s largest and most expensive hatchback (besides the pricier 500e), positioned above the 500 and 500X models.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Fiat 500L comes equipped with one powertrain option, a 160-hp, 184-lb-ft of torque 1.4-liter turbocharged I-4 engine backed by a six-speed automatic transmission that routes power to the front wheels and delivers an EPA-rated 22/30 mpg city/highway. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 500L Trekking hit 60 mph in 8.6 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 121 feet.</p>

<p>The base 500L Pop comes standard with 16-inch aluminum wheels, a bright exhaust tip, heated and powered side view mirrors, front and rear one-touch automatic windows, leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear shift knob, and the previously mentioned Uconnect 4 system with a 7.0-inch center display and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The top Lounge model adds dual-zone automatic temperature control, 17-inch painted aluminum wheels, chrome exterior mirrors, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, Uconnect 4 with navigation, and a Beats premium audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>In IIHS testing, the 2017 Fiat 500L received the lowest rating of Poor for the small overlap front crash evaluation but received the highest rating of Good in the remaining four crash tests (moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and head restraints and seats). The front crash prevention evaluation was not conducted because the Fiat 500L does not have emergency automatic braking or any driver assist safety feature. The 500L comes standard with the previously mentioned rearview camera and is available with rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>“Out on the open road, this little engine struggles a bit to hustle the biggest 500 up to speed. For around-town driving, it is just fine, but I am concerned about how it would perform on mountain vacations with the whole family onboard and a cargo compartment filled with weekend gear,” we said in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/500l/2017/2017-fiat-500l-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Fiat 500L. “The combined result is that the 2017 Fiat 500L doesn’t feel like a very sporty car deep down, which may explain why there’s no Abarth variant offered and why Fiat has never done one of those “<a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2017-fiat-124-spider-stars-new-blue-pill-commercial/">little blue pill</a>” Viagra-gag commercial featuring the 500L. No, if you’re into cheeky, boutiquey small four-doors and you need a bit more sport, the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mini/clubman/2016/2016-mini-clubman-first-drive-review/">Mini Clubman</a> might be a better choice,” we concluded.</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-contenders-and-finalists/">2014 Car of the Year testing</a> we said, “The 500L weebled and wobbled but didn’t fall down as editors pushed it through the ride and handling course. ‘Drives like it looks — top-heavy, wallowing at times, but also surprisingly stable at higher speeds.’” The judges didn’t care for the interior, “The emergency brake hides under the driver’s armrest, and the gearshift knob on the manual model is the size of a baseball. The second row folds forward and up to create a useless storage space. The upright driving position and the lack of bolstering make it easy for the driver to slide around the seat.” However, the judges agreed that the 500L is driver-friendly, ergonomically sound, and is relatively quiet with a nice ride. “Attempting to sell the 500L here on its practical merits is a waste of energy, just as it would be trying to sell <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/">Ram</a> pickups to Europeans.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>When the 500L was first launched, the hatchback utilized a six-speed manual transmission and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic, now it is just offered with a traditional six-speed automatic.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The 500 Pop and Lounge trims receive a new and more powerful standard turbocharged engine, an upgraded braking system, sport-tuned suspension, a rearview camera, and a spoiler.</p>

<p>The two-door 500 is offered as a hatchback and convertible, and is Fiat’s most affordable model. Above the 500 in Fiat’s lineup is the 124 Spider, the 500L, and the 500X.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiat 500 Pop</strong>: The base Pop comes standard with 16-inch semi-gloss alloy wheels, heated and power side view mirrors, a 5.0-inch touchscreen with a six-speaker Alpine audio system and Bluetooth, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, fog lights, adjustable front cloth seats, spoiler (hatchback model) a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a rearview camera (cabrio model also gets rear sensors), and a black cabrio top (cabrio model only).</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiat 500 Lounge</strong>: The Lounge model adds 16-inch Tech Silver wheels, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, chrome mirror caps, automatic climate control, SiriusXM satellite radio, a fixed glass roof (for hatchback model), and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiat 500 Abarth</strong>: The higher-performance and top Abarth model comes equipped with a more powerful 1.4-liter turbo-four, 16-inch Hyper Black alloy wheels, a higher-performance braking system with red brake calipers, dual chrome exhaust tips, performance-tuned suspension for the hatchback model and high-performance tuned suspension for the cabrio, a black performance top (for the cabrio model), a spoiler, a three-mode electronic stability control system, performance high-back cloth seats with seat-belt pass-through, a turbo boost gauge, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and a perforated leather-wrapped, a leather-wrapped instrument panel, flat-bottom Abarth steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiat 500e</strong>: The 500e is powered by an all-electric powertrain and comes standard with 15-inch wheels, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, a 5.0-inch infotainment screen with a navigation system and SiriusXM satellite radio, rear parking sensors, an audible pedestrian warning system, automatic climate control, heated front seats, and heated side view mirrors.</p>

<p>The highly customizable Fiat 500 is available in 15 exterior colors, and the dashboard is the same color as the exterior paint. If you want a more exciting cabrio top color than black, the non-Abarth models also offer Bordeaux and beige, soft tops and the Abarth has an optional gray top. The Abarth’s and Pop’s mirror caps and roof can be finished in black, red, white, or gray (Abarth only). The Abarth’s wheels can be upgraded to 17-inch Hyper Black forged wheels or 17-inch Bronze forged wheels.</p>

<p>The Pop and Lounge’s new standard engine is 1.4-liter turbo-four that produces 135 hp and 150 lb-ft of torque and is backed by a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. The Abarth’s 1.4-liter turbo-four makes 160 hp and 170 lb-ft with the five-speed manual and 157 hp and 183 lb-ft with the six-speed automatic. All 500 models are front-wheel drive. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2012 500 Abarth with the five-speed manual (same power output as the 2018 model) hit 60 mph in 6.8 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 117 feet.</p>

<p>The 2017 Fiat 500 received a four-star overall rating out of five stars from the NHTSA. In IIHS testing, the 2017 Fiat 500 received the lowest rating of Poor in the small overlap front driver side crash test and the highest rating of Good in all other crash tests. Front crash prevention was not tested because the 500 does not offer an automatic emergency braking or a collision warning system. A rearview camera and a tire pressure monitoring system are standard on all trims. Rear parking sensors are standard on the Pop cabrio model and up.</p>

<p>The Fiat 500 hatchback offers up to 9.5 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats but the cabrio offers less, at 5.4 cubic feet. If you fold down the seats of the hatchback, the 500 can hold up to 30.1 cubic feet. Front seat passengers receive up to 40.7 inches of legroom and rear seat passengers have 31.7 inches.</p>

<p>The 500’s standard multimedia system features a 5.0-inch touchscreen with a six-speaker Alpine audio system and Bluetooth. A navigation system, SiriusXM satellite radio, and a Beats Audio system are optional.</p>

<p>After one year with our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/500/2012/2012-fiat-500-sport-verdict/">long-term 2012 Fiat 500</a>, we didn’t like the lack of power and wish the 500 was more stable under hard braking but the fuel economy was great. The small size is great for tight maneuvering into small spaces and the “cuteness is undeniable, inside and out, and it earned many a thumbs-up from strangers,” we said. “I love the simple, retro/modern dash design, a nice expression of the Fiat’s Italian genes, and the shiny dash panel matches the exterior paint and doesn’t show fingerprints or smudges.”</p>

<p>We didn’t care for the high seating position and small sun visors but the Fiat was reliable the entire year we had it. The Fiat 500 is just not very practical for most, “The Fiat’s size makes it an ideal city car, but not so great for road trips involving more than one adult passenger, and forget about lugging a lot of luggage,” we said. “So anytime I needed to drive them somewhere more than two hours away, I signed into another car.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/500/2012/mini-cooper-vs-scion-tc-vs-honda-crz-vs-volkswagen-beetle-vs-hyundai-veloster-vs-fiat-500-comparison/">six-way comparison</a> of small cars, the liked the cute looks and charm of the 2012 Fiat 500 but the small hatchback placed fifth. “With its little-bitty trunk and vestigial rear seats, the Fiat isn’t practical by any stretch,” we said. “The Fiat’s other failing was in the drive. A short wheelbase combined with a narrow footprint and a sport-tuned suspension conspire to give the car a bouncy ride that keeps your head tossing constantly on the freeway. Unfortunately, that didn’t translate into fun in the hills, either. While the 500 is incredibly nimble, it tends to bounce around over bumps and is quick to understeer when pressed,” we added. “Exacerbating everything was the driving position, which felt like driving from a bar stool.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>All Fiat 500X model receive the Uconnect 4 system which includes a 7.0-inch center display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The 500L slots above the smaller 500 model but below the larger and more expensive 500L. The 124 Spider sports car (Fiat’s only non-hatchback) and 500e EV also have higher starting prices.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base 500X Pop model comes powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged 1.4-liter engine produces that 160 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque and is backed by a six-speed manual transmission that powers that front wheels (2017 EPA-rating of 25/33 mpg city/highway). Available on the Pop (but standard with AWD), but standard on the Trekking and Lounge models is a 180-hp, 175 lb-ft of torque 2.4-liter I-4 engine paired to a nine-speed automatic that delivers 22/30 mpg with front-wheel drive and 21/29 mpg with AWD (2017 figures).  In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2016 Fiat 500X Pop Trekking AWD hit 60 mph in an expected 8.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a short 116 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Fiat 500X comes standard with the previously mentioned Uconnect 4 system with smartphone compatibility and a 7.0-inc display, heated side-view mirrors, a 3.5-inch driver’s display screen, a USB port, electric parking brake, 16-inch steel wheels with covers, chrome exhaust tip, and a body-color rear spoiler. If you opt for the top Lounge model, add Uconnect with navigation, heated front seats and steering wheel, an eight-way power driver seat, dual-zone climate control, a traction control system with three modes (Auto, Sport, and Traction+), interior ambient lighting, auto-dimming rearview mirror, an eight-speaker premium audio system, and 17-inch aluminum wheels. For additional features, order the Lounge Premium package that consists of 18-inch wheels, Beats premium audio system, and a dual-pane power moonroof.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2017 Fiat 500X is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick by the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all five crash test evaluations and the second highest rating of Advanced for the front crash prevention evaluation because the crossover managed to properly warn the driver of a possible collision, avoided a 12 mph collision, and reduced the speed of a 25 mph collision by 5 mph thanks to the Full Speed Forward Collision Warning with Active Braking driver assist safety feature found in the optional Advanced Safety package. The lowest rating of Poor for the headlights kept it out of the Top Safety Pick+ designation. The Advanced Safety package also contains automatic high beams, Blind Spot Monitoring with Rear Cross-Path Detection, Lane Departure Warning Plus, ParkSense Rear Park Assist system, and rain sensitive windshield wipers.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/500x/2016/2016-fiat-500x-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the 2016 Fiat 500X, we did not care for the slow acceleration and ride comfort, “Press on the gas pedal and you can count the few long seconds it takes to get up to a reasonable speed. Expect quite a bit of growl during the drive, as well as a bouncy ride with little protection from potholes and other road imperfections. It’s also easy to tell when the nine-speed is at work…” We like the available AWD with different traction modes and the tight steering. We also enjoyed some of the interior quirkiness, “Colorful, shiny plastics cover the dashboard, complemented by circular controls and either a 3.0-inch, 4.0-inch, or 6.5-inch Uconnect screen depending on the model. Oversize door handles, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and clever storage cubbies complete the cabin. The two-tone seats are stylish and comfortable enough for long drives.” We concluded by saying that “although it doesn’t feel spacious, the 500X offers a different formula for practicality.”</p>

<p>“The 500X targets other models with funky exterior designs, such as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Juke and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">Chevrolet Trax</a>, but adds more personality and a more cohesive exterior and interior design; everything about the small crossover was done with intention,” we said in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/fiat/500x/2016/2016-fiat-500x-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Fiat 500X AWD Trekking. We felt the acceleration was just decent with the 2.4-liter and the nine-speed transmission shifted roughly at highway speeds with slow to respond paddle shifters. The manual transmission Pop model was easy to drive with a light clutch pedal. “The 500X has a competitive edge in many aspects and clings to the persona of Fiat, but it also has its drawbacks. Regardless, for those shopping in the small CUV segment, the Fiat 500X is definitely worth at least a test drive,” we concluded.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 1.6-liter turbocharged I-4 gets good fuel economy at 25/33 mpg city/highway but with recommended premium 91 octane fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/taurus/2018/">Ford Taurus</a> did not receive any significant updates for the new model year, all model features carry over. The 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine has been dropped from the lineup.</p>

<p>The Taurus is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>’s flagship sedan, positioned above the subcompact Fiesta, the compact Focus, and the midsize Fusion in size and price.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Taurus SE</strong>: The base Taurus comes equipped with 18-inch Sparkle Silver aluminum wheels, a sport mode, rear seat vents, Ice Blue instrumentation lighting, SYNC infotainment system with a 4.2-inch center display screen, six-way power driver’s seat, dual-chrome exhaust tips, keyless entry keypad, illuminated entry, and an SOS Post-Crash Alert system.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Taurus SEL</strong>: The better-equipped SEL adds dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, integrated remote start system, unique cloth seating upholstery, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Taurus Limited</strong>: The Limited trim comes well-equipped with 19-inch Luster Nickel Painted aluminum wheels, interior ambient lighting, branded front floor mats, power-adjustable pedals, power rear window sunshade, wood and leather-trimmed steering wheel with power tilt and telescope, a heated steering wheel, a Sony audio system, an 8.0-inch touchscreen with SYNC 3 and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 10-way power heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, perforated leather-trimmed seats, automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist, and auto-dimming side view mirrors.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Taurus SHO</strong>: The range-topping and higher-performance Taurus comes standard with the 3.5-liter Ecoboost engine, all-wheel drive, sport-tuned suspension, paddle shifters, 20-inch Ebony Black-painted machined aluminum wheels, aluminum pedals, SHO interior trim, perforated leather-trimmed seats with SHO graphics, dual exhaust system with chrome exhaust tips, HID headlights, SHO side view mirrors, and SHO grille with fender and rear badging.</p>

<p>The optional SHO Performance package includes performance brake pads, sport-calibrated electric power steering, stiffer springs and stabilizer bars, Track Mode/True Off electronic stability modes, performance summer tires, larger front and rear brake rotors, and an Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/taurus/2018/">2018 Ford Taurus</a> is powered by a standard 288-hp, 254-lb-ft of torque 3.5-liter V-6 that delivers an EPA-rated 17/24 mpg city/highway with all-wheel drive and 18/27 when equipped with front-wheel drive. The top SHO comes standard with AWD and utilizes a 365-hp, 350-lb-ft of torque 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 that comes rated at 16/24 mpg. All powertrains are backed by a six-speed automatic transmission. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2013 Ford Taurus Limited AWD (with the same 3.5-liter V-6 that’s standard today) hit 60 mph in a decent 7.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 120 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford Taurus earned a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (five stars is the highest possible rating). In IIHS testing, the Taurus received the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the small overlap front crash test and received the highest rating of Good in the remaining four crash test evaluations. The lowest score of Basic was given for the front crash prevention evaluation because the Taurus properly warned the driver of a possible collision but did not brake for the driver (the sedan does not offer an automatic emergency braking feature). The Collision Warning with Brake Support feature is found in the Driver Assist package that also includes adaptive cruise control, Lane Keep Assist, Lane Departure Warning, and Active Park Assist (self-parking feature). Other safety features include automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring with Cross-traffic Alert (standard on Limited SHO), rear parking sensors, and an SOS post-crash alert system.</p>

<p>The Ford Taurus’ trunk offers lots of room, measuring in at 20.1 cubic feet of cargo room, more than the redesigned <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord/2018/">2018 Honda Accord</a>’s 16.7 cubic feet. The Taurus offers 44.2 inches of front legroom and 38.1 inches of rear legroom, about even with the Accord’s 42.3 and 40.4 inches, respectively.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford Taurus standard SYNC infotainment is displayed on a 4.2-inch center display and comes with a single CD player and MP3 capability, a 4.2-inch driver’s instrument panel display screen, and an SOS Post-Crash Alert system. The optional SYNC 3 system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen includes Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, AppLink, 911 Assist, and two <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/smart/">smart</a>-charging USB ports. The optional voice-activated navigation system features SiriusXM and Travel Link. For enhanced audio, opt for the available 12-speaker Sony audio system that features Clear Phase and Live Acoustic technologies.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/taurus/2013/2013-ford-taurus-sel-v-6-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2013 Ford Taurus SEL, we liked the improved interior materials, less cluttered center stack, and were surprised by the heavy sedan’s cornering ability, “The 255mm Michelins cling and coexist nicely with the abundant body roll.”</p>

<p>We were also pleased with the acceleration of the sedan with the 288-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. We concluded by saying, “First, we’d request the Limited model’s 10-way power seats. The SEL has a power switch to adjust the seat base position and height, but altering the seat back recline angle and lumbar support means fiddling with stiff plastic controls. The entire process seems disjointed. Second, on the driving controls area, we’d request the gas pedal be less touchy. Third, lower the step-in heights for the front and back rows.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/taurus/2013/the-big-test-2013-2014-full-size-sedans/">five-way full-size sedan comparison in 2013</a>, the Ford Taurus came in last place. Although we liked the price point on the sedan, “the Taurus needs more than a refresh to compete in this segment. If you’re on a budget, shop for something in the midsize category.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/transit/2018/">2018 Ford Transit</a> Connect is unchanged.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/transit/2018/">Ford Transit</a> Connect is a compact commercial van that’s available as a cargo vehicle or a passenger van with seating for up to seven passengers. The Transit Connect slots below the larger Transit.</p>

<p><strong>Transit Connect XL:</strong> The base Transit Connect XL comes with vinyl upholstery, 16-inch steel wheels with covers, 180-degree swing out rear cargo doors, sliding side doors, cruise control, keyless entry, and a radio. Passenger van models add a rearview camera, a 4.2-inch screen, a USB port, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>’s Sync infotainment system.</p>

<p><strong>Transit Connect XLT:</strong> Moving up to the XLT trim adds cornering fog lights, a fold flat front passenger seat, a 4.2-inch screen, automatic headlights, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Transit Connect Titanium:</strong> Available only on the passenger variant, the Transit Connect Titanium comes with 16-inch alloy wheels, Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system with a 6.5-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, leather upholstery, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, and navigation.</p>

<p>Notable options include a panoramic glass roof, aircraft-style overhead storage bins, 17-inch alloy wheels, remote start, and front parking sensors.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/transit-connect/2018/">2018 Ford Transit Connect</a> is available only with a 2.5-liter I-4 rated at 169 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque paired exclusively with a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 20/27 mpg city/highway for the cargo van and 19/27 mpg for the passenger variant.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/transit-connect/2018/">Ford Transit Connect</a> received a five-star overall rating for the passenger van model called the Wagon and a four-star front crash and five-star side impact rating for the cargo variant (out of a possible five stars). Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are available only on the XLT trims for both the cargo van and passenger model.</p>

<p>Cargo vans have a maximum capacity of 124.3 cubic feet in short-wheelbase form and 149 cubic feet in long-wheelbase guise. Short wheelbase passenger vans have 46.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the split-folding rear seats and 77.1 cubic feet behind the front seats. Opt for the long-wheelbase passenger van and you’ll have 15.7 cubic feet behind the third row, 58.9 cubic feet behind the second row, and 104.2 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the Transit Connect can haul up to 2,000 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/transit-connect/2014/2014-ford-transit-connect-titanium-wagon-lwb-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>, we said that the Transit Connect handles well despite being tall and feels light on its feet similar to a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/focus/2018/">Ford Focus</a>. The van’s steering is well-weighted, making it fun to toss into a corner. The 2.5-liter I-4, however, doesn’t have much torque available at higher revs and tends to run out of steam pretty quickly. Interior space is generous with comfortable seating for all rows. The build quality in the Titanium is good, though no one will think of the cabin ; as luxurious.</p>

<p>The Ford Transit Connect is closely related to the Focus and C-Max.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/expedition/2018/">2018 Ford Expedition</a> has been redesigned and now uses the same aluminum-intensive architecture as the current generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2018/">Ford F-150</a>. As a result, the new Expedition is around 300 pounds lighter than its predecessor. Additionally, it also features more multimedia and safety technologies than the model it replaces.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/expedition/2018/">Ford Expedition</a> is a full-size SUV that slots above the three-row, car-based Explorer. Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional. In addition to the standard Expedition, a long wheelbase variant called the Expedition Max replaces the EL model.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>An updated EcoBoost 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 with more power and torque will power the 2018 Expedition and the six-speed automatic has been replaced by a new 10-speed unit that first saw duty in the F-150 Raptor. Expect the 2018 Expedition to be able to tow more payload and have a larger cargo capacity than the SUV it replaces.</p>

<p>Available features include leather upholstery, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>’s Sync 3 infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a wifi hot spot, a rear seat entertainment system, a 12-speaker B&amp;O Play sound system, a panoramic sunroof, and a new advanced cargo manager that features a shelf that lets owners customize the space behind the third row.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Expedition. Active safety features and driver aids such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and lane keeping assist are available.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We haven’t driven the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/expedition/2018/2018-ford-expedition-first-look-review/">2018 Expedition</a> yet but we expect it to be quicker and more capable than the model it replaces. Since it’s lighter, the new Expedition might also be more efficient and handle better. Platinum models will be more luxurious with chrome accents, 22-inch polished alloy wheels, and quilted leather upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Ford Expedition is the third vehicle to use an aluminum-intensive architecture, following the Ford F-150 and Super Duty trucks.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/11-significant-changes-refreshed-2018-ford-mustang/">2018 Ford Mustang gets its first major makeover</a> since the all-new car was introduced for 2015. Up front, the 2018 Mustang gets a more aggressive front clip including standard LED headlights and available LED foglights, and a lower hood with new vents. Around back, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> has also revised the LED taillights and rear fascia, and added quad exhaust tips for the GT. The 2018 Mustang also gains new paint colors, four spoilers, new stripe options, more wheel choices, and more.</p>

<p>Inside, the 2018 Mustang gains a new customizable 12.o-inch digital instrument cluster with Track Apps, a heated leather steering wheel, and revived interior trim.</p>

<p>Ford also made drivetrain revisions. The V-6 engine is no longer available, while both the 2.3-liter EcoBoost I-4 and 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 have been revised for more power and better fuel mileage. The six-speed manual has been updated for both engines, and V-8 models gain a twin-disc clutch and dual-mass flywheel for better torque capability. The previously available six-speed automatic has been replaced by an <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/leaked-document-2018-ford-mustang-to-add-10-speed-automatic/">all-new 10-speed automatic</a>.</p>

<p>Other performance upgrades include revised monotube shocks, V-8 exhaust manifold and optional active exhaust system. Additionally, the revised Performance Packs will be available on all trims and engines. The Performance Pack now includes MagneRide dampers, a new Michelin performance tire, Brembo brakes, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang/2018/">Ford Mustang</a> coupe <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang/2018/2018-ford-mustang-convertible-first-look/">and convertible</a> is the automaker’s legendary front-engine rear-drive sports car that slots below the much more expensive mid-engine rear-drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/gt/2018/">Ford GT</a> supercar and above the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/focus/2018/">Ford Focus</a> RS hatchback.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>For 2018, the Ford Mustang is available with turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost I-4 in the base model or a port- and direct injected 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 in the Mustang GT. Performance Packs are available with either engine and both standard and Premium trim levels. Cloth seats are standard, and leather is optional. The Ford Mustang is offered in a wide variety of exterior paint colors and available stripes, interior colors and trim choices as well as wheels and spoilers.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Although the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang/2018/">2018 Ford Mustang</a> hasn’t been crashed tested yet, we expect the coupe and convertible to retain similar NHTSA safety ratings as the 2017 model. The 2017 Ford Mustang has a five-star overall NHTSA safety rating (out of a possible five stars). Both Mustang body styles earned a Good rating from the IIHS in the moderate overlap front, side, and head restraints &amp; seats tests, while the coupe earned a Good in the roof strength and an Acceptable rating in the small overlap front tests. The 2017 Ford Mustang also earned a Basic rating for its optional Forward Collision Warning.</p>

<p>New active safety tech for the 2018 model year included distance alert, lane departure warning, pedestrian detection, and Pre-Collision Assist system that adds automatic emergency barking to the forward collision warning system.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think </strong></p>

<p>Although we are excited to test the updated drivetrains, in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang/2018/2018-ford-mustang-first-look-first-refresh-since-ponycar-went-global/">2018 Ford Mustang First Look</a>, we’re already looking ahead to the higher-performance variants: “Come on, Ford. Time to spill on the GT500.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In addition to port- and (new) direct-injection, the 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 features the same wire arc spray-bore cylinder lining process used on the GT350/R coupe’s 5.2-liter Voodoo V-8 in place of the heavy iron cylinder liners.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The 1.0-liter turbocharged I-3 engine has been dropped and a rearview camera is now standard on all models. All other features carry over. If the Fiesta returns to the U.S. market for another generation, we can expect the subcompact to be similar to the redesigned <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fiesta/2018/2018-ford-fiesta-european-spec-review/">European model that we reviewed</a>.</p>

<p>The subcompact <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fiesta/2018/">Ford Fiesta</a> sedan and hatchback are the automaker’s smallest vehicles and sit below the compact Focus sedan and hatch, and the midsize Fusion and full-size Taurus sedans.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiesta S</strong>: The base S trim comes equipped with a six-speaker radio with an auxiliary input jack, a rearview camera, hill-start assist, halogen headlights, six-way manual driver’s seat, Sync infotainment system, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and a tire pressure monitoring system.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiesta SE</strong>: The SE trim adds interior ambient lighting, cruise control, power windows with driver one-touch up and down, 15-inch aluminum wheels, keyless entry, upgraded front cloth seats, and a shift knob with a chrome insert (on automatic-transmission models).</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiesta Titanium</strong>: Building off the SE’s features, the Titanium adds 16-inch aluminum  wheels, power and heated side view mirrors, fog lights, Sync 3 with SiriusXM satellite radio and two USB ports, a 6.5-inch touchscreen center display, a Sony audio system with HD Radio, leather-trimmed and heated front seats, automatic climate control, auto-dimming rearview mirror, push-button start, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fiesta ST</strong>: The performance-oriented ST adds a turbocharged 1.6-liter I-4 engine, a six-speed manual transmission, sport suspension, 17-inch Rado Gray aluminum wheels, performance summer tires and brakes, twin chrome-tipped exhaust, ST fog lights, a mesh grille insert, unique body-color rocker panels, unique high-mounted rear spoiler, aluminum pedals, and ST badging.</p>

<p>The Fiesta ST can be optioned with red brake calipers and the ST Recaro package that includes Recaro partial leather-trimmed seats (six-way manual adjustable), heated front seats, and heated side view mirrors.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fiesta/2018/">2018 Ford Fiesta</a> is powered by a 1.6-liter I-4 that produces 120 hp and 112 lb-ft of torque in all models except the ST. The 1.6-liter delivers an EPA-rated 27/35 mpg city/highway with the standard five-speed manual transmission and 27/37 mpg with the optional six-speed dual clutch automatic. The high-performance Fiesta ST model is powered by a 1.6-liter turbo-four that pumps out a healthy 197 hp and 202 lb-ft of torque, is backed by a six-speed manual, and delivers 26/33 mpg. The Fiesta is available in sedan and hatchback body styles and front-wheel drive is the only option. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2014 Fiesta ST hit 60 mph in a quick 6.4 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 104 feet.</p>

<p>In IIHS testing, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> Fiesta sedan and hatchback received the second-lowest score of Marginal for the small overlap front crash test but received the highest score of Good in four other crash tests. The front crash prevention test was not conducted because the Fiesta does not offer a collision warning or emergency automatic braking system. The 2018 Fiesta received a four-star overall safety rating out of five stars from the NHTSA. Standard safety features include a rearview camera, Ford’s Personal Safety System for front passengers with dual-stage airbags, and a tire pressure monitoring system.</p>

<p>Cargo space in the Fiesta sedan’s trunk is 12.8 cubic feet and 14.9 cubic feet for the hatchback behind the rear seats (10.1 cubic feet for the ST). That is less than the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/rio/2018/">2018 Kia Rio</a> that offers 13.7 cubic feet in the sedan and 17.4 cubic feet behind the rear seats of the hatchback. Legroom in the sedan and Rio hatchback are the same, 43.6 inches for the front and 31.2 inches for the rear passengers.</p>

<p>The 2018 Fiesta’s list of standard tech features is short, and includes a six-speaker radio with an audio input jack, a rearview camera, and the Sync infotainment system. Optional and standard on the Titanium trim is the Sync 3 system with SiriusXM satellite radio, a 6.5-inch touchscreen center display, two USB ports, and a Sony audio system with HD radio. A push-button start ignition and interior ambient lighting are also available.</p>

<p>In a 2014 Ford Fiesta SFE Ecoboost I-3 <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fiesta/2014/2014-ford-fiesta-sfe-ecoboost-first-test/">First Test review</a>, we were very impressed with the fuel economy and the torquey power band that the turbocharged three-cylinder engine provides (this engine was discontinued for the 2018 model year). However, interior vibration – especially at idle and lower rpm – might bother some people. To our surprise, the little three-cylinder is actually quicker than the 1.6-liter I-4 that’s standard on all non-ST 2018 Fiestas, and emits a unique but muffled growl.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fiesta/2014/2014-ford-fiesta-st-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2014 Ford Fiesta ST, we were impressed with the lack of torque steer and understeer from the powerful front-wheel drive car. We did notice some turbo lag but once the boost hits, the subcompact rockets away. Acceleration is quick and the short stopping distance of 104 feet from 60 mph is impressive. The front seats have plenty of room but the rear seats lack space and cargo room is limited, like many subcompacts. The Fiesta ST offers very fun handling dynamics and is quite the driver’s car: “The clutch is light but communicative, rev matching is easy, and the pedals are positioned favorably for heel-and-toe shifts. Though not completely connected to the road, steering is nicely responsive and communicative. In all,” we continued, “there’s nothing here a driver won’t enjoy.” “Having spent time in both the Focus ST and the Fiesta ST, it’s a safe bet to say that those most interested in driving are going to prefer the Fiesta by a considerable margin. It’s simply much more fun to drive.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2018/">Ford Fusion</a> does not receive any significant changes for the new model year.</p>

<p>Positioned below <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>’s largest sedan, the Taurus, the Fusion is larger and more expensive than the Fiesta and Focus sedans. The Fusion Hybrid and Energi plug-in are part of Ford’s electrified lineup that also consists of the C-Max hybrid and Focus Electric.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fusion S</strong>: The Fusion’s base S trim comes equipped with a 2.5-liter I-4 engine, 16-inch alloy wheels, six-way manual driver’s seat, a four-speaker audio system, Sync infotainment system, a 2.3-inch instrument panel driver’s display, rotary gear shift dial, automatic headlights, push start ignition, a chrome grille, LED taillights, and hill start assist.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fusion SE</strong>: In the SE trim, the 1.5- and 2.0-liter turbocharged engines are now optional, and more features are standard including 17-inch alloy wheels, 10-way power driver’s seat, six-way power passenger’s seat, a six-speaker audio system, a 4.2-inch instrument cluster driver’s display, SiriusXM satellite radio, power and heated side view mirrors, and LED daytime running lights.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fusion Titanium</strong>: The Titanium trim comes standard with the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, paddle shifters, 18-inch machined-face alloy wheels, leather upholstery, heated front Sport seats, 10-way power front seats, dual-zone climate control, a 12-speaker Sony audio system with HD radio, Sync 3 with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual 4.2-inch instrument panel driver’s display, leather-wrapped steering wheel, interior ambient lighting, rear A/C vents, remote engine start, LED fog lights, LED headlights, dual bright exhaust tips, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fusion Sport</strong>: The Sport model adds additional power with the 2.7-liter turbocharged V-6 engine and sportiness with all-wheel drive, continuously controlled damping, 19-inch wheels, heated sport seats with Dark Earth Gray Miko and leather surfaces, premium floor mats with Sport logo, aluminum sport pedals, unique high-gloss black mesh grille, quad-tip dual exhaust system, and LED headlights.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Fusion Platinum</strong>: The range-topping Fusion Platinum builds off the Titanium trim and comes well-equipped. The Fusion Platinum adds paddle shifters, 19-inch polished aluminum wheels, premium leather upholstery, premium leather-wrapped and stitched instrument panel and console rails, cooled front seats, Sync Connect, a navigation system, rain-sensing wipers, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, lane keep assist, a 110-volt power outlet, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, a self-parking system, adaptive cruise control, pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection, power moonroof, a heated steering wheel, premium grille, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p>The Fusion Hybrid comes in S, SE, Titanium, and Platinum trims and the Energi plug-in comes in SE, Titanium, and Platinum trims (neither has a Sport trim).</p>

<p>The Fusion’s base 2.5-liter engine produces 175 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque and is only available with front-wheel drive (EPA-rated 21/32 mpg city/highway). The 1.5-liter turbocharged I-4 pumps out 181 hp and 185 lb-ft and like the 2.5-liter engine, it can only be paired to a FWD system but delivers a better 23/34 mpg. The more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 makes 245 hp and 275 lb-ft and is offered in FWD (21/31 mpg) and all-wheel drive (20/29 mpg). The Sport’s 2.7-liter turbocharged engine produces 325 hp and a healthy 380 lb-ft of torque and delivers 17/26 mpg with its standard AWD system. The Hybrid’s powertrain is rated at 43/41 mpg and the Energi plug-in can travel up to 21 miles on all-electric energy.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2018/">2018 Ford Fusion</a> received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA. In IIHS testing, the 2018 Ford Fusion is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick because it received the highest rating of Good in all six crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation for avoiding 12- and 25-mph frontal collisions thanks to the available (standard on Platinum trim) adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go and forward collision warning including active braking with pedestrian detection. The Fusion missed the “+” designation because it received the lowest rating of Poor for the headlights evaluation.</p>

<p>The Driver Assist package includes automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, a heated steering wheel, lane keep assist with lane keep alert, rain-sensing wipers, a 110-volt power outlet, and auto-dimming side view mirrors. A self-parking system is optional on all trims and standard on the top Platinum trim.</p>

<p>The Fusion can hold up to 16.0 cubic feet of cargo in its trunk, the Hybrid and Energi models hold less–12.0 cubic feet due to the battery pack. Front and rear legroom is 44.3 and 38.3 inches, respectively.</p>

<p>The Fusion’s standard tech includes the Sync infotainment system displayed on a 4.2-inch center display, a 2.3-inch driver’s display, and a rotary gear shifter. The driver’s instrument panel display can be upgraded to a 4.2-inch screen or a pair of 4.2-inch display screens. Sync 3 comes with a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, Sirius XM satellite radio, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The standard four-speaker system can be upgraded to a six-speaker system or to the 12-speaker Sony unit with HD radio.</p>

<p>The Ford Pass app allows owners to find parking, compare fuel prices, receive important vehicle information, lock/unlock and start your vehicle, and schedule service from your smartphone. Sync Connect can also remotely start your vehicle and lock/unlock the doors, schedule remote start times, locate your Fusion in a parking lot, and check the car’s status. The optional continuously controlled damping with pothole mitigation smooths out the ride by detecting potholes and adjusts the suspension before the tire hits it.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2017/2017-ford-fusion-ecoboost-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Ford Fusion with the turbocharged 1.5-liter engine, we liked how intuitive the Fusion’s Sync 3 infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is and how well it worked. We didn’t care for the sedan’s acceleration and short power band but the transmission shifts well and the engine provides good fuel economy, beating the EPA rating during Real MPG testing. The Fusion’s chassis is tuned well and offers a good mix of ride comfort and handling prowess. The cabin is comfortable, spacious, and quiet but has some cheap trim pieces. We concluded: “Priced at $25,000, our test car is attainable and surprisingly well-connected for the money. Multimedia tech is the main highlight in the refreshed Fusion. Its interface is user-friendly and easily integrated with mobile devices. The car isn’t perfect, however, because the cabin materials, chassis damping, and engine response could be improved.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2017/2017-ford-fusion-sport-ecoboost-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Ford Fusion Sport, we praised the engine for its strong power and very quick acceleration, hitting 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds. The standard AWD system delivers the power very well, even when launched hard. However, we wish the transmission was snappier with downshifts but it upshifts well. Handling is good and steering feel is fine, but braking was not stand-out; the car stopped from 60 mph in 122 feet. The cabin is comfortable and quiet, though maybe too quiet as we wanted to hear more of that powerful engine. “But still with two turbos, all-wheel drive, and impressive straight-line speed, the unassuming Fusion Sport is a surprisingly fun outlier in a segment that thrives on playing it safe,” we said.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> dropped the C-Max Energi plug-in model from the lineup, leaving the unchanged C-Max Hybrid for its last model year.</p>

<p>The C-Max is Ford’s only hatchback hybrid and the automaker’s only other hybrid vehicle along with the Fusion Hybrid.</p>

<p><strong>2018 C-Max SE</strong>: The base trim comes equipped with 17-inch aluminum wheels, Sync infotainment system with USB and auxiliary ports, LED daytime running lights, active grille shutters, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 110-volt outlet, and 10-way power adjustable driver seat.</p>

<p><strong>2018 C-Max Titanium</strong>: The top Titanium trim adds 17-inch aluminum wheels with painted pockets, power and heated exterior mirrors, fog lights, a chrome grille, rear parking sensors, rain-sensing wipers, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, push-start ignition, remote engine start, Sync 3 with unique hybrid content and an 8.0-inch touchscreen, a nine-speaker Sony audio system with HD radio, 10-way power adjustable passenger’s seat, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>

<p>Some notable features include a panoramic fixed glass roof and a motion-activated power liftgate.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford C-Max’s electrified powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter I-4 engine paired to an electric motor for a total system output of 188 hp, delivering an EPA-rated 42/38 mpg city/highway and has a driving range of 540 miles (based on the EPA’s default split of 55 percent city and 45 percent highway). A CVT routes power to the front wheels. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2013 C-Max Hybrid hit 60 mph in 8.1 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 128 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford C-Max received four stars out of five for the hatchback’s overall safety rating. In IIHS testing, the C-Max received the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the driver-side small overlap front crash test and the highest rating of Good for four other crash tests. The front crash prevention test was not conducted because the C-Max does not offer an automatic emergency braking system. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear-cross traffic alert is found in the Titanium Driver Assist package that also includes front parking sensors and a self-parking system. A rearview camera and an SOS post-crash alert system are standard.</p>

<p>The 2018 C-Max offers 24.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats and 52.6 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/niro/2018/">Kia Niro</a> hybrid has 19.4 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 54.5 with the rear seats folded down. Front seat passengers in the C-Max have 43.1 inches of legroom while rear seat passengers make due with 36.5 inches.</p>

<p>The C-Max comes standard with the Sync infotainment system with USB and auxiliary ports and a 110-volt power outlet for devices. Sync 3 is the upgraded infotainment system that is displayed on an 8.0-inch touchscreen; SiriusXM satellite radio and a navigation system are optional. A six-speaker audio system is standard and a nine-speaker Sony sound system with HD radio is available. A self-parking system and remote engine start are optional.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/c-max/2013/2013-ford-c-max-hybrid-sel-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2013 Ford C-Max, we liked the cabin and its “comfortable and airy environment with plenty of cushy materials, bright lightings, and supportive seating. The extra-large windows add to the interior’s open feel and allow for superb all-around visibility. Storage compartments and power outlets galore make the interior as useful as it is stylish.”</p>

<p>We also liked the hatchback’s fuel efficiency and said “If you drive it with the A/C blasting, radio blaring, and the occasional jackrabbit start from a stoplight, you’ll easily see 35-plus mpg, thanks to its highly efficient 2.0-liter Atkinson four-cylinder that’s good for 141 hp and 129 lb-ft of torque, 118-hp electric motor, and library-quiet HF35 eCVT transmission.” We thought it was fun to drive for a hybrid—so much so, that the author recommended “two different people to purchase a C-Max Hybrid instead of a Prius.”</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/flex/2018/">Ford Flex</a> did not receive any significant changes for the new model year and all model features carry over.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>’s crossover lineup, the three-row Flex is positioned above the all-new and subcompact EcoSport, Escape, and Edge. Among Ford’s SUVs and crossovers, only the three-row Explorer and Expedition have higher starting prices.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Flex SE</strong>: The base SE trim comes standard with 4.2-inch instrument cluster and center LCD screens, rear parking sensors, bright dual exhaust tips, power and heated side view mirrors, rear climate controls, auto-dimming rearview mirror, manual tilt and telescoping steering wheel, a USB port, SYNC infotainment system, six-way power driver’s seat, 17-inch painted aluminum wheels and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Flex SEL</strong>: If you upgrade to the SEL, your Flex will also get fog lights, stainless steel bright beltline side and rear molding, chrome door handles, dual-zone automatic climate control, San Macassar Wood interior trim, heated front seats, a remote start system, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, Intelligent access with push-start ignition, two USB charging ports, an 8.0-inch center touchscreen display, SYNC 3, 10-way power driver’s seat, six-way power front passenger seat, and 18-inch painted aluminum wheels.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Flex Limited</strong>: In addition to the SEL features, the range-topping model comes with a power liftgate, HID headlights, LED taillights, Satin-aluminum finish grille and liftgate applique, power-folding and heated side view mirrors with security approach lights, interior ambient lighting, perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood inlay, Charcoal Black leather-trimmed seats with perforated inserts, Yoho Maple Cross interior instrument panel and door trim, a navigation system with Sirius XM Traffic and Travel Link, a 12-speaker Sony audio system, and 19-inch painted aluminum wheels.</p>

<p>A self-parking system, Multipanel Vista Roof, heated and cooled front seats, and one-touch power-folding third-row seats are some notable features.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/flex/2018/">2018 Ford Flex</a> is powered by a standard 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 287 hp and 254 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 16/23 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 16/22 mpg with all-wheel drive. The available 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 produces a healthy 365 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque and is only paired to an all-wheel-drive system, delivering 15/21 mpg. Both engines are backed by a six-speed automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2013 Ford Flex Limited with the twin-turbo V-6 (the same EcoBoost powertrain is still offered today) hit 60 mph in a quick 5.9 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 122 feet.</p>

<p>In NHTSA testing, the Ford Flex was only evaluated for the rollover crash test and the crossover received four stars out of five stars. With the exception of an Acceptable rating in the small overlap front crash test, the Flex scored the highest rating of Good in the remaining four crash evaluations in IIHS testing. The lowest score of Basic was issued for front crash prevention for properly warning the driver of a collision but the Flex does not offer emergency automatic braking and cannot avoid a frontal accident. Standard safety features for the 2018 Ford Flex include AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control, a rearview camera, and an SOS Post-Crash alert system that flashes the hazard lights and honks the horn in an event of an accident. Available driver assist safety feature include adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning with brake support, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, inflatable rear safety belts, and a self-parking system.</p>

<p>Behind the second-row, the Flex offers 43.2 cubic feet of cargo space. Put the second row down, and the cargo space grows to a massive 83.2 cubic feet. That actually tops the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/explorer/2018/">Ford Explorer</a>’s maximum cargo capacity of 81.7 cubic feet. Behind the third row is 20.0 cubic feet of cargo space. The Flex offers 42.6 inches of front legroom, 44.3 inches of second-row legroom, and 33.3 inches of third-row legroom.</p>

<p>The 2018 Flex’s standard infotainment system is SYNC with a 4.2-inch LCD center display screen and a 4.2-inch driver’s display screen with AppLink and 911 Assist and SOS Post-Crash Alert system. An audio USB port and an auxiliary audio jack are also standard. Upgrading to the larger 8.0-inch touchscreen will get you SYNC 3 and two quick-charging USB ports. The Limited model comes standard with a 12-speaker Sony audio system, navigation, and a 110-volt power outlet for electronics. The Active Park Assist self-parking system is available.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/flex/2013/2013-ford-flex-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the 2013 Ford Flex, we said that “the added power and broader torque curve are readily noticeable on the base V-6, which steps off with greater authority, though we wish the shifts happened quicker and with less torque sag. The new brakes feel great — nice firm pedal, minimal travel, easily modulated for smooth stops. And try as I could, I found no fault with the electric power steering. Its weighting felt natural; the quicker ratio is welcome; and with most of the rubber isolation out of the system, the driver can sense road-surface texture through the rim, but not changes in road-surface grip. Interior noise levels are remarkably low, allowing front-seat conversation to be easily heard from the third row. EcoBoost models dial all of the above impressions up several notches, with truly naughty acceleration rates and slightly crisper steering feel.”</p>

<p>A new SEL trim joins the lineup offering leather and Sync 3. The 2018 Escape SEL is positioned above the S and SE trims but below the Titanium trim. The 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 is now only available in the top Titanium trim.</p>

<p>The compact 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/escape/2018/">Ford Escape</a> crossover is positioned above the new subcompact EcoSport but below the midsize Edge, three-row Flex, three-row Explorer, and three-row Expedition SUVs.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Escape S</strong>: The base S trim comes equipped with the 2.5-liter I-4 engine, 17-inch steel wheels, six-way manual front seats, Sync infotainment system with a 4.2-inch screen, Ice Blue instrument panel lighting, automatic headlights, LED taillights, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Escape SE</strong>: The SE trim adds the 1.5-liter turbocharged I-4 engine, 17-inch alloy wheels, 10-way power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control, sync with SiriusXM satellite radio, one-touch up/down on all windows, fog lights, dual chrome exhaust tips, and black roof rails.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Escape SEL</strong>: The new SEL trim builds off the SE trims, adding leather-trimmed front seats, a power liftgate, heated side view mirrors, heated front seats, signature LED lighting, Sync 3 with a Wi-Fi hotspot and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an 8.0-inch center touchscreen, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear-shift knob, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Escape Titanium</strong>: The top trims comes equipped with the 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine, adds 18-inch wheels, a 10-way power passenger’s seat, driver’s seat memory, a 10-speaker Sony audio system, a heated steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 110-volt power outlet, interior ambient lighting, quick entry with a push-start ignition, remote engine start, a self-parking system, silver roof racks, and a foot-activated liftgate.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/escape/2018/">2018 Ford Escape</a> is available with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> Smart and Safe package of driver assist safety features, all-wheel drive, a panoramic moonroof, and 19-inch alloy wheels, and a navigation system.</p>

<p>The Escape’s base engine is a 2.5-liter I-4 with 168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque. Only available on the Escape S, the Ford delivers an EPA-rated 21/29 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is not available on the base engine). The optional engine is a 1.5-liter turbocharged I-4 that produces 170 hp and 177 lb-ft and is rated at 23/30 mpg with FWD and 22/28 mpg with AWD. The top 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine makes 245 hp and 275 lb-ft and delivers 21/28 with FWD and 20/27 with AWD. All engines are mated to a six-speed automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Ford Escape with the 1.5-liter turbo-four and FWD hit 60 mph in 9.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 126 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford Escape received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA. In IIHS testing, the Escape received the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the driver-side small overlap front crash test and the highest rating of Good in the other four conducted crash tests. The lowest rating of Basic was issued for the front crash prevention test for properly warning the driver of a possible collision thanks to the optional forward collision warning feature, but the Escape does not offer emergency automatic braking. The available Ford Safe and Smart package consists of rain-sensing windshield wipers, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with brake support, automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, lane keep assist, and a windshield wiper de-icer.</p>

<p>The Escape offers a healthy amount of cargo room with 34.0 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 68.0 with the rear seats folded down. The new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox/2018/">Chevrolet Equinox</a> offers 29.9 cubic feet and 63.5, respectively. Front passengers receive 43.1 inches of legroom and the rear seats offer 37.3 inches.</p>

<p>Standard tech for the Escape includes the Sync infotainment system displayed on a 4.2-inch center screen with voice recognition and a rearview camera. The upgraded Sync 3 system comes displayed on an 8.0-inch center screen and comes with a Wi-Fi hotspot, SiriusXM satellite radio, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility. A six-speaker audio system is standard and a 10-speaker Sony system is optional. Other tech features include remote engine start, a self-parking system, a foot-activated power liftgate, and a 110-volt power outlet. The FordPass app allows the owner to do several things such as finding parking, looking up vehicle information and scheduling service, locating fuel stations and comparing prices, locking/unlocking and starting your Escape remotely.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/escape/2017/2017-ford-escape-ecoboost-awd-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Ford Escape 2.0 EcoBoost, we felt that out loaded Titanium tester with AWD was pricey at $39,010, comparable to a mid-level Explorer. However, during SUV of the Year testing, judges praised the crossover’s handling dynamics and neutral chassis, saying it drove “very much like a hot hatch; you can tell that Ford of Europe had their hand in there somewhere.” Acceleration was quick and Real MPG testing numbers surpassed the EPA’s. We enjoyed the roomy interior and technology but felt the styling was showing its age. “All the goodness to be found in the 2017 Ford Escape could be had for several thousand dollars less than this loaded Titanium example; consider the midgrade SE trim with the outstanding 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine. This version might’ve even won that mega comparison test … [and] will suit both the driving enthusiast and the economy enthusiast,” we concluded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2016/small-crossover-comparison-big-test/">Big Test comparison</a> of nine compact crossovers, the Ford Escape SE with the 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine came in sixth place. The aged interior, tight backseat and slow acceleration took a toll on its ranking. “In sixth place is the Ford Escape SE. The Ford has a lot going for it from a ride-and-handling perspective, but there’s more to being a good family hauler than good dynamics. Its sluggish instrumented testing performance and tight cabin are really what sunk the Ford,” we said.</p>

<p>A SEL Sport Appearance package is new, as are seats that feature Mayan Gray fabric with Umber-colored cloth seats with Miko suede cloth inserts. SEL, Titanium, and Sport models add an available Safe and Smart package.</p>

<p>In size, the midsize two-row <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/edge/2018/">2018 Ford Edge</a> slots above the new subcompact EcoSport and compact Escape crossovers, but below the three-row Flex, Explorer, and Expedition.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Edge SE</strong>: The Edge’s base model comes standard with 18-inch wheels, automatic headlights, dual stainless steel exhaust tips, LED taillights, rear spoiler, Sync infotainment system, a 4.2-inch center screen, push-start ignition, a USB port, and a leather-wrapped shift knob.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Edge SEL</strong>: The SEL trim adds dual-zone climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 10-way power driver’s seat, 6-way power passenger’s seat, unique cloth seats, SiriusXM satellite radio, EasyFold rear seats, rear parking sensors, heated side view mirrors with approach lights, and LED signature lighting.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Edge Titanium</strong>: Move up to the Titanium trim and the Edge adds interior ambient lighting, an 8.0-inch center LCD touchscreen, two 4.2-inch LCD instrument cluster driver’s displays, Sync 3 infotainment system, leather-trimmed sport bucket seats, a 12-speaker Sony audio system, heated front seats, two USB ports, illuminated door sills, 10-way front passenger’s seat, a hands-free foot-activated liftgate, and LED taillights with light bar.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Edge Sport</strong>: The range-topping Sport trim comes with the 2.7-liter Ecoboost engine, sport-tuned suspension, all-wheel drive, adaptive steering, 20-inch polished wheels, leather-trimmed seats with Miko suede cloth inserts, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, unique body-color front, and rear lower fascia, and a piano black grille with Magnetic surround.</p>

<p>The 401A equipment package adds luxury and safety with a navigation system, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a self-parking system, a front 180-degree camera, HID headlights, remote engine start, rain-sensing wipers, a 110-volt power outlet, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, and lane keep assist.</p>

<p>The base engine in the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> Edge is a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated 245 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque, with an EPA-rated 20/29 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive (21/29 mpg with auto start/stop) and 20/27 mpg with all-wheel drive. The optional 3.5-liter V-6 pumps out 280 hp and 250 lb-ft and is rated at 17/26 mpg with FWD and 17/23 mpg with AWD. <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/edge/2016/2016-ford-edge-sport-awd-first-test-review/">The Ford Edge Sport</a> is powered by a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6 rated 315 hp and 350 lb-ft and comes standard with AWD, delivering 17/24 mpg. All engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2016 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/edge/2018/">Ford Edge</a> Sport hit 60 mph in 5.7 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 120 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford Edge received the highest overall safety rating of five stars from the NHTSA. In IIHS testing, the 2018 Ford Edge received the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the driver-side small overlap front crash test but received the highest rating of Good in four other crash tests. The lowest rating of Basic was issued for the front crash prevention evaluation because the Edge properly warned the driver of a possible collision but doesn’t offer emergency automatic braking. Available driver assist safety features include adaptive cruise control and forward collision with brake support, blind-spot monitoring with cross-traffic alert, active park assist with side parking sensors, lane keep assist, and a front 180-degree camera. A rearview camera system and an SOS post-crash alert system are standard.</p>

<p>The Edge offers 39.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats and 73.4 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down. Front and rear seat legroom are 42.6 and 40.6 inches, respectively. The Edge tops the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe/2018/">Hyundai Santa Fe</a> Sport’s cargo space of 35.4 cubic feet with the seats up and 71.5 with the seats down. <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/murano/2015/2015-ford-edge-nissan-murano-hyundai-santa-fe-sport-comparison/">In a comparison</a> with the Edge, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/murano/2018/">Nissan Murano</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Santa Fe, we noted that even though the Edge has more rear-seat legroom on paper, in person, the Murano had noticeably more room.</p>

<p>The standard Sync infotainment system is displayed on a 4.2-inch center display screen and comes with one USB port, but the available Sync 3 system comes with an 8.0-inch touchscreen and two USB ports. Two 4.2-inch instrument panel driver display screens, SiriusXM satellite radio, and a Sony audio system are available. Other optional tech includes a hands-free motion-activated liftgate, a self-parking system, a dual-screen rear entertainment system, and adaptive cruise control with other driver assist features.</p>

<p>In a of the 2015 Ford Edge Sport AWD, we liked the quick acceleration and loads of features but all that came with a high price tag. “Should you be in the market and score a test drive with the Sport,” we wrote, “let us know if you thought the suede inserts in the front and rear leather seating caused discomfort, as they did with some editors. There’s no question this is the most impressive Edge yet.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/edge/2016/2016-ford-edge-sport-awd-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Ford Edge Sport AWD with adaptive steering, we said: “What is it like to drive this quick, firm-riding SUV that doesn’t prioritize on-road ride comfort or fuel savings (16.5/23.9/19.2 city/highway/combined Real MPG)? Pretty much the same as last time. Aside from the presence of the attractive and faster-reacting Sync 3 and the newly gained ease of parking thanks to adaptive steering, it was a challenge to spot the differences.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-350/2018/">2018 Ford F-350</a> gets an upgraded diesel engine option with more torque.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-350/2018/">Ford F-350</a> is a heavy duty truck that slots above the F-250. Available in five grades, the F-350 offers three cab styles, single or dual-wheel layouts, and two bed lengths.</p>

<p><strong>F-350 XL:</strong> The base XL trim comes standard with bench seats (including rear seats on the SuperCab and crew cab), vinyl seats, air conditioning, a four-speaker audio system, a rearview camera, and 17-inch steel wheels.</p>

<p><strong>F-350 XLT: </strong>Move up to the XLT trim and you’ll get 18-inch wheels, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a 4.2-inch instrument cluster display, and steering wheel audio controls.</p>

<p><strong>F-350 Lariat: </strong>The Lariat model is the first of three variants that lean toward luxury and come standard with leather upholstery, 10-way power front seats, dual-zone climate control, a 10-speaker Sony audio system, Sync 3 with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, rear parking sensors, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>F-350 King Ranch: </strong>King Ranch models feature unique treatments including bright 18-inch alloy wheels, Mesa brown leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, navigation, and a heated steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>F-350 Platinum: </strong>Range-topping Platinum models come with 20-inch alloy wheels, heated rear seats, full LED headlights, and multicontour front seats with a massage function.</p>

<p>Options include remote start, power-deployable side steps, LED bed lighting, a 360-degree camera system, a panoramic sunroof, and a power-sliding rear window. The FX4 off-road package is also available and includes unique suspension tuning and transfer case, and skid plates for the fuel tank.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> F-350 comes standard with a 6.2-liter V-8 good for 385 hp and 430 lb-ft of torque. A 6.7-liter turbodiesel V-8 rated at 450 hp and 935 lb-ft is also available. Both engines are paired to a heavy-duty six-speed automatic transmission. The EPA doesn’t rate heavy duty trucks for fuel economy.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Ford F-350. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are optional on the XL, XLT, and Lariat trims and standard on higher grades. Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum models are also available with adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p>When properly equipped, the 2018 F-350 can haul up to 7,630 pounds of payload depending on the cab style and bed length. The F-350 has the ability to pull up to 21,000 pounds of payload with a conventional trailer or up to 32,000 pounds with a fifth wheel or goose neck.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-250/2017/2017-ford-f-series-super-duty-first-drive-tow-masters/">2017 First Drive</a>, we appreciated the F-350’s towing capability and the improved cabin materials. Ride quality, however, is still stiff when empty but becomes smooth when loaded. Both engines offers plenty of power but the diesel is punchier. We were impressed by how easy it was to use the driving aids that facilitate towing and hauling.</p>

<p>With its generous towing capacity, torque-rich diesel engine, and slick tech features that help with towing, the Ford Super Duty family was crowned <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/ford-super-duty-2017-motor-trend-truck-of-the-year/"><em>Motor Trend’s </em>2017 Truck of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>The current-generation Ford F-350, like the smaller F-150, has an aluminum body to help reduce the truck’s overall weight.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Everything. The 2018 <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/ford-ecosport-small-crossover-confirmed-for-north-america/">Ford EcoSport is a new model for the U.S. market</a>. Although the Fiesta-based crossover has been on sale in various global markets for years, 2018 is the first model year for the subcompact crossover in the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>Based on the subcompact <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fiesta/2018/">Ford Fiesta</a>, the new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/ecosport/2018/">Ford EcoSport</a> slots below the Escape, Edge, three-row Explorer, three-row full-size Flex, and three-row Expedition in the automaker’s SUV/crossover lineup. The subcompact Ford EcoSport competes in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/xv-crosstrek/2015/the-big-test-2015-2016-subcompact-crossovers/">growing segment</a> that also includes the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/renegade/2018/">Jeep Renegade</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">Chevrolet Trax</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/hr-v/2018/">Honda HR-V</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-3/2018/">Mazda CX-3</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/kicks/2018/">Nissan Kicks</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base engine in the Ford EcoSport is a variation of the 1.0-liter EcoBoost turbo-three also found in the Fiesta and Focus cars. In the 2018 EcoSport, the engine makes 123 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque and is only offered with front-wheel drive. A 2.0-liter I-4 is optional on all-wheel-drive models, making 166 hp and 149 lb-ft. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-drive is standard, though all-wheel-drive is standard with the 2.0-liter engine.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/six-first-impressions-2018-ford-ecosport/">got our first look at the new subcompact crossover</a> during its North American reveal. Although the rear seats fold flat, they don’t fold level with the rear cargo floor. A height-adjustable shelf solves that issue. The EcoSport also features lots of storage bins and cubbies.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The EcoSport is available with a 10-speaker, 675-watt B&amp;O Play audio system by Harman.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think </strong></p>

<p>“The flavors are many, as are the toppings,” we said in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/transit/2015/2015-ford-transit-first-drive/">2015 Ford Transit First Drive</a>. “But no matter which variety is earmarked for daily duty, buyers can count on a comfortable, efficient, highly capable, nicely priced foundation. In other words, the fiery rumble between commercial vans in America just got hotter. Hey, ProMaster, NV, Sprinter, Express — you’d better watch out.”</p>

<p>At the end of our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/transit/2015/2015-ford-transit-150-350hd-first-test/">2015 Ford Transit 150, 350HD First Test</a>, we concluded: “Ford has entered a quick growing segment in the cargo/passenger van/wagon market and has done it the right way. It offers a massive variety of configurations to fit any need its customers might have, from a comfort-friendly passenger vehicle to heavy-duty work vehicle and everything in between. What Ford has done with the 2015 Transit will not go unnoticed by its competition, and for very good reason.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Ford Transit’s unit-body construction is stronger and more capable than the old body-on-frame Econoline van.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2018-ford-explorer-gets-mildest-refreshes-new-york/">2018 Ford Explorer gets mild freshening</a> before its next major redesign. Updates include a new grille and foglights, and quad exhaust tips on models with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. Other exterior changes include four new paint options and five wheel choices. The interior gains a 4G LTE modem and Wi-Fi hotspot. A new Safe and Smart package combines several popular active safety and driver assist tech together.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>In price, the three-row midsize <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/explorer/2018/">2018 Ford Explorer</a> slots above the compact Escape, midsize two-row Edge, and three-row Flex, but below the full-size Expedition SUV.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Three engine options are offered for the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/explorer/2018/">Ford Explorer</a> including a 3.5-liter V-6 base engine making 290 hp and 255 lb-ft of torque. Optional engines include turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost I-4 with 280 hp and 310 lb-ft or a twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 making 365 hp and 350 lb-ft. A six-speed automatic backs all engine options. Front-drive is standard with the 3.5-liter and 2.3-liter, and the automaker’s all-wheel-drive system is available with the base 3.5-liter and 2.3-liter EcoBoost and standard with 3.5-liter EcoBoost.</p>

Standard and available options include cloth or leather seating surfaces, rear auxiliary climate control, 12-speaker Sony premium audio system, SiriusXM satellite radio, navigation, a twin-panel moonroof, heated and cooled seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>With only a mild refresh to the 2018 Explorer, we expect the 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> Explorer’s five-star <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/">NHTSA rating</a> (out of a possible five stars) to carry over, as well as <a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/ford/explorer-4-door-suv">the IIHS’ Good ratings</a> in the moderate overlap front, side, and roof strength tests and its Marginal rating in the small overlap front test. The 2017 Explorer also earned a Basic rating for its front crash warning. Available active safety and driver assistance tech on the 2017 model includes in the new Safe and Sound package includes collision warning and emergency braking, lane keeping, blind-spot warning, cross-traffic warning, adaptive cruise control, auto high beams, and rain-sensing wipers.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>“Ultimately, that might be the single biggest problem with the new Explorer Platinum and the Explorer as a whole: For every one thing it does well, someone else does it better. Want something roomier? There’s the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/pilot/2018/">Honda Pilot</a>. Want something more fun to drive? Look at the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2018/">Mazda CX-9</a>. Want something more luxurious? Check out the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/acadia/2018/">GMC Acadia</a>,” we concluded in out <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/explorer/2016/2016-ford-explorer-platinum-first-test/">2016 Ford Explorer Platinum EcoBoost First Test</a>. “The Ford Explorer line is thoroughly competitive on paper, but its dominance has ultimately led the competition to simply try harder. With others overtaking the Explorer in comfort, packaging, luxury, and dynamics, it’s now finally time for Ford to show ‘we try harder’ when the next-generation Explorer hits the streets in 2019.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2.3-liter EcoBoost is available with all-wheel drive, while the previous 2.0-liter EcoBoost I-4 was front-drive only.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2018/">Ford Fusion</a> Hybrid and Energi plug-in did not receive any significant changes for the new model year.</p>

The Hybrid comes with an EPA rating of 43/41 mpg city/highway and the Energi is also rated at 43/41 mpg when in hybrid mode, with 97 mpg-e on all-electric power. Before the gas engine turns on, the Fusion Energi is rated for up to 21 miles of all-electric power. A CVT routes power to the front wheels. In <em>Motor Trend </em>testing, the 2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid hit 60 mph in 8.7 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 123 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford Fusion Hybrid received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA. The 2018 Ford Fusion is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick for receiving the highest rating of Good in all crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test by avoiding 12- and 25-mph collisions thanks to the automatic emergency braking feature that’s part of a package that also consists of adaptive cruise control with stop/go, pre-collision warning, and brake support. Other driver assist features are found in the Driver Assist package, which includes automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, lane keep assist, lane departure alert, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and auto-dimming side view mirrors with security approach lights. A self-parking system, rear parking sensors, and inflatable rear safety belts are also offered.</p>

<p>The Ford Fusion offers up to 44.3 inches of legroom for the front seats and 38.3 inches for the rear seats in all models. Without a battery pack taking up space, the non-hybrid Fusion offers 16.0 cubic feet of space in the trunk. The Fusion Hybrid has 12.0 cubic-feet of space, which shrinks to 8.2 cubic-feet on the Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid.</p>

<p>The Fusion’s standard infotainment system is displayed on a 4.2-inch center screen that can be upgraded to an 8.0-inch center touchscreen with SiriusXM satellite radio. The Platinum trims have a navigation system with SiriusXM Traffic and Travel Link. Dual 4.2-inch instrument panel displays are standard on all trims. The standard nine-speaker audio system can be upgraded to a 12-speaker Sony system with HD radio. The Fusion also offers two packages of driver assist safety features, a self-parking system, a 110-volt power outlet, and the Sync Connect app that offers many functions like locating your car and turning it on.</p>

<p>In a review comparing the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion-energi/2017/2017-ford-fusion-hybrid-energi-review/">2017 Ford Fusion Hybrid and Energi</a> models, we noted that the cargo space and acceleration is worse than many competitors. However, we like the available suite of driver assist safety features and the solid crash safety scores. We concluded by saying, “The Fusion hybrids aren’t the most efficient or cargo-friendly in their classes, but they drive well and boast attractive looks in a sedan body style. At the right price, they might just make sense.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2017/2017-ford-fusion-ecoboost-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 non-hybrid Ford Fusion SE (1.5-liter turbo-four engine), we said, “Although the 2017 Fusion doesn’t forget that it’s a family sedan, it brings plenty of substance in the form of user-friendly technology and agile handling. … Multimedia tech is the main highlight in the refreshed Fusion. Its interface is user-friendly and easily integrated with mobile devices.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/focus/2018/">2018 Ford Focus</a> is unchanged for the new model year.</p>

<p>The compact <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/focus/2018/">Ford Focus</a> sedan and hatchback slot above the subcompact Fiesta sedan and hatch and below the midsize Fusion and full-size Taurus sedans in the automaker’s passenger car lineup.</p>

If you plan to track your Focus RS or just want maximum grip, opt for the available Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 2 summer tires.</p>

<p>Four engines are offered on the 2018 Ford Focus depending on trim level. The base engine is a 2.0-liter I-4 that develops 160 hp and 146 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 25/34 mpg city/highway when backed by the five-speed manual and 26/38 mpg when backed by the six-speed dual-clutch automatic (24/34 mpg with the SelectShift six-speed dual-clutch).

The Ford Focus Titanium with the 2.0-liter engine most Focuses will have, hit 60 in 8.4 seconds and stopped from 60 in a very short 105 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ford Focus received the highest overall safety rating of five stars from the NHTSA for sedan and hatchback body styles. In IIHS testing, The 2018 Ford Focus received the second-highest rating of Acceptable in the driver-side small overlap front crash test and received the highest rating of Good in four other crash test evaluations. The front crash prevention test was not conducted because the Focus does not offer emergency automatic braking. Standard safety features include a rearview camera, dual-stage front airbags, and a tire pressure monitoring system. Available safety features include active park assist (self-parking system), rear parking sensors, lane keep assist, and blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert.</p>

<p>The Focus sedan offers 13.2 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk and the hatch has 23.3 cubic feet behind the rear seats and up to 43.9 cubic feet behind the front seats.

The upgraded infotainment system is Sync 3 displayed on an 8.0-inch center touchscreen with HD Radio, SiriusXM satellite radio, two USB ports, and a 10-speaker Sony audio system. Navigation, interior ambient lighting, and dual 4.2-inch instrument cluster driver displays (Electric model) are optional.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/focus/2016/2016-ford-focus-rs-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Ford Focus RS, we said the acceleration, lateral grip, stopping power, and figure-eight course time were all very impressive, on par with more expensive sports cars. One of our biggest complaints happen when the hatch is in track mode: “At that point the dampers turn into pogo sticks, and the hatchback starts bouncing up and down like an excited Boston terrier. It isn’t like a rough ride that you’d ignore in a sports car, but an unbelievable and constant vertical shake, as if riding a sine wave. It happens both mid-corner and on the straights, no matter how smooth the pavement.”</p>

<p>Take away the pogo stick effect and, “the Focus RS will reframe your perception of previous all-wheel-drive sport compacts, such as the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/wrx/">Subaru WRX</a> STI and <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/lancer/">Mitsubishi Lancer</a> Evolution. It’s much, much faster and more fun to drive.” However, when loaded, the Focus RS gets expensive, “the Focus RS gets close in price to the vastly superior-handling and faster <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/camaro/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> SS 1LE. The hatchback and four doors make the car more livable for a single-car family, but there are better-performing and better-riding cars available for $42,245.”</p>

<p>When we reviewed both 2016 Ford Focus SE sedan and hatchback with the 1.0-liter turbocharged I-3 EcoBoost engine <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/focus/2016/2016-ford-focus-se-ecoboost-i3-first-test-review/">during a First Test</a>, we were not impressed with the performance, but that was expected because these engines were developed for maximum fuel efficiency and not quick acceleration. We felt the manual-transmission model was more responsive around town and the engine was quiet and torquey (once the engine gets past the turbo lag). The Focus handles surprisingly well but the steering is vague on center with plenty of play. We concluded by saying: “The 2016 Ford Focus SE Sedan 1.0-Liter EcoBoost is a compelling choice for those looking to maximize fuel economy in their compact sedan or hatchback. We would choose the manual transmission to save on upfront costs and at the pump. The manual-equipped car is significantly quicker and seals the deal.”</p>

<p>Optional extras include a 360-degree camera system, front parking sensors, power deployable running boards, LED bed lighting, and the FX4 Off-road package, which includes unique suspension tuning and transfer case, and skid plates for the fuel tank.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 F-250 a five-star rating for the side impact test (out of a possible five stars). On the NHTSA’s rollover test, rear-drive models received four-stars and four-wheel drive models got three stars.</p>

<p>Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert is available on all models. Lane keeping assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control are available only on higher-grade models.</p>

<p>Depending on the cab style, drivetrain configuration, and bed length, the 2018 F-250 can haul up to 15,000 pounds with a conventional trailer or 18,500 pounds with a fifth wheel or goose neck. Maximum payload capacity for the 2018 F-250 is 4,000 pounds.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-250/2017/2017-ford-f-series-super-duty-first-drive-tow-masters/">2017 First Drive</a>, we were impressed with the material quality inside the F-250’s cabin and the optional diesel engine, which offers plenty of power on tap to move the massive truck. Ride quality is comfortable when the truck is carrying payload but it’s stiff when it’s empty. We were also impressed with the F-250’s driver assistance features, which helps make towing easier by giving the driver plenty of guidance when backing into a trailer. It’s also got a blind-spot warning system than includes the trailer when driving.</p>

<p>The 2017 F-250 was <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/ford-super-duty-2017-motor-trend-truck-of-the-year/"><em>Motor Trend’s </em>2017 Truck of the Year</a> as part of the Super Duty family.</p>

<p>Although its body is now mainly constructed out of aluminum, the rest of the F-250’s platform continues to use steel.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The best-selling <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2018/2018-ford-f-150-first-look-review/"></a><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2018/">Ford F-150</a> gets a major update for its 40<sup>th</sup> birthday. The big news is a new 3.0-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel V-6 as well as revised gasoline engines. Power ratings for the turbodiesel haven’t been revealed. The 10-speed automatic now has a wider availability. Other changes include a new front end and rear end including exterior lighting, grille, and tailgate. Inside, more interior colors are available, and SYNC 3 offers more infotainment and connectivity features.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The full-size <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> F-Series is the number one selling vehicle in the U.S. The light-duty F-150 pickup lots below the F-Series Super Duty pickups in the automaker’s lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Not only is the Ford F-Series the number one selling truck for four decades, it’s also the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 35 years. For 2018, the refreshed F-150 gets a new 3.0-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel V-6 that has yet to be rated for power or fuel economy. The new engine, which will likely feature twin turbos, is backed by a 10-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>Ford also updated most of the F-150’s gasoline engines. The previous model’s base 3.5-liter V-6 has shrunk to 3.3 liter, but gains a new twin-injection system (port and direct). Power ratings are unchanged at 282 hp and 253 lb-ft of torque. The 3.3-liter is backed by a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>The new second-generation 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 also gains the twin-injection system, while the 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 gains new plasma-transferred wire arc spray-bore cylinder lining for reduced weight over the previous engine’s iron cylinder liners. Ford says the 2.7-liter EcoBoost and 5.0-liter V-8 make more power than before. The second-generation twin-injection 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, with 375 hp and 470 lb-ft, introduced in 2017 carries over. A 10-speed automatic backs the 2.7-liter EcoBoost, 5.0-liter, and 3.5-liter EcoBoost engines. All 2018 F-150 drivetrains feature standard automatic start/stop.</p>

<p>We expect the new for <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2017/2017-ford-f-150-raptor-first-test-velocity-raptor/">2017 Ford F-150 Raptor</a> and its 450-hp, 510 lb-ft 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 and 10-speed auto combo to carry over unchanged.</p>

<p>The current-generation <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2015/2015-ford-f-150-first-look/">Ford F-150 arrived in 2015</a> amidst lots of controversy due to its (mostly) aluminum cab and box. Ford claims the aluminum construction reduced weight by up to 700 pounds depending on configuration and options.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The pre-refresh <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2017/">2017 Ford F-150</a> pickup has a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars) and is considered a 2016 Top Safety Pick by the IIHS. That F-150, last year’s model, received a front crash prevention designation of basic for its optional Adaptive Cruise Control and Collision Warning with Brake Support. The 2018 F-150 features precollision assist with pedestrian detection, which first warns the driver and second brakes the vehicle to lessen impact, while the adaptive cruise control now features stop-and-go traffic-jam cruising.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think </strong></p>

<p>“From their hauling and towing abilities to trailer-attaching in-truck electronic guidance to the quality of materials lining the cab’s innards to the sticker prices slapped on the driver-side window, pickups have never been more impressive,” we said in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2017/2017-ford-f-150-platinum-4x4-ecoboost-first-test/">2017 Ford F-150 Platinum 4×4 EcoBoost First Test</a>. “Which means the eager, post-peak secondhand pickup shoppers have a lot of F-150 to look forward to.”</p>

<p>We look forward to driving the refreshed 2018 Ford F-150 soon.</p>

<p>The G90 is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/genesis/">Genesis</a>’ flagship sedan, positioned above the smaller and less expensive G70 and G80 premium sedans.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/genesis/g90/2018/">2018 Genesis G90</a> 3.3T Premium</strong>: The G90 comes standard with a long list of premium features including 19-inch alloy wheels, steering-responsive full LED headlights, Nappa leather seating, 22-way power adjustable driver’s seat (16-way power for passenger), a 12.3-inch center HD display with a navigation system and SiriusXM satellite radio, a 7.0-inch instrument panel driver’s display, a 17-speaker Lexicon surround sound audio system, front and rear USB ports, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, a multi-view camera system, high-beam assist, a full-color head-up display, a wireless charging pad, microfiber suede headliner, leather-wrapped dashboard, genuine wood interior trim, rear power sunshades, interior ambient lighting, Genesis Connected Services, and a suite of driver assist safety features.</p>

<p>The 2018 Genesis G90’s standard engine is a 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 that produces 365 hp and 376 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 17/24 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and exactly the same with all-wheel drive equipped. The upgraded 5.0-liter V-8 pumps out 420 hp and 383 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 16/24 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 15/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. Both engines are backed by an eight-speed automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 G90 5.0 (RWD) hit 60 mph in a quick 5.0 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 121 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Genesis G90 is considered a 2018 Top Safety Pick+ by the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all crash tests and in the headlights evaluation, and the highest rating of Superior in the front crash prevention test by avoiding 12- and 25-mph frontal collisions thanks to the standard automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection system. The G90 comes standard with many additional driver assist safety features including adaptive cruise control with stop/go, a pre-collision warning system, lane keep assist, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist, driver attention alert, a multi-view camera system, front and rear parking sensors, and pre-active seatbelts that automatically tighten when needed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/genesis/g90/2017/2017-genesis-g90-33t-awd-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Genesis G90 3.3T AWD, we were impressed with the superior ride comfort, great value, and very quiet interior. The large sedan feels floaty but can still handle a corner well. The fuel economy did not impress us and we didn’t have much to say about the sedate exterior and interior styling.</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/genesis-g90-2017-car-of-the-year-finalist/">2017 Motor Trend Car of the Year testing</a>, the G90 was a finalist due to its very impressive ride comfort, great value, strong base twin-turbo V-6, good high-speed stability, and high-quality interior. However, the premium sedan was not our Car of the Year, and “it was more than the ho-hum styling. If Genesis wanted to make an entrance, it should have made a technological statement, as well. Every feature about the car screams table stakes. There is nothing exceptional here.’”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/genesis/g90/2018/bmw-740e-vs-lexus-ls-500-vs-genesis-g90-33t-vs-lincoln-continental-30/">four-way comparison</a> of big and luxurious sedans, The 2018 Genesis G90 3.3T (with AWD) was the victor, topping the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/continental/2017/">2017 Lincoln Continental</a> 3.0, 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> 740e xDrive iPerformance, and the redesigned <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/ls/2018/">2018 Lexus LS</a> 500. The G90 has remarkable value thanks to its low starting price and a long list of standard features. At the track, we were impressed with the Genesis’ strong acceleration, braking, and good handling dynamics. On the road the G90 is “…as smooth as a Marvin Gaye ballad. Its engine and transmission are particularly noteworthy for how effortless they make the process of driving. Dip into the throttle, and the G90 accelerates with pure elegance, with no noise from the V-6 under the hood and no physical sensation of gearshifts, save for the tach needle’s swing.”</p>

<p>Inside, the G90 is a “…peaceful sensory deprivation chamber. You know, like Lexuses used to be. The leather seats are ‘buttery smooth’ and enormously comfortable both up front and in the cavernous rear passenger area. With much to prove, Genesis appears to have thought out every function of the G90’s interior—with high-quality materials on every surface and easy-to-find controls for everything from the 360-degree camera and radar cruise control to the infotainment system.” However, some judges noted that the interior was “sterile” compared to some of its rivals.</p>

<p>We concluded by saying, “It’s easy to dismiss upstart luxury automakers such as Genesis as luxury car imitators. But the G90 is no knock-off Rolex—it’s a proper luxury flagship in its own right. Although we admittedly wish the G90 made more of a visual statement, the cabin is comfortable, luxurious, and filled with the latest creature comforts and semi-autonomous technologies. The drive is smooth yet engaging. And its value story is undeniable.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong> The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-2500hd/2018/">2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD</a> gets a rearview camera and a 7.0-inch touchscreen as standard. Three new exterior colors, Deep Mahogany Metallic, Red Quartz Tintcoat, and White Frost Tricoat, are now available. A tire-fill alert has been added to the tire pressure monitoring system, and the Denali trim gets a new grille.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong> The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-2500hd/2018/">GMC Sierra 2500HD</a> is one of two heavy-duty trucks sold by <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a>, slotting below the larger Sierra 3500HD and above the smaller Sierra 1500. Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional. Two box styles and three cab styles are available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong> Two engines are available in the 2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD, a 6.0-liter V-8 producing 360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V-8 rated at 445 hp and 910 lb-ft. Both engines are paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the Sierra 2500HD can tow up to 18,100 pounds and can haul up 3,534 pounds of payload. Standard features on a base Sierra 2500HD include 17-inch alloy wheels, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth connectivity, 60/40 split-folding rear seats on the double- and crew-cab models, and a six-speaker audio system. Higher trim levels can be had with navigation, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, a Bose premium audio system, leather upholstery, 18-inch chrome wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, keyless entry/start, remote start, and a wireless charging pad.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong> The NHTSA gave the 2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD a four-star overall rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 Sierra 2500HD. Higher trim levels can be had with safety features such as the lane departure warning and forward collision warning, both of which are bundled together with parking sensors and the Safety Alert Seat in the Driver Alert package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong> In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-gmc-sierra-denali-hd-first-test/">2015 First Test,</a> we noted that, like all heavy duty trucks, the Sierra 2500HD has a jittery ride; however, it smooths out when there’s payload in the bed. Having payload in the bed also didn’t hurt the truck’s acceleration, allowing it to haul with ease. The transmission, however, is programmed to go to the highest gear as possible, which can make the Sierra 2500HD feel sluggish. Interior quality on the Denali trim is higher than in others, giving it a more upscale feel.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong> The more new diesel engine, which was introduced last year, offers 165 lb-ft of torque more than the older unit it replaces.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The all-new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/terrain/2018/">2018 GMC Terrain</a> rides on a new platform and features a new range of turbocharged engines and a full suite of active safety features.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting below the three-row Acadia, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/terrain/2018/">GMC Terrain</a> is the brand’s front- and all-wheel-drive entry-level crossover. Unlike the new Acadia, the Terrain is no longer available with a six-cylinder engine option</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Terrain is offered with three new turbocharged four-cylinder engines including a base 1.5-liter unit with 170 hp and 203 lb-ft of torque, a larger 2.0-liter with 252 hp and 260 lb-ft, and a 1.6-liter diesel rated at 137 hp and 240 lb-ft. A new nine-speed automatic developed in house by General Motors is standard on the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter, while the diesel makes do with a six-speed unit. Cargo capacity stands at 29.6 cubic feet behind the second row and 63.3 cubic feet behind the front seats. The 2018 Terrain is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped and powered by the 252-hp 2.0-liter gas turbo-four.</p>

<p>Available features include <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a>’s IntelliLink multimedia interface with a 7.0- or 8.0-inch touchscreen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, 4G LTE connectivity, navigation, a Bose premium audio system, a 360-degree view camera system, a heated steering wheel, the Rear Seat Reminder system that reminds you to check the back seats before leaving the car, LED headlights, alloy wheels up to 19 inches in diameter, and Bluetooth connectivity. As with every GMC model, there’s a range-topping Denali trim level that’s more upscale and is distinguished by its chrome exterior accents and a unique grille.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The Terrain makes available a full suite of active safety features that includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, lane change alert, blind spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We’ve yet to drive the 2018 Terrain, but the lighter crossover’s turbocharged engines will likely provide more accessible power compared to the last-gen model’s naturally aspirated four- and six-cylinder mills. The 2018 Terrain’s infotainment system should also be a major improvement as it now features smartphone integration even on the base unit with the smaller 7.0-inch touchscreen.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 GMC Terrain is closely related to the recently redesigned <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox/2018/">2018 Chevrolet Equinox</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/acadia/2018/">2018 GMC Acadia</a> now gets a heated steering wheel on the Denali trim and a new exterior color, Blue Steel Metallic. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a> has also made the six- and seven-seat configurations available on the All-Terrain trim, in addition to the standard five-seat layout.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the smaller Terrain and below the larger, full-size Yukon, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/acadia/2018/">GMC Acadia</a> is a midsize crossover that’s available in front- or all-wheel-drive configurations. In addition to the standard five-seat layout, the Acadia also has a six- and seven-seat configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available on the 2018 GMC Acadia including a 2.5-liter I-4 with 193 hp and 188 lb-ft of torque or an optional 3.6-liter V-6 with 310 hp and 271 lb-ft. Both are paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/26 mpg city/highway for front-drive or 21/25 mpg with all-wheel drive for four-cylinder models. Jumping to the V-6 doesn’t come at a huge cost to fuel economy since front-drive models are rated at 18/25 mpg while all-wheel-drive cars are rated at 17/25 mpg. With the base four-cylinder, the 2018 Acadia can tow up to 1,000 pounds but with the optional V-6, it increases to 4,000 pounds. Cargo capacity is 12.8 cubic feet with the third row in place, 41.7 cubic feet behind the second row, and 79 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>The base SL trim comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/start, tri-zone climate control, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a rearview camera, the rear seat reminder system, 4G LTE connectivity, a six-speaker audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, and split-folding second- and third-row seats. Options on higher trim levels include a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, a programmable power liftgate, heated and ventilated front seats, second-row captain’s chairs, HID headlights, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, remote start, and a Bose premium audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the front-drive 2018 Acadia a four-star safety rating and the all-wheel drive variant a five-star rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Acadia received a Good score on all crash test but only got a Marginal rating for the new headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Acadia avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the impact in a 25-mph test by 24 mph, enabling it to get a Superior rating (Superior is the highest score in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the IIHS gave the 2018 Acadia the Top Safety Pick rating.</p>

<p>Optional on higher trims is the Driver Alert II package, which adds pedestrian detection, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, Intellibeam headlights, front and rear parking sensors, following distance indicator, the safety alert seat, lane keeping assist, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot warning, and lane change assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Despite the shorter wheelbase compared to the outgoing model, the Acadia features a comfortable ride and confident handling for a crossover, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/acadia/2017/2017-gmc-acadia-terrain-first-test-smaller-faster/">2017 First Test</a>. With the optional 310-hp 3.6-liter V-6, the GMC Acadia offers strong acceleration. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2016/2017-gmc-acadia-2016-mazda-cx-9-2017-toyota-highlander-comparison/">2016 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2018/">Mazda CX-9</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">Toyota Highlander</a>, the Acadia placed third due to an interior with some cheap-feeling interior materials, sluggish throttle response, and a transmission that’s slow to response.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong> The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-3500hd/2018/">2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD</a> gets a rearview camera and a 7.0-inch touchscreen as standard on all trim levels. Three new colors, Deep Mahogany Metallic, Red Quartz Tintcoat, and White Frost Tricoat, have been added to the Sierra 3500HD’s exterior color palette. The tire pressure monitor system now also includes a tire pressure alert system.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong> The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-3500hd/2018/">GMC Sierra 3500HD</a> is the largest truck sold by <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a>, slotting above the smaller Sierra 2500HD. It is available in rear- or four-wheel-drive configurations and in either single or dual rear-wheel setups. Two bed lengths and three cab styles are available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong> Two engines are offered on the 2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD, a 6.0-liter V-8 rated at 360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V-8 with 445 hp and 910 lb-ft. Both engines are paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. Maximum payload on the 2018 Sierra 3500HD is 7,153 pounds, and when properly equipped, it can tow up to 23,300 pounds. Standard features include a GMC’s IntelliLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, an automatic locking differential, 18-inch steel wheels, Bluetooth connectivity, and 60/40 split-folding rear bench seats on double- and crew-cab models.

<p><strong>Safety</strong> The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD. On higher trim levels, you can also opt for forward collision warning and lane departure warning, both of which are bundled together with parking sensors and the Driver Alert Seat as part of the Driver Alert package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong> We’ve yet to test a 2018 Sierra 3500HD, but in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-gmc-sierra-denali-hd-first-test/">2015 First Test</a> of a Sierra 2500HD we said that like other trucks of the same size, the ride is jittery when the bed is empty; however, add some payload, and it smooths out without affecting its ability to accelerate. In the Denali trim, the truck’s interior is well-appointed and packed with plenty of tech features including 4G LTE connectivity. The transmission is tuned for fuel economy and always wants to upshift to the highest gear, making the truck feel sluggish at times.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong> The GMC Sierra 3500HD distinguishes itself from its sister truck, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-3500hd/2018/">Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD</a>, with a more luxurious Denali trim that features more standard equipment plus design cues such as a unique large chrome grille.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/yukon/2018/">2018 GMC Yukon</a> gets a 10-speed automatic transmission on Denali models. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a> also gave the 2018 Yukon and Yukon XL minor exterior design tweaks to freshen up the SUV’s looks.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the midsize Acadia, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/yukon/2018/">GMC Yukon</a> is a full-size SUV that can seat up to eight passengers and is available with rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. In addition to the standard model, <strong>a long-wheelbase variant called the Yukon XL is also offered</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Yukon including a 5.3-liter V-8 with 355 hp and 383 lb-ft of torque in the SLE and SLT trims, and a 6.2-liter V-8 with 420 hp and 460 lb-ft in the Denali grade. The 5.3-liter comes paired with a six-speed automatic transmission while the 6.2-liter is coupled to a 10-speed automatic. Towing capacity  for the standard Yukon stands at 8,500 pounds for rear-drive models and 8,200 pounds on four-wheel-drive variants. The long-wheelbase Yukon XL can tow 8,300 pounds in rear-drive guise and 8,000 pounds with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the standard-wheelbase Yukon are 16/23 mpg city/highway for the rear-drive Yukon and 16/22 mpg with four-wheel drive. The more powerful Yukon Denali is rated at 14/23 mpg with rear-wheel drive or 14/22 mpg with four-wheel drive. The Yukon XL gets the same 16/23 mpg for rear-drive models as the standard Yukon, but opting for four-wheel drive drops those numbers  to 15/22 mpg. In the Yukon XL Denali, rear-drive models retain the same 14/23 mpg from the Yukon Denali but four-wheel drive variants are less efficient at 14/21 mpg.</p>

<p>Cargo space in the standard wheelbase Yukon is 15.3 cubic feet behind the third row, 51.7 cubic feet behind the second row and 94.7 cubic feet behind the front seats. The long-wheelbase Yukon XL features more cargo capacity at 39.3 cubic feet behind the third row, 76.7 cubic feet behind the second row, and 121.1 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base Yukon SLE trim includes 18-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, parking sensors, a Bose premium audio system, GMC’s IntelliLink infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, Bluetooth connectivity, tri-zone climate control, and the rear-seat reminder system. Options include power-operated split-folding second- and third-row seats, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, keyless entry/start, navigation, active noise cancellation, Magnetic Ride Control, 4G LTE connectivity, and a programmable power liftgate.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Yukon a four-star overall score (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t crash tested the 2018 Yukon but the 2017 model was given the Basic rating in front crash prevention for the availability of forward collision warning (Superior is the highest possible rating). Other available active safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban/2015/2015-chevrolet-suburban-2015-gmc-yukon-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>, we noted that despite its size, the GMC Yukon, even in XL guise, is easy to drive thanks to its smooth steering, making it easy to maneuver such a large. Material quality in the Yukon, especially the Denali trim, is excellent and the infotainment system is easy to use. However, we noted on a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban/2015/2015-chevrolet-suburban-gmc-yukon-xl-first-test/">2015 First Test</a> that the Yukon’s ride with the available 22-inch alloy wheels is rough even with Magnetic Ride Control, making it feel more truck-like. Additionally, prices of the Yukon and its sister vehicles, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/tahoe/2018/">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> and Suburban can easily skyrocket, putting them in the same bracket as luxury crossovers and SUVs.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 GMC Yukon Denali uses the same 6.2-liter V-8 with The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> Tahoe RST and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/escalade/2018/">Cadillac Escalade</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-1500/2018/">2018 GMC Sierra 1500</a> now comes standard with a rearview camera, a six-speaker audio system, and a 7.0-inch touchscreen. Two new exterior colors, Deep Mahogany Metallic and Red Quartz Tintcoat, have been added. A tire fill alert has been added to the tire pressure monitoring system.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the midsize Canyon and the heavy duty Sierra 2500HD, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-1500/2018/">GMC Sierra 1500</a> is a full-size pickup that’s available in rear- or four-wheel drive configurations. There are three cab styles to choose from and two bed lengths.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>There are four powertrain options on the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a> Sierra 1500 including a mild hybrid. A 4.3-liter V-6 with 285 hp and 305 lb-ft of torque paired to a six-speed automatic transmission is the base engine. Upgrade engines include a 5.3-liter V-8 with 355 hp and 383 lb-ft and a 6.2-liter V-8 rated at 420 hp and 460 lb-ft. The 5.3-liter can be paired to either a six- or eight-speed automatic, and the 6.2-liter comes exclusively with the eight-speed. A mild hybrid that combines the 5.3-liter V-8 with a small electric motor is also available and comes paired only with the eight-speed automatic; however, its power output is the same as the nonhybrid 5.3-liter V-8. The 2018 Sierra 1500 can carry up to 2,250 pounds of payload and, when properly equipped, can top up to 12,500 pounds.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 18/24 mpg city/highway for a rear-drive V-6-powered Sierra 1500 and 17/22 mpg with four-wheel drive. The 5.3-liter V-8 with the eight-speed automatic is rated at 16/23 mpg with rear-wheel drive or 15/20 mpg with four-wheel drive. Opting for the six-speed automatic gets you the same 16/23 mpg for rear-drive models and an improvement to 16/22 mpg for four-wheel-drive models. The 6.2-liter V-8 is the least efficient at 15/21 mpg for rear-drive models and 15/20 with four-wheel drive. Opting for the eAssist model gets you similar gas mileage in rear-drive Sierra 1500s at 18/24 mpg; however, four-wheel drive variants are still less efficient than the V-6 at 16/21 mpg.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base 2018 Sierra 1500 include a six-speaker audio system, a rearview camera, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, Bluetooth connectivity, 17-inch alloy wheels, and 60/40 split-folding bench seats on the double cab and crew cab variants. Higher trim levels come with features such as a large 8.0-inch touchscreen, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, a Bose premium audio system, heated and ventilated front seats, LED headlights, 4G LTE connectivity, Magnetic Ride Control, and alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 GMC Sierra 1500 received a five-star safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the truck received an Average score on the headlights test and a Good score on all crash tests except the small overlap front test where the crew cab variant only received a Marginal score while the double cab model got an Average rating (Good is the highest possible score). The IIHS also gave the 2018 Sierra 1500 a Basic rating for front crash prevention for its available forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating). Standard on the Denali trim and optional on the SLT trim, the Enhanced Driver Alert package bundles together the Driver Alert Seat, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, and Intellibeam headlights.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/sierra-1500/2016/2016-gmc-sierra-denali-1500-4wd-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said that with the available 420-hp 6.2-liter V-8, the Sierra 1500 is one of the quickest pickups we’ve tested, offering strong acceleration even when hauling a trailer. However, despite the Denali trim’s well-built interior, there’s still some missing features that can be found in less expensive vehicles, making its value proposition questionable. Ride comfort, on the other hand, is respectable with the available Magnetic Ride Control suspension, but it’s easily upset by road imperfections.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The optional 6.2-liter V-8 is shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500/2018/">Chevrolet Silverado 1500</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/tahoe/2018/">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> RST, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/escalade/2018/">Cadillac Escalade</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/yukon/2018/">GMC Yukon</a> Denali.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/canyon/2018/">2018 GMC Canyon</a> gets a leather upholstery option on the All-Terrain trim.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/canyon/2018/">GMC Canyon</a> is a midsize truck that’s available in two bed lengths and two cab styles. It slots below the larger, full-size Silverado 1500 and is available in rear- or four-wheel drive configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Canyon SL</strong>: Standard features included on the base trim include a rearview camera, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port, a six-speaker audio system, vinyl upholstery, and a 3.5-inch multi-information display.</p>

<p><strong>Canyon:</strong> The Canyon builds on the base SL trim with 16-inch alloy wheels, a power-operated driver’s seat and projector headlights with LED accents.</p>

<p><strong>Canyon SLE</strong>: Moving to the SLE trim gets you a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, four USB ports, 17-inch alloy wheels, steering wheel controls, an automatic locking differential in four-wheel drive models, 4G LTE connectivity, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, and the EZ Lift and Lower locking tailgate.</p>

<p><strong>Canyon All-Terrain</strong>: The off-road-oriented Canyon All-Terrain adds an off-road-tuned suspension, 17-inch dark alloy wheels, faux carbon fiber interior accents, red contrast stitching on the seats, hill descent control, and a transfer case shield.</p>

<p><strong>Canyon Denali</strong>: As the range-topping trim, the luxury-oriented Canyon Denali adds 20-inch alloy wheels, navigation, a Bose premium audio system, side steps, a heated steering wheel, a wireless charging pad, and ventilated front seats.</p>

<p>Key options such as navigation and the Bose premium audio system are available as options on lower grades of the Canyon.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/">GMC</a> Canyon comes standard with a 2.5-liter I-4 rated at 200 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque. A 3.6-liter V-6 with 308 hp and 275 lb-ft, and a 2.8-liter turbodiesel I-4 with 181 hp and 369 lb-ft is optional. A six-speed manual is standard on the base 2.5-liter I-4 and a six-speed automatic is optional. Diesel-powered Canyons come exclusively with the six-speed automatic while the 3.6-liter V-6 comes with an eight-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the base engine are 20/26 mpg city/highway for rear-drive models and 19/24 mpg with four-wheel drive. Trucks with the V-6 are rated at 18/25 mpg with rear-wheel drive or 17/24 mpg with four-wheel drive. The most efficient models is the diesel-powered Canyon, which is rated at 22/30 mpg for rear-drive trucks and 20/28 mpg with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>The 2018 Canyon received a four-star rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars).  In IIHS testing, the crew cab version received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side front small overlap impact where it hasn’t been tested yet (Good is the highest possible score). Extended-cab models didn’t do as well scoring Good on all crashworthiness tests except for driver’s side front small overlap and side impact tests where it got an Acceptable rating. Both cab variants of the 2018 Canyon received a Poor score on the headlights test. The truck also received a Basic rating since it’s available with forward collision warning (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test). Lane departure warning is available only on certain trim levels.</p>

<p>With the base four-cylinder engine, the 2018 Canyon can tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped. Trucks powered by the V-6 engine are more capable with a tow up to 7,000 pounds of payload. The most capable Canyon is the diesel-powered model, which can tow up to 7,700 pounds in rear-drive configuration or 7,600 pounds with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>Extended-cab models can haul 1,599 pounds of payload in rear-drive configuration or 1,559 pounds with four-wheel drive. Crew cab models with the short bed are rated at 1,605 pounds of payload in rear-drive guise and 1,528 pounds with four-wheel drive. The Canyon crew cab with the long bed has the least maximum payload at 1,555 pounds in rear-drive guise or 1,459 pounds with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/canyon/2017/2017-gmc-canyon-denali-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that the new eight-speed automatic paired to the 308-hp 3.6-liter V-6 offers strong acceleration despite only having a slight bump in output. Denali models offer plenty of creature comforts but lack certain features like a moonroof, push button start, and fully powered front seats. Ride comfort is excellent and for a truck, the Canyon handles reasonably well. However, the eight-speed automatic is reluctant to give downshifts unless you floor it.</p>

<p>Cool Fact<br>
The GMC Canyon’s 3.6-liter V-6 is shared with a number of General Motors products including the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/colorado/2018/">Chevrolet Colorado</a> and Camaro.</br></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018 </strong></p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/clarity/2018/">Honda Clarity</a> Fuel Cell hydrogen car already roaming California highways, the Japanese automaker revealed the all-new <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/honda-clarity-ev-plug-hybrid-debut-new-york/">2018 Honda Clarity Electric and 2018 Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid models</a> at the 2017 New York auto show. Buyers will now have three powertrains choices with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> Clarity sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/clarity/2018/">2018 Honda Clarity</a> Fuel Cell hydrogen car, 2018 Honda Clarity Electric, and 2018 Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid sedans will slot alongside the Fit EV, CR-Z hybrid, and Accord Hybrid in the automaker’s alternative vehicle lineup as well as the gasoline-powered Civic and Accord in its sedan lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Motivation for the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid comes from an electric motor with 181 hp and 232 lb-ft of torque, with power from a 17 kWh battery pack. A 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle I-4 gasoline engine is used primarily to generate electricity to recharge the battery pack, but in some conditions can be used for vehicle motivation. The battery pack can be recharged in 2.5 hours with a 240-volt Level 2 charger. The plug-in model has an expected range of 42 miles on electricity alone and about 330 miles overall with the generator in hybrid mode as well as a 105 mpg-e rating.</p>

<p>The Clarity Plug-in Hybrid features three driving modes including Normal, Econ, and Sport, while the HV mode, which maintains the battery’s state of charge, can be used with any of the three driving modes. Two trims are available including standard and Touring.</p>

<p>The Honda Clarity Electric is powered by a 161-hp, 221 lb-ft electric motor paired with a 25.5 kWh battery pack, which can be charged in a little over three hours via a 240-volt charger or to an 80 percent charge via an SAE Combined Charging System DC fast charger. Honda expects the Clarity Electric to have a 120/102/111 mpg-e city/highway/combined and a total range of just 80 miles. Initially, the Clarity Electric will be available for lease in California and Oregon.</p>

<p>The fuel cell in the regular Honda Clarity Fuel Cell  is said to be 33 percent smaller and 60 percent more power dense than the previous Honda FCX Clarity four-door. The hydrogen fuel cell and integrated powertrain are about the size of a V-6 engine and fits completely under the hood of the car. The Clarity Fuel Cell has an EPA-rated 68 mpg-e combined and a 366-mile range. Currently, the Clarity Fuel Cell is only offered for lease in California.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>All three 2018 Honda Clarity models feature the full suite of Honda Sensing safety and driver assist technologies including Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) with Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) with Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Other safety features include a multi-angle rearview camera as well as array of front and side airbags.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/fit/2018/">2018 Honda Fit</a> gets slightly tweaked front fascia and a new Sport trim that gets a unique body kit, 16-inch alloy wheels with a gloss black finish, bright orange pinstriping, a chrome exhaust tip, and black cloth upholstery with orange contrast stitching. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> also added a new multimedia system with a volume knob as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/fit/2018/">Honda Fit</a> is a front-drive subcompact hatchback that slots under the compact Civic and serves as the automaker’s entry-level vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Honda Fit is powered by a 1.5-liter I-4 with 130 hp and 114 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the standard six-speed manual transmission or 128 hp and 113 lb-ft with the optional CVT. EX-L models come exclusively with the CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings are 29/36 mpg city/highway with the manual, 31/36 mpg with the CVT in Sport, EX, and EX-L trims, and 33/40 mpg with the CVT in the base LX grade. Cargo space with the split-folding rear seats in place is 16.6 cubic feet and 52.7 cubic feet with them folded.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base LX trim include cloth upholstery, a four-speaker audio system, a 5.0-inch screen, Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port, 15-inch steel wheels, keyless entry, and a rearview camera. The Sport trim adds 16-inch black alloy wheels, fog lights, a chrome exhaust tip, a body kit, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a six-speaker audio system, the HondaLink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, and a second USB port. The EX trim adds keyless start, 16-inch machine-finished alloy wheels, and a moonroof. On the range-topping EX-L grade, additional features include leather upholstery, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, and an optional navigation system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Honda Fit a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Fit received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests for which it was tested except a Poor rating on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2018 Fit received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest possible score for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Standard on the EX and EX-L trims and optional on the LX and Sport grades is Honda Sensing, an active safety suite that includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, road departure mitigation, and lane departure warning.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/fit/2018/2018-honda-fit-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>, we said that the addition of a volume knob has made the Fit’s infotainment more user-friendly. The Fit remains great to drive and the suspension deals with road imperfections well despite being on the sportier side. However, even though the 1.5-liter I-4 is one of the more powerful engines in its class, it could still use more torque. The manual transmission is easy to use in traffic and can be had with advanced safety tech.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In order to give the Fit its expansive interior, Honda mounted the fuel tank under the front seats to free up space in the rear.</p>

<p>The three-row <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/pilot/2018/">Honda Pilot</a> did not receive any new changes for the 2018 model year, but expect to see a refresh for the 2019 model year.</p>

<p>The Pilot is the largest and most expansive crossover in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a>’s lineup, positioned above the compact CR-V and subcompact HR-V.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/pilot/2018/">2018 Honda Pilot</a> LX</strong>: The base LX trim comes standard with 18-inch wheels, eight-passenger seating, a 5.0-inch center screen, Bluetooth, two USB port, a 4.2-inch instrument panel driver’s display, a 200-watt seven-speaker audio system, push-start ignition, hill-start assist, cruise control, rearview camera, and manually adjustable front seats.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Honda Pilot EX</strong>: Moving up to the EX trim adds remote engine start, LED daytime running lights, Honda LaneWatch, an 8.0-inch center display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, SiriusXM satellite radio, 10-way power driver’s seat (manual for passenger), heated and power side-view mirrors, a quick entry system, fog lights, tri-zone climate control, rear facing conversation mirror, and three USB ports.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Honda Pilot EX-L</strong>: The well-equipped EX-L trim comes with a power moonroof, a power tailgate, four-way power passenger’s seat, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and one-touch folding second-row seats.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Honda Pilot Touring</strong>: Building off the Pilot EX-L, the Touring trim adds a nine-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters (upgraded from the six-speed automatic), a navigation system, a rear seat entertainment system with a 9.0-inch top-mounted screen, a 540-watt 10-speaker audio system, a fifth USB port in the second-row, front and rear parking sensors, roof rails, automatic reverse-tilting side-view mirrors, blue ambient lighting, courtesy door lights, and Honda Sensing, which includes automatic emergency braking, lane centering assist, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure assist.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Honda Pilot Elite</strong>: The Pilot’s top Elite trim comes standard with all-wheel drive, LED headlights, automatic high beams, a panoramic moonroof, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED map lights, front and second-row illuminated cup holders, heated and ventilated front seats with perforated leather, heated second-row captain’s chairs with perforated leather, front and rear parking sensors with indicators, and HD radio.</p>

<p>The Pilot’s 3.5-liter V-6 produces 280 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 18/26 mpg city/highway with the six-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, or 19/27 mpg with front-wheel drive. With the nine-speed automatic, the Pilot is rated at 20/27 mpg with front-wheel drive and 19/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, a 2016 Honda Pilot AWD with the nine-speed automatic hit 60 mph in a quick 6.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 119 feet.</p>

<p>The Honda Pilot received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA. The Pilot is considered an IIHS 2018 Top Safety Pick for receiving the highest rating of Good in five crash tests, the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the headlights evaluation, and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test for avoiding a 12-mph collision and reducing the speed of a 25-mph collision by 12 mph thanks to the automatic emergency braking system found in the Honda Sensing package. Honda Sensing—available on the EX and standard on the Touring trim—also consists of adaptive cruise control, lane centering assist, and lane departure assist. Blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert and automatic high beams are standard on the Elite trim. Honda LaneWatch (standard on EX, EX-L, and Touring, but not available on LX or Elite) activates a camera viewing the lane to the right of the Pilot when the right blinker is activated. Front and rear parking sensors become standard on the Touring trim.</p>

<p>The 2018 Honda Pilot can carry up to 16.5 cubic feet of cargo behind the third-row, 46.8 with the third-row folded down, and 83.9 cubic feet with the second and third rows folded down. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/explorer/2018/">Ford Explorer</a> has more behind the third row with 21.0 cubic feet, but less behind the second row with 43.9 cubic feet and 81.7 behind the front seats. First, second, and third-row legroom in the Pilot is 40.9 inches, 38.4 inches, and 31.9 inches, respectively.</p>

<p>The Pilot LX’s standard 5.0-inch center screen is upgraded to the 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and SiriusXM satellite radio in the EX trim. The Touring trim adds a navigation system, a rear seat entertainment system, a fifth USB port, and a 115-volt outlet to power your devices. The standard 200-watt audio system is upgraded to a 225-watt on in the EX trim and a 10-speaker, 540-watt system in the Touring trim. A 4.2-inch instrument panel driver’s display is standard on all trims.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/pilot/2016/2016-honda-pilot-elite-awd-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Honda Pilot Elite, we were very impressed with the crossover’s quick acceleration and comfortable ride. The optional one-touch second-row seats make getting into the decently sized third row easy. The all-wheel-drive system provides good off-road traction but the nine-speed automatic transmission was “a bit clunky at times” on the road and we questioned why the Pilot still had a manual pedal parking brake instead of an electric one. We liked the available Honda Sensing package of driver assist safety features, the 8.0-inch center touchscreen on almost every trim, and the digital speedometer located at the top of the instrument cluster. We concluded our review by saying, “Although the 2016 Pilot is more attractive than the boxy previous generation crossovers, it reminded more than one driver of a minivan from inside—not a good connection for a minivan alternative. If you don’t mind the low-speed behavior of the nine-speed auto on Touring and Elite models, however, the Honda merits a top spot on your shopping list.”</p>

<p>After 15 months in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/pilot/2016/2016-honda-pilot-elite-review-verdict/">long-term 2016 Honda Pilot</a>, we appreciated the three-row crossover’s interior that took a beating after 38,528 miles but wished it had a volume knob (Honda is starting to bring back the volume knob to its lineup). Besides a transmission replacement that was covered under warranty, the Pilot suffered no additional mechanical defects and had average maintenance costs. One thing that really impressed us was the Pilot’s traction in a bad mountain winter storm. The Honda traversed snow and ice-covered roads with confidence while on factory tires without chains.</p>

<p>Our biggest issue with the Pilot remained the nine-speed automatic found on the top two trims: “It’s great for cruising on the highway, but the nine-speed lacks smoothness for stop-and-go in-town driving. It can be especially maddening in driving conditions when the throttle needs constant modulation, with jerkiness and hesitation between upshifts and downshifts.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>For the 2018 model year, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/ridgeline/2018/">Honda Ridgeline</a> now only has nine trim levels, down from 12 in 2017. Also, the Sport trim is now available with two new exterior colors: White Diamond Pearl and Lunar Silver Metallic.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/ridgeline/2018/">2018 Honda Ridgeline</a> is a midsize pickup truck that’s available in front- or all-wheel drive configurations. Unlike other midsize trucks, the Ridgeline features a unibody, and not body-on-frame construction.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> Ridgeline is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 280 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque. With the Ridgeline’s six-speed automatic transmission EPA fuel economy ratings are 19/26 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 18/25 mpg with all-wheel drive. When properly equipped, the front-drive Ridgeline can tow up to 3,500 pounds and the all-wheel drive model can tow up to 5,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base RT trim include the in-bed trunk, the Dual-Action tailgate, keyless start, cloth upholstery, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, a 5.0-inch screen, Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port, 18-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, and a 4.2-inch multi-information display in the instrument cluster. Higher trims can be had with keyless entry, LED headlights, a 540-watt audio system, leather upholstery, heated front seats, power-adjustable front seats, the HondaLink infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, three additional USB ports, an in-bed audio system, and interior ambient lighting.</p>

<p>A Black Edition sits at the top of the 2018 Ridgeline lineup, including all the features of the RTL-E trim, but adding black exterior and interior accents (including black leather and black wheels), as well as red ambient lighting.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Ridgeline a five-star overall rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 Ridgeline but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Ridgeline received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in the 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest possible rating in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Honda Ridgeline received the Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Standard on the RTL-E and Black Edition models is Honda Sensing, a suite of active safety features that includes adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, road departure mitigation, and blind-spot warning.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/ridgeline/2017/honda-ridgeline-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that even though the Ridgeline rides on a car-based platform, its handling benefits is minimal compared to body-on-frame competitors such as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/colorado/2018/">Chevrolet Colorado</a>. The truck’s towing capabilities are also less than rivals but it easily hauls its rated capacity. Ride comfort is where the Ridgeline excels. Thanks to its car-based chassis, the Ridgeline doesn’t wander around on the highway and rarely gets jittery. The truck is also less prone to lean into corners. However, the V-6 engine needs more revs to get moving and there’s no manual shift mode function.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The in-bed trunk in the Honda Ridgeline can be turned into a cooler thanks to a drain plug built into its bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2018/">2018 Honda Civic</a> is unchanged. The performance-minded Civic Si and Civic Type R were late additions to the 2017 model year lineup and carry over with the rest of the lineup unchanged.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2018/">Honda Civic</a> is a front-drive compact car that slots below the larger Accord and above the subcompact Fit. Three body styles are offered, coupe, hatchback, and sedan. In addition to the standard models, two performance-oriented variants are available the Civic Si, which is available as a sedan or coupe, and the Civic Type R, which is offered only as a hatchback.</p>

<p><strong>Civic LX:</strong> The base LX trim comes with automatic headlights, cruise control, a 160-watt audio system with four speakers, a 5.0-inch screen, Bluetooth, a USB port, 16-inch steel wheels with covers, cloth upholstery, and a rearview camera. Hatchback variants get the 1.5-liter turbo-four as standard.</p>

<p><strong>Civic Sport:</strong> Available only on the hatchback, the Civic Sport gets a unique exhaust system, 18-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, and underbody spoilers to give it a more aggressive look in addition to the same standard features as the LX trim.</p>

<p><strong>Civic EX:</strong> Moving up to the EX trim adds <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a>’s Lane Watch system, 16-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/start, a second USB port, a 180-watt audio system with eight speakers, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, remote start, a moonroof, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.</p>

<p><strong>Civic EX-T:</strong> The EX-T trim adds 17-inch alloy wheels, the 1.5-liter turbo-four, fog lights, a rear spoiler, dual-zone climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and heated front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Civic Si:</strong> Available as a single trim, the Civic Si comes with the same features as the EX-T trim plus sport seats with fixed headrests, a Sport mode, 18-inch alloy wheels, a sportier suspension setup, a more powerful 1.5-liter turbo-four, a limited-slip differential, and adjustable dampers.</p>

<p><strong>Civic EX-L:</strong> Jumping to the EX-L gets you leather upholstery, eight-way power adjustable front seats, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>

<p><strong>Civic Touring:</strong> Range-topping Touring Models get you full LED headlights, heated outboard rear seats on the sedan, navigation, a four-way power adjustable front passenger seat, a 450-watt premium audio system with 10 speakers, and the Honda Sensing suite of active safety tech that’s an option on other trims.</p>

<p><strong>Civic Sport Touring:</strong> Another trim available only on the hatchback, the Sport Touring is the range-topper of the Civic hatchback and comes with the same cosmetic changes as the Sport trim but with the creature comforts of the sedan and coupe’s Touring trim. It also gets a 540-watt premium audio system with 12 speakers instead of the 450-watt unit found in the sedan and coupe.</p>

<p><strong>Civic Type R</strong>: The highest-performing Civic model comes with 20-inch alloy wheels, adjustable dampers, a performance-tuned suspension, high performance front bucket seats, a limited-slip differential and a fully functional aero kit complete with a large rear wing. Unlike the Civic Si, which is based on the EX-T trim, the Civic Type R is based on the Touring trim but doesn’t include the Honda Sensing suite.</p>

<p>The 2018 Honda Civic is available with three engine choices. A 2.0-liter I-4 with 158 hp and 138 lb-ft of torque paired to a six-speed manual or CVT is standard on the coupe and sedan. A 1.5-liter turbo-four with 174 hp and 167 lb-ft (manual) or 162 lb-ft (CVT) is optional on the coupe and sedan, and standard on the hatchback.</p>

<p>The Sport trim on the hatchback features the same 1.5-liter turbo-four but it’s rated at 180 hp and 177 lb-ft with the six-speed manual. With the optional CVT, the engine retains its 162 lb-ft. In the Civic Si, the same 1.5-liter turbo-four is rated at 205 hp and 192 lb-ft. The most powerful model is the Civic Type R, which uses a 2.0-liter turbo-four good for 306 hp and 295 lb-ft. A six-speed manual is the only transmission available on the Civic Si and Civic Type R.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the sedan with the 2.0-liter I-4 are 28/40 mpg city/highway with the manual and 31/40 mpg with the CVT. Opt for the optional 1.5-liter turbo-four and you’ll get even better fuel economy at 31/42 mpg with the manual or 32/42 mpg with the CVT. The coupe is less efficient, with the 2.0-liter at 28/39 mpg with the manual or 30/39 mpg with the CVT. With the 1.5-liter turbo-four the coupe is rated at 30/41 mpg with the manual or 31/40 mpg with the CVT.</p>

<p>The Civic hatchback is rated at 29/38 mpg with the manual or 31/40 mpg with the CVT. Sport and Sport Touring models are less efficient with the CVT at 30/36 mpg. For a performance-oriented model, the Civic Si is surprisingly fuel efficient at 28/38 mpg. The Civic Type R, on the other hand, is the least efficient model at 22/28 mpg.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Civic a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS evaluations, the 2018 Civic received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the new headlights test where it got a Poor rating (Good is the highest possible score). Coupe and hatchback models haven’t been tested for the new passenger side front small overlap impact as of this writing. In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Civic avoided a 12-mph and a 25-mph collision, allowing it to receive a Superior rating (Superior is the highest score in the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Honda Sensing is standard on the Touring and Sport Touring trims and available on all but the Sport, Si and Type R models. That package bundles together adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and road departure mitigation. Instead of blind-spot monitoring, the Civic features Honda’s Lane Watch system, which utilizes a camera on the right side mirror to show your right side blind spot on the main touchscreen.</p>

<p>The Civic sedan has 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space on all but Touring and Si trims, which has less at 14.7 cubic feet. Coupe models have less trunk space at 12.1 cubic feet for the LX trim or 11.9 cubic feet on the EX-T, EX-L, Touring, and Si grades. For more cargo space, the Civic hatchback has 25.7 cubic feet behind the split-folding second row and 46.2 cubic feet behind the front seats. Sport and Sport Touring models have less cargo space with the rear seats in place at 22.6 cubic feet.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2016/2016-2017-big-test-compact-sedans/">2016 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/elantra/2018/">Hyundai Elantra</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/2018/">Chevrolet Cruze</a>, Mazda3, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2018/">Toyota Corolla</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2018/">Volkswagen Jetta</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/sentra/2018/">Nissan Sentra</a>, the Honda Civic won because of its combination efficiency, safety, and performance. The interior packaging is also impressive, with its reconfigurable center console storage area and generous passenger space. However, the infotainment system lacks a volume knob and can be finicky to use.</p>

<p>The Civic hatchback takes things up a notch and offers better handling than the coupe and sedan, making it plenty of fun to drive. It offers even more interior space than the Civic coupe and sedan, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2017/2017-honda-civic-hatchback-sport-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>. We found the Civic hatchback’s cargo cover to be a highlight because you can stow it on the side without having to take it out of the car.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2017/2017-honda-civic-si-sedan-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> of the first turbocharged Civic Si, we were surprised that the car wasn’t quicker than its naturally aspirated predecessors, but its braking performance was better. The new Civic Si retains the model’s expected excellent handling, especially with the optional summer performance tires, without sacrificing much in terms of ride quality. However, because it shares powertrain bits from the regular Civic, the Civic Si no longer feels special like its predecessors were with their high-revving engines.</p>

<p>The highlight of the 10<sup>th</sup>-generation Civic lineup is the 306-hp Civic Type R, which offers a slick shifter and exceptional performance that belies the fact that it’s front-wheel drive. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2017/2017-honda-civic-type-r-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the way the Civic Type R balances its excellent handling with comfort and daily drivability, despite what its aggressive looks might convey.</p>

<p>The Civic hatchback, including the Type R model, is built in Honda’s Swindon plant in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2018/">Honda CR-V</a> did not receive any significant changes for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The CR-V is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a>’s compact crossover, slotting above the subcompact HR-V and below the three-row Pilot in size and price. The CR-V has a higher starting price than the Accord sedan and Civic hatchback.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base LX model for the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2018/">2018 Honda CR-V</a> is powered by a 2.4-liter I-4 engine that produces 184 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque and is rated at an EPA-estimated 26/32 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 25/31 mpg with all-wheel drive. The CR-V EX, EX-L, and Touring trims come standard with a 190-hp, 179-lb-ft of torque 1.5-liter turbocharged I-4 engine that delivers 28/34 mpg with front-wheel drive and 27/33 with all-wheel drive. Both engines are backed by a CVT. In <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>Motor Trend</em></span> testing, the 2017 Honda CR-V AWD Touring hit 60 mph in a respectable 7.5 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 115 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 CR-V comes standard with 17-inch wheels, automatic climate control, a 5.0-inch LCD center display screen with Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, one USB charging port, a multi-information drivers display, and a six-way manual adjustable driver’s seat. The EX model adds a power moonroof, fog lights, push-button start, heated front seats, and a 7.0-inch center display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The EX-L includes a 12-way power driver’s seat, four-way power passenger’s seat, leather upholstery and an automatic dimming rearview mirror. The top Touring model comes standard with 18-inch alloy wheels, a hands-free power liftgate with programmable height, LED headlights with auto on/off, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and a 330-watt premium audio system. If you’re seeking bolder styling, opt for the available body side moldings and 19-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Honda CR-V received the highest overall safety rating from the NHTSA of five stars, and the crossover is considered an IIHS 2017 Top Safety Pick+. The highest award of Top Safety Pick+ was issued because the CR-V scored the highest rating of Good in all five crash test evaluations, the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention, and scored the second highest rating of Acceptable for the headlights evaluation. The Superior rating for front crash prevention was issued because the CR-V properly warned the driver of a possible collision and avoided frontal collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests thanks to the optional Collision Mitigation Braking System found in the Honda Sensing package that is standard on the EX trim and above. The Honda Sensing package also includes Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Road Departure Mitigation System, Lane Keeping Assist System, and adaptive cruise control with Low-Speed Follow. Other safety features include the standard multi-angle rearview camera system, automatic high beams, rain-sensing windshield wipers, rear parking sensors, and blind-spot monitoring with Cross Traffic Monitor.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2017/2017-honda-cr-v-touring-awd-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Honda CR-V, we liked the crossover’s quick acceleration for the segment, the responsive and smooth automatic transmission, and plentiful rear seat room. The CR-V provides more cargo room than most in its class and has easy-folding second-row seats. We like the modern design of the CR-V but wished the center screen was a little larger and was canted toward the driver. We also wished the CR-V had better outward visibility; this made us appreciate the Honda Sensing package of driver assist safety features even more. “It’s not that the CR-V does everything well, but just like its predecessor, it’s good or <em>soooo</em> good at so many important things that it’s difficult not to appreciate the Honda. Does the CR-V have a chance at claiming the SUV of the Year title? It surely has a chance and, in the meantime, the crossover is ready to do showroom battle as it likely becomes Honda’s best-selling vehicle.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2017/2017-honda-cr-v-vs-2017-mazda-cx-5-comparison-review/">two-way comparison</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2018/">Mazda CX-5</a>, we loved just about everything the CR-V offered except the excessive wind and tire noise, a slightly frustrating user interface, and a less premium interior versus the CX-5. We concluded the comparison by saying: “Yes, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/">Mazda</a> CX-5 is prettier, more luxurious, and a little more fun to drive, but the Honda CR-V is just damn good. If you want to be coldly rational, the CR-V has more space, gets better fuel economy, has more-advanced technology, and is cheaper to own. It’s also very good to drive. In the past, we lead-footed sports car lovers might have excused the Mazda’s deficiencies in exchange for its lusty driving experience. But this time, we have no hesitation in recommending the CR-V to enthusiasts as well as our automotively apathetic friends and family. It’s a narrow margin of victory, but whether your other car is a Camaro or a Corolla, if you want a compact crossover, you’ll be slightly better served by the new Honda CR-V.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The large three-row <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/pilot/2018/">Honda Pilot</a> offers up to 83.9 cubic feet of cargo space, which is not too much more than the CR-V’s impressive 75.8 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The subcompact <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/hr-v/2018/">Honda HR-V</a> is the automaker’s entry-level crossover and slots below the compact CR-V and full-size three-row Pilot SUV. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> also sells the three-row Odyssey minivan and four-door Ridgeline pickup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Because the HR-V arrived for the 2015 model year, the small crossover might be refreshed for the 2018 or 2019 model year, with available active safety tech on higher trims and a mild facelift. We’ll update this space as soon as we have official info.</p>

<p>Power for the current, 2017 HR-V comes from a 1.8-liter I-4 rated at 121 hp and 127 lb-ft of torque. The engine is backed by either a six-speed manual in front-drive form or a CVT in front- or all-wheel-drive. Three trims are available including LX, EX, and EX-L-Navi. The top-spec model includes leather seating, navigation, and paddle shifters standard.</p>

<p>Standard active safety tech includes multi-angle rearview camera, Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) with traction control, Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and daytime running lights. Honda LaneWatch, a rear-facing camera mounted on the passenger side-view mirror, is included on EX and EX-L-Navi.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord/2018/">2018 Honda Accord</a> is all-new and rides on a new platform with new turbocharged engines and features an updated infotainment system that has volume and tuning knobs. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> has discontinued the Accord’s coupe body style, leaving only the sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord/2018/">Honda Accord</a> is a front-drive midsize sedan slotting above the compact Civic. In addition to the 1.5T and 2.0T gas-powered models, there’s also a hybrid variant.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Honda Accord is available with two turbocharged four-cylinder engines including a 1.5-liter with 192 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque. The non-hybrid upgrade engine is a 2.0-liter unit with 252 hp and 273 lb-ft. A six-speed manual is available on the Sport trims for both engines. Automatic transmission options include a CVT for the 1.5-liter unit or a 10-speed unit for the more powerful 2.0-liter. The Accord Hybrid returns with an updated version of Honda’s two-motor hybrid system that couples a 2.0-liter I-4 to two electric motors and a lithium-ion battery for a total output of 212 hp. Unlike some of its competitors, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord-hybrid/2018/">Honda Accord Hybrid</a> doesn’t utilize a conventional transmission.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 30/38 mpg city/highway for the CVT-equipped 1.5-liter in all trims except Sport and Touring, which get 29/35 mpg Go for the manual transmission on the 1.5T and the ratings are 26/35 mpg. Fuel economy ratings with the both variants of the 2.0-liter and the hybrid haven’t been released yet. Trunk space on all variants is 16.7 cubic feet even in the Accord Hybrid, which now has its batteries placed under the rear seats.</p>

<p>The base Accord LX trim comes with, a rearview camera, LED low-beam headlights, cloth upholstery, 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth connectivity, a 7.0-inch screen, and a USB port. Moving up to the Accord EX trim adds a moonroof, remote start, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, heated front seats, an eight-speaker audio system, and keyless entry/start. Accord Sport models get 19-inch alloy-wheels, paddle shifters on CVT-equipped 1.5-liter turbo-four variants, unique exhausts, aluminum pedals, a rear spoiler, LED fog lights, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>

<p>Moving up to the Accord EX-L trim adds a power operated passenger seat, a 10-speaker audio system, memory function for the driver’s seat, a leather-wrapped shift knob, leather upholstery, and an optional navigation system. The range-topping Accord Touring grade adds 19-inch alloy wheels, a head-up display, adaptive dampers, full LED headlights, ventilated and heated front seats, wireless charging, heated rear seats, and parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Honda Accord. Standard on all models is the Honda Sensing active safety suite that includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, road departure mitigation, traffic sign recognition, and adaptive cruise control. A driver attention monitor, blind-spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert are also available on certain trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord/2018/2018-honda-accord-15t-vs-2018-toyota-camry-25-comparison-review/">2018 comparison test</a> against the new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/">Toyota Camry</a>, the 1.5-liter-equipped Accord handily won because of its sophisticated interior design, spacious interior, intuitive multimedia system, and superior powertrain. Although it needs slightly more throttle input than the Camry’s 2.5-liter I-4, the Accord’s turbocharged 1.5-liter accelerates in a more linear fashion and the CVT operates seamlessly without much droning. The Accord’s chassis is more responsive, giving it better cornering capabilities and minimal body roll. However, there’s excessive tire noise in the Accord and on less-than-perfect roads, it jostles around more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord/2018/2018-honda-accord-15t-vs-2018-toyota-camry-25-comparison-review/">2018 First Test</a>, we noted that when the midsize sedan is equipped with the optional 2.0-liter turbo-four, the Accord offers strong acceleration, making it slightly quicker than its V-6-powered predecessor. The optional manual transmission, however, lacks the precision found in more sporting Hondas like the Civic Si and Type R. We were impressed with the Touring model, which comes with adaptive dampers and features excellent handling and responsiveness. Road noise, on the other hand, continues to be an issue in the Accord. The interior is a class above with high-quality materials everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Honda Accord’s optional 2.0-liter turbo-four is closely related to the 306-hp unit found in the high-performance Civic Type R.</p>

<p>The 2018 Tucson’s base engine is a 164-hp, 151-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter I-4 that delivers an EPA-rated 23/30 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 21/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. The upgraded 1.6-liter turbocharged I-4 engine produces 175 hp and 195-lb-ft of and is rated at 25/30 mpg with FWD and 24/28 mpg with AWD. The 2.0-liter is backed by a six-speed automatic transmission and the 1.6-liter turbo-four gets paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the Tucson Limited with AWD hit 60 mph in a respectable 7.9 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 120 feet.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/tucson/2018/">2018 Hyundai Tucson</a> received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA. The Tucson is also considered a 2018 Top Safety Pick from the IIHS because the crossover received the highest rating of Good in all six crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test for avoiding both a 12- and 25-mph frontal collision thanks to the optional automatic emergency braking system found in the Ultimate package for the Limited model. Blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert and keep assist are standard on the SEL Plus, Value, and Limited trims and the aforementioned Ultimate package also consists of lane departure warning.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/tucson/2018/">Hyundai Tucson</a> can hold up to 31.0 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 61.9 with the rear seats folded down.

The Remote package uses an app that can remote start your car (and adjust climate control), lock/unlock doors, honk the horn, find your vehicle in a parking lot, and several other services.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2016/small-crossover-comparison-big-test/">Big Test comparison</a> among nine compact crossovers, the Tucson Limited AWD fared well and earned third place. Keeping it from first place was the powertrain’s slow throttle response, the high price tag, a small backseat, and a somewhat harsh ride. We said, “Our first podium finisher is the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Tucson. We all liked its upscale cabin, its around-town road manners, and its solid safety scores, but all that doesn’t quite justify the high Tucson’s high price.” “With a little refinement in that powertrain, we’d have had a much harder time picking our top two.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/tucson/2016/2016-hyundai-tucson-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the base SE trim and the top Limited trim, we liked the acceleration of the Limited model but not the slow acceleration of the base model with the 2.0-liter engine. Both engines have the same slow throttle response issue. The crossover offers a stiff ride but handles corners well. Inside, the Limited “is nicely appointed with a laundry list of standard features. Its 8-inch BlueLink information and entertainment screen is intuitive and responsive with crisp graphics. The materials are good quality, and the vehicle feels worthy of its price tag.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, “the SE, on the other hand, feels like the cheapest SUV option at the rental counter. All of the fancier safety features are options, just like the conveniences. The monotone coloring, cheap-feeling materials, and dearth of features were disappointments. The rough plastic steering wheel drew considerable rebuke.” Regardless, both vehicles are quiet inside, comfortable, and have good visibility. We concluded by saying, “The new Tucson offers a nice upgrade with more space and some of the best styling in the class from the outgoing model. Should you be willing to pay for it, you can add more features than most competitors while maintaining class-competitive fuel economy and performance. In terms of how it drives, we find the new Tucson to be average, but if that matters less to you than features and style, you’ll find plenty to like.”</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The Accent enters its fifth generation with the redesigned 2018 model that rides on a new platform and features new styling inside and out, new technology, and new driver assist safety features. The hatchback body style has been dropped.</p>

<p>The Accent is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/">Hyundai</a>’s smallest sedan, slotting below the larger and more expensive Elantra, Sonata, and Azera sedans.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Accent SE</strong>: The Accent’s base SE trim is equipped with a 5.0-inch color touchscreen, Bluetooth, a USB port, a rearview camera, power side view mirrors, remote keyless entry, six-way adjustable driver’s seat, and 15-inch steel wheels.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Accent SEL</strong>: The SEL trim adds a 7.0-inch center touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, SiriusXM satellite radio, automatic headlights, heated side view mirrors, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, two USB ports, Bluetooth voice recognition, and 15-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Accent Limited</strong>: The range-topping Limited trim adds lots of features including 17-inch alloy wheels, emergency automatic braking, push-start ignition, heated front seats, power sunroof, LED daytime running lights, fog lights, a chrome grille, automatic climate control, a 3.5-inch instrument panel driver’s display, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Blue Link Connected services, and an automatic hands-free trunk that opens by simply standing behind the car with the key fob.</p>

<p>The front- drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/accent/2018/">2018 Hyundai Accent</a> is powered by a 1.6-liter I-4 that produces 130 hp and 119 lb-ft of torque and comes paired to a six-speed manual transmission (EPA rated 28/37 mpg) or a six-speed automatic transmission (28/38 mpg).</p>

<p>The Accent offers automatic emergency braking that comes standard on the Limited trim. Hill-start assist is optional and a rearview camera with guidelines is standard.</p>

<p>The 2018 Accent carries up to 13.7 cubic feet of cargo room in the trunk and offers 42.1 inches of legroom for front passengers and 33.5 inches for rear passengers.</p>

<p>The Accent comes standard with a 5.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth calling and a USB port. The available 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth voice recognition and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard on the SEL trim. Blue Link Connected services allows owners to remotely control their car (start, lock/unlock, honk the horn) from their smartphone and is standard on the Limited trim for three years.</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/accent/2018/2018-hyundai-accent-first-drive-review/">First Drive</a> review of the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/accent/2018/">Hyundai Accent</a>, we felt the power was adequate and the transmission shifted well. Handling was well-controlled and ride comfort was good but unsettled over rough pavement. The front seats are comfortable and interior quality is good but there are a lot of hard plastics and road and tire noise can get loud. We concluded by saying, “With a generous list of standard features on each trim, the 2018 Hyundai Accent proves that buying a subcompact car doesn’t mean you’ll be driving something extremely basic. Sure, there’s still some road and tire noise, but it’s better than the old car and quieter than rivals such as the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a>, <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a>, and <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a>. The car’s exterior is stylish, and its driving dynamics have improved. With all of the improvements made to the new car as well as its long warranty, the 2018 Accent might just win over buyers who would otherwise only consider a used vehicle.”</p>

The optional 2.0-liter turbo-four engine pumps out 240 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 20/28 mpg with FWD and 19/26 mpg with AWD. With the 2.0-liter turbo-four equipped in the range-topping Ultimate trim, fuel economy slightly drops to 20/27 mpg with FWD and 19/24 mpg with AWD. All models are backed by a six-speed automatic transmission. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Santa Fe Sport (2.4-liter with FWD) hit 60 mph in 8.3 seconds and the 2.0T Ultimate AWD did it in 8.4 seconds.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe/2018/">2018 Hyundai Santa Fe</a> Sport received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA. The 2018 Santa Fe Sport is considered a 2018 Top Safety Pick+ because the crossover received the highest score of Good in five crash tests and the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the new passenger-side small overlap front crash test. The highest designation was also received because the Santa Fe Sport received the highest rating of Good for the headlights test and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test by avoiding a 12- and 25-mph frontal collision thanks to the automatic emergency braking system found in the optional Tech package. The Tech package of driver assist safety features is only offered on the Ultimate trim (the base trim offers a different Tech package) and consists of adaptive cruise control with stop/go, lane departure warning, electronic parking brake, high-beam assist, and steering-responsive headlights.

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe-sport/2018/2018-hyundai-santa-fe-sport-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe-sport/2018/">2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</a> base FWD model and AWD Ultimate model, we preferred the 2.0-liter turbo-four engine over the naturally aspirated 2.4-liter (even though the 2.4-liter in the base model was slightly quicker), “Of the two variants, the all-wheel drive with the 2.0-liter turbo was by far the better to drive. The rear wheel traction helped to keep the car steadier on the entry into corners and pushed it out on the exits, keeping the safety nannies from intervening.”</p>

<p>The AWD system did a good job off-road but the FWD model, of course, struggled off-road. The interior received a lot of praise, “For a base model, the Santa Fe is surprisingly nice to look at. I like the color and the interplay of different materials and textures in the interior. The materials are obviously less expensive, and the light brown parts look pretty cheap, but at the price point, it’s not bad.”</p>

<p>We concluded by saying, “All in all, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe-sport/2018/">Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</a> is a great car for its value. Whether it’s a $26,000 model or a more-equipped trim, the Santa Fe Sport does its job fine. We’d still like to see a better suspension and a more powerful drivetrain that brings more emotion to the driver.”</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/hyundai-santa-fe-sport-2018-suv-of-the-year-contender/">2018 <em>Motor Trend </em>SUV of the Year testing</a>, the Santa Fe Sport did not become a finalist but we liked the interior of the base model and preferred the 2.0-liter turbo-four equipped model for its better driving dynamics. Although, the Santa Fe Sport got dinged for its ride that felt “both floaty and flinty” and for excessive NVH. “It’s a thoughtfully designed, well-executed SUV that lacks excitement. It’s anonymous and anodyne but strong on value.” Although it serves its purpose well, it’s not good enough to be SUV of the Year,” we concluded.</p>

However, we didn’t care for the slow throttle response, slow steering, and unpleasant ride over road imperfections. Rear seat room is good and the rear seats have their own A/C control and vents. The interior offers lots of luxury but is showing its age. As for fun driving dynamics, “buyers might want to look at the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/durango/2018/">Dodge Durango</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/explorer/2018/">Ford Explorer</a> EcoBoost, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2018/">Mazda CX-9</a>.” We concluded by saying, “For features and value, the Santa Fe is a pretty good bet. Some competitors offer a rear seat entertainment system but the Santa Fe hits all the most important notes and more.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/kona/2018/2018-hyundai-kona-quick-drive-review/">2018 Quick Drive</a> we said that the Kona’s steering was on the heavy side while the suspension did a good job dealing with uneven surfaces. The optional 1.6-liter turbo-four offers plenty of power thanks to its wide powerband.</p>

<p>The optional 175-hp 1.6-liter turbo-four in the 2018 Kona is shared with the larger Tucson.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A new variant, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/ioniq/2018/">Hyundai Ioniq</a> Pug-In, joins the electrified lineup for the new model year. The Ioniq Electric and Hybrid are carryover models. Paddle shifters are now standard on the plug-in model and available on the hybrid Lane Departure Warning adds the Lane Keep Assist function.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Ioniq is a hatchback that offers a traditional hybrid, plug-in electric hybrid, and battery electric variants.</strong> The hybrid model is the most affordable of the three, with a starting price similar to the midsize Sonata sedan and compact Tucson crossover.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/ioniq/2018/">2018 Hyundai Ioniq</a> Hybrid is powered by a 1.6-liter I-4 paired to a 32kW electric motor for a total system output of 139 hp and delivers an impressive EPA-rated 57/59 mpg city/highway for the base Blue model and 55/54 mpg for the rest of the lineup (2017 figures). The Ioniq Plug-In uses the same 1.6-liter engine but paired to a larger 45kW electric motor with an estimated total output of 156 hp. The EPA has yet to rate the plug-in model. The hybrid and plug-in models send power to the front wheels through a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A 118-hp, 215-lb-ft of torque 88kW electric motor powers the Ioniq Electric and comes with an EPA-rated driving range of 124 miles. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the Ioniq Hybrid hit 60 mph in 9.4 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 124 feet, expected numbers from a hybrid vehicle.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The range-topping Hyundai Ioniq Limited comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, power moonroof, heated front leather seats, HID headlights with LED accents, LED interior illumination, LED taillights, a 7.0-inch center touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 7.0-inch driver’s display screen, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and Blue Link Telematics, Connected Care, and Remote Charge Access. The Ioniq Electric Limited comes standard with heated leather front seats, a powered driver’s seat, LED headlights, 16-inch eco-spoke wheels, 7.0-inch center touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 7.0-inch driver’s display screen, power-folding side mirrors with puddle lamps, rear seat air vents, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and Blue Link Telematics, Connected, Remote Package, and Remote Charge Access.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>All of the driver assist safety features for the Ioniq lineup are included in the Ultimate package for the Limited trim and include automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, headlights with Dynamic Bending Light (HIDs on the Electric model), and rear parking sensors. If you don’t get the Limited trim, the Tech package for the SEL trim includes automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control. The SEL trim on the Hybrid model comes standard with blind-spot warning and rear-cross traffic alert as does the Limited trim on the Electric model.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>After a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/ioniq/2017/2017-hyundai-ioniq-hybrid-and-ev-first-test-review/">First Test</a> review of the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid and Electric, we liked the amazing fuel economy of the Ioniq Hybrid (the best in the market), but we weren’t sure about the short 124-mile driving range of the Electric model. We also felt that the interior and exterior designs were very conservative. We concluded by noting that “Hyundai is obviously playing it safe with the Ioniq’s styling—a good or bad thing, depending on how your eyes react to the Prius. … Dimensionally it’s Prius-like, too. It’s 2.7 inches shorter and 2.4 inches wider and has a bit more passenger and cargo space. And most obviously, it’s clearly hell-bent on beating the Prius’s mileage numbers—to such a degree that the racket from the Ioniq’s low rolling resistance tires was a noticeable issue. But unlike the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> Insight, which was blind-focused on a strategy of being not quite a Prius at not quite the cost, Hyundai is asking us to see the Ioniq as a very good car that just happens to be a deal, delivers ridiculous mileage, and is fun to drive. If you compare it to a Prius, well, that’s good, too.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2017/hyundai-ioniq-hybrid-vs-toyota-prius-chevrolet-volt-vs-prius-prime-bolt-ev-vs-ioniq-ev-vs-honda-clarity-vs-mirai/">2017 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid and 2016 Toyota Prius comparison</a>, the Prius was the victor: “Since the fourth-generation Prius transitioned to <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s dynamic new TNGA platform, it doesn’t really drive ‘like a Prius’ anymore. But Toyota doubled down on a design personality that—even if you hate it—will never bore you. Hyundai’s rookie effort has had a good first round against the champ, but it hasn’t landed enough blows yet for a dethroning. Our pick? Still the Prius.”</p>

<p>When we compared the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2017/hyundai-ioniq-hybrid-vs-toyota-prius-chevrolet-volt-vs-prius-prime-bolt-ev-vs-ioniq-ev-vs-honda-clarity-vs-mirai/">2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV and the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Electric</a>, the Bolt EV won: “The Bolt EV’s advantages go beyond range, though. Unlike the Volt, our 2017 Car of the Year is brilliantly packaged. With the battery mostly beneath the floor, there’s space in spades for people and cargo, and the slightly elevated seat heights are great for outward vision in our SUV-infested world. The low center of gravity gives it planted handling. (Unlike its hybrid version, the Ioniq’s aft-battery and simpler twist-beam rear suspension impart an occasional tail wiggle.)”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Hyundai claims that the Ioniq Plug-In can run on all-electric power for up to 27 miles and has a total driving range of more than 650 miles.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The new Elantra GT hatchback joins the lineup for 2018 and a new SEL trim replaces the former SE with Popular Equipment trim. The Limited trim adds gloss black interior accents and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with Blue Link and HomeLink. The Sport trim receives a power sunroof and blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert and all trims receive a new exterior color, Machine Gray.</p>

The 1.6-liter turbo-four in the Sport model is rated at 22/30 mpg with the six-speed manual and 26/33 mpg with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in the sedan. When equipped in the Elantra GT Sport, that engine delivers 22/29 mpg with the manual and 26/32 mpg with the automatic. All models are front-wheel drive.</p>

<p>In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Elantra Limited hit 60 mph in 8.9 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 117 feet. The Elantra GT Sport (manual) had a 0-60 time of 7.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 118 feet.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/elantra/2018/">2018 Hyundai Elantra</a> sedan and GT hatchback both received a four-star overall safety rating out of five stars from the NHTSA. The 2018 Elantra sedan and GT hatchback are considered 2018 Top Safety Picks from the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all conducted crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test for avoiding a 12-mph collision and reducing the speed of a 25-mph collision by 22 mph thanks to the automatic emergency braking system with pedestrian detection found in the Ultimate package. That package is available on the Limited trim for the sedan and in the Tech package for the GT Sport hatchback.</p>

<p>Additional safety features in the sedan’s Ultimate package include forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and automatic high beams. Additional safety features in the hatchback’s Tech package include adaptive cruise control with stop/start capability, forward collision warning, lane keep assist, high beam assist and a driver attention alert system. Blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert and lane change assist become standard on the SEL sedan trim and on the GT Sport trim. The base SE trim is the only one without a rearview camera. The Connected Care package in the Blue Link system includes automatic collision notification, SOS emergency assistance, and roadside assistance.</p>

<p>The 2018 Elantra sedan can hold 14.4 cubic feet of cargo in its trunk while the GT hatchback can hold up to 24.9 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 55.1 with the rear seats down. Front seat passengers have 42.2 inches of legroom in both body styles but the sedan’s rear seats offer 35.7 inches, more than the GT’s 34.8 inches.</p>

<p>The base SE trim for the sedan comes with a four-speaker radio system with Bluetooth. Upgrade to the SEL trim and you’ll get a six-speaker audio system with a 7.0-inch center display, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and SiriusXM satellite radio. The top system—available on the Ultimate package for the Limited sedan—adds a larger 8.0-inch screen, a navigation system with SiriusXM Data services, and an eight-speaker Infinity audio system with Clari-fi music restoration technology, and two USB ports. That package also includes the upgraded 4.2-inch instrument panel driver’s display (up from 3.5 inches). The Elantra GT hatchback comes well-equipped with an 8.0-inch center display with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and SiriusXM satellite radio. A navigation system with a seven-speaker Infinity premium audio system with Clari-fi music restoration is available on both GT trims. The available Blue Link packages include the Connected Care package (automatic collision notification, diagnostic report, roadside assistance, and other services), the Remote package (the remote app can honk the horn, turn on/off lights, find your car, remote start with climate control, and more), and the Guidance package that supplements the navigation system.</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/hyundai-elantra-gt-2018-car-of-the-year-contender/">2018 Motor Trend Car of the Year testing</a>, the 2018 Elantra GT Sport hatchback did not make the finalist cut due to the lack of a limited-slip differential, some cheap interior components, and a tight rear seat. However, we liked the GT Sport’s fun-to-drive factor, solid handling dynamics, and the fact that Sport actually means something—more power, bigger brakes, and an independent rear suspension. Some judges preferred it over the new Civic Si and one judge called it “a genuine Golf GTI-lite.” We concluded by saying that “the Elantra GT Sport is the perfect car for someone who wants something more fun than your run-of-the-mill compact but without the compromises of a straight-up hot hatch.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/elantra/2017/2017-hyundai-elantra-sport-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/elantra/2018/">Hyundai Elantra</a> Sport sedan, we enjoyed the improved acceleration over the regular Elantra but not as much as the improved handling dynamics thanks to the rear independent suspension: “Testing director Kim Reynolds … found that you can drift it slightly by lifting your foot off the throttle. Reynolds concluded that the Elantra Sport’s balance is its best attribute and said that no one attribute stands out ahead of the others.”</p>

<p>On the road, the Elantra Sport handles very well when pushed through the corners with “plenty of grip and minimal body roll, allowing you to confidently string corners and maintain your momentum.” The brakes have a good feel, the ride is comfortable, and steering is a big improvement but feels artificially heavy sometimes. The engine power trails off at high rpm but it provides plenty of low-end torque and the shifter is “…smooth and precise with reasonably short throws, and [has] a clutch that’s light and easy to predict.”</p>

<p>[The Elantra Sport] is a well-balanced car with a nice blend of power, agility, and comfort so you can easily drive it during the week and take it to an autocross over the weekend,” we concluded. “Sure, a limited-slip differential and stronger brakes would be nice, but even without them the Elantra Sport is able to put its power down effectively and scrub off speed quickly when needed.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2016/2016-2017-big-test-compact-sedans/">2016/2017 Big Test review</a> of seven compact sedans, the Elantra Limited did well, placing third. Although we didn’t like the sedan’s ride, steering feel, handling dynamics, and coarse powertrain, the Elantra made up for it with its impressive infotainment system, good value, and premium presentation. We concluded by saying: “Third place goes to the premium presentation from Hyundai. Despite still having the industry’s best warranty, the Elantra’s value proposition has waned. ‘The visuals promise,’ we said, ‘but the mechanicals don’t quite deliver on that promise.’”</p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata-hybrid/2018/2018-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-plug-in-hybrid-first-look-review/">2018 </a><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> <strong>Sonata Hybrid</strong> and its <strong>Plug-In Hybrid</strong> variant get a revised exterior featuring the same new front fascia found in the gas-only car and a recalibrated steering system. Suspension updates include a stiffer front anti-roll bar, a more rigid trailing arm design, and retuned bushings. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are now standard on all models. All variants get 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels with new designs. There are also a host of new optional features including full LED headlights and an updated navigation system.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2018/">2018 Hyundai Sonata</a> Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid is a family of midsize hybrid sedans that slot above the smaller, more efficient Ioniq hatchback. It’s available in two trims.</p>

<p><strong>Sonata Hybrid SE: </strong>The base SE trim comes with features like Bluetooth, a rearview camera, 16-inch alloy wheels, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and keyless entry and start.</p>

<p><strong>Sonata Hybrid Limited: </strong>Moving up to the Limited grade adds features such as heated and ventilated front seats, 17-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, LED headlights, and power-adjustable front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Sonata Plug-In Hybrid: </strong>The base Sonata Plug-In Hybrid comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/start, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, and the hands-free <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/smart/">smart</a> trunk.</p>

<p><strong>Sonata Plug-In Hybrid Limited: </strong>The range-topping Sonata Plug-In Hybrid Limited adds an Infinity premium audio system, ventilated front seats, rear parking sensors, and leather upholstery.</p>

<p>Optional features on the 2018 Sonata Hybrid include LED headlights, wireless phone charging, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, and a heated steering wheel.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sonata Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid are powered by a hybrid system that couples a 154-hp 2.0-liter I-4 with 140 lb-ft of torque to an electric motor, lithium-ion battery and a six-speed automatic transmission. In the standard hybrid, the electric motor generates 51 hp and 151 lb-ft while the the Plug-In Hybrid features a more powerful 67-hp unit. Total output for the 2018 Sonata Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid is 193 hp and 202 hp respectively. Charging times for the Plug-In Hybrid from empty are 8.7 hours on a level 1 charger (household outlet) or 2.7 hours on a level 2 public charger.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy estimates for the 2018 Sonata Hybrid are 40/46 mpg city/highway for the SE trim and 39/44 mpg for the Limited. The Sonata Plug-In Hybrid can travel up to an estimated 27 miles in EV mode.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sonata Hybrid received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). Plug-in hybrid variants haven’t been rated yet. Both the 2018 Sonata Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid haven’t been tested by the IIHS but the gas-only variant received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS front crash prevention test, the gas-only 2018 Sonata received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test). As a result of its excellent crash test and collision avoidance scores, the gas-only 2018 Sonata received the IIHS’ 2018 Top Safety Pick+ rating.</p>

<p>Available active driver assistance features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, auto high beams and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sonata Hybrid only has 13.3 cubic feet of trunk space (compared to the gas-only Sonata’s 16.3 cubic feet) but it can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.  Plug-In Hybrid variants have even less cargo capacity at 9.9 cubic feet and it loses the split-folding rear seats because of the larger battery.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata-hybrid/2016/2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-first-test/">2016 First Test</a> of the Sonata <strong>Hybrid</strong>, we said that it offers good power and has smooth ride thanks to a suspension that soaks up bump well. However, on rough surfaces, excessive road noise penetrates the interior. As for the interior’s build quality, it has plenty of soft-touch materials throughout the cabin. Passenger space is generous for four thanks to the roomy rear seats.</p>

<p>The <strong>plug-in hybrid</strong> offers quicker acceleration thanks to the more powerful electric motor. We also noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata-plug-in/2016/2016-hyundai-sonata-plug-hybrid-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a> that ride comfort is a strong point, making the Sonata Plug-in a great road trip car (as long as you don’t have too much luggage). As with most Hyundai vehicles, the Sonata plug-in’s multimedia system is user-friendly. Handling is secure, but since the Sonata plug-in is more of a cruiser, it’s not very engaging to drive.</p>

<p>The Sonata receives an extensive refresh for the new model year including a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/hyundai-sonata-gets-eight-speed-auto-cascading-grille/">new eight-speed automatic, “cascading” grille</a>, narrower headlights and taillights, a new hood, front fenders, a larger trunk lid, new wheel designs, available LED headlights, and a new rear fascia. Inside, the center stack and steering wheel have been redesigned, and the 2.0T model differentiates itself from the rest of the lineup with a mesh grille, black bezel headlights, a black lower front bumper, black DRL surrounds, dark chrome exterior trim, and chrome on the rear diffuser. Blind-spot monitoring and rear-cross traffic alert are now standard on all trims.</p>

<p>The Sonata is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/">Hyundai</a>’s midsize sedan that’s positioned above the smaller Accent and Elantra, but below the larger Azera. Aside from a choice of gas engines, the Sonata will continue to be offered as a</p>

<p><strong>2018 Sonata SE</strong>: The Sonata’s base SE trim comes well-equipped with 16-inch alloy wheels, blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert and lane change assist, a 7.0-inch center touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, a 3.5-inch instrument panel driver’s display, automatic headlights, a drive mode selector, remote keyless entry, six-way manually adjustable driver’s seat, as well as USB and auxiliary ports.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Sonata Eco</strong>: The Eco trim comes with the same equipment as the SE trim (minus the drive mode selector) but adds the more efficient 1.6-liter turbo-four and seven-speed dual-clutch transmission powertrain instead of the 2.4-liter I-4 engine.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Sonata SEL</strong>: Building off the SE’s features, the SEL adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a 10-way power driver’s seat, quick-entry with a push-start ignition, heated front seats, LED daytime running lights, heated side view mirrors, a hands-free automatic trunk, a 4.2-inch instrument panel driver’s display,  leather-wrapped steering wheel, leatherette door panel inserts, SiriusXM satellite radio, a rear USB port, and the Blue Link telematics system with Connected Care and Remote packages.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Sonata Sport</strong>: The Sport trim adds a Sport grille, front fascia, rear diffuser, shift knob, seats, rocker panels, and instrument cluster. The Sport also adds a leather-wrapped D-shaped steering wheel, glossy trim, black headliner, aluminum pedals, the 3D tech appearance interior trim, dark chrome doors handles, LED interior lights, power sunroof, and a dual exhaust.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Sonata Limited</strong>: The Limited adds more luxury with leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, steering-responsive LED headlights, power sunroof, LED taillights, six-way power passenger’s seat, wood grain appearance interior trim, dual automatic climate control, rear A/C vents, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and metal door sills.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Sonata Sport 2.0T</strong>: Building off the Sonata Sport’s features, the Sport 2.0T adds the more powerful 2.0-liter turbo-four engine and new eight-speed automatic, 18-inch alloy wheels with Michelin tires, a sport-tuned suspension, and larger front brakes.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Sonata Limited 2.0T</strong>: Building off the Limited’s trim, the Limited 2.0T adds the 2.0-liter turbo-four powertrain, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control with start/stop, an 8.0-inch center touchscreen with navigation (with Blue Link Guidance), an Infinity premium audio system, automatic high beams, rear parking sensors, electronic parking brake with automatic vehicle hold, leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, SiriusXM Travel Link, and wireless device charging.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2018/">2018 Hyundai Sonata</a> is powered by a 185-hp, 178-lb-ft of torque 2.4-liter I-4 that delivers an EPA-rated 25/36 mpg city/highway on the base SE model and 25/35 mpg on the other trims. The 178-hp, 195-lb-ft 1.6-liter turbo-four found in the Sonata Eco model delivers the best fuel economy in the lineup at 28/37 mpg. The 245-hp, 260-lb-ft 2.0-liter turbo-four that powers the 2.0T model is rated at 23/32 mpg. A six-speed automatic routes power to the front wheels on the 2.4-liter engine, but a new eight-speed automatic backs the 2.0-liter turbo-four engine option this year. A more efficient seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is used on the Eco’s 1.6-liter turbo-four. The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata-hybrid/">Sonata hybrid and plug-in hybrid</a> models sport a 154-hp 2.0-liter I-4 engine paired to a 51-hp and 67-hp electric motor, respectively. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2018 Sonata 2.0T Limited hit 60 mph in 7.1 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a short 113 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2018/">Hyundai Sonata</a> received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA. The 2018 Sonata is also considered a 2018 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS because the sedan received the highest rating of Good in all six crash tests, Good for the headlights evaluation, and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention test by avoiding 12- and 25-mph frontal collisions thanks to the automatic emergency braking feature in the Tech and Ultimate packages  that also adds adaptive cruise control with start/stop, lane keep assist, and an electronic parking brake. The Ultimate package adds automatic high beams, rear parking sensors, and other comfort and entertainment features. The 2018 Sonata comes standard with blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist. Steering-responsive headlights are standard on the Limited trims.</p>

<p>The Sonata can carry up to 16.3 cubic feet of cargo in the trunk and offers 45.5 inches of front seat legroom and 35.6 inches of rear seat legroom. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/altima/2018/">Nissan Altima</a> offers slightly less cargo room at 15.4 cubic feet but the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord/2018/">Honda Accord</a> edges them both out, with 16.7 cubic feet.</p>

<p>The standard 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration can be upgraded to an 8.0-inch touchscreen with a navigation system in the Limited trims. The 3.5-inch non-color instrument panel driver’s display found in the base SE trim becomes a 4.2-inch color display in the other trims. The standard six-speaker audio system is upgradable to the eight-speaker Infinity audio system but only in the Limited trims. One USB port is standard but a second one for the rear seats is optional, as is the wireless device charger. The Blue Link system offers the Connected Care package (SOS emergency assistance, automatic collision notice, maintenance reminder and more), the Remote package (remote start, remote lock/unlock, car finder, stolen vehicle recovery and more), and the Guidance package that supplements the Sonata’s navigation system.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2018/2018-hyundai-sonata-20t-limited-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2018 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0T, we liked the improved acceleration over the outgoing model but the Sonata is still slower than comparable rivals. Braking feel was praised during testing and the car felt nimble around the figure-eight handling course. The Sonata handles very well, the steering is much improved and feels more precise, and the eight-speed automatic is smooth. During Real MPG testing, the Sonata returned results higher than the EPA, 28.9 mpg combined driving, an impressive figure.</p>

<p>“In our eyes, the Sonata is not the top competitor in its segment. But once again, the Sonata stands apart because it offers great value for the money, a particularly impressive feat once you get to the top trim level. With improved acceleration and driving dynamics, as trite as it sounds, the Sonata is a good pick in a segment filled with many good options,” we concluded.</p>

<p>During our , we felt the 2.4-liter engine had plenty of power for around-town driving and the six-speed automatic was smooth. We found the Sonata’s ride to be comfortable and appreciated the interior’s high-quality materials, spaciousness, and good outward visibility.</p>

<p>“Although the 2018 Sonata is only a refreshed model, ” we wrote, “it builds on the seventh-generation car by adding a more distinctive exterior and an interior that feels more upscale, especially on higher trim levels. Now offering better driving dynamics, the 2018 Sonata is ready to compete with the redesigned <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/">2018 Toyota Camry</a> and the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/accord/2018/">2018 Honda Accord</a>. As a whole, the 2018 Sonata is a better midsize sedan that offers user-friendly tech, space, and comfort wrapped in an attractive, high-value package, especially considering that the base car’s sticker price only increased by $100.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of revised model naming (all non-hybrid models now include the word Luxe), new package naming, and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> InTouch single display now standard, the Q70 and Q70L are unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Q70 and Q70L are Infiniti’s flagships sedans positioned above the Q50 sedan and Q60 coupe. The Q70L has the second highest starting price in the automaker’s entire lineup, after the full-size QX80 SUV.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/q70/2018/">2018 Infiniti Q70</a> 3.7 and Q70L 3.7 are powered by a 3.7-liter V-6 that produces 330 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque and comes with an EPA-rating of 18/25 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and 18/24 mpg with AWD. The available 5.6-liter V-8 found in the Q70 5.6 churns out 420 hp and 417 lb-ft (416 hp, 414 lb-ft for the Q70L) and is rated at 16/24 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 16/23 mpg with AWD. The Q70 Hybrid utilizes a 302-hp, 258 lb-ft 3.5-liter V-6 paired to 67-hp, 214-lb-ft electric motor for a total combined output of 360 hp. The Hybrid is only available in rear-wheel drive and delivers 28/33 mpg. All engines are backed by a seven-speed automatic.</p>

<p>The Q70 comes standard with 18-inch wheels, LED fog lights and taillights, power sliding moonroof, leatherette upholstery, 10-way power adjustable heated front seats, a sequential welcome lighting illuminated entry system, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, genuine Japanese Ash wood interior accents, active noise cancellation, a 7.0-inch center display screen, Enhanced Intelligent Key memory settings, and an Infiniti analog clock.</p>

<p>For additional luxury, opt for the Premium package that includes Infiniti Navigation, an multi-camera parking system with Moving Object Detection, front and rear parking sensors, a Bose 10-speaker premium audio system, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, and a heated steering wheel. The Premium Select Edition package consists of Dark Chrome exterior trim, darkened lower rear bumper, rear spoiler, 20-inch wheels, suede-like headliner, aluminum interior trim, semi-aniline leather seating, contrast piping floor mats, illuminated door sills, and sport brakes.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA has yet to conduct its full array of crash evaluations, but 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/q70/2018/">Infiniti Q70</a> did received four out of five stars for the frontal and rollover crash tests. The 2017 Infiniti Q70 is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick from the IIHS because the sedan received the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests and the highest rating of superior for front crash prevention. The Superior rating was issued because the sedan properly warned the driver of a possible collision, avoided a 12 mph collision, and reduced a 25 mph collision by 22 mph thanks to the Forward Emergency Braking system found in the Technology package. The Technology package also includes the remaining driver assist features – blind spot warning, blind spot intervention, Intelligent Cruise Control (adaptive), forward collision warning, lane departure warning, lane departure prevention, and back-up collision intervention.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/le-cabriolet/2015/2015-infiniti-q70s-56-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the standard- and long-wheelbase versions of the 2015 Infiniti Q70S 5.6, we liked the improved ride in the long-wheelbase version and the huge backseat the sedan provides. When driving the car, the recalibrated transmission and steering were much improved. Sportiness was good but not as much as other rivals. We liked the new styling but the technology inside was a little outdated. “To me, the GS and the CTS are still the sports sedans to beat. Let’s not forget that not only is the new CTS-V on the horizon, so is the GS F. However, the biggest Infiniti sedan does drive much better than the car it replaces.”</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-infiniti-q70l-3-7-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the Q70L, we said, “No matter how much you spend on a Q70, the center-stack screen is 7 inches, plenty big if your daily driver predates the march toward gigantic <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2018/">Tesla Model S</a>-size screens but not so big if you just test drove a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/">Lexus</a> GS with its 12.3-inch screen. I’m also looking forward to seeing an instrument cluster screen with better graphics and more info or an available head-up display. Better fuel economy would be a plus, too.”</p>

<p>At the end of our review we said, “When passenger space is more important than fuel economy, the Q70L should rise toward the top of your search. Avoid those flashy 20-inch wheels, and you’re left with a somewhat exclusive sub-$60,000 luxury sedan with a back seat [few others in the segment can match].”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The long-wheelbase version offers an additional 5.6 inches of rear seat space.</p>

<p><strong>Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>After a 2017 redesign, updates for 2018 include new 20-inch wheels for the Red Sport 400, new 19-inch wheels for the 3.0t Sport model, and a new exterior color: Solar Mica. A new trim level structure now consists of the Pure, Luxe, Sport, and Red Sport designations.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Q60 is the coupe version of the Q50 sedan. In price, the Q60 is positioned above the Q50 but below the flagship Q70.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Q60’s base 2.0t models are powered by a 208-hp, 258-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbo I-4 and delivers an EPA-rated 21/28 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and 22/30 mpg for all-wheel drive (AWD). The available 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 produces 300 hp and 295 lb-ft and comes with a rating of 19/28 with rear-wheel drive and 19/27 with AWD. The range-topping Red Sport 400 utilizes the same twin-turbo V-6 but tuned to churn out a potent 400 hp and 350 lb-ft and is rated at 20/27 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 19/26 with AWD. A seven-speed automatic transmission backs all engines.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base 2.0t Pure include LED headlights and daytime running lights, LED fog lights and turn signals, LED rear combination lights, 19-inch wheels, a chrome front grille, leatherette upholstery, eight-way power front seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> InTouch dual display system with an upper 8.0-inch and a 7.0-inch lower LCD touchscreens with controller, aluminum interior trim, dual-zone automatic temperature control, satellite radio, and Infiniti’s customizable InTuition infotainment system. Opt for the 3.0t models for the best packages like the Sensory package 3.0t consists of auto dimming outside mirrors, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, Infiniti InTouch with Navigation and Infiniti InTouch Services, driver’s seat power lumbar, driver’s seat power torso bolsters, heated steering wheel and remote start. Silver Optic Fiber interior trim and an illuminated grille emblem are additional options.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/q60/2018/">Infiniti Q60</a> has yet to be crash tested, but the Q50 sedan on which it’s based received the highest rating of Good in four of the IIHS’ crash test evaluations and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention (thanks to the Forward Emergency Braking system also available on the Q60). The Q60 should fare well if ever crash tested. The available driver assist safety features are found in either the ProAssist package or the ProActive package and include blind-spot warning, blind spot intervention, adaptive cruise control, backup collision intervention with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning, forward emergency braking, lane departure warning, and Lane Departure Prevention with Active Lane Control.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/q60/2017/2017-infiniti-q60-red-sport-coupe-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/q60/2017/">2017 Infiniti Q60</a> Red Sport 400 with AWD, acceleration was strong in Sport mode with minimal lag and the transmission was quick to downshift. The suspension was smooth in Sport mode with good handling but the Standard mode felt too floaty at speed. The steering was light but quickly got artificially heavy and boosted too much when turning. The Standard mode for steering was preferred for its natural and linear feel. The rear-wheel drive model felt lighter and more responsive versus the AWD model but felt slower in the corners.</p>

<p>As for Infiniti’s Direct Adaptive Steering (DAS), we said: “We would probably save the $1,000 for the DAS and stick with the conventional steering system. The DAS is required, however, for the Technology package.” Inside, we liked the center stack layout and double infotainment screens.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The twin turbochargers make a maximum 9.5 psi for the 300-hp V-6 engine and 14.7 psi for the 400-hp version.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Introduced last year, there are no significant changes to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx30/2018/">Infiniti QX30</a> for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The QX30 is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/">Infiniti</a>’s entry-level crossover and the most affordable vehicle in the automaker’s lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx30/2018/">2018 Infiniti QX30</a> is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 that produces 208 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque and is available in front-wheel drive (EPA-rated 24/33 mpg city/highway) and in all-wheel drive (21/30 mpg). Like its German twin, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class</a>, a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission routes power to the wheels. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the QX30 AWD hit 60 mph in a quick 6.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a very respectable 113 feet.</p>

<p>Standard features for the QX30 include LED daytime running lights, power-folding and heated outside mirrors with puddle lamps, Fibretec upholstery, eight-way manual front seats with power lumbar support, leatherette stitched dashboard and console, paddle shifters, 7.0-inch touchscreen with Infiniti InTouch, illuminated entry system, two USB ports, and dual exhaust outlets with chrome finishers. Available only on the top Premium AWD model, the Café Teak Theme package consists of Brown Nappa leather-appointed seats, brown leatherette console and door trim, black contrast stitching, real wood center stack and door trim, enhanced LED interior ambient lighting, black suede-like headliner and A-pillars, and Satin Silver mirror caps. Other available features include LED headlights and fog lights, panoramic moonroof, eight-way power heated front seats, surround view camera system, a 10-speaker Bose premium audio system, and navigation.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The QX30 comes standard with a rearview camera, electronic stability control, and front, side, and knee airbags. Driver assist safety features are found in the Technology package that consists of blind-spot warning, lane departure alert, forward emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, high beam assist, Intelligent Park Assist (self-parking system), and the Around View camera system with front and rear parking sensors. The IIHS nor the NHSTA have yet to evaluate the QX30 or the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> GLA-Class, its sister vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx30/2017/2017-infiniti-qx30-first-drive-review/">First Drive</a> of the 2017 Infiniti QX30, we were impressed with the luxurious interior and the comfortable seats, but the rear seats and cargo space are both on the small side. The transmission also impressed us: “Infiniti’s tweaks to the engine and sole-option seven-speed dual-clutch transmission seem to be mostly refinements, smoothing out power delivery and shifting for a slightly more relaxed demeanor than the playful GLA.”</p>

<p>The driving dynamics and ride comfort were also on par, “The same can be said for the QX30’s driving behavior. It’s more mature and straight-laced than its German half-brother. The ride is smooth and unperturbed by most bumps and holes, but the suspension still returns moderately sporty handling when pressed.” At the end of our review we said, “In a crowd trying to blend sport, luxury, and cost-savings as effectively as possible, the QX30 feels like <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/smart/">smart</a>, confident choice for someone less concerned with badges. At a starting price of just $30,900 ….it’s likely to be friendlier to the wallet than the competition, as well.”</p>

<p>When we reviewed the 2017 QX30 during <em><a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/infiniti-qx30-2017-suv-of-the-year-contender/">Motor Trend’s SUV of the Year testing</a></em>, we loved the compact crossover for its sharp looks and very fun handling and felt it was more of a raised hatchback than an SUV or crossover. The biggest complaints were the small back seats and cargo area. “Pretty little hot hatch with an interior nicer than the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x1/2018/">BMW X1</a>’s, …In fact, both the exterior and the interior look better than the GLA the QX30 is based on—although back-seat space in the Infiniti definitely gets a failing grade.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The QX30 Sport model differentiates itself with a lower ride height, unique front, and rear lower fascias, gloss black grille, cross-drilled front brake rotors, dark chrome exhaust finishers and 19-inch Gun Metallic wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> refreshed the QX80 with a redesigned front fascia, grille, headlights, liftgate, taillights, and rear bumper finisher. Inside, you will find new stitching, piping, and quilting on the seats, and new wood grain trim as well. The center console has also been updated to fit mugs with handles and adds USB ports.</p>

<p>The QX80 is the automaker’s only body-on-frame SUV and is positioned above the smaller QX30 and QX60 crossovers. The QX50 skips the 2018 model year and the QX70 has been discontinued.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx80/2018/">2018 Infiniti QX80</a></strong>: The QX80 is offered in one well-equipped trim that includes 20-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, LED fog lights, power sunroof, power-folding and heated side view mirrors with auto-dimming and reverse tilt-down, quick-entry with a push-start ignition, remote engine start, tri-zone climate control, leather seating, 10-way power front driver’s seat (eight-way for passenger), heated front seats, heated steering wheel, Stratford Burl trim, second-row captain’s chairs, a 13-speaker Bose audio system, an 8.0-inch center touchscreen with navigation and SiriusXM satellite radio, a power-adjustable steering wheel, a surround view camera system, plus nine cup holders and four bottle holders.</p>

<p><strong>2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx80/2018/">Infiniti QX80</a> 4WD</strong>: Infiniti adds its All-Mode four-wheel-drive system in addition to all the above standard features.</p>

<p>The Theater package adds entertainment to the rear seats with dual 8.0-inch display screens, two wireless headphones and headphone jacks, a wireless remote control, auxiliary HDMI and USB audio/visual ports, an additional 120-volt outlet, heated second-row seats, and remote tip-up second-row seats.</p>

<p>The 2018 Infiniti QX80 is powered by a 400-hp, 413-lb-ft of torque 5.6-liter V-8 backed by a seven-speed automatic transmission that delivers an EPA-rated 14/20 mpg with two-wheel drive and 13/19 mpg with four-wheel drive. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2015 Infiniti QX80 hit 60 mph in a quick 6.3 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 123 feet.</p>

<p>Driver assist safety features are found in Driver Assistance package that consists of emergency automatic braking with pedestrian detection, forward collision warning, reverse automatic braking, blind-spot monitor, blind-spot intervention, lane departure warning with lane keep assist, distance control assist, and full-speed adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>The QX80 can fit up to 16.6 cubic feet of cargo behind the third row, 49.6 behind the second row, and 95.1 cubic feet with both rows folded down. The redesigned <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/navigator/2018/">2018 Lincoln Navigator</a> (regular wheel-base) offers more with 19.3, 57.5, and 103.3 cubic feet of cargo space, respectively. The QX80’s front seat passengers have 39.6 inches of legroom, second-row passengers have 41.0 inches, and third-row passengers receive much less at 28.8 inches.</p>

<p>Standard tech in the QX80 consists of an 8.0-inch center touchscreen with a navigation system and a central controller, SiriusXM satellite radio, SiriusXM Travel and Traffic Link, and Bluetooth streaming audio and calling. The standard 13-speaker Bose audio system can be upgraded to a 15-speaker Bose Cabin Surround audio system found in the Deluxe Technology package that also consists of the Hydraulic Body Motion Control system, the Smart Rear View Mirror (a traditional rearview mirror that can change to a camera rear view), climate-controlled seats, an adaptive front lighting system with auto-leveling headlights, advanced climate control, and some additional luxurious features. The Infiniti Wi-Fi package can connect up to five devices and is available in 1 GB and 5 GB monthly plans. The previously mentioned Driver Assistance package and Theater package adds lots of tech.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx80/2018/2018-infiniti-qx80-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2018 Infiniti QX80, we liked all the interior and exterior updates the QX80 received this model year, but the platform and powertrain remained unchanged. The ride is still comfortable and the QX80 still handles like a large SUV—the new Hydraulic Body Motion Control system didn’t seem to make a difference from previous models. The suite of driver assist safety feature is unchanged—we hoped ProPilot Assist would be available. The new Smart Rearview Mirror is a nice touch. Unfortunately, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a digital instrument cluster are not available.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/escalade/2015/the-big-test-large-luxury-suvs/">2015 Big Test</a> of large luxury SUVs, the pre-refresh Infiniti QX80 came in last place out of six competitors. We liked the ride comfort, braking distance, powerful V-8, and some impressive cabin materials, but we concluded, “When you factor in worst in test fuel economy, a cramped third row, and those awkward looks, you have a big SUV that only one of us loved.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The QX60’s only significant change for the 2018 model year is the discontinuation of the low-volume hybrid model, leaving the QX60 3.5 and QX60 3.5 AWD.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The QX60 is positioned above the entry-level QX30 and below the larger and more expensive QX80. The QX70 has been discontinued. Below the QX60 is the QX50 model, which will not see a 2018 model but will return for the 2019 model year, and the entry-level QX30.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx60/2018/">2018 Infiniti QX60</a> is powered by a 295-hp, 270 lb-ft of torque 3.5-liter V-6 paired to a CVT that routes power to the front wheels (EPA-rated 19/26 mpg city/highway) or to an all-wheel drive (AWD) system (20/27 mpg). The QX60 (which is based on the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/pathfinder/2018/">Nissan Pathfinder</a>) offers 15.8 cubic feet of cargo space with the third row up, 40.8 cubic feet with the third row down, and healthy 76.5 cubic feet with the second row down.</p>

<p>Standard features for the 2018 QX60 include 18-inch wheels, heated outside mirrors, chrome grille, power moonroof, leather upholstery (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> row), power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, leather wrapped steering wheel, eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, an 8.0-inch center display, tri-zone climate control, and rear A/C vents (not third row). For additional features, opt for the Premium package that includes a Bose Premium audio system, dual front memory seats (includes outside mirrors and steering wheel), Enhanced Intelligent Key (occupant memory settings), heated steering wheel, reverse-tilt-down side view mirrors, and a stainless steel rear bumper protector. The above Premium package is required if you want the Premium Plus package that adds navigation, a multi-camera parking camera system with Moving Object Detection, rain-sensing windshield wipers, illuminated door sills, as well as front and rear parking sensors. Additional optional features include 20-inch wheels and a second and third row moonroof with power sunshade.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx60/2018/">Infiniti QX60</a> is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick because the crossover received the highest rating of Good in all five crash evaluations and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention from the IIHS for being able to avoid a 12 mph and 25 mph frontal collision thanks to the available Forward Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection found in the Deluxe Technology package that includes Lane Departure Warning, Lane Departure Prevention, adaptive cruise control, Backup Collision Intervention, front and rear parking sensors, Blind Spot Intervention, forward collision warning, and blind spot warning. The QX60 missed out on a Top Safety Pick+ rating because the IIHS rated its headlights as Poor. The 2018 model has yet to be IIHS-rated.</p>

<p>The NHTSA issued its highest rating of five stars for the crossover’s overall rating in front- and all-wheel drive forms.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2016-infiniti-qx60-nine-things-to-know/">Nine Things to Know</a> review of the refreshed 2016 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> QX60, we felt the crossover drove sportier than the pre-refreshed model but still very comfortable. The NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) was reduced, keeping the interior quiet over rough surfaces. We liked the four USB ports but having only one in the front and two for the third-row confused us. Inside, we liked the new premium shifter, contrast stitching, and good-looking wood-grain trim. The second-row was nice with optional heated seats, rear entertainment system, and seats that slide forward and tilt up for easy third-row access.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The available Bose Cabin Surround audio system includes 15 speakers and digital 5.1 decoding, great for watching movies with the optional rear entertainment system.</p>

<p>The 2018 XJ comes standard with a 340-hp, 332-lb-ft of torque 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 that delivers an EPA-rated 18/27 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and 17/26 mpg with all-wheel drive (AWD; EPA figures here are from the 2017 model year). The long-wheelbase version, the XJL, is also rated at 18/27 mpg in rear-wheel drive form and 17/25 with AWD. The available 5.0-liter supercharged V-8 produces 470 hp and 424 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 15/23 mpg in both traditional and long-wheelbase versions and is only available with rear-wheel drive. The XJR575 uses the same 5.0-liter supercharged V-8 that is tuned to produce a potent 575 hp and 517 lb-ft of torque and is only available in rear-wheel drive (the EPA has yet to rate the engine’s fuel economy). All powertrains use an eight-speed automatic transmission. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2016 Jaguar XJL AWD V-6 hit 60 mph in a quick 5.4 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 112 feet.</p>

<p>The base XJ R-Sport model comes standard with 19-inch wheels, an R-Sport exterior trim with black mesh grille, full LED headlights with automatic high beams, LED taillights, panoramic roof, ventilated heated and cool front and rear seats, Touch Pro with connected navigation, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 20-speaker Meridian surround sound system, interior ambient lighting, rear air suspension, a drive mode selector, 16-way powered perforated Softgrain leather front seats, and a Softgrain leather-wrapped heated steering wheel. Opt for the Comfort package and your XJ will come with 18-way heated and cooled front seats with massaging function, front seat passenger memory, four-zone climate control, and an electric rear sunshade. The impressive Premium Rear Seat package comes with two individual massaging seats, a folding center armrest with seat controls, rear business tables, and the Rear Seat Entertainment system which includes dual 10.2-inch LCD screens, a rear media interface, touch-screen remote control, and two wireless headphones. The XJR575 features exterior badging, twin hood louvers, red brake calipers, 20-inch five split-spoke Gloss Black wheels, bespoke door sills, diamond-quilted seating, and an electronic Active Differential.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The standard driver assist safety features for the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xj/2018/">2018 Jaguar XJ</a> include a blind-spot monitoring system, rear-cross traffic alert, traffic sign recognition with adaptive speed limiter, Driver Condition Monitor (drowsy driver alert), and Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist. Available driver assist safety features include a multi-camera visibility system, Park Assist (self-parking and exiting system), and adaptive cruise control with Queue Assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xj-series/2016/2016-jaguar-xjl-3-0-awd-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Jaguar XJL 3.0 AWD, we felt the Jaguar was powerful and responsive with a quick 0-60 mph time. However, the auto start/stop function shook the body briefly upon restarting and the steering feel is a little vague. We liked the Jaguar’s first-class interior, price tag, and warranty. “There are certainly much worse vehicles to be stuck in while inching along in the rain,” we said. “The XJL is a soothing vehicle to drive. The motor purrs along, and the sound isolation is excellent. The only interruptions are potholes or rough, irregular pavement; the stiff aluminum chassis transmits a surprising amount of shock into the cabin. In this regard, the big Jag doesn’t feel up to the same level as the S-Class or new 7 Series.”</p>

<p>“As impressive as the XJL is, I have a few quibbles for this nearly six-figure car,” we said during a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xj-series/2014/2013-jaguar-xjl-supercharged-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2013 Jaguar XJL 5.0. “For example, the manual rear door shades and the power rear window shade didn’t work for two days from the front or rear cabin switches. Being able to use the heated seat backs and ventilated seat bottoms at the same time with the messaging function (as on the outgoing <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> S-Class) would be a welcome feature, as would massaging and reclining rear seats.” In conclusion, we said: “Despite the few complaints, the Jaguar wowed most of those who experienced it. With a base price of $93,475 and an as-tested price of $98,075, the 2013 Jaguar XJL 5.0 pampers with luxury and comfort along with power and handling for true driving enthusiasts; something not found in all of its similarly priced German competitors.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Jaguar claims that the XJR575 can hit 60 mph in 4.2 seconds and has a top speed of 186 mph.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> F-Pace receives a third engine option: a 2.0-liter gas turbo-four from Jaguar <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/">Land Rover</a>’s Ingenium engine family. Owners can use a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/jaguar-launches-car-payment-system-fueling-stations/">new Shell app</a> to pay for gas using the car’ infotainment system. Forward traffic detection and forward vehicle guidance have also been added to the available suite of active safety systems.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The Jaguar F-Pace is the British automaker’s first crossover, and it comes standard with all-wheel drive and a choice of gas or diesel powertrains.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three engines are offered in the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/f-pace/2017/2017-jaguar-f-pace-first-drive-review-practical-sports-car/">2018 Jaguar F-Pace,</a> a 2.0-liter turbodiesel I-4 making 180 hp and 318 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter gas turbo-four with 247 hp and 269 lb-ft, and a 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 rated at 340 hp or 380 hp and 332 lb-ft. An eight-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox available on all F-Pace variants. EPA fuel economy estimates haven’t been announced for the 2018 model, but the diesel variant should retain the 2017 car’s 26/33 mpg city/highway while the V-6-powered models will likely keep the 2017 car’s 18/23 mpg. Expect the gas 2.0-liter turbo-four to fit in between the diesel and the V-6 in terms of fuel economy.</p>

<p>Cargo space is 33.5 cubic feet and can be expanded to 63.5 cubic feet with the standard 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats folded. The diesel and V-6-powered F-Pace can tow up to 5,290 pounds when properly equipped; expect the 2.0-liter gas turbo-four to have less towing capacity.</p>

<p>Standard and optional features include a panoramic sunroof, adaptive LED headlights, alloy wheels up to 22 inches in diameter, a Meridian premium audio system, leather upholstery, a head-up display, Jaguar’s InControl Touch multimedia interface with standard eight-inch touchscreen in the base version or a 10.2-inch unit in the Pro variant, a 12.3-inch digital display replacing traditional gauges, the Adaptive Dynamics drive model selector, and Jaguar Land Rover’s All Surface Progress Control, which aids when driving the F-Pace off-road.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Jaguar F-Pace. Available active safety and driver assistance systems include lane keeping assist with driver condition monitoring, adaptive cruise control with queue assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot warning.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/f-pace/2017/2017-jaguar-f-pace-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that the Jaguar F-Pace offers excellent driving dynamics and offers strong acceleration when equipped with the optional supercharged V-6 engine. Larger alloy wheels, however, produce more road noise and makes the ride worse than. Opting for smaller alloy wheels improves the F-Pace’s ride and minimizes the road impacts from uneven surfaces. Although there is a decent amount of cargo space inside, fit and finish is subpar, with cheap materials throughout the interior.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Jaguar F-Pace was first previewed by the sexy C-X17 concept that debuted at the 2013 Frankfurt auto show.</p>

Forward traffic detection and forward vehicle guidance have also been added to the available suite of active safety features. A 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster display is also now available. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xe/2018/">Jaguar XE</a> S gets more power with its supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 now rated at 380 hp.</p>

<p>A <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/jaguar-launches-car-payment-system-fueling-stations/">new Shell app</a> allows owners to pay for fuel via the car’s touchscreen and a power-operated trunk is now offered.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Jaguar XE is a compact premium sports sedan that slots below the midsize XF and is the British automaker’s answer to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/3-series/2018/">BMW 3 Series</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a4/2018/">Audi A4</a>. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional on the diesel-powered and V-6-powered variants.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three engines are available in the 2018 XE, a new 2.0-liter gas turbo-four making 247 hp and 269 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbodiesel I-4 rated at 180 hp and 318 lb-ft, and a 3.0-liter supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 340 hp or 380 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox available on all models.</p>

<p>Cargo space stands at 15.9 cubic feet regardless of the variant and can be expanded with the 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats that’s available on all but the base XE. Compared to the 2017 model year, fuel economy numbers shouldn’t change much with the diesel, which is the most efficient at 32/42 mpg city/highway for rear-drive models and 30/40 mpg with all-wheel drive. The more powerful variants with the supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 should retain the same 21/30 mpg rating for rear-drive variants and 20/29 mpg with all-wheel drive. However, the gas 2.0-liter turbo-four could see an improvement from the 2017 model’s 21/30 mpg rating.</p>

<p>Standard and available features include Jaguar Land Rover’s InControl infotainment system with a standard eight-inch touchscreen or a larger 10.2-inch unit, navigation, a Meridian premium audio system, a rearview camera, head-up display, heated and ventilated front seats, leather upholstery, adaptive HID headlights, a moonroof, keyless entry/start, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, and heated rear seats.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Jaguar XE. A suite of active safety and driver assistance features is available and includes automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, blind-spot warning, lane keeping assist, driver condition monitoring, and adaptive cruise control with queue assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xe/2017/2017-jaguar-xe-25t-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that the XE offers smooth power delivery, and features a great ride and handling balance. Noise levels inside the XE’s cabin is minimal but the fit and finish is not up to par with the class due to some cheap materials used in some areas include the paddle shifters. The seat bottom are also lacking in thigh support, especially taller drivers with long legs. As for the infotainment system, Jaguar Land Rover’s InControl interface is finicky and suffers from glitches that cause it to freeze (at least, in our test car). The touchscreen is also slow to respond, especially when inputting commands for navigation. Rear seat space is also cramped due to the car’s swoopy roofline.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Jaguar XE features an aluminum-intensive architecture that helps keep its weight down.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The F-Type gained a new base 2.0-liter turbocharged engine for the coupe’s mid-cycle refresh and a limited-edition 400 Sport model featuring a 400-hp supercharged V-6 engine.

<p>The Jaguar InControl Touch Pro infotainment system is now standard and features a faster processor. New for the infotainment system is a GoPro connectivity feature dubbed ReRun, an app that can record track data including speed, lateral acceleration, gear selection, and throttle and brake position. The data can then be overlaid with GoPro footage and downloaded on a smartphone. For added look and bite, you can opt the SVR model with the available Carbon Ceramic Brake package that will likely return for 2018 and includes yellow brake calipers and 20-inch Maelstrom five twin-spoke forged alloy wheels. The Extended Leather package adds a leather upper dash trim and leather sports sun visor with mirror while the Exterior Carbon Fiber package adds carbon fiber hood louvers, mirror caps, front splitter, and side vents.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>Jaguar improved the safety on the 2018 F-Type by offering Autonomous Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, Traffic Sign Recognition, and Driver Condition Monitor that can sense driver fatigue. Also new is Adaptive Speed Limiter, the feature uses Traffic Sign Recognition to determine if the speed limit has changed and automatically speeds up or slows down the F-Type until the vehicle reaches the new speed limit. Safety features from 2017 should carry over and include blind-spot monitoring, Forward Collision Warning, and parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In <em><a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mclaren/570/2016/2016-motor-trend-best-drivers-car/">Motor Trend’s 2016 Best Driver’s Car</a></em> competition, we felt the 2017 F-Type SVR was the most capable F-Type ever with the new all-wheel-drive system and improved chassis: “A really satisfying car to drive on corner entry; power doesn’t seem to change the car’s balance a lot. It’s like I’m carving the friction circle.”</p>

<p>The Jag impressed us by still feeling like a rear-wheel drive car: “Its steering remains fluid, linear, and marvelously uncorrupted by torque inputs into the front wheels.” However, the eight-speed automatic lagged behind the rest: “The biggest letdown is the eight-speed automatic, which in both auto and manual modes always feels a beat behind the rest of the car. Feels unsophisticated compared with the other automatics here.”</p>

<p>In the end, the F-Type finished in ninth place out of 12 cars driven on the track and on public roads.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/f-type/2016/2016-jaguar-f-type-r-coupe-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/f-type/2016/">2016 Jaguar F-Type</a> R, the coupe’s new all-wheel-drive system improved performance by allowing the Jag to perform better in acceleration runs and in our figure-8 handling course. “While I do miss the ability to do monstrous, adolescent burnouts at the drop of a foot, the 2016 F-Type R Coupe is more fun to drive on a winding road than the car it replaces. That’s what confidence—and traction—does for you.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Jaguar’s 3.0-liter supercharged V-6’s horsepower output ranges from 340 hp to 400 hp but the torque output only ranges from 332 lb-ft of torque to 339 lb-ft.</p>

The 2018 XF’s available active safety feature suite now includes forward traffic detection and forward vehicle guidance.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xf/2018/">Jaguar XF</a> is a midsize luxury sedan slotting above the compact XE and the full-size XJ. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three engines are available in the 2018 XF including a 2.0-liter gas turbo-four with 247 hp/269 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbodiesel I-4 with 180 hp/318 lb-ft or a 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 rated at 340 hp or 380 hp and 332 lb-ft. An eight-speed automatic is the sole transmission offered across the entire XF lineup.</p>

<p>The XF’s spacious trunk can be expanded via the available 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats in the Premium and higher trims. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 XF should change much compared to the 2017 model, which was rated at 31/42 mpg city/highway for the rear-drive diesel models and 30/40 mpg with all-wheel drive. The supercharged V-6 should retain its 20/29 mpg rating for rear-drive version and the 20/28 mpg with all-wheel drive. Expect the 2.0-liter turbo-four’s EPA mileage to fall in between</p>

<p>Standard and optional features include <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a>’s InControl infotaiment system with an eight-inch touchscreen or a larger 10.2-inch unit in the InControl Pro variant, a head-up display, heated and ventilated front seats, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, a Meridian premium audio system, full LED headlights, the Adaptive Dynamics drive mode selector system, leather upholstery, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, and soft-close doors.</p>

Active safety and driver assistance features include adaptive cruise control with queue assist, automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, blind-spot warning, and lane keeping assist with driver condition monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xf/2017/2017-jaguar-xf-awd-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that regardless of the variant you choose, the XF is fun to drive, offering excellent handling thanks to its great chassis and well-tuned steering. The aluminum structure also helps keep the XF’s ride comfortable and minimize tire noise. However, the diesel engine can get noisy and the stiff suspension doesn’t fare well on rough pavement. We also noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xf/2016/2016-jaguar-xf-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a> that the infotainment system, which is displayed on an available 10.2-inch touchscreen, is quicker than before. The XF is also available with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Jaguar XF shares its engines available diesel engine with the XE and F-Pace.</p>

The optional 2.4-liter I-4 pumps out 180 hp and 175 lb-ft and is rated at 22/30 mpg with front-wheel drive and 21/29 mpg with all-wheel drive. The 1.4-liter turbo-four can only be paired with a six-speed manual and the 2.4-liter is backed by a nine-speed automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/renegade/2018/">2018 Jeep Renegade</a> Sport 4×4 (nine-speed automatic) hit 60 mph in 9.0 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 123 feet.</p>

<p>The 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/renegade/2018/">Jeep Renegade</a> received a four-star overall safety rating out of five stars from the NHTSA. In IIHS testing, the 2017 Renegade received the second highest rating of Acceptable in the driver side small overlap front test, and Good in the other crash tests. In the front crash prevention evaluation, the second highest score of Advanced was issued because the crossover reduced the speed of a 12-mph collision by 10 mph and reduced the speed of a 25-mph collision by 5 mph thanks to the optional automatic emergency braking feature found in the Advanced Technology group that also consists of forward collision warning, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, rear parking sensors, and automatic high beams. The Safety and Security group includes blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert, a security alarm, rain-sensitive wipers, HID headlights, and a tonneau cover. A rearview camera is standard.</p>

<p>The 2018 Renegade offers 18.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats and 50.8 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down.

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/jeep-renegade-2016-motor-trend-suv-of-the-year-contender/">2016 <em>Motor Trend</em> SUV of the year testing</a>, the Renegade Latitude and Trailhawk failed to make our finalist cut. We liked the Renegade’s value and interior packaging and roominess but did not care for the lack of power, sub-par transmissions, and poor off-road performance. We concluded by saying that “buyers who are able to overlook engines that feel slightly overtaxed and less than ideal transmissions will find themselves piloting a stylish cute-ute with an exceptionally spacious and well-packaged interior.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/xv-crosstrek/2015/the-big-test-2015-2016-subcompact-crossovers/">2015/2016 Big Test</a> of subcompact crossovers, the Renegade came in third place out of six. “Objectively, the Jeep is a weak performer, yet it still garnered two first-place votes, thanks to an engaging personality and a stylish, commodious cabin. But its temperamental transmission and recent stop-sale over ’software issues‘ are reasons for concern.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard not to be charmed by this little Renegade, and if FCA spent half as much time working on the nine-speed to make it smoother and more efficient as it did on the Jeep’s Easter eggs, you’d be looking at the winner,” we concluded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/grand-cherokee/2017/2017-jeep-grand-cherokee-trailhawk-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, we felt the standard V-6 offered plenty of power and the air suspension rides well on pavement. Off-road, “the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk just motored on up steep hills and frame-twisting ruts like they weren’t even there. Although many off-roaders turn their noses up at air suspensions because of a perceived lack of reliability, the Grand Cherokee Trailhawk’s didn’t exhibit any bad behavior; it rode incredibly well off-road and never bottomed out on more extreme obstacles, which is an issue exhibited by many air suspension–equipped off-roaders.”</p>

<p>“…The Grand Cherokee Trailhawk offers up some serious off-road potential and on-road comfort at a killer price,” we concluded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/grand-cherokee/2018/2018-jeep-grand-cherokee-trackhawk-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk, we were very impressed with its acceleration at the track: “The Trackhawk hit 60 mph in 3.3 seconds in our testing, beating Jeep’s claimed time of 3.5 seconds. The quickest we’ve ever hit 60 mph in Hellcat testing is 3.7 seconds, for both the Challenger and the Charger …  For SUVs, the quickest to 60 mph we tested before the Trackhawk were <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-x/2018/">Tesla Model X</a> (3.2 seconds), the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/bentayga/2018/">Bentley Bentayga</a> (3.5 seconds), the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x6/2018/">BMW X6</a> M (3.7 seconds) and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-AMG GLE 63 S Coupe 4Matic (3.9).”</p>

<p>“In the quarter-mile test, ” we continued, “the Trackhawk runs 11.7 seconds at 116.2 mph. Did you ever think we’d see the day when a production SUV runs the quarter in the 11s? That’s just crazy! Or should I say ludicrous, as the Model X when in Ludicrous mode also runs an 11.7-second quarter mile.”</p>

<p>The Trackhawk also put down a respectable braking distance and a quick figure-eight time. We concluded by saying, “I’m sure we can all agree that there’s no need for a vehicle like this. But boy, are we all happy Jeep gave it the green light. I got no problem with crazy, as long as it’s the good kind of crazy. You know, the kind that makes a supercar saturated car scribe giggle like a toddler.”</p>

<p>The Wrangler JK gets three new special-edition models for the 2018 model year: the Golden Eagle, Freedom Edition and the Altitude. <em>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler/2018/">2018 Jeep Wrangler</a> JK is the previous-generation model that will be sold alongside <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler/2018/">the all-new</a> <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler/2018/">2018 Wrangler</a>.</em></p>

<p>Key features include a choice between soft and hardtop roofs, a locking limited-slip differential, keyless entry, a nine-speaker Alpine audio system, and navigation with a 6.5-inch touchscreen.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler/2018/">Jeep Wrangler</a> JK is powered by a 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 285 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, and it can be paired to either a six-speed manual or a five-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings for the two-door model is 17/21 mpg city/highway regardless of the transmission choice. Opt for four-door Unlimited model and fuel economy ratings drop to 16/20 mpg with the manual or 16/21 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler-jk/2018/">2018 Jeep Wrangler JK</a> received a three-star rating on the front crash and rollover rating for the Unlimited and a three-star rollover rating for the two-door model (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 Wrangler JK but the 2017 model received a Good score driver’s side front small overlap and moderate front overlap test, Marginal on the side impact, and Poor on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). Two-door models scored Good only on the moderate front overlap test, Poor on the side impact test, Marginal on the driver’s side front small overlap test and Poor on the headlights test. There are no active safety features available on the 2018 Wrangler JK.</p>

<p>The two-door Wrangler JK has 12.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats and 56.5 cubic feet behind the front seats. You can also remove the rear seats on the two-door model. Unlimited models have 31.5 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 70.6 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the two-door Wrangler JK can tow up to 2,000 pounds of payload while the four-door Unlimited is rated at 3,500 pounds.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler-unlimited/2016/2016-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-rubicon-first-test-review/">2016 First Test,</a> we were impressed with the Wrangler JK’s off-road capabilty where it tackled the trails in Moab, Utah with minimal issue. The electronic nannies, while helpful, weren’t really needed anymore because the Wrangler JK has so much capability built in to it that it can crawl over nearly anything. We also put the Wrangler JK in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/land-cruiser/2016/jeep-wrangler-mercedes-benz-g550-toyota-land-cruiser-comparison/">2016 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> G550 and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/land-cruiser/2018/">Toyota Land Cruiser</a> where it placed second due to its sluggish five-speed automatic transmission and lack of power.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler-jk/2018/">Jeep Wrangler JK</a> was the first Wrangler to use the Pentastar V-6 engine.</p>

<p>With its major redesign last year, the 2018 Compass receives minimal changes. The Limited trim can now be ordered with front-wheel drive.</p>

<p>In Jeep’s six-vehicle lineup, the Compass slots above the smaller Renegade and below the more expensive Wrangler JK, Cherokee, Wrangler JL, and Grand Cherokee.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Compass Sport</strong>: The entry-level trim comes equipped with 16-inch steel wheel painted in low gloss black, the Uconnect 3 infotainment system with a 5.0-inch touchscreen and Bluetooth, a 3.5-inch instrument panel driver’s display, six-way manual front seats, a rearview camera, remote keyless entry, power adjustable and heated side view mirrors, and push-start ignition.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Compass Latitude</strong>: Moving up to the Latitude trims will get you 17-inch silver aluminum wheels, black roof rails, premium cloth and vinyl seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, rear seat A/C vents, keyless entry, and automatic headlights.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Compass Limited</strong>: Adding more tech and luxury, the Limited trim comes standard with 18-inch polished aluminum wheels, Uconnect 4 with an 8.4-inch touchscreen and SiriusXM satellite radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 7.0-inch instrument panel driver’s display, leather-trimmed seats with perforated inserts, heated eight-way power adjustable front seats, dual-zone climate control, a 115-volt power outlet, two-tone black roof, and bright roof rails.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Compass Trailhawk</strong>: The rugged Trailhawk packs 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with all-terrain tires, Active Drive Low four-wheel drive system with 20:1 crawl ratio, Selec-Terrain traction control system, off-road suspension, hill descent control, skid plates, black hood decal, and Ruby Red tow hooks.</p>

<p>Available on the Latitude trim, the Popular Equipment group adds lots of features including an eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, remote start ignition, dual-zone climate control, Uconnect 4 with a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, SiriusXM satellite radio, a 7.0-inch instrument panel driver’s display, and a 115-volt power outlet.</p>

<p>Powering all Compass models is a 180-hp, 175-lb-ft of torque 2.4-liter I-4 engine that delivers an EPA-rated 23/32 mpg city/highway with the standard six-speed manual transmission and front-wheel drive and 22/31 with all-wheel drive. When backed by the six-speed automatic (only available in front-wheel drive) the Compass is rated at 23/31 mpg. The nine-speed automatic can only be paired with all-wheel drive and delivers 22/30 mpg. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the all-wheel-drive Compass Limited hit 60 mph in a slow 10.5 seconds and hit the quarter-mile in 17.8 seconds at 76.1 mph.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/compass/2018/">2018 Jeep Compass</a> received a four-star overall safety rating out of five stars from the NHTSA. The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/compass/2018/">Jeep Compass</a> is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick for receiving the highest rating of Good in all crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test by avoiding both a 12- and 25-mph frontal collision thanks to the automatic emergency braking feature found in the Advanced Safety and Lighting group. That feature group also consists of forward collision warning, lane departure warning and lane keep assist, auto-dimming rearview mirror, automatic high beams, and HID headlights. The Safety and Security group includes blind-spot monitoring, rear-cross traffic alert, rear parking sensors, and rain-sensitive wipers.</p>

<p>The 2018 Jeep Compass offers 27.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats and 59.8 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue/2018/">Nissan Rogue</a> Sport has between 19.9 and 22.9 cubic feet behind the rear seats and between 53.3 and 61.1 cubic feet with the rear seats down. Legroom for the Compass is 41.8 inches for the front seats and 38.3 for the rear seats.</p>

<p>The Compass comes standard with the Uconnect 3 infotainment system displayed on a 5.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth and media hub that consists of two USB ports and an auxiliary port. The Uconnect 4 system can be displayed on either a 7.0-inch or 8.4-inch touchscreen and adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (SiriusXM satellite radio is optional on the 7.0-inch display and standard on the 8.4-inch display). The Uconnect 4C system (8.4-inch touchscreen) features a navigation system and adds SiriusXM Traffic Plus, Travel Link, and Guardian (remote start/stop, honk the horn, turn off the lights, and lock/unlock doors). The standard six-speaker audio system can be upgraded to a nine-speaker Beats audio system.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/no-mans-land/">three-way comparison</a> that included the Compass Trailhawk, Rogue Sport AWD, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>, the Compass finished in second place. The Compass’ acceleration was the slowest (9.4 seconds to 60 mph) and fuel economy was also the lowest of the three. The engine revs slowly and is loud and the nine-speed automatic transmission shifts slow but it smoother than in other earlier Jeep models. On the road, “The steering wheel loads up nicely through corners, and the off-road-oriented tires start to squeal far before the Jeep is ever at risk of losing grip. The Compass Trailhawk’s ride is also particularly noteworthy—it eats up harsh pavement and potholes without transmitting any of the impacts into the cabin.”</p>

<p>We didn’t care for the interior’s cheap components and seats that lacked lateral support. Off-road capability was very impressive: “Even in its default Auto mode, the Compass stomps through the off-road obstacles. Placed in Snow or Sand mode, the Jeep exhibits seemingly endless traction.”</p>

<p>“If all-wheel-drive capability is your priority, the Trailhawk might seem to be the best option. However, our winner [the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a> Crosstrek] proved to be just as capable off the beaten path while even better to drive on pavement,” we concluded.</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/jeep-compass-2018-suv-of-the-year-contender/">2018 Motor Trend SUV of the Year testing</a>, the Compass Trailhawk and Limited 4×4 did not make the finalist cut due to the lack of power and the slow-shifting transmission. However, we did like the crossover’s new styling, value, and off-road capability.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The all-new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler/2018/">2018 Jeep Wrangler</a> features an optional turbocharged engine, a redesigned interior, and the latest version of FCA’s UConnect infotainment system. <em>Now</em> c<em>alled the Wrangler JK, <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler-jk/2018/">the last-generation Wrangler will be sold alongside the new one</a>.</em></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler/2018/">Jeep Wrangler</a> is a four-wheel drive off-road-oriented SUV that’s available in a two-door layout or a four-door called the Wrangler Unlimited. Four trim levels are available on the new 2018 Wrangler.</p>

<p><strong>Wrangler Sport: </strong>The base Wrangler Sport comes with fog lights, 17-inch steel wheels, keyless start, cloth upholstery, an eight-speaker audio system, a USB port, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>Wrangler Sport S: </strong>Moving up to the Sport S adds power windows and door locks, 17-inch aluminum wheels, single-zone air conditioning, and keyless entry.</p>

<p><strong>Wrangler Sahara: </strong>Available only on the four-door Wrangler Unlimited, the Sahara trim comes standard with a 115-volt outlet in the center console, 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, dual-zone climate control, LED interior ambient lighting, FCA’s UConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, and an additional USB port for the second row.</p>

<p><strong>Wrangler Rubicon: </strong>The most off-road capable Wrangler, the Rubicon adds Dana 44 solid front and rear heavy duty axles, electronically locking front and rear differentials, a more capable four-wheel-drive system with a 4:1 low gear ratio, two-piece fender flares, and 17-inch allow wheels shod with all-terrain tires.</p>

<p>Notable options include an Alpine premium audio system, FCA’s UConnect interface with a 7.0-inch or 8.4-inch touchscreen, navigation, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, LED headlights, a 7.0-inch multi-information display, rear parking sensors, leather upholstery, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration.</p>

<p>One of the key differences between the two- and four-door Wrangler models is that the two-door seats four, but the four-door — also known as the Wrangler Unlimited — seats five. At 96.8 inches, the two-door Wrangler’s wheelbase is 21.6 inches shorter than the Unlimited’s. The breakover angle on the two-door is about 5 degrees better than the Unlimited, but the four-door’s departure angle is slightly superior at 36.1 degrees versus the two-door’s 35.9 degrees (with the 245/75R17s on the Sport trim).</p>

<p>In terms of exterior dimensions, the two-door Wrangler is significantly shorter in length at 166.8 inches versus the Unlimited, which checks in at 188.4 inches. Both the two- and four-door models are 73.8 inches wide and 73.6 inches tall.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/">Jeep</a> Wrangler is powered by a 3.6-liter V-6 with 285 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque; a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission are available. A 2.0-liter turbo-four with 270 hp and 295 lb-ft is optional and paired exclusively with the eight-speed automatic. A 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 with 260 hp and 442 lb-ft will follow in the near future and come paired exclusively with the eight-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the 3.6-liter V-6-equipped four-door Unlimited models are 17/23 mpg city/highway with the manual and 18/23 mpg with the automatic. If you’re looking for the ratings on the EPA’s site, search for what’s currently called “New Wrangler Unlimited.” Ratings for the 2.0-liter turbo-four-powered models and the new two-door Wrangler haven’t been released yet.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Jeep Wrangler yet. Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is available on the Sport S, Sahara and Rubicon trims as part of the Jeep Active Safety group.</p>

<p>The four-door 2018 Wrangler Unlimited has 31.7 cubic feet behind the second row and can be expanded to 72.4 cubic feet. Four-door models can tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/wrangler/2018/2018-jeep-wrangler-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive review</a>, we were impressed that the new Wrangler featured more on-road ride comfort without sacrificing its vaunted off-road capability. The 3.6-liter V-6, however, feels lacking on the larger four-door Wrangler Unlimited. When equipped with the optional turbo-four, the Wrangler remains plenty capable off-road. The eight-speed automatic transmission continues to be a gem with its quick and smooth shifts, and well-calibrated computer that knows what gear to be in at all times.</p>

<p>The 2018 Jeep Wrangler is the first Wrangler to utilize the new 2.0-liter turbo-four in FCA’s range.</p>

<p>Jeep changes the Cherokee’s trim lineup by adding a new Latitude Plus and Latitude with Tech Connect trims and removing the former base Sport trim and Sport Altitude trim, making the Latitude the new base trim. The High Altitude trim has also been removed from the lineup. The Trailhawk and Limited trims receive more standard features. The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/cherokee/2019/2019-jeep-cherokee-first-drive-review/">2019-model-year Cherokee</a> gets an extensive refresh with a newly available turbo-four engine.</p>

<p>The Cherokee slots in the middle of Jeep SUV and crossover lineup, positioned above the less expensive Renegade, Compass, and Wrangler JK and below the more expensive new Wrangler JL, and the flagship Grand Cherokee.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Cherokee Latitude</strong>: The base Latitude trim equips the 2.4-liter I-4 and comes standard with 17-inch aluminum wheels, a 5.0-inch center touchscreen with Uconnect 3 infotainment system with Bluetooth, a media port hub (12-volt, auxiliary, SD card, and USB ports), a 3.5-inch instrument panel driver’s display, a five-mode traction control system (4×4 only), automatic HID headlights, fog lights, a rearview camera, a six-way manual driver’s seat, and roof rails.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Cherokee Latitude with Tech Connect</strong>: The Latitude with Tech Content adds an 8.4-inch touchscreen with Uconnect 3C and navigation, 4G connectivity, an Alpine premium audio system, 18-inch aluminum wheels, and Gloss Black exterior accents. This trim also adds Alexa with a free Echo Dot and a three-month trial to Audible and Amazon Music.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Cherokee Latitude Plus</strong>: Building off the Latitude’s features, the Latitude Plus trim makes the 3.2-liter V-6 available and adds an 8.4-inch touchscreen with Uconnect 3C and Uconnect Access, SiriusXM satellite radio, quick entry with push-start ignition, leather and cloth seating, an eight-way power driver’s seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a fold-flat front passenger seat.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Cherokee Limited</strong>: Moving up to the Limited trim, the Cherokee receives a larger 7.0-inch instrument panel driver’s display, 18-inch aluminum wheels, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats and steering wheel, a power liftgate, remote vehicle start, rear parking sensors, and blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Cherokee Trailhawk</strong>: Enhancing off-road capability, the rugged Trailhawk adds 17-inch polished and painted off-road aluminum wheels with all-terrain tires, the Active Drive Lock 4×4 system with Selec-Terrain drive modes including Rock mode, upgraded off-road suspension, a 1.0-inch suspension lift, skid plates, accent-colored tow hooks, a unique off-road fascia, and exclusive Trailhawk seats with Nappa leather-trimmed bolsters and Ruby Red accent stitching.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Cherokee Overland</strong>: Adding to the Cherokee Limited’s features, the top Overland trim comes standard with an 8.4-inch touchscreen with Uconnect 3C with navigation, 18-inch polished aluminum wheels, body-color fascia and cladding, heated and ventilated Nappa leather-trimmed front seats, a premium leather-wrapped instrument panel, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood trim, eight-way power passenger’s seat, and a nine-speaker Alpine premium audio system. The 3.2-liter V-6 becomes standard on the Overland with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>If you plan to do some serious off-roading in your Cherokee, opt for the Heavy Duty Protection package that consists of skip plates for the fuel tank, front suspension, transmission, and underbody (also includes a full-size spare tire).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/cherokee/2018/">2018 Jeep Cherokee</a>’s standard engine is a 2.4-liter I-4 that produces 184-hp and 171 lb-ft of torque and is backed by a nine-speed automatic transmission routing power to the front wheels or to an all-wheel drive system. With two-wheel drive, the engine delivers an EPA-rated 21/30 mpg city/highway, 21/28 mpg with the Active Drive I all-wheel-drive system, 21/27 mpg with the Active Drive II four-wheel-drive system, and 19/25 mpg in the four-wheel-drive-equipped Trailhawk. Also backed by a nine-speed automatic, the 271-hp, 239-lb-ft 3.2-liter V-6 delivers 21/29 mpg with front-wheel drive, 20/27 mpg with the Active Drive I system, 18/26 mpg with the Active Drive II system, and 18/24 in the Trailhawk. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the Cherokee Latitude with Active Drive II hit 60 mph in 6.8 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 122 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/cherokee/2018/">Jeep Cherokee</a> received a four-star overall safety rating out of five stars from the NHTSA. In IIHS testing, the 2018 Cherokee was issued the second-lowest rating of Marginal for the driver-side small overlap front crash test and the highest rating of Good in four other crash tests. The Cherokee received the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test by avoiding a 12 mph collision and reducing the speed of a 25 mph collision by 12 mph. The SafetyTec group (available on Latitude Plus) includes the following driver assist safety features: blind-spot monitoring, rear-cross traffic alert, and rear parking sensors. The Technology group (available on the Limited, Overland, and Trailhawk trims) consists of forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, and a self-parking system.</p>

<p>The Cherokee can hold between 26.4 and 29.1 cubic feet of cargo behind the rear seats (depending on the position of the slidable rear seats) and 54.9 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down (58.9 cubic feet with the optional fold-flat front passenger seat). The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/escape/2018/">Ford Escape</a> tops that with 34.0 and 68.0 cubic feet, respectively. The front seats offer 41.1 inches of legroom and 40.3 inches for the rear seats.</p>

<p>The 2018 Cherokee’s standard infotainment system consists of a 5.0-inch touchscreen with Uconnect 3 with Bluetooth, and a media hub (12-volt outlet, auxiliary, SD card, and USB ports). The upgraded system features an 8.4-inch screen with the Uconnect 3C system, SiriusXM satellite radio, an additional USB port, and can be optioned with a navigation system (also includes SiriusXM Traffic and Travel) and 4G connectivity. The standard instrument panel driver’s display is 3.5 inches but can upgraded to a 7.0-inch display. A nine-speaker Alpine premium audio system is optional (standard on Overland) and replaced the standard six-speaker system. The Technology group consists of a suite of driver assist safety features and a self-parking system.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/cherokee/2016/2016-jeep-cherokee-v-6-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Cherokee Latitude with Active Drive II (V-6), the Jeep handled its heavyweight well and feels quick around town. At the track, acceleration was on par with some turbo-four rivals and braking was strong. The nine-speed automatic has improved but still delivers some rough shifts. Handling dynamics are similar to a true SUV—top heavy and tippy—and not fun like some competitors. The liftover height for the cargo area and access to the rear seats is high but rear seat space is good. The interior is nicely detailed but the “build quality isn’t quite as detailed, and we noticed several small squeaks and rattles on rougher pavement.”</p>

<p>“Whether it’s the unmistakable styling or the unstoppable attitude, there’s just something endearing about the Jeep Cherokee that makes you want to love it,” we wrote. “If we’re being rational, we might say the poor small front overlap crash test result might outweigh the overachieving (but low for the segment) fuel economy (Real MPG scored it at 21.8/28.1/24.2 mpg city/highway/combined compared to the EPA’s 19/26/22), but car purchases are often emotional choices, and this Jeep just gets us. When everything else is a car on stilts, a crossover that actually drives like an SUV is special to the right kind of person.”</p>

<p>However, in a more mainstream-consumer-focused <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2016/small-crossover-comparison-big-test/">2016/2017 Big Test of nine small crossovers</a>, the Jeep Cherokee came in last place: “Were the criteria for Big Test less consumer-oriented and more enthusiast-oriented, odds are this Jeep would be much higher on this list.”</p>

<p>“As much as we all liked our V-6-powered Jeep Cherokee Latitude tester’s styling and off-road ability, we relegated it to ninth place because of poor crash test scores, high cost of ownership, and low fuel economy.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/soul/2018/">2018 Kia Soul</a> gets the UVO3 interface and automatic climate control as standard on all trims. Active safety features such as automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control are now available on the Plus trim with the optional Primo package.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/soul/2018/">Kia Soul</a> is a tall compact wagon that comes exclusively in front-drive configuration. In addition to the gas-powered models, the Soul is also available as an EV model with an EPA-estimated range of 93 miles on a single charge.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Soul offers three engines (in addition to the electric model) including a base 1.6-liter I-4 with 130 hp and 118 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter I-4 rated at 161 hp and 150 lb-ft, and a turbocharged 1.6-liter I-4 with 201 hp and 195 lb-ft. A six-speed manual is standard on the base 1.6-liter and a six-speed automatic is optional. The 2.0-liter I-4 comes exclusive with a six-speed automatic while the 1.6-liter turbo-four is paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. EPA fuel economy ratings for the base model are 24/30 mpg city/highway with the manual or 25/30 mpg with the automatic. The 2.0-liter is rated at 25/30 and the turbocharged 1.6-liter I-4 is rated at 26/31 mpg, making it the most fuel efficient Soul despite also being the most powerful. Thanks to its boxy shape, the 2018 Soul has 24.2 cubic feet of space behind the 60/40 split-folding rear seats and it can be expanded to 61.3 cubic feet. However, when it’s equipped with the removable underfloor tray, it drops to 18.8 cubic feet and 49.5 cubic feet, respectively.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base 2018 Soul include 16-inch alloy wheels, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/">Kia</a>’s UVO3 interface, a six-speaker audio system, cloth upholstery, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, a USB port, and Bluetooth. Higher trim levels can be had with a rearview camera, HID headlights, LED fog lights, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a 4.3-inch multi-information display, navigation, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, additional USB ports, keyless entry/start, and alloy wheels up to 18 inches in diameter.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Soul a five-star overall safety score (out of a possible five stars). Although the IIHS hasn’t crash tested the 2018 Soul, a 2017 model received a Good score on all crash worthiness tests (Good is the highest possible score). When equipped with the Primo package, the mid-grade Soul Plus gets adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and forward collision warning. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are bundled separately and are available on the Plus and Exclaim trims.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think<br/></strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/soul/2014/2014-kia-soul-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>, we said that the Soul offers excellent interior space thanks to its boxy shape. Additionally, the cabin stays quiet on the highway and the ride is comfortable. However, the 2.0-liter I-4’s power is merely adequate, making it feel like it’s struggling going uphill.</p>

<p>The turbocharged Soul Exclaim gives the Soul the power it needs and uses a dual-clutch transmission, which we found quick to shift in a 2017 <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/soul/2017/2017-kia-soul-turbo-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a>. Put the car into Sport mode and it keeps the car in the meat of its power band, so you’ve always got power on tap for accelerating and merging. The Soul Exclaim’s wider tires, however, do cause the cabin to get noisy on poor surfaces and the steering isn’t very communicative especially in Normal mode.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>On the Plus and Exclaim trims, the Soul can be had with speaker lights that change colors.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

A six-speed automatic sends power to the front wheels for both models. The Optima Hybrid delivers an EPA-rated 39/46 mpg and the Plug-In is rated at 38/43 mpg when operating like a hybrid but can also go up to 29 miles on all-electric power (103 mpg-e).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/optima-hybrid/2018/">2018 Kia Optima Hybrid</a> received the highest five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (the Plug-In was not tested). The 2018 Kia Optima (non-hybrid) is considered a 2018 Top Safety Pick from the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all crash tests and in the headlights evaluation, and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test by avoiding 12- and 25-mph frontal collisions thanks to the automatic emergency braking system found in the Technology package. The Technology package also adds adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, high beam assist, blind-spot monitoring, lane change assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/optima-hybrid/2018/">Kia Optima Hybrid</a> offers up to 13.4 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk while the Plug-In model offers 9.9 cubic feet thanks to the larger battery pack. The non-hybrid Optima holds up to 15.9 cubic feet of cargo space. All Optima models have 45.5 inches of legroom for the front seats and 35.6 inches for the rear seats.</p>

<p>The 2018 Optima comes well-equipped with a standard 7.0-inch center touchscreen with SiriusXM satellite radio and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, and a 4.3-inch instrument panel driver’s display. The center touchscreen can be updated to an 8.0-inch display with a navigation system, SiriusXM Traffic, and HD radio. The standard six-speaker audio system can be upgraded to a 10-speaker Harman Kardon premium sound system. The standard UVO eServices app can among other things help you find your vehicle in a parking lot, look up vehicle information and points of interest, and call for roadside assistance.</p>

<p>We have yet to test a Kia Optima Hybrid or Plug-In but we did test the similar <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2016/">2016 Hyundai Sonata</a> Hybrid in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata-hybrid/2016/2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-first-test/">First Test review</a> and concluded by saying, “At $35,550, the 2016 Sonata Hybrid isn’t cheap, but when you consider an array of features usually found on pricier cars, the price starts making sense. Except for minor fit and finish issues and non-linear brakes, the Sonata Hybrid is a solid proposition, offering value, fuel efficiency, a smooth powertrain, and a well-appointed interior. In fact, the hybrid delivers similar levels of performance as its gas-only siblings but with the bonus of stellar fuel economy.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata-plug-in/2016/2016-hyundai-sonata-plug-hybrid-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the Optima Plug-In’s sibling, the similar <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2018/">Hyundai Sonata</a> Plug-In, we said, “The Sonata PHEV offers a great blend of fuel efficiency, power, generous EV-only range, and user-friendly technology.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/stinger/2018/">2018 Kia Stinger</a> is an all-new model for the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/">Kia</a> brand and is its first sports sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/stinger/2018/">Kia Stinger</a> is a midsize sports four-door that features a fastback roofline and a large hatch. Rear-wheel drive comes standard and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>

<p><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,n,t){var o,c=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];e.getElementById(t)||(o=e.createElement(n),o.id=t,o.src="//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.2",c.parentNode.insertBefore(o,c))}(document,"script","facebook-jssdk");</script></p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The Stinger is offered with two engines including a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 255 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 with 365 hp and 376 lb-ft. Both engines are paired exclusively to an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

Rear-drive models come standard with a mechanical limited-slip differential, while all-wheel-drive-equipped cars have torque vectoring control instead. The Stinger is also the first Kia to feature an adaptive suspension system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Kia Stinger. Available active safety features include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, lane keeping assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and driver attention assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We have yet to drive the production-spec 2018 Kia Stinger but we expect it to be a car that should drift easily in rear-drive guise, as we noted on our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/kia-stinger-gt-first-look/">First Look</a>. The rear-drive 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6-equipped Stinger GT should be the most potent and driver-focused variant of the Korean brand’s first sports sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Kia Stinger’s exterior design was inspired by the GT Concept that first debuted at the 2011 Frankfurt auto show.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sedona/2018/">Kia Sedona</a> is a front-drive minivan with seating for up to eight passengers and is available in five trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Sedona L</strong>: The base Sedona L comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, a sliding second row, a 5.0-inch touchscreen, a four-speaker audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port, keyless entry, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>Sedona LX</strong>: Moving up to the LX trim adds power-folding side mirrors, power sliding doors, eight passenger seating, eight-way power adjustable front seats, a 3.5-inch multi-information display, and six-speaker audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Sedona EX</strong>: Mid-level EX models adds 18-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, silver roof rails, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, tri-zone climate control, a larger 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, additional USB ports, keyless start, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Sedona SX</strong>: The second highest trim adds LED taillights, a power-operated passenger seat, ventilated front seats, an Infinity premium audio system, a drive mode selector, heated second row seats, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>Sedona SXL: </strong>As the most luxurious variant of the Sedona, the SXL trim adds HID headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels, a mesh grille, a heated steering wheel, and a 360-degree view camera system. Nappa leather upholstery, dual sunroofs, and second-row captain’s chairs are optional only on the SXL.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sedona is powered exclusively by a 3.3-liter V-6 with 276 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 18/24 mpg city/highway for the L, LX and EX trims. The SX trim is the most efficient at 18/25 mpg while the range-topping SXL grade is the least efficient at 17/22 mpg.</p>

<p>In NHTSA testing, the 2018 Sedona received a five-star overall rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to fully test the 2018 Sedona but the 2017 model received a Good score on five crashworthiness tests, and in the headlights test, the 2017 model received a Poor rating (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Sedona received a Superior rating after it avoided 12- and 25-mph collisions (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Sedona received the 2017 Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Active safety and driver assistance features are available on the LX trim and higher and it includes lane departure warning, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/cadenza/2018/">2018 Kia Cadenza</a> has 33.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, 78.4 cubic feet behind the second row, and 142 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the 2018 Sedona can tow up to 3,500 pounds.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sedona/2015/2015-kia-sedona-sxl-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, we said it offers a comfortable ride and respectable handling for its size. The second row, especially with the optional captain’s chairs, offer high levels of comfort. However, the third row is on the tight side, particularly with the sunroof that eats into passenger head room. There’s also a lack of folding second row seat stowage, which means the Sedona isn’t as practical as rivals such as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2018/">Chrysler Pacifica</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/town-&amp;-country/2015/the-big-test-2014-2015-minivans/">2015 comparison tes</a>t that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/sienna/2018/">Toyota Sienna</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/odyssey/2018/">Honda Odyssey</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Quest, and the recently discontinued <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> Town &amp; Country, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/">Kia</a> Sedona won because of its combination of style, comfort, and respectable driving dynamics. Its interior was also the best of the bunch with high quality materials all around, Nappa leather upholstery, and a comfortable second row.</p>

<p>The optional second-row captain’s chairs on the 2018 Sedona were inspired by long haul first class seats on airplanes.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sorento/2018/">2018 Kia Sorento</a>’s base L trim receives a rearview camera and auto on/off headlights, and the LX 2.4 model now offers a Cool &amp; Connected package.

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/28 mpg city/highway for the base 2.4-liter in front-drive guise and 21/25 mpg with all-wheel drive. The 2.0-liter turbo-four is slightly less efficient at 20/27 mpg with front-wheel drive and 19/25 mpg with all-wheel drive. Models with the V-6 are the least efficient at 18/25 mpg in front-drive configuration and 17/23 mpg in all-wheel-drive guise.</p>

<p>The base L trim comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, a six-speaker audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, cloth upholstery, a USB port, a rearview camera, and 40/20/40 spit-folding second row seats. Higher trim levels can be had with a larger 7.0- or 8.0-inch touchscreen, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/">Kia</a>’s UVO multimedia interface, navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, an Infinity premium audio system, additional USB ports, a surround view camera system, HID headlights, leather or Nappa leather upholstery, keyless entry/start, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, dual-zone climate control, a heated steering wheel, and a panoramic sunroof.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Sorento a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS evaluations, 2018 Sorento received a Good score on all but the new headlights test where it received an Acceptable score (Good is the highest possible score). Thanks to its strong performance on the front crash prevention test where it avoided a 12- and 25-mph collision, the 2018 Sorento receive a Superior rating (Superior is the highest score in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the crossover was awarded the Top Safety Pick+ rating</p>

<p>On all but the base L trim, a full suite of active driver assistance and safety features is available or standard equipment. The tech includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are only available on certain trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sorento/2016/2016-kia-sorento-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we noted that the 2.0-liter turbo-four suffers from slow throttle response but features plenty of torque for passing; however, it was barely quicker than the base 2.4-liter in our acceleration tests. The larger V-6 engine offers significantly better acceleration but its driving dynamics remain similar to four-cylinder-equipped models, meaning it’s easy to maneuver thanks to its tight turning radius. Interior noise levels are kept in check with minimal road and wind noise entering the cabin. Ride comfort, on the other hand, is excellent thanks to a revised suspension while handling veers more towards relaxed than sporty Material quality, especially in the SX Limited trim, is excellent, and the infotainment system is user-friendly. With the third row in place, cargo space does take a hit and it’s best suited for children on long trips.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Sorento’s optional 2.0-liter turbo-four is also used in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/optima/2018/">Kia Optima</a> and Sportage, and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2018/">Hyundai Sonata</a> and Santa Fe Sport.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The biggest news for the 2018 Niro is that the Touring model now comes standard with HID headlights, Autonomous Emergency Braking, a Forward Collision Warning system, a Lane Keep Assist system, adaptive cruise control, and a wireless phone charger. The new Touring Graphite Edition includes Platinum Graphite paint, Glossy Black 18-inch wheels, Glossy Black roof rails, metallic colored grille, 10-way power driver’s seat with adjustable lumbar, and an 8.0-inch display screen with navigation and a Harmon Kardon premium audio system. The Lane Keep Assist system is now included in the Advanced Technology package and an auto-dimming rearview mirror is now standard on the EX model.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Niro hybrid is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/">Kia</a>’s hybrid-only crossover-like front-drive hatchback that carries a base price that’s about the same as that of the Optima sedan and Sportage crossover. In Kia’s two-car hybrid lineup, the Niro slots below the Optima Hybrid. The <strong>Niro Plug-In Hybrid</strong> debuts for the 2018 model year, and will slot below the Optima Plug-In Hybrid in price.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/niro/2018/">2018 Kia Niro</a> is powered by a hybrid powertrain consisting of a 104-hp, 109-lb-ft of torque 1.6-liter I-4 engine paired to a 43-hp, 125-lb-ft of torque electric motor that has a combined power output of 139 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed dual-clutch automatic routes power to the front wheels. The base <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/niro/2018/">Kia Niro</a> FE delivers an impressive EPA-rated 52/49 mpg city/highway but mid-level Niros are rated at 51/46 mpg. The range-topping Touring model has the lowest fuel economy rating at 46/40 mpg. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the Kia Niro hit 60 mph in 8.7 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 134 feet.</p>

<p>The Niro FE comes standard with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, 16-inch wheels, automatic headlights, rear spoiler, matte black front grille, a 4.2-inch instrument cluster display, woven and knit cloth seats, six-way adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, and Drive Mode Select (Active Eco and Sport modes). At the top end of the Niro range is the Touring model, which comes loaded with 18-inch alloy wheels, power-folding heated side-view mirrors, Gloss Black front grille, power moonroof, satin chrome inside door handles, leather upholstery, 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat, heated and ventilated front seats, leather-wrapped and heated steering wheel, rear A/C vents, an 8.0-inch touchscreen with navigation, an eight-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system, rear USB charger, and a wireless phone charger.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Kia Niro is available with a suite of driver assist safety features: Autonomous Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection, Forward Collision Warning, Lane Keep Assist, and adaptive cruise control are standard on the Touring model and optional on the LX and EX models (not available on the FE model). Blind-spot monitoring with Lane Change Assist and rear cross traffic alert are standard on the EX and Touring models (not available on the FE or LX models). A rearview camera is standard;  front and rear parking sensors are standard on the Touring model.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/niro/2017/2017-kia-niro-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Kia Niro, we praised it for its non-hybrid looks, smooth shifting six-speed dual-clutch, and flat-folding rear seats. We also appreciated the seamless shift between EV mode and hybrid mode and felt the Niro had good regenerative braking. Interior space is good for a small crossover-like hatch and we appreciated all the available driver assist safety features. Negatives include too much wind noise. “Kia has a solid strategy, but time will tell whether the Niro wins a piece of the hybrid market.”</p>

<p>When we drove a Kia Niro again for a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/niro/2017/2017-kia-niro-hybrid-first-test-review/">First Test review</a>, we liked the quick acceleration for the segment and the good fuel economy, but the Prius does offer better fuel economy. We liked the smooth transition from EV to gas power and the hybrid’s Sport mode. Braking performance at the track was not that good and there was too much tire noise, but the ride was comfortable and interior space was good for passengers. We concluded by saying, “The Niro hybrid isn’t a standout performer, but there is value in its pricing, and there’s lots of room for your Uber or Lyft passengers. When you’re ready to appreciate the Niro’s longer driving range and quiet city operation, Kia finally has something to offer buyers who don’t want the segment’s most popular entry: the Prius.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Kia Niro shares the same powertrain and platform as the smaller <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/ioniq/2018/">Hyundai Ioniq</a> that delivers an impressive 57/59 mpg city/highway (Blue model), topping the Niro FE model that manages 52/49 mpg.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/">Kia</a> expands the Forte sedan’s features-list by adding cruise control as standard on the base LX model and including UVO3 with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay on the Popular package. The S model receives a new 16-inch alloy wheel design, the Technology package now includes a moonroof and the Premium package has been discontinued. Kia also expands the Forte’s safety features by adding rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot monitoring with Lane Change Assist as standard on the top EX model. The Forte5 hatchback will likely receive similar updates.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>Kia’s compact Forte sedan is positioned above the subcompact Rio but below the large and more expensive Optima, Cadenza, Stinger, and K900 sedans. The Forte has a similar starting price as the Soul, Kia’s crossover-like hatchback.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Powering the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/forte/2018/">2018 Kia Forte</a> LX and S sedans is a 147-hp, 132 lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter I-4 engine that delivers 25/34 mpg city/highway when backed by a standard six-speed manual transmission and 29/37 mpg with a six-speed automatic. Found in the range-topping EX sedan is a direct-injection 2.0-liter I-4 that produces 164 hp and 151 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 25/33 mpg with the six-speed automatic (not available with the manual transmission).</p>

<p>The Forte5 hatchback uses the 164-hp 2.0-liter I-4 paired to the six-speed automatic in the base LX and EX trims and comes rated at 25/34 mpg. The top SX model packs a 1.6-liter turbocharged I-4 that pumps out 201 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 25/30 mpg with the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and 23/29 mpg with the six-speed manual. The Forte and Forte5 are only available in front wheel drive.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/forte/2018/">Kia Forte</a> is available with 17-inch alloy wheels, LED daytime running lights, HID headlights that turn in the direction the car is traveling, LED taillights, power-folding and heated side view mirrors, a power moonroof, a 4.2-inch instrument cluster display, 10-way power adjustable heated and ventilated leather front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a 7.0-inch center display with the UVO3 infotainment system and navigation and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The Forte5 is also available with all the above features as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, perimeter approach lighting, puddle lamps, gloss black side view mirrors, dual chrome exhaust finishers, Sport front and rear fascia with red accents, metal pedals, two-way power driver’s lumbar support, and soft-touch front upper door panels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Forte received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The Forte5 hatchback received five stars for the side crash test and four stars for the rollover evaluation (an overall rating has not been issued). The 2017 Forte sedan is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ – the IIHS’ highest award – because the sedan received the highest score of Good in all five crash test evaluations and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test by avoiding a frontal  collision in 12- and 25 mph tests thanks to the available Autonomous Emergency Braking system found in the Technology or Premium packages (depending on the model). Those packages also include the remaining driver assist safety features: Forward Collision Warning system, a lane departure warning system, lane keep assist system, HID headlights, blind-spot monitoring, Lane Change Assist and rear cross traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/kia-forte-2017-car-of-the-year-contender/">2017 <em>Motor Trend</em> Car of the Year testing</a>, the refreshed 2017 Kia Forte sedan did not make it as a finalist. We liked the refreshed exterior styling and loads of value but found that the acceleration and fuel economy lagged behind some competitors. The interior is not much to look at and the ride is too firm: “The Forte is a solid, well-behaved, value-priced commodity car, but it’s nothing special. Playing catch-up doesn’t get you into the finalist circle.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to direct injection (versus port injection), the 2.0-liter I-4 in the EX model produces an extra 17 hp and 19 lb-ft of torque.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/optima/2018/">2018 Kia Optima</a> receives a 7.0-inch touchscreen, blind spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert as standard equipment on all models. Laminated front windows, a 10-way power driver’s seat, and auto up/down front windows are now standard on the LX 1.6T and the LX 2.4 with the Convenience package. A new S trim has also been added, slotting just above the LX 2.4.</p>

<p>The SX Turbo model gets LED fog lights, a panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, a 10-way power front passenger seat, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/">Kia</a>’s UVO3 infotainment system as standard. Kia has also discontinued the SX Limited trim and turned it into an optional package for the SX trim of the Optima.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/optima/2018/">Kia Optima</a> is a front-drive midsize sedan slotting above the compact Forte and below the larger, full-size Cadenza. In addition to gas-powered variants, the Optima is also available as a hybrid and plug-in hybrid.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three gas engines are available in the 2018 Optima including a 2.4-liter I-4 with 185 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque, a 1.6-liter turbo-four with 178 hp and 195 lb-ft, and a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 245 hp and 260 lb-ft. A six-speed automatic transmission is paired to the base 2.4-liter I-4 and 2.0-liter turbo-four, while a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is exclusive to the 1.6-liter turbo-four. EPA fuel economy ratings are 24/34 mpg city/highway for the base 2.4-liter in LX and EX grade, 25/36 mpg for the 2.4-liter in FE trim, 28/37 mpg for the LX 1.6T and 22/31 mpg for the SX Turbo. Trunk space in the 2018 Optima is 15.9 cubic feet and can be expanded via the 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In addition to the gas engines, the <strong>Optima is also available as a hybrid</strong> that combines a 2.0-liter I-4, an electric motor, a lithium-ion battery, and a six-speed automatic. The standard Optima Hybrid is has a combined output of 192 hp and 271 lb-ft and the Optima Plug-In is rated at 202 hp and 276 lb-ft. EPA fuel economy ratings are 39/46 mpg for the standard hybrid. The Optima Plug-In is rated at 40 mpg combined and can travel up to 29 miles in EV mode thanks to a larger battery. Total range with a full tank and a fully charged battery is 610 miles according to the EPA. Opting for the hybrid powertrain does cut trunk space down to 13.4 cubic feet but retains the 60/40 split-folding rear seats. The Optima Plug-In loses more cargo space and the 60/40-split-folding rear seats due to the larger battery, cutting trunk space to 9.8 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Base models come with 16-inch alloy wheels, Kia’s UVO3 infotainment system, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a 3.5-inch multi-information display, cloth upholstery, Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, a USB port, blind spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Higher trim levels can be had with leather or Nappa leather upholstery, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, a Harman/Kardon premium audio system, a panoramic sunroof, adaptive LED headlights, alloy wheels up to 18 inches in diameter, a surround view camera system, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, keyless entry/start, a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/smart/">smart</a> trunk with a hands-free opening, and additional USB ports for fast charging.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Optima received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 model but the 2017 Optima received a Good score on all crash tests and the headlights tests (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Optima received a Superior rating after in avoided a 12- and 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest rating in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Optima received the 2017 Top Safety Pick+ award.</p>

<p>On the EX and SX trims, a suite of driver assistance and active safety features that includes automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning are available.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/optima/2016/2016-kia-optima-lx-1-6t-first-test-review/">2016 First Test of the Optima LX 1.6T</a>, we noted that the tiny little turbocharged engine didn’t give up much when it comes to acceleration thanks to a quick-shifting dual-clutch automatic. At highway speeds, however, you do need to plan your passes as the small turbo engine can feel slightly lethargic. Interior space, on the other hand, is generous with plenty of room for front and rear seat passengers. Material quality on lower trim levels is also not on par with higher grade models, especially on the base LX trim.</p>

<p>The more powerful 2.0-liter turbo-four in the SX trim didn’t have much of an advantage in terms of acceleration due to prodigious amounts of turbo lag, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/optima/2016/2016-kia-optima-sxl-2-0t-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>. Comfort levels and ride quality, on the other hand, are respectable even with the standard 18-inch alloy wheels on the SX trim.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Optima’s optional 2.0-liter turbo-four is also found in a number of vehicles including the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sorento/2018/">Kia Sorento</a> and Sportage, as well as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/sonata/2018/">Hyundai Sonata</a> and Santa Fe Sport.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/cadenza/2018/">2018 Kia Cadenza</a> gets LED interior lighting and a panoramic sunroof as part of the Luxury package.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/cadenza/2018/">Kia Cadenza</a> is a large front-drive sedan slotting above the midsize Optima and alongside the sporty Stinger in price. Above the Stinger and Cadenza is the large, luxury-minded K900.</p>

<p><strong>Cadenza Premium: </strong>The base Cadenza Premium comes well equipped with 18-inch alloy wheels, projector-beam headlights, a 3.5-inch instrument cluster display, leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, an eight-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, keyless entry and start, a rearview camera, and the Smart Trunk feature (stand behind the trunk for a few seconds with the key fob in your pocket and the trunk opens). Opting for the Luxury package gets you the 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, a panoramic sunroof, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Cadenza Technology: </strong>Moving up to the Technology trim gets you a larger 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, 19-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, rain-sensing wipers, a power-operated steering column adjuster, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, wireless phone charging, rear parking sensors, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>

<p><strong>Cadenza Limited: </strong>Range-topping Limited models built on the Technology grade with more standard features like a 360-degree view camera system, a head-up display, the Smart Trunk feature, heated outboard rear seats, Nappa leather upholstery, and a power rear sunshade.</p>

<p>The 2018 Cadenza is powered by a 3.3-liter V-6 with 290 hp and 252 lb-ft of torque, and uses an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 20/28 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The NHTSA hasn’t crash tested the 2018 Cadenza. In IIHS evaluations, the 2018 Cadenza received a Good score on all crash-worthiness tests (Good is the highest possible score). However, it only receives the Top Safety Pick rating because it only got an Acceptable rating on the headlights test.</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Cadenza received a Superior score after it avoided collisions in 12- and a 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest rating on the front crash prevention evaluation). Adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, high beam assist, lane keeping assist, lane change assist, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert comes standard on the Technology and Limited trims. The base Premium trim is available with lane change assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert when you opt for the Luxury package.</p>

<p>The 2018 Cadenza has a 16-cubic-foot trunk but it can’t be expanded because the rear seats only have ski pass through (they don’t split and fold).</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/cadenza/2017/2017-kia-cadenza-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the Cadenza’s ride comfort. However, the car’s handling isn’t as sporty as competitors like the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/maxima/2018/">Nissan Maxima</a> and has a bit more body roll. We also noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/cadenza/2017/2017-kia-cadenza-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a> that the eight-speed automatic is smooth and nearly unnoticeable while the interior stays well-insulated even at highway speeds.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sportage/2018/">2018 Kia Sportage</a> get an updated Popular package with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and automatic climate control. There’s also a new Technology package for the LX trim that adds automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane departure warning. EX models get blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert as standard while the EX Technology package for all-wheel-drive models get heated rear seats. SX variants get an electronic parking brake.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sportage is a compact crossover that slots below the larger Sorento and above the smaller Soul. Front-wheel drive comes standard while all-wheel drive is optional. It’s available in three trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Sportage LX: </strong>The base LX grade comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, a five-inch touchscreen, a 3.5-inch instrument cluster display, a six-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, keyless entry, a rearview camera, and a USB port.</p>

<p><strong>Sportage EX: </strong>Moving up to the EX grade adds a 7.0-inch touchscreen, 18-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, leather upholstery, a power-operated driver’s seat, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, a second USB port, and keyless start.</p>

<p><strong>Sportage SX Turbo: </strong>Range-topping SX Turbo models add navigation, HID headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels, the Smart power tailgate (with the key fob in your pocket, the tailgate will lift after a few seconds standing behind the car), ventilated front seats, an eight-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, a sport-tuned suspension, a flat-bottom steering wheel with paddle shifters, LED fog lights, and a heated steering wheel.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sportage LX and EX come with a 2.4-liter I-4 with 181 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque. A 2.0-liter turbo-four with 240 hp (237 hp with all-wheel drive) and 260 lb-ft is standard on the range-topping SX trim. Both engines come exclusively with a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy varies based on the trim level, front-drive LX models are rated at 23/30 mpg city/highway and the EX grade is rated at 22/29 mpg. Opting for all-wheel drive drops those ratings down to 21/25 mpg. The least efficient model is the more powerful SX grade, which is rated at 21/26 mpg for front-drive models and 20/23 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sportage received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Sportage received a Good score on all crash-worthiness tests (Good is the highest possible score). However, the crossover received an Acceptable score on the headlights test, which meant it only qualified for a Top Safety Pick rating.</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Sportage received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and a 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest score for the front crash prevention test). Active driver assistance features like automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, and lane departure warning are standard on the SX trim. Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane change alert is standard on the EX and SX trims, and part of LX Technology package, which also include lane departure warning.</p>

<p>The 2018 Sportage has 30.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats and it can be expanded to 60.1 cubic feet.</p>

<p>When properly equipped, the 2018 Sportage can tow up to 1,650 pounds of payload without a trailer and up to 2,000 pounds with one.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2263520&amp;action=edit">2017 First Test</a>, we were not impressed with the Sportage’s poor fuel economy, which was due in part to its curb weight of nearly 4,000 pounds. This means the additional grunt of the 2.0-liter turbo-four didn’t help straight-line performance as much as we’d hoped. The six-speed automatic, on the other hand, was smooth and the car features a good ride and handling balance that’s comfortable without sacrificing agility. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2016/small-crossover-comparison-big-test/">2016 crossover comparison test of nine vehicles</a>, the Sportage placed seventh because of its lackluster fuel economy, tight rear seats, and inconsistent material quality inside the cabin.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The all-new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/rio/2018/">2018 Kia Rio</a> features a more conservative exterior and a new interior that features a tablet-style touchscreen on higher trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting below the compact Forte, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/rio/2018/">Kia Rio</a> is a front-drive subcompact car <strong>available in sedan and hatchback body styles</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>A 1.6-liter I-4 with 130 hp and 119 lb-ft of torque is the only engine available in the 2018 Rio and it can be paired to either a standard six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. The manual, however, is only available on the base LX trim. EPA fuel economy ratings are 29/37 mpg city/highway for the manual and 28/37 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>There’s 13.7 cubic feet of trunk space in the Rio sedan, and 60/40 split-folding rear seats is available on the S or EX grades.

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Range Rover Land Rover comes standard with a 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 that produces 340 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 17/23 mpg city/highway.

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2017/2017-land-rover-range-rover-svautobiography-dynamic-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Range Rover SVAutobiography, we loved the effortless acceleration and said: “What that single data point doesn’t tell you, however, is how effortlessly quick the SVAutobiography Dynamic feels on the road compared with a regular full-size Range Rover. The secret sauce is not so much the 40 hp power boost, but the 41 lb-ft increase in torque to 502 lb-ft, all of which swells nicely right in the midrange of the powerband.”</p>

<p>The ride is comfortable, even with 22-inch wheels shod in low-profile tires. “The Range Rover SVAutobiography Dynamic’s interior, awash with beautifully wrought diamond quilted leather and highlighted with sparkling metalwork, is a wonderfully serene place from which to watch the world go by. The dash and door panels feature a black veneer, and the rotary shifter features a thin red band. Red anodized paddles peek out from behind the leather-clad steering wheel, unless you’ve ordered a tan interior.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/escalade/2015/the-big-test-large-luxury-suvs/">six-way full-size premium SUV comparison</a>, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2018/">Land Rover Range Rover</a> HSE placed fourth. In the comparison, we said: “Gorgeous truck, Gerry McGovern be praised. But the suspect build quality and pricey everything else leaves us cold.” Even so, we enjoyed the comfortable ride, luxurious features, and fuel efficiency (compared to competitors).</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In the upcoming 2019 P400e plug-in model, the Range Rover can operate in all-electric mode when off-roading, even when traversing in the transmission’s low range.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2018/">2018 Land Rover Range Rover</a> Evoque gets a new turbocharged four-cylinder engine from <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/">Land Rover</a>’s Ingenium family. Base SE models now come standard with auto-dimming rearview mirrors and 4G LTE connectivity has been added. Land Rover has also discontinued the slow-selling coupe variant of the Evoque. A new Landmark Edition has also been added with unique exterior and interior styling cues.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2018/">Land Rover Range Rover</a> Evoque is the smallest crossover in Land Rover’s lineup, slotting below the larger Range Rover Velar. It comes standard with four-wheel drive and is available as a four-door crossover or a two-door convertible. Six trim levels are available in the four-door and the convertible is only available in SE Dynamic and HSE Dynamic.</p>

<p><strong>Range Rover Evoque SE: </strong>The base SE trim comes standard with a leather-wrapped steering wheel, push-button start, 12-way power adjustable front seats, dual-zone climate control, front and rear parking sensors, Bluetooth, navigation, 18-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen.</p>

<p><strong>Range Rover Evoque SE Premium:</strong> Moving up to the SE Premium gets you HID headlights, keyless entry, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>Range Rover Evoque Landmark Edition: </strong>This new special edition model comes with unique 19-inch alloy wheels, gray contrast roof, a hands-free tailgate, a panoramic glass roof, an upgraded eight-speaker audio system, Graphite Atlas exterior design cues including the logo, and perforated leather upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>Range Rover Evoque HSE: </strong>The HSE grade adds a 10-speaker Meridian premium audio system, a 10.0-inch touchscreen, fog lights, heated side mirrors with memory, memory function for the front seats, heated front and rear seats, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, an upgraded navigation interface, 19-inch alloy wheels, a hands-free power tailgate and Windsor leather upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>Range Rover Evoque HSE Dynamic: </strong>The HSE Dynamic trim adds black hood louvers, square exhaust tips, and a perforated leather steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>Range Rover Evoque Autobiography: </strong>On the range-topping Autobiography trim, you get adaptive HID headlights, a full Windsor leather interior, the All Terrain Progress Control system, Satin brushed aluminum interior, illuminated kick plates, 20-inch alloy wheels, and a 16-speaker Meridian premium audio system.</p>

<p>Key options include alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, full LED headlights, a 360 degree camera system, a head-up display, parallel and perpendicular parking assist, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats with massaging function, and contrasting roof colors in grey or black.</p>

<p>The 2018 Range Rover Evoque is powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 237 hp and 251 lb-ft of torque. A high output variant with 286 hp and 295 lb-ft is available in the four-door but only on the HSE Dynamic and Autobiography trims. The only transmission available on the 2018 Evoque is a nine-speed automatic sourced from ZF. Regardless of the body style and engine output EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/29 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>Active safety tech is available as part of the Driver Assistance package on the HSE trim and higher and it includes lane keeping assist, automatic emergency braking, a driver condition monitor, lane departure warning, and traffic sign recognition. Adaptive cruise control is only available on the HSE Dynamic and Autobiography trims as part of the Driver Assistance Plus package.</p>

<p>Behind the second row, the 2018 Range Rover Evoque has 20.3 cubic feet of cargo space and that can be expanded to 51 cubic feet. The convertible has a small 8.9-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the split-folding rear seats. When properly equipped, the Evoque has a maximum towing capacity of 3,968 pounds of payload regardless of body style.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx200t/2015/the-big-test-2015-luxury-compact-crossovers/">2015 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx/2018/">Lexus NX</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkc/2018/">Lincoln MKC</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x3/2018/">BMW X3</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/xc60/2018/">Volvo XC60</a>, the Range Rover Evoque placed third thanks to its stylish, well-built interior. With the 20-inch alloy wheels, however, the ride suffers and gets harsh. On-road handling, on the other hand, is sporty and tossable.</p>

<p>Like the four-door Evoque, the convertible is capable when the trail ends. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover-evoque/2017/2017-land-rover-range-rover-evoque-convertible-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we were impressed with the Evoque convertible’s capability in the snow and in the dirt, meaning it can easily work as a four-seasons vehicle.</p>

<p>We noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover-evoque/2017/2017-range-rover-evoque-convertible-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> of the convertible that the nine-speed automatic makes it hard to modulate the throttle because it can be a little too eager. With the 20-inch alloy wheels, there’s excessive road and tire noise. Visibility is surprisingly good for a convertible with the top up. Trunk, however, is small and doesn’t hold much. The multimedia system needs work and the touchscreen is mounted low on the center stack.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover-evoque/2018/">2018 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque</a>’s new turbocharged four-cylinder engine is shared with a number of vehicles including the newly released Jaguar E-Pace crossover.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2018/">Land Rover Range Rover</a> Velar is an all-new model from the automaker and is underpinned by the aluminum-intensive D7a platform from the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xe/2018/">Jaguar XE</a> and XF sedans and the F-Pace SUV.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Range Rover Velar is positioned ahead of the entry-level Evoque but behind the Range Rover Sport and flagship Range Rover model in price. Additionally, the Velar has the same starting price as the new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery/2018/">Land Rover Discovery</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The four-door Velar will come with a choice of three engines, a 177-hp, 317-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbodiesel I-4, a 380-hp, 332-lb-ft 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 (shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> F-Pace), and a 247-hp, 269-lb-ft 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4. An eight-speed automatic transmission routes power to an all-wheel-drive system. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/">Land Rover</a> claims that the V-6 equipped Velar will hit 60 mph in 5.6 seconds.</p>

<p>The Velar First Edition (only to be sold during the first model year) is the most expensive Velar and comes standard with most of the options and features available on the Velar. The exterior sports a black contract roof with power sliding panoramic roof, LED headlights with Signature daytime running lights, 22-inch split-nine-spoke wheels with Diamond Turned finish, a First Edition badging, and auto-dimming, power-fold, heated doors mirrors with approach lights.

<p>A 10.0-inch touchscreen is now standard on all 2018 Discovery models and comes with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/">Land Rover</a>’s InControl Pro infotainment system. Automatic emergency braking is standard on all models, and both gas and diesel engine options are now available on all trims.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery/2018/">2018 Land Rover Discovery</a> is a large luxury SUV that’s capable off-road and can seat up to seven passengers with its optional two-seat third row. Three trims are offered.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery SE: </strong>The base SE trim comes with a fixed panoramic glass roof, automatic headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels, a 10-speaker audio system, 12-way adjustable front seats, rear parking sensors, leather upholstery, navigation, a 10.0-inch touchscreen, ambient lighting, dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, keyless start and a gesture-operated tailgate.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery HSE: </strong>Moving up to the HSE trim adds 20-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, full LED headlights, fog lights, keyless entry, a 10-speaker Meridian premium audio system, and front parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery HSE Luxury: </strong>The HSE Luxury trim adds a two-speed transfer case, air suspension, 16-way power front seats with driver’s side memory, Windsor leather upholstery, tri-zone climate control, configurable ambient lighting, a power-folding third row, and a 14-speaker Meridian premium audio system.</p>

<p>Notable options include heated and ventilated front seats, heated second row seats, four-zone climate control, a heated steering wheel, a 360-degree view camera system, Land Rover’s All Terrain Progress Control system, heated third row seats, massaging front seats, and an active locking rear differential.</p>

<p>The 2018 Discovery is powered by either a gas 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 with 340 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque or a 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 with 254 hp and 443 lb-ft for the SE, HSE, and HSE Luxury models. SVX models come powered by a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 rated at 518 hp and 461 lb-ft. All variants come exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings haven’t been released for the 2018 Discovery but the 2017 model was rated at 16/21 mpg city/highway for the gas engine and 21/26 mpg for the diesel.</p>

<p>Automatic emergency braking comes standard on all 2018 Discovery SUVs. Driver condition monitor, adaptive cruise control, and traffic sign recognition are available on all models as part of the Drive and Drive Pro packages. Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane keeping assist are added to the Drive and Drive Pro packages on the HSE and HSE Luxury trims.</p>

<p>Seven-seat variants of the 2018 Discovery have 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row and that can be expanded to 40.2 cubic feet behind the second row and 85 cubic feet behind the front seats. Five-seat models have 43.5 cubic feet behind the second row and 88.3 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the gas-powered Discovery can tow up to 8,201 pounds of payload while the diesel is rated at 7,716 pounds.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery/2017/2017-land-rover-discovery-review/">2017 review</a>, we said that the Discovery offers excellent off-road performance despite moving to a unibody platform. On pavement, the Discovery drives smaller than it looks thanks to its good steering and independent suspension. Due to its size, the Discovery’s handling isn’t as confidence inspiring and the SUV can feel sloppy.</p>

<p>Inside, we noted that the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery/2017/2017-land-rover-discovery-first-drive-review/">Discovery’s</a> third row is usable for adults and that the second row can slide forward and back, giving it better flexibility. We did note, however, that the diesel engine is lacking and needs more grunt to improve its passing power. When it comes to smoothness, on the other hand, the diesel engine is more linear and doesn’t lurch from a stop like the gas engine does. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery/2017/2017-land-rover-discovery-first-test-civilized-beast/">2017 First Test review</a>, we said that the interior is well-appointed, feels premium, and has plenty of storage spaces.</p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/land-rover-discovery-svx-serious-off-roader/">Land Rover Discovery SVX</a> is a nearly-production-ready concept that’s powered by a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 with more than 500 horsepower.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery/2018/">2018 Land Rover Discovery</a> Sport gets a new 2.0-liter turbo-four from <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/">Land Rover</a>’s Ingenium engine family. Two new exterior colors, Byron Blue and Namib Orange, replace Loire Blue and Phoenix Orange. Four-way lumbar support is now standard on the Discovery Sport.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery/2018/">Land Rover Discovery</a> Sport is a compact luxury crossover that slots below the larger Discovery and comes with standard all-wheel drive. Three trim levels are offered on the 2018 Discovery Sport.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery SE: </strong>The base Discovery Sport SE comes standard with the Terrain Response system, partial leather seats, 18-inch alloy wheels, a 10-speaker audio system, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, three USB ports, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, and Bluetooth.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery HSE: </strong>Jumping to the HSE trim adds keyless entry/start, front parking sensors, a fixed panoramic glass roof, a gesture-operated power tailgate, leather upholstery, 10-way power front seats, fog lights, and HID headlights.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery HSE Luxury: </strong>The range-topping HSE Luxury adds configurable mood lighting, 19-inch alloy wheels, navigation, a 10-speaker Meridian premium audio system, and Windsor leather upholstery.</p>

<p>Notable options include heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a 360-degree view camera system, a two-seat third row, a head-up display, and a WiFi hotspot.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery-sport/2018/">2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport</a> is powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 237 hp and 251 lb-ft of torque. A higher-output variant with 286 hp and 295 lb-ft is available on the HSE and HSE Luxury trims. A nine-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox available. EPA fuel economy estimates haven’t been released yet but it should be slightly better than the 2017 model’s 20/25 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Discovery Sport. On the HSE and HSE Luxury trims, active safety tech is optional and includes lane keeping assist, driver condition alert, automatic emergency braking, and traffic sign recognition. Adaptive cruise control is available exclusively on the range-topping HSE Luxury trim.</p>

<p>Behind the second row, there’s 34.6 cubic feet of cargo space that can be expanded to 62.7 cubic feet. The optional third row eats up the cargo space behind the second row and leaves barely any room for your gear. When properly equipped, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/discovery-sport/2018/">Land Rover Discovery Sport</a> can tow up to 4,409 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-land-rover-discovery-sport-first-test-review/">2015 First Test</a>, we noted that the Discovery Sport felt strained on the road and that the nine-speed automatic feels jerky and has inconsistent shift quality. Handling is acceptable with the crossover’s quick and accurate steering but it does have a stiff ride. Interior quality, however, is lacking and there’s  excessive noise entering the cabin at high speeds. Off the pavement, the Discovery Sport performs reasonably well, provided you pick the right mode before you venture off the beaten path.</p>

<p>The 2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport is available in front-wheel drive configuration in other world markets.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rx/2018/">2018 Lexus RX</a> gets an updated Lexus Enform telematics system on all models.  Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert can now be had as standalone options on the RX 350 and RX 450h. Navigation, heated and ventilated front seats, and a moonroof are available as standalone options on the RX 450h. A new Premium package option on the RX 450h adds power-folding side mirrors with memory, wood interior trim, leather upholstery, driver’s seat memory, and a rear center armrest with a storage bin.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rx/2018/">Lexus RX</a> is a midsize five-seat crossover that slots above the compact NX and the larger, more capable GX. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. An all-wheel-drive hybrid variant called the RX 450h is also offered at a premium above the RX 350.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Lexus RX comes with two powertrain options including the <strong>RX 350</strong>‘s 3.5-liter V-6 with 295 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission or the <strong>RX 450h</strong>‘s hybrid system that combines the V-6 with three electric motors, a nickel metal hydride battery, and a CVT for a total output of 308 hp.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 20/27 mpg city/highway for the front-drive RX 350 and 19/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. Even though it comes standard with all-wheel drive, the RX 450h is the most efficient at 31/28 mpg.</p>

<p>The 2018 RX 350 has 18.4 cubic feet behind the split-folding rear seats and it can be expanded to 56.3 cubic feet. Due to the additional hybrid powertrain components, the RX 450h has slightly less cargo space at 18 cubic feet behind the second row and 55.9 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the 2018 Lexus RX can tow up to 3,500 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, keyless entry/start, leatherette upholstery, 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats, 10-way power adjustable front seats, dual-zone climate control, an 8.0-inch screen, a rearview camera, a power lift gate, and Bluetooth connectivity.  Options include navigation, a larger 12.3-inch screen, a Mark Levinson premium audio system, a panoramic sunroof, touch-free power liftgate, triple-beam LED headlights, 20-inch alloy wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheels, semi-aniline leather upholstery, and a rear seat entertainment system with two 11.6-inch screens.</p>

<p>The F Sport package adds 20-inch alloy wheels, an active sound generator, an adaptive variable suspension system, a Sport+ mode, black side mirror covers, a black headliner, an F Sport steering wheel, F Sport gauges, heated and ventilated F Sport seats, a more aggressive front fascia, paddle shifters and an F Sport-specific suspension setup.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave all variants of the 2018 Lexus RX a five-star safety rating except for the front-drive RX 350, which received four stars (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 RX but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crash tests and Average on the new headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the RX received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and a 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest possible rating in the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>All variants of the 2018 RX come standard with the Lexus Safety System+ suite which bundles together automatic high beams, lane departure warning with steering assist, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and pedestrian detection. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are available as standalone options.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkx/2016/2016-lexus-rx-mercedes-benz-glc-lincoln-mkx-comparison/">2016 comparison test</a>, the Lexus RX placed third due to the F Sport model’s tendency to get jarring over rough road surfaces, outdated graphics on its multimedia system, and overly complicated infotainment controls. Additionally, the stiffer suspension in the RX 350 F Sport didn’t translate to better handling; the crossover exhibited too much body roll and didn’t feel planted. We did note in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rx350/2016/2016-lexus-rx-350-f-sport-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a> review that the RX’s luxurious interior has comfortable seats up front and in the back. The front seats, in particular, offer excellent comfort levels. However, the interior isn’t as well-insulated as one would expect of a Lexus vehicle.</p>

<p>The more powerful RX 450h, with its 308-hp hybrid system, offers better off-the-line acceleration thanks to its electric motors but with superior fuel economy compared to the gas-only RX 350, as we observed in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2016-lexus-rx-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a> review.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Lexus RX’s base 3.5-liter V-6 is shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/sienna/2018/">Toyota Sienna</a> and Highlander.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/is/2018/">Lexus IS</a> is a compact premium sports sedan available in rear- or all-wheel drive configuration. With the discontinuation of the CT 2ooh hatchback, the IS is now the entry-level model in the Lexus lineup, slotting below the larger GS and ES sedans.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 2018 Lexus IS is available with two engines, a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 241 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque in the IS 300 RWD or a 3.5-liter V-6 with 260 hp and 236 lb-ft in the IS 300 AWD or 311 hp and 277 lb-ft in the IS 350. Rear-drive models come exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission while all-wheel drive models are equipped with a six-speed automatic. EPA fuel economy ratings are 22/32 mpg city/highway for the IS 300 RWD, 19/28 mpg for the IS 350, and 19/26 mpg for the IS 300 AWD and IS 350 AWD. Trunk space is on the small side at 10.8 cubic feet but it can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

Options include navigation with a 10.3-inch screen, a Mark Levinson premium audio system, leather upholstery, adaptive headlights, parking sensors, heated/ventilated front seats, memory for the front seats, and a heated steering wheel. F Sport models come with unique 18-inch alloy wheels, F Sport suspension, F Sport seats, an LFA-inspired gauge cluster, and aluminum pedals. The IS 350 F Sport gets more go fast goods such as a limited-slip differential and an adaptive F Sport suspension with a Sport+ mode.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 2018 Lexus IS received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 model but the 2017 IS received a Good score on side impact, roof strength, and moderate front overlap crashes, and an Average on the small front overlap and headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Lexus IS received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest possible score in the front overlap crash test).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Standard on all 2018 Lexus IS models is the Lexus Safety System+ suite of active driver assistance and safety features that bundles together forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, and lane departure warning with steering assist.

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/ls/2018/">2018 Lexus LS</a> is all-new and now rides on the new GA-L platform that first appeared on the LC coupe. In addition to the gas-powered variant, there’s also a hybrid model.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The flagship of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/">Lexus</a> lineup, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/ls/2018/">Lexus LS</a> is a full-size sedan available with a gas or hybrid powertrain. As with the previous generations, the new model comes standard with rear-wheel drive but all-wheel drive will likely be added as an option on the <strong>gas-powered LS 500</strong>. The <strong>hybrid model is called LS 500h</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Compared to the outgoing model, the 2018 Lexus LS is much larger. The 2018 model is longer than the long-wheelbase version of the outgoing car. The previous model’s V-8 engine has also been replaced by a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 rated at 415 hp and 442 lb-ft of torque. A 10-speed automatic transmission replaces the old eight-speed unit. The hybrid model returns but is now makes use of a 3.5-liter V-6 coupled to an electric motor, a lithium-ion battery, a CVT and a four-speed automatic. Total output stands at 354 hp.</p>

<p>The F Sport trim receives 20-inch alloy wheels, larger brakes measuring 15.7 inches up front and 14.1 inches in the back and summer performance tires for the rear-drive LS 500 F Sport. An optional Handling package adds variable gear ratio steering, active rear steering, an active stabilizer, and a sport-tuned air suspension. F Sport variants also receive a revised spindle grille, rocker panels, trunk moldings, F Sport exclusive front seats, a unique F Sport steering wheel, an LFA-inspired gauge cluster, aluminum pedals, and Ultrasuede upholstery. The LS 500 and LS 500h can both be had in F Sport trim.</p>

<p>Expect the 2018 LS to feature a slew of new tech including an updated multimedia system with a large screen with touchpad controls, heated, ventilated and massaging seats for front and rear passengers, rear-wheel steering, tri-beam LED headlights, and an intuitive pedestrian detection system than can steer the car out of pedestrians’ way.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist, and intelligent high beams should come standard in the 2018 LS as part of the Lexus Safety System+ suite of active safety and driver assistance features. Expect other features such as blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and lane keeping assist to also be available.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We haven’t driven the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/ls/2018/2018-lexus-ls-first-look-building-a-bolder-flagship/">2018 Lexus LS</a> yet but we expect it to be a more luxurious car than its predecessor. The hybrid variant should be more fuel efficient as it has ditched the 5.0-liter V-8 in favor of a 3.5-liter V-6 as its gas engine. Both the LS 500 and <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lc-500h/2018/2018-lexus-ls-500h-first-look-review/">LS 500h</a> should be better to drive and ride much better thanks to the new platform.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The LS 500h’s new hybrid powertrain first appeared in the LC 500h coupe</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es/2018/">2018 Lexus ES</a> gets available bi-LED headlights and all variants receive an updated <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/">Lexus</a> Enform interface. A new Premier package is now available on the ES 350.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting below the larger, rear-drive GS, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es/2018/">Lexus ES</a> is a front-drive entry-level midsize luxury sedan. Unlike the smaller, rear-drive IS, the ES is more oriented toward comfort instead of sportiness, and is also available as a four-cylinder hybrid. Lexus ES models include the <strong>ES 300h</strong> hybrid and <strong>ES 350</strong> V-6.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Lexus ES offers two powertrain options including a 3.5-liter V-6 with 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque paired to a six-speed automatic transmission in the ES 350. Go for the ES 300h and the car has a 200-hp hybrid system that couples a 2.5-liter I-4 to an electric motor and a CVT in the ES 300h. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/30 mpg city/highway for the ES 350 and 40/39 mpg for the ES 300h. Trunk space is generous in the ES 350 at 15.2 cubic feet; however, the ES 300h only has 12.1 cubic feet due to hybrid system components eating up a bit of the trunk. Neither model has split-folding rear seats, making the ES less practical than some of its competitors.</p>

<p>Standard features include keyless entry/start, Bluetooth connectivity, 10-way power adjustable front seats, leatherette upholstery, a rearview camera, LED headlights, 17-inch alloy wheels and dual-zone climate control. Options include 18-inch alloy wheels (ES 350 only), navigation, an 8.0-inch screen, a Mark Levinson premium audio system, heated and ventilated front seats, a panoramic sunroof, a power-operated trunk, leather upholstery, and ambient lighting.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Lexus ES received a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 ES but a 2017 model received a Good score on all crash tests and Average on the new headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the ES received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and 25-mpg collision (Superior is the highest score possible on the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Lexus ES got the Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS.</p>

<p>The Lexus Safety System+ safety suite comes standard and combines forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, high beam assist, adaptive cruise control, and sway warning. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are optional as part of a package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Even though it’s the less powerful variant, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es300h/2018/">Lexus ES 300h</a> offers plenty of power on tap while giving you excellent fuel economy for its size. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es300h/2017/2017-lexus-es-300h-hybrid-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the car’s spacious interior, especially the rear seats, which offer plenty of room for three across thanks to a nearly nonexistent drivetrain hump. However, like most hybrids, the brakes aren’t linear and will take time to get used to. The suspension, on the other hand, offer a comfortable ride until you get to rough surfaces where it can become bouncy.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/lacrosse/2012/2012-buick-lacrosse-hyundai-azera-2013-lexus-es-350-comparison/">2012 comparison test</a> that also included the last-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/buick/lacrosse/2018/">Buick LaCrosse</a> and the recently discontinued <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/azera/2018/">Hyundai Azera</a>, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es350/2018/">Lexus ES 350</a> ended up in third place due to its lack of sound deadening in the interior, dull driving manners, unsupportive seats and surprisingly rough ride for a Lexus.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Lexus ES was the second vehicle to join the Lexus lineup, debuting alongside the full-size LS sedan back in 1989.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lc/2018/">2018 Lexus LC</a> is a new grand touring coupe that serves as the flagship of the Japanese automaker’s lineup and is the first vehicle to use the GA-L platform.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lc/2018/">Lexus LC</a> is a rear-drive luxury coupe slotting above the smaller RC coupe, with prices starting just below $100,000. A hybrid variant is also available but all-wheel drive isn’t offered on any variant.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/">Lexus</a> LC comes in two variants, the <strong>LC 500</strong>, which is powered by a 5.0-liter V-8 with 471 hp and 398 lb-ft of torque paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission, and the <strong>LC 500h</strong>, which features a hybrid system that combines a 3.5-liter V-6, an electric motor, a nickel metal hydride battery, a CVT and a four-speed automatic for a total output of 354 hp. EPA fuel economy ratings are 16/26 mpg city/highway for the LC 500 and 26/35 mpg for the LC 500h. There’s 0nly 5.4 cubic feet of cargo space in the LC 500 and 4.7 cubic feet in the LC 500h.</p>

<p>Standard features include 20-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, leather upholstery, 10-way power front seats, an 8.0-inch multi-information display, keyless entry/start, a 12-speaker audio system, navigation with a 10.3-inch screen, and a rearview camera. Options include heated and ventilated front seats, semi-aniline leather upholstery, 21-inch alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential, a head-up display, a carbon fiber roof, active rear wheel steering, a variable gear ratio steering system, active rear spoiler, carbon fiber scuff plates, a heated steering wheel and a Mark Levinson premium audio system.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lc/2018/2018-lexus-lc500-lc500h-first-test-review/">2018 First Test review</a>, we said that the LC 500 offers good acceleration but its curb weight of over 4,000 pounds and fuel economy-tuned transmission hinders its straight line performance. Although the LC does handle well, it’s more of a grand tourer than a sports car. On the road, the LC offers a comfortable ride even with the massive 20- or 21-inch alloy wheels, making it an excellent long distance cruiser. The interior is exquisitely crafted with high-quality materials and supremely comfortable seats, further hinting at its grand tourer leanings. Rear seat space, however, is tight in the LC 500 and even more so in the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lc-500/2018/2018-lexus-lc-500-lc-500h-first-drive-review/">LC 500h</a> due to the extra components of the hybrid powertrain. Lexus’ infotainment system lags behind its competitors and is distracting to use due to its touchpad controls.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Lexus LC. Lexus Safety System+ is standard on the 2018 Lexus LC. That standard package of tech includes adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist with steering assist, lane departure warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Lexus LC shares its platform and hybrid system with the upcoming LS sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rc/2018/">Lexus RC</a> is a compact luxury sports coupe that slots below the larger, more luxurious LC coupe. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. A high-performance variant called the RC F is also offered and comes exclusively in rear-drive configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three engines choices are available in the 2018 Lexus RC including a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 241 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque in the <strong>RC 300 RWD</strong>, a 3.5-liter V-6 with 260 hp and 236 lb-ft in the <strong>RC 300 AWD</strong>, 311 hp and 277 lb-ft in the <strong>RC 350</strong>, or a 5.0-liter V-8 with 467 hp and 389  lb-ft in the <strong>RC F</strong>. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard on rear-drive variants of the RC coupe while all-wheel drive models get a six-speed unit. EPA fuel economy ratings are 22/32 mpg city/highway for the RC 300 RWD, 19/26 mpg for the RC 300 AWD and RC 350 AWD, 19/28 mpg for the rear-drive RC 350, and 16/25 mpg for the RC F. Trunk space in the RC coupe is small at 10.4 cubic feet and it’s even less in the RC F at 10.1 cubic feet; however, it can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include leatherette upholstery, keyless entry/start, 18-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth connectivity, a 10-speaker audio system, a rearview camera, a 7.0-inch screen, and power adjustable front seats. Options include a Mark Levinson premium audio system, navigation with a 10.3-inch screen, leather upholstery, heated/ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, driver’s seat memory, and 19-inch alloy wheels. F Sport models get unique features like sport seats, an F Sport steering wheel, adaptive variable suspension, and an LFA-inspired gauge cluster. The RC F can be had with performance goodies like a torque vectoring rear differential as part of the Performance package, which also adds a carbon fiber roof and rear spoiler.</p>

<p><strong>Safety<br/></strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Lexus RC. A 2017 model, however, earned a Good score on all crash worthiness tests and an Average score on the headlights test from the IIHS (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Lexus RC got an Advanced rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the impact of a 25-mph one by 8 mph (Superior is the highest score on the front crash prevention test.</p>

<p>Lexus Safety System+ is standard on all 2018 RC coupes and it bundles together automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist, and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available as part of an optional package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rc-f/2015/2015-lexus-rc-f-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, we noted that the RC F offers strong acceleration; however, since the car’s platform is built out of parts from three different cars, which means it is surprisingly heavy. Despite its heft, the RC F offers good handling and understeer was easy to correct. Drifting the RC F was also easy thanks to the torque vectoring rear differential. The less powerful RC 350 is just as playful in the corners but because it’s so heavy, it felt underpowered despite having over 300 hp. The car’s brakes aren’t meant for track duty, and will easily overheat if pushed hard. The RC F lost a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rc-f/2015/2015-bmw-m4-vs-2015-lexus-rc-f-comparison/">2014 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/m4/2018/">BMW M4</a> because it was deemed too soft for track use and as a whole, the M4 performance better. However, the Lexus sounds great and is much easier to drive at its limit thanks to its stability.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Lexus RC’s platform is a combinations of bits and pieces taken from the current generation IS and GS sedans, and the previous generation IS Convertible.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gx/2018/">2018 Lexus GX</a> gets two-tone Black and Sepia leatherette upholstery as standard on the bench seat with the Premium package and standard semi-aniline leather upholstery on the Luxury trim. Second-row captain’s chairs now come standard with the available Sport Design package on the range-topping Luxury grade.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gx/2018/">Lexus GX</a> is a midsize three-row SUV with seating for up to seven passengers with the standard bench seats or six with the optional second-row captain’s chairs. The GX slots below the flagship LX and two-row RX midsize crossover in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/">Lexus</a>’ lineup. Four-wheel drive comes standard on all Lexus GX variants.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Lexus GX’s only engine is a 4.6-liter V-8 with 301 hp and 329 lb-ft of torque, that is paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are low at 15/18 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>Despite its size, the 2018 Lexus GX isn’t very roomy with 11.6 cubic feet behind the third row, 46.7 cubic feet behind the second row, and 64.7 cubic feet behind the front seats, making it less practical than other SUVs of similar size. When properly equipped, the GX can tow up to 6,500 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base GX 460 include a rearview camera, LED low-beam headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, 10-way power front seats, 40/20/40 split-folding second-row bench, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, a nine-speaker audio system, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, keyless entry/start, the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension system, and a Torsen limited-slip differential with an electronic locking feature.</p>

<p>Options include navigation, blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, LED fog lights, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, parking sensors, second-row captain’s chairs, tri-zone climate control, adaptive variable suspension, front and right side view cameras, a rear entertainment system, and a Mark Levinson premium audio system. The Sport Design package, which is available on the Premium and Luxury trims, adds a a unique front bumper and front grille lower garnish, a rear bumper spoiler, a chrome-tipped exhaust, Scarlet Red taillight graphics, side mirrors with chrome accents, and gunmetal 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Lexus GX. However, the IIHS did give the SUV a Basic rating for the front crash prevention test thanks to its forward collision warning tech but hasn’t tested the GX’s crash avoidance tech (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>The Driver Support package, which is available exclusively on the range-topping Luxury trim as an order-only option, adds features including lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, driver attention alert, pedestrian detection, and the Pre-Collision System, which combines forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gx460/2017/2017-lexus-gx-460-first-test-review/">2017 First Test review</a>, we said that the Lexus GX is an excellent off-road vehicle and can easily tackle rough terrain. That doesn’t come at the cost of on-road comfort because it rides well for a truck-based SUV. The GX’s cabin stays quiet while on the road, and build quality is typical Lexus, which means high-grade materials throughout the interior. As for the infotainment system, it’s easy to use since it doesn’t have the mouse-like controls or the touchpad found in newer Lexus models; however, it is dated and doesn’t come with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto support. Handling is sloppy due to excessive body roll when taking turns. Also, the six-speed automatic transmission sometimes upshifts too early.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx/2018/">2018 Lexus NX</a> gets a slightly revised exterior, standard active safety features, and a new name for the turbocharged model, which now carries the NX 300 moniker instead of NX 200t. A larger 10.3-inch is now available along with the updated navigation option, and a new exterior color called Caviar has also been added.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx/2018/">Lexus NX</a> is a compact luxury crossover that slots below the larger midsize RX and above the upcoming UX subcompact crossover. In addition to the gas-only variant, the NX is also available as a hybrid that comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/">Lexus</a> NX comes with two powertrain options, a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 235 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque in the <strong>NX 300</strong> that comes paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission or a hybrid system in the <strong>NX 300h</strong> that couples a 2.5-liter I-4 to three electric motors, a nickel metal hydride battery and a CVT. Combined output in the NX 300h is 194 hp.</p>

<p>There are no EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 Lexus NX but the 2017 model was rated at 22/28 mpg city/high for front-drive models and non-F Sport all-wheel drive variants or 22/27 for F Sport models with all-wheel drive. The NX 300h is the most fuel efficient model and is rated at 33/30 mpg.</p>

<p>Cargo space in the NX 300 is 17.7 cubic feet with the 60/40 split-folding rear seats in place or 54.6 cubic feet with them down. The extra hybrid powertrain components in the NX 300h cuts into cargo capacity slightly, dropping the space to 16.8 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 53.7 cubic feet with them folded. When properly equipped, the NX 300 can tow up to 2,000 pounds of payload while the NX 300h can tow up to 1,500 pounds.</p>

<p>Standard features include LED headlights, an 8.0-inch screen, the Lexus Safety System+ active safety suite, 17-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, power-folding side mirrors, Bluetooth connectivity, and a 4.2-inch multi-information display. Options include a Mark Levinson premium audio system, 18-inch alloy wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, a power liftgate, navigation with a 10.3-inch screen, and a power-adjustable steering column. The F Sport package adds some sporty flair to the 2018 NX 300 and adds features like a unique front fascia, an Active Sound Control system, sport seats, an F Sport steering wheel, and an LFA-inspired gauge cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Lexus NX received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). Although the IIHS has yet to test the 2018 NX, it has crash tested the 2017 model, which received a Good score on all crash worthiness tests and Average on the new headlight test (Good is the possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the NX avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the severity of a 25-mph impact by 9 mph, enabling it to receive an Advanced rating (Superior is the highest possible score in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the NX received the Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Lexus Safety System+ is standard on the 2018 NX and it bundles together adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, and automatic high beams. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are available as part of an optional package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We’ve yet to review the refreshed 2018 NX but in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx300h/2015/2015-lexus-nx-200t-300h-first-drive/">2015 First Drive review</a>, we said that the NX features a comfortable ride thanks to its unique suspension setup despite its short wheelbase. The crossover’s steering is lively and holds the road well, giving it confident handling. Both variants of the NX, however, are a bit heavy, so regardless of the engine choice, neither will be a rocket in a straight line compared to the competition, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx300h/2015/2015-lexus-nx-200t-f-sport-300h-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>.</p>

<p>The NX won a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx200t/2015/the-big-test-2015-luxury-compact-crossovers/">2015 comparison test</a> that included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x3/2018/">BMW X3</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2018/">Land Rover Range Rover</a> Evoque, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkc/2018/">Lincoln MKC</a>, and the previous generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/xc60/2018/">Volvo XC60</a>. Thanks to its lowest as-tested price, confident handling, well-crafted interior, and low ownership costs. However, the NX did get dinged for its lack of headroom and poor visibility.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Lexus NX was the first Lexus vehicle to feature the brand’s 2.0-liter turbo-four when it first arrived for the 2015 model year.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gs/2018/">Lexus GS</a> is the brand’s midsize luxury sport sedan, slotting below the larger LS and above the compact IS. Rear-wheel drive comes standard and all-wheel drive is available only on the GS 350.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cargo space in the GS 300 and GS 350 is 18.4 cubic feet but it can’t be expanded since the car doesn’t come with split-folding rear seats. The GS 450H has less cargo space at 15.9 cubic feet due to the extra powertrain components. The GS F has the least cargo space at 14 cubic feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Standard features include keyless entry/start, dual-zone climate control, a moonroof, 10-way power front seats with memory, a drive mode selector, LED headlights, Bluetooth connectivity, a 8.0-inch screen, a 12-speaker audio system, and a rearview camera. Options include heated and ventilated front seats, leather upholstery, navigation with a 12.3-inch screen, a heated steering wheel, parking sensors, a Mark Levinson premium sound system, a power-operated trunk, a head-up display, triple-beam LED headlights and 19-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The F Sport variant comes with unique styling cues such as a different grille, an F Sport leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum trim, dark graphite 19-inch alloy wheels, high performance brakes (rear-drive models only), F Sport adaptive variable suspension, 16-way adjustable F Sport front seats, a Sport S+ mode, LFA-inspired digital gauge cluster, and optional orange brake calipers. The GS 350 F Sport can be had with other go-fast features such as the Lexus Dynamic Handling System that bundles together variable gear ratio steering and rear-wheel steering, and a Torsen limited-slip differential.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The NHTSA hasn’t crash tested the 2018 Lexus GS. In IIHS testing, it earned a Good rating on the roof strength, moderate front overlap impact, and side impact tests (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Lexus GS only received a Basic rating to indicate that it has forward collision warning since the rest of its front crash avoidance tech hasn’t been tested yet (Superior is the highest score in the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Standard on all Lexus GS models is the Lexus Safety System+, which bundles together adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high beams. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available as a separate option or as part of a package.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gs/2017/2017-lexus-gs-350-f-sport-first-test-review/" style="font-family: Georgia, serif">2017 First Test review</a>, we said that the GS 350 F Sport offers linear acceleration thanks to its smooth V-6 engine; however, its competitors are more powerful and are quicker in a straight line. The F Sport variant’s stiffer suspension, offers excellent handling but it comes at the cost of ride comfort. Interior space is average for the class and the infotainment system’s mouse-like controls are finicky to use. The less powerful 2.0-liter turbo-four offers respectable mid-range punch and doesn’t feel underpowered, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gs-200t/2016/2016-lexus-gs-200t-first-drive-review/" style="font-family: Georgia, serif">2016 First Drive review</a>. However, it does suffer from turbo lag and takes some time before it finally gives you power. Even with the smaller engine, the GS is fun to drive thanks to well-controlled body motions and confident handling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The performance-oriented GS F placed second in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/cts-v/2016/comparison-audi-s6-4-0t-quattro-vs-cadillac-cts-v-sport-vs-lexus-gs-f/" style="font-family: Georgia, serif">2016 comparison test</a> that also include the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/s6/2018/">Audi S6</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/cts/2018/">Cadillac CTS</a> VSport thanks to its well-appointed interior and engaging driving dynamics. However, the overly harsh ride and dulled responses on all but the most aggressive kept it from winning along with its complicated multimedia interface.</p>

<p><strong> Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lx/2018/">Lexus LX</a> is the most expensive SUV in Lexus’ lineup, slotting above the smaller GX. It comes standard with four-wheel drive and seats up to eight passengers.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Lexus LX is available as a a single model, the LX 570, and is powered exclusively by a 5.7-liter V-8 with 383 hp and 403 lb-ft of torque that comes paired exclusively to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 LX isn’t very good at 13/18 mpg city/highway, making it one of the least efficient vehicles in its class.</p>

<p>With all seats in place, the 2018 LX has 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space, which is extremely small for such a large car. That can be expanded to 24.8 cubic feet with the third row folded and 44.7 cubic feet behind the front seats, both of which are still smaller than many SUVs its size. When properly equipped, the 2018 LX can tow up to 7,000 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>Standard features include LED headlights, 20-inch alloy wheels, parking sensors, Crawl Control with Turn Assist, the Multi-Terrain Select System, an adjustable suspension system, leather upholstery, power front seats, power-operated split-folding second and third row seats, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, a 360-degree camera system, keyless entry/start, a 12.3-inch screen, navigation, a nine-speaker audio system, four-zone climate control, and a power tailgate.</p>

<p>The Luxury package adds semi-aniline leather upholstery with contrast stitching and heated and ventilated front and second row seats. Standalone options include 21-inch alloy wheels, a wireless mobile device charging pad, a head-up display, a Mark Levinson premium audio system, a cool box, and a rear entertainment system with two 11.6-inch screens and two headphones.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Lexus LX a five-star rollover rating and a four-star front crash rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has not crash tested the 2018 Lexus LX.</p>

<p>Standard on all 2018 LX models is the Lexus Safety System+ suite that bundles together adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, lane departure warning, pedestrian detection, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert also comes standard on the 2018 LX.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lx570/2016/2016-lexus-lx-570-first-test-review/">2016 First Test review</a>, we said that the LX 570 is a capable off-road vehicle thanks to its adjustable suspension; however, it doesn’t have the same capability as its sister vehicle, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/land-cruiser/2018/">Toyota Land Cruiser</a>, because it lacks the necessary departure angles. On pavement, Comfort mode does cause a significant amount of body roll while Sport mode does enable the transmission to more frequently. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/lx570/2018/">Lexus LX 570</a> is distinguished from the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Land Cruiser thanks to its array of luxury and comfort features, as well as different exterior styling including an enormous grille.</p>

<p><strong> Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Lexus LX is closely related to Toyota Land Cruiser and is built in the same factory in Aichi, Japan.</p>

Navigation and ventilated front seats, which are standard on higher trims, are available on lower trims as part of packages.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 MKX comes standard with a 3.7-liter V-6 rated at 303 hp and 278 lb-ft of torque. A 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6 with 335 hp and 380 lb-ft is optional. Both engines are paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>

Surprisingly, the more powerful 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6 is the most efficient at 18/25 mpg for front-drive models and 17/25 mpg for all-wheel-drive-equipped models.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 MKX received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars).

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkx/2016/2016-lincoln-mkx-awd-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the MKX’s ride and handling balance thanks to its supple ride and excellent body control. The optional twin-turbo V-6 offers plenty of power on tap, giving it plenty of straight-line performance. Lincoln’s multimedia interface, however, isn’t quick to respond.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkx/2016/2016-lexus-rx-mercedes-benz-glc-lincoln-mkx-comparison/">2016 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rx/2018/">Lexus RX</a>, the Lincoln MKX placed second. Despite having a well-built interior, there’s some cheap plastics in certain places and hollow-sounding buttons on the center stack.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Lincoln MKX, along with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/edge/2018/">Ford Edge</a>, was one of the first vehicles to utilize <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>’s 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkc/2018/">2018 Lincoln MKC</a> gets a number of new exterior colors including Blue Diamond Metallic, Iced Mocha Metallic, and Rhapsody Blue. All models now come standard with 4G LTE connectivity and four-way lumbar support for the driver. The MKC gets <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkc/2019/2019-lincoln-mkc-first-look-review/">a minor update</a> for the 2019 model year.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkc/2018/">Lincoln MKC</a> is a compact luxury crossover that slots below the MKX (the MKX is called the Nautilus starting in the 2019 model year). Front-wheel drive comes standard and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>

<p><strong>MKC Premiere: </strong>Standard equipment on the base Premiere trim include keyless entry and start, dual-zone climate control, remote start, the Sync 3 multimedia system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, two USB ports, a nine-speaker audio system, heated power adjustable front seats with 12-way and six-way adjustments for the driver and passenger respectively, rear parking sensors, HID headlights, a power liftgate, 18-inch alloy wheels, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the standard 2.0-liter turbo-four is 21/28 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 19/25 mpg with all-wheel drive. Move up to the 2.3-liter turbo-four and fuel economy drops to 18/25 mpg.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 MKC a four-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 MKC received a Good rating and the side impact and moderate front overlap test (Good is the highest possible score). The car also received a Basic rating on the IIHS’ front crash prevention test for having an available forward collision warning system.</p>

<p>Blind-spot monitoring comes standard on the Reserve trim. The Technology package, which is also available on the Reserve grade, adds forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane keeping assist.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> MKC has 25.2 cubic feet of cargo space with the standard split-folding rear seats in place and it can be expanded to 53.1 cubic feet. When properly equipped, the 2018 MKC can tow up to 3,000 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkc/2015/2015-lincoln-mkc-20-23-ecoboost-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, we said that with the optional 2.3-liter turbo-four, the MKC offers potent acceleration, giving it good straight-line performance. However, the six-speed automatic sometimes feels lazy with its responses. Cabin materials are a mixed bag: the buttons feel cheap, but most of the interior features high-quality plastics, wood, and metal.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx200t/2015/the-big-test-2015-luxury-compact-crossovers/">2015 comparison test</a> that also included the previous-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x3/2018/">BMW X3</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx/2018/">Lexus NX</a>, Range Rover Evoque, and the previous-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/xc60/2018/">Volvo XC60</a>, the Lincoln MKC placed fourth. The Lincoln’s unpredictable throttle response hurt its overall drivability and its handling felt clumsy. On the positive side, minimal road noise enters the cabin and the ride is comfortable thanks to the available adjustable dampers.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The full-size three-row 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/navigator/2018/">Lincoln Navigator</a> is the premium brand’s flagship model and sits above the compact MKC and midsize two-row MKX and three-row MKT crossovers as well as the full-size Continental and midsize MKZ sedans.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p><a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/navigator/2018/2018-lincoln-navigator-first-look-review/">Power for the 2018 Lincoln Navigator</a> comes from a second-generation twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 making an estimated 450 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque.

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkt/2018/">2018 Lincoln MKT</a> gets three new exterior colors: Blue Diamond Metallic, Iced Mocha Metallic, and Ivory Pearl Metallic.</p>

<p><strong>Trim Levels (Interior and Exterior Options)</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkt/2018/">Lincoln MKT</a> is a midsize three-row crossover slotting above the two-row Nautilus (formerly MKX) and below the flagship three-row Navigator. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. A seven-seat configuration is standard and a six-seat variant is optional.</p>

<p><strong>MKT Premiere: </strong>The base Premiere trim comes standard with a fixed glass roof, adaptive HID headlights, keyless entry and start, remote start, rear parking sensors, a power liftgate, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, ambient lighting, a 10-speaker audio system, the Sync 3 infotainment system, leather upholstery for the first and second rows, 12-way power adjustable front seats, heated and ventilated front seats, 19-inch alloy wheels, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>MKT Reserve:</strong> Moving up to the Reserve trim gets you an adaptive suspension, three-zone climate control, a heated steering wheel, navigation, and a power-folding third row.</p>

<p>Available options include active parking assist, heated and ventilated second-r0w bucket seats, 20-inch alloy wheels, a power-opening panoramic sunroof, a refrigerator-like chilled compartment in the second row, and a rear-seat entertainment system with two screens mounted in the back of the front seat headrests.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> MKT comes standard with a 3.7-liter V-6 with 303 hp and 279 lb-ft of torque. Reserve models come standard with all-wheel drive and a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 rated at 365 hp and 350 lb-ft. Both engines come paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 16/24 mpg city/highway for the front-drive MKT with the standard 3.7-liter V6 while opting for all-wheel drive drop those numbers to 16/23 mpg. The optional 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 drops is the least efficient at 15/21 mpg.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA has only rated the 2018 MKT on the rollover test where it got a four-star rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the crossover received a Good score on all but the headlights test where it received a Marginal rating and the front small overlap test where it hasn’t been tested (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 MKT got a Basic rating for having an available forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert comes standard on the Reserve trim. Lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking are available only on the Reserve grade.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>

<p>With all seats in place the 2018 MKT has 17.9 cubic feet of cargo space. Fold the third row and that expands to 39.6 cubic feet. That can be expanded further with the second- and third rows down, giving the crossover 75.9 cubic feet of cargo capacity.</p>

<p>Front-drive 2018 MKTs with the standard 3.7-liter V-6 can tow up to 2,000 pounds when properly equipped. The more powerful twin-turbo V-6 increases towing capacity to 4,500 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkt/2010/2010-lincoln-mkt-ecoboost-test/">2010 First Test</a>, we said that the third row is cramped. With the optional 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6, the MKT’s acceleration is quick for a such a large vehicle. However, the crossover has a spongy brake pedal that has a delayed response.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkt/2010/2010-lincoln-mkt-ecoboost-test/">2018 Lincoln MKT</a> is closely related to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/flex/2018/">Ford Flex</a> and shares the same engine options.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors<br/></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/continental/2018/">2018 Lincoln Continental</a> gets standard 4G LTE. Black Label models now come with the Climate package and a moonroof. The exterior colors Blue Diamond, Ivory Pearl Metallic and Iced Mocha Metallic replace Midnight Sapphire, Jade Metallic, Diamond Black and Palladium Gold.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/continental/2018/">Lincoln Continental</a> is a large luxury sedan that slots above the midsize MKZ and is available in front- or all-wheel-drive configurations. In addition to the three trims described below, the Continental is available in a Black Label variant that features two-tone upholstery in vibrant colors, embroidery on the headrests, complimentary maintenance for four years or 50,000 miles, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Continental Premiere: </strong>The base Premiere trim comes standard with adaptive steering, adaptive suspension, 18-inch alloy wheels, rear parking sensors, keyless entry/start, remote start, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, a 10-inch audio system, the Sync 3 multimedia system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, heated 10-way power adjustable front seats with driver’s side memory, leatherette upholstery, and HID headlights.</p>

<p><strong>Continental Select: </strong>Move up to the Select grade and you get 19-inch alloy wheels, front parking sensors, ambient lighting, and leather upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>Continental Reserve: </strong>The range-topping Reserve trim comes with tri-zone climate control, navigation, a 13-speaker Revel audio system, 24-way power front seats, a power-operated trunk and ventilated front seats.</p>

<p>Options include full LED headlights, heated and ventilated rear seats, 30-way multi-contour front seats with massage function, 20-inch alloy wheels, a 19-speaker Revel Ultima audio system, a heated steering wheel, an automatic parking system, and a head-up display. Features such as navigation, heated and ventilated 24-way adjustable front seats, and the power-operated trunk are available as part of packages or as standalone options on lower trims.</p>

<p>The 2018 Continental comes with three six-cylinder engine choices that are all paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. A 3.7-liter V-6 with 305 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque comes standard on the Premiere and Select trim. The range-topping Reserve trim comes standard with a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6 good for 335 hp and 380 lb-ft. This engine is also available as an option on the mid-grade Select. The most powerful engine, a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 with 400 hp and 400 lb-ft, is only available on the Reserve and Black Label grades and comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the base 3.7-liter V-6 are 17/26 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 16/24 mpg with all-wheel drive. Move up to the more powerful 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6 and fuel efficiency goes up to 18/27 mpg for front-drive variants and 17/25 mpg on cars with all-wheel drive. The 400-hp 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 is rated at 16/24 mpg.</p>

<p>The 2018 Continental received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing the 2018 Continental received a Good rating in all crashworthiness tests and in the new headlight test (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Continental received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest rating in the front crash prevention test). As a result of its excellent crash test and front crash prevention scores, the Continental received the 2018 Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Forward collision warning comes standard on all but the base Premiere trim. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are optional on the Select grade and standard on the Reserve and Black Label variants. The Technology package, which is available on all but the entry-level Premiere trim, adds lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p>The 2018 Continental has a 16.7-cubic-foot trunk but it can’t be expanded since the car doesn’t come with split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/continental/2017/2017-lincoln-continental-30t-awd-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we noted that the Continental, when equipped with the 400-hp 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6, offers strong acceleration and handles well for a heavy sedan with most of its weight hanging over the front wheels. However, the six-speed automatic is hesitant to downshift. On the road, the Continental is quiet and the cabin is well-insulated. Ride comfort is excellent for the most part, but sometimes the suspension struggles to soak up sharp bumps, especially when equipped with the 19- and 20-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>The Continental recently participated in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/genesis/g90/2018/bmw-740e-vs-lexus-ls-500-vs-genesis-g90-33t-vs-lincoln-continental-30/">2017 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/ls/2018/">Lexus LS</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/7-series/2018/">BMW 7 Series</a>, and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/genesis/g90/2018/">Genesis G90</a>. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> placed fourth because it needed more refinement. Throttle tip-in is too aggressive and its cabin suffers from squeaks and rattles. Passenger space, however, is spacious for both front and rear passengers and, overall, editors were impressed by the Lincoln’s potential.</p>

<p>The 2018 Lincoln Continental was one of the first vehicles to utilize the 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 that’s exclusive to Lincoln vehicles.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkz/2018/">2018 Lincoln MKZ</a> gets 4G LTE as standard on all models and the Reserve trim now comes standard with the Revel audio system. A power-operated trunk is now part of the Select Plus package. The new Magnetic package adds cosmetic changes such as a painted grille, aluminum pedals, and 19-inch alloy wheels. Three new exterior colors — Blue Diamond, Ivory Pearl Metallic and Iced Mocha Metallic — are now available.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkz/2018/">Lincoln MKZ</a> is a midsize premium sedan slotting below the larger, more luxurious Continental. Front-wheel drive comes standard and all-wheel drive is optional on gas-only models. A hybrid variant is also available. In addition to the three trims described below, an exclusive Black Label variant based on the Reserve trim comes with unique interior color schemes including two-tone leather upholstery with embroidery.</p>

<p><strong>MKZ Premiere: </strong>The base Premiere trim comes standard with HID headlights, rear parking sensors, a 10.1-inch reconfigurable gauge cluster, dual-zone climate control, leatherette upholstery, keyless entry and start, remote start, two USB ports, the Sync 3 multimedia system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, a 14-speaker Revel premium audio system, a rearview camera, heated 10-way power adjustable front seats, adaptive suspension, and 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>MKZ Select: </strong>Moving up to the Select grade adds leather upholstery, ambient lighting, wood interior accents, a power-adjustable steering column, and two additional USB ports.</p>

<p><strong>MKZ Reserve: </strong>Opt for the range-topping Reserve trim and you’ll get navigation, perforated leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, and 19-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>Optional extras include heated rear seats, multi-contour front seats with massage function, a 20-speaker Revel audio system, a sport-tuned suspension, a heated steering wheel, automatic high beams, and full LED headlights.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> MKZ comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 245 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 is optional and makes 350 hp in front-drive models or 400 hp with all-wheel drive and 400 lb-ft. Both engines are paired only to a six-speed automatic transmission. The MKZ Hybrid comes with a 2.0-liter I-4 coupled to an electric motor and a CVT for a combined system output of 188 hp.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the base 2.0-liter turbo-four are 21/31 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 20/28 mpg with all-wheel drive. The more powerful 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 is EPA-rated at 18/27 mpg for front-drive models and 17/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. Hybrid variants are the most efficient, at 41/38 mpg.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 MKZ a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 MKZ received a Good rating on all crash worthiness tests except the headlights test where it received a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 MKZ received a Superior score after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test). Active driver assistance features including lane keeping assist, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control are optional on the Select and Reserve trims. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert come standard on the Reserve grade and is optional on the Select model.</p>

<p>The 2018 MKZ has a 15.4-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats. Hybrid models have a smaller 11.1-cubic-foot trunk.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkz/2017/2017-lincoln-mkz-3-0t-awd-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we noted that the optional 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 offers strong acceleration but stomping on the accelerator from a stop can easily overwhelm the car’s tires. The six-speed automatic transmission, on the other hand, reacts slower than units found in the MKZ’s rivals. Despite the stiff suspension, active dampers, and torque vectoring, the MKZ is more of a cruiser and doesn’t handle as well as expected. The car is right at home on the open highway, where it remains comfortable and quiet.</p>

<p>Although the MKZ Hybrid isn’t as powerful as its gas-only siblings, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/lincoln/mkz-hybrid/2017/2017-lincoln-mkz-hybrid-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> that the car doesn’t feel underpowered. However, it rides stiffly and the steering isn’t precise. We also noted that the our test vehicle had a number of creaks.</p>

<p>The 2018 MKZ rides on the same platform as the <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2018/">Ford Fusion</a> and features the same hybrid system.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/levante/2018/">2018 Maserati Levante</a> gets an updated electric power steering system, and additional active safety features including traffic sign recognition, active blind-spot monitoring, and highway assist.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/levante/2018/">Maserati Levante</a> is a midsize crossover that comes standard with all-wheel drive. It is the first crossover in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/">Maserati</a>’s lineup and is closely related to the Ghibli and Quattroporte sedans.</p>

<p><strong>Levante GranLusso: </strong>The luxury-oriented Levante GranLusso features touches like a protection plate in a metallic finish, open-pore wood trim, a wood-finished steering wheel, comfort-oriented seats with 12-way adjustability, and two interior choices full Italian Leather or the available silk upholstery by luxury clothing maker Ermengildo Zegna.</p>

<p><strong>Levante GranSport: </strong>On the other side of the spectrum is the Levante GranSport, which features front sport seats, Piano Black interior trim, black roof rails, a sport steering wheel, brushed chrome paddle shifters, and power adjustable aluminum pedals.</p>

<p>Standard features include leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, an 8.4-inch touchscreen with a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, and heated front seats. Notable options include alloy wheels up to 21 inches in diameter, a surround view camera system, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, four-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, navigation, HID headlights, air suspension, ventilated front seats, and a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio system.</p>

<p>The 2018 Maserati Levante is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 rated at 345 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque in the base Levante Q4 and 424 hp and 428 lb-ft in the Levante S Q4. An eight-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox available. EPA fuel economy ratings are 14/20 mpg city/highway for the Levante Q4 and 14/19 mpg for the Levante S Q4.</p>

<p>Active safety features are available as part of a package and it includes highway assist, lane keeping assist, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, traffic sign recognition, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>When properly equipped, the 2018 Levante can tow 5,900 pounds of payload. Cargo space is slightly behind most midsize luxury crossovers at 19.4 cubic feet with the split-folding rear seats in place and 57.3 cubic feet with them folded.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/levante/2017/2017-maserati-levante-sq4-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that the more powerful Levante S Q4 offers strong acceleration, making it quicker than many of its key competitors. The crossover pairs straight-line speed with excellent handling and a ride that’s comfortable and well-controlled. However, its start/stop system is too aggressive and will activate even if you’ve only stopped for a quick second. The exhaust note in Sport mode also became annoying as it opened up the baffles completely even at half throttle. Passenger space for passengers is generous thanks to the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/levante/2017/2017-maserati-levante-q4-first-test-review/">Levante</a>‘s long wheelbase but it comes at cost of cargo capacity. Interior materials quality, on the other hand, could use improvement because there are trim pieces and buttons that were clearly taken out of the Fiat-<a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> parts bin.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/quattroporte/2018/">2018 Maserati Quattroporte</a> gets a more powerful twin-turbo V-6 engine, an updated electric power steering system, and additional active safety features. Adaptive LED headlights are now available on the 2018 Quattroporte.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/quattroporte/2018/">Maserati Quattroporte</a> is a full-size luxury sedan slotting above the midsize Ghibli. It comes standard in rear- or all-wheel drive configurations; however, the latter is only available on the S grade.</p>

<p><strong>Quattroporte GranLusso:</strong> The more luxury-oriented variant of the Quattroporte features unique interior trims such as wood inlays, unique alloy wheel designs, and wood-trimmed steering wheel. In addition to leather upholstery, the GranLusso is offered with silk upholstery by luxury clothing maker Ermenegildo Zegna that come with personalized labels stitched into the sun visors.</p>

<p><strong>Quattroporte GranSport: </strong>Geared more towards a sportier look, the Quattroporte GranSport features front sport seats, a sport steering wheel, paddle shifters, and an optional Interior Carbon package that adds carbon fiber paddle shifters and door guards.</p>

<p>Notable standard features include 19-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/">Maserati</a>’s new infotainment system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, a rearview camera, and 12-way power adjustable front seats. Options include a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio system, LED headlights, leather with silk inserts by Zegna, the Skyhook suspension system, and a surround view camera system.</p>

<p>The 2018 Maserati Quattroporte comes standard with a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 rated at 424 hp and 428 lb-ft of torque on the S and S Q4 models. A 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 523 hp and 524 lb-ft is only available on the range-topping Quattroporte GTS. Both engines come paired exclusively to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 16/23 mpg city/highway for the Quattroporte S and S Q4, and 15/22 mpg for the Quattroporte GTS.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Maserati Quattroporte. Active safety features are available as part of an optional package and include blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, traffic sign recognition, and highway assist.</p>

<p>Trunk space is generous at 18 cubic feet that can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/quattroporte/2014/2014-maserati-quattroporte-s-q4-first-drive/">2014 First Drive</a>, we said that the V-6-powered Quattroporte offers plenty of power thanks to its prodigious low-end torque. The cabin is well-insulated and stays quiet with minimal wind and road noise. One of the biggest highlights is the Quattroporte’s awesome engine note, which gives it plenty of character but can get tiring after a while if you’re accustomed to the quieter experience provided by the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/s-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a>. Also, interior quality could be better, as some trim pieces and buttons are too appear to be taken directly from the Fiat <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> Group parts bin.</p>

<p>The more powerful Quattroporte GTS has a more linear power delivery with very little turbo lag, as we observed in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/quattroporte/2014/2014-maserati-quattroporte-v-8-drive/">2014 First Drive</a>. For its size, the Quattroporte handles well thanks to its excellent chassis and steering system. The eight-speed automatic shifts quickly and has a full manual mode that gives you full control of shifting duties.</p>

<p>The 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 in the Quattroporte was designed with input from <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ferrari/">Ferrari</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/ghibli/2018/">2018 Maserati Ghibli</a> gets an updated exterior, additional active safety features, and more power on the S and S Q4 variants. Two new sub-models have been added: the luxury-oriented GranLusso and the sporty GranSport. A new electric power steering system has been added to the 2018 Ghibli, as well.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/ghibli/2018/">Maserati Ghibli</a> is a luxury midsize sedan that slots below the large full-size Quattroporte. Rear-wheel drive is standard on all models while all-wheel drive is available only on the Ghibli S Q4.</p>

<p><strong>Ghibli GranLusso: </strong>As the more luxury-oriented sub-trim, the Ghibli GranLusso features chrome bumper inserts, body-colored side skirts, a front spoiler, wood trim and comfort seats with 12-way adjustability. In addition to the standard leather upholstery, you can also opt for silk upholstery by Ermenegildo Zegna in a two-tone scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Ghibli GranSport:</strong> The sport-oriented Ghibli GranSport comes with from sport seats, a more aggressive front bumper, a sport steering wheel, paddle shifters, and sport pedals. You can also opt for a unique grille featuring a Trident badge with blue inserts.</p>

<p>Standard features include leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, an updated infotainment system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, and a rearview camera. Options include full LED headlights, a surround view camera system, a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio system, navigation,  Wi-Fi connectivity, paddle shifters, alloy wheels up to 21 inches in diameter, adaptive dampers, a power-operated trunk and paddle shifters.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/">Maserati</a> Ghibli is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 that comes in two flavors, 345 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque in the base model or 424 hp and 428 lb-ft in the S and S Q4 variants. An eight-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox available. EPA fuel economy ratings are 17/24 mpg city/highway for the base Ghibli and 16/24 mpg for the Ghibli S and S Q4.</p>

<p>The 2017 Ghibli received a Good score in all crashworthiness tests except the front small overlap impact (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Ghibli received a Basic rating since it comes with a forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating available). Its front crash prevention features haven’t been crash tested yet. Active safety features are available as optional extras include blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane keeping assist, highway assist, traffic sign recognition, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>Trunk space is 17.6 cubic feet and can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/ghibli/2014/2014-maserati-ghibli-first-drive/">2014 First Drive</a>, we said that despite the well-built interior, which includes high-quality leather, many parts are clearly from the Fiat <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> parts bin especially the buttons and trim. On the road, the Ghibli offers an engaging driving experience thanks to its nimble handling and strong acceleration. The more powerful Ghibli S accelerates quickly thanks to its twin-turbo V-6 and the quick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/maserati/ghibli/2014/2014-maserati-ghibli-s-q4-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>. However, because of its stiff suspension it doesn’t ride as smoothly as other midsize luxury sedans, and it can get noisy due to its exhaust note.</p>

<p>The Maserati Ghibli shares its underpinnings with the recently launched Levante crossover.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2018/">2018 Mazda CX-9</a> gets automatic emergency braking and G-Vectoring Control as standard on all trims. When entering a turn, G-Vectoring Control reduces torque slightly to shift the car’s weight to the front tires to improve steering response and increase cornering force. Once the steering wheel unwinds, full power comes on, transferring weight to the rear tires and adding stability. Heated second row seats are now available on upper trim levels and the full suite of active safety tech is now available as an optional package in lower trims. Soul Red Crystal, an exterior color that debuted on the second-generation CX-5, replaces Soul Red Metallic in the 2018 CX-9.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the compact CX-5, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2018/">Mazda CX-9</a> is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/">Mazda</a>’s large three-row crossover that seats up to seven passengers. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional on all but the range-topping Signature trim, which has standard all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The only engine available is a 2.5-liter turbo-four with 310 lb-ft of torque and 250 hp on premium fuel or 227 hp on regular gas. The engine is paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 22/28 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 20/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. Despite its size, the CX-9 isn’t the roomiest three-row crossover with 14.4 cubic feet behind the third row, 38.2 cubic feet behind the second row, and 71.2 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>The base Sport trim comes with LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, tri-zone climate control, keyless start, cloth upholstery, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, the MazdaConnect infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity and tw0 USB ports. Move up to the Touring trim and you’ll get a power driver’s seat, a power liftgate, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, heated front seats, keyless entry, a power front passenger seat, and leather upholstery. The Touring Premium package adds LED fog lights, navigation, a 12-speaker Bose premium audio system, parking sensors, and a sunroof.</p>

<p>Grand Touring models feature the same equipment as the Touring trim with the Touring Premium package and adds 20-inch alloy wheels, aluminum interior trim, a head-up display, adaptive headlights, heated second-row seats, a heated steering wheel, and roof rails. The range-topping Signature trim adds all-wheel drive, Auburn Nappa leather upholstery, rosewood interior trim by Japanese guitar maker Fujigen, LED interior lights, and LED grille lighting.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA hasn’t crash-tested the 2018 Mazda CX-9. Although the IIHS hasn’t evaluated the 2018 CX-9, the 2017 model received a Good score on all crash worthiness tests and an Average rating on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the CX-9 received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and a 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest possible score on the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Mazda CX-9 received the 2017 Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS.</p>

<p>All 2018 Mazda CX-9s get a standard low-speed automatic emergency braking system that works up to 19 mph. Optional on lower trims and standard on the upper grades is an automatic emergency braking system that works at highway speeds. Other available active safety features include forward collision warning, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, Distance Recognition Support and blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2016/2017-gmc-acadia-2016-mazda-cx-9-2017-toyota-highlander-comparison/">2016 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">Toyota Highlander</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/acadia/2018/">GMC Acadia</a>, the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2016/2016-mazda-cx-9-touring-fwd-first-test-review/">Mazda CX-9 </a>won thanks to its engaging driving dynamics and premium-feeling interior. However, the crossover did have its quirks including steering that can get too heavy for a family-oriented vehicle, a stiff suspension that gets upset on poor road surfaces, and an overly aggressive automatic emergency braking system. The CX-9 Signature’s interior is a highlight because it feels expensive and can nearly rival interiors found in luxury cars, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2016/2016-mazda-cx-9-signature-awd-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>. Third row access is easy thanks to a single latch that moves the second row seats out of the way, and there’s respectable amounts of room for adults back there for short trips.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The CX-9 is currently the only vehicle in Mazda’s lineup that uses the brand’s turbocharged 2.5-liter I-4.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-3/2018/">2018 Mazda CX-3</a> gets low-speed automatic emergency braking and the G-Vectoring Control system as standard on all trims. New options include a full color head-up display, power driver’s seat with memory settings, and a heated steering wheel. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/">Mazda</a> also tweaked the steering and chassis to improve the CX-3’s ride comfort, handling, and quietness. A new exterior color, Machine Grey Metallic, has also been added, replacing Meteor Grey Mica.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Serving as the brand’s entry-level crossover, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-3/2018/">Mazda CX-3</a> slots below the larger CX-5. Front-wheel drive is standard on all trims and all-wheel drive is optional.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>All 2018 CX-3s are powered by a 2.0-liter I-4 with 146 hp and 146 lb-ft of torque paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 29/34 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 27/32 mpg with all-wheel drive. However, opting for all-wheel drive gets you a smaller 11.9-gallon tank instead of the larger 12.7-gallon one found in front-drive CX-3s.</p>

<p>Cargo space is on the small side at 12.4 cubic feet behind the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats and 44.5 cubic feet behind the front seats. The available cargo space gets cut down to 10.1 cubic feet and 42.3 cubic feet respectively with the optional Bose premium audio system, which comes standard on the range-topping Grand Touring trim.</p>

<p>Standard equipment on the base CX-3 Sport trim includes cloth upholstery, two USB ports, a rearview camera, the MazdaConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, low-speed automatic emergency braking and 16-inch alloy wheels. Move up to the mid-level CX-3 Touring trim and it adds 18-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery with suede inserts, keyless entry/start, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, automatic climate control, and auto on/off headlights. Opt for the Touring Preferred Equipment package and that adds a Bose premium audio system, a sunroof, satellite radio and a cargo cover. The range-topping CX-3 Grand Touring trim adds leather upholstery with suede inserts, adaptive LED headlights, LED fog lights, navigation, a head-up display, a Bose premium audio system, and paddle shifters as standard. Power-adjustable front seats and a heated steering wheel are available as part of the Grand Touring Preferred Equipment package, which also comes with active safety and driver assistance features.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 CX-3 a five-star overall safety score (out of a possible five stars). Although the IIHS has yet to test the 2018 model, a 2017 model received a Good score on all crash worthiness tests and an Average rating on the new headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). The CX-3 also received a Superior rating on the front crash prevention test after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the impact of a 25-mph one by 23 mph (Superior is the highest possible rating for the front crash prevention test). As a result, the IIHS awarded the CX-3 a Top Safety Pick+ rating.</p>

<p>Low-speed automatic emergency braking comes standard on all trims on the 2018 CX-3. On the Grand Touring trim, the Grand Touring Preferred Equipment package adds automatic emergency braking for high speeds, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and high beam assist. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert come standard on the Grand Touring trim and are optional on the mid-level Touring grade as part of the Touring Preferred Equipment package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to its light curb weight, the Mazda CX-3 is easy to drive and we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-3/2016/2016-mazda-cx-3-first-drive/">2016 First Drive</a> that even though it’s not very powerful, it can easily accelerate to highway speeds without much drama. However, the six-speed automatic does tend to upshift to the highest gear to save fuel. The interior is well appointed, especially in the two-tone black and cream leather/suede combo with red contrast stitching, giving it a more upscale feel.  Handling is one of CX-3’s strengths, offering great steering feel and a buttoned-down chassis that makes it right at home on windy roads, as we observed in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-3/2016/2016-mazda-cx-3-grand-touring-awd-first-test-review/">2016 First Test review</a>.</p>

<p>The CX-3 placed second in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/xv-crosstrek/2015/the-big-test-2015-2016-subcompact-crossovers/">2015 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/trax/2018/">Chevrolet Trax</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/hr-v/2018/">Honda HR-V</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/renegade/2018/">Jeep Renegade</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Juke, and the previous-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>. Although the attractive Mazda excels in driving dynamics and fuel efficiency, the CX-3’s lack of interior space held it back. Rear seat space is cramped and there’s not much cargo capacity, especially compared to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> HR-V and the comparison test winner, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a> Crosstrek.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Even though it’s nearly the same size as the Mazda3, the Mazda CX-3 rides on a smaller platform that also underpins the global market Mazda2 subcompact and its sibling, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris/2018/">Toyota Yaris</a> iA.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>All 2018 Mazda3 models now come standard with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, and all Touring trims are now powered by the 2.5-liter I-4.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda3 is a front-drive compact car slotting below the midsize Mazda6. Sedan and four-door hatchback body styles are available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Mazda3 including a 2.0-liter I-4 with 155 hp and 150 lb-ft of torque in the base Sport trim or a 2.5-liter I-4 with 184 hp and 185 lb-ft in the Touring and Grand Touring grades. Both engines can be paired to a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2.0-liter-equipped sedan are 28/38 mpg city/highway with the automatic or 28/37 mpg with the manual. The hatchback with the base engine is rated at 28/37 mpg with the automatic and 27/37 mpg with the manual. Opt for the larger 2.5-liter I-4 and the Mazda3 sedan’s fuel economy is rated 27/36 mpg with the automatic and 25/34 mpg with the manual. The more practical hatchback is slightly less efficient with the 2.5-liter I-4 at 26/35 mpg with the automatic and 25/33 mpg with the manual. Trunk space in the sedan is 12.4 cubic feet while the hatchback has 20.2 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 47.1 cubic feet with them down.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base Sport trim include 16-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, the MazdaConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, a six-speaker audio system, cloth upholstery, and 60/40 split-folding rear seats. The Touring trim adds 18-inch all0y wheels, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, leatherette upholstery, keyless entry/start, and blind spot warning. Opt for the range-topping Grand Touring trim and you also get LED headlights and fog lights, a Bose premium audio system, leather upholstery, and a flip up head-up display. Navigation can be had as an accessory in the Sport and Touring trims or as part of the Premium Equipment package on the Grand Touring grade.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Mazda3 a five-star overall score (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Mazda3 received a Good score on all crash tests and an Average score on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). It also earned a Superior rating on the front crash prevention evaluation after it avoided a 12- and 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest possible rating). Overall, the IIHS gave the 2018 Mazda3 the Top Safety Pick+ award.</p>

<p>Automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning are standard on all 2018 Mazda3 models. Additional driver assistance features such as blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and high beam assist are available as part of package in the Grand Touring trim.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a Big Test comparison of 2016 and 2017 compact sedans, a 2016 Mazda3i Grand Touring (with the 2.0-liter engine) placed <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2016/2016-2017-big-test-compact-sedans/">fourth out of seven competitors</a>.</p>

<p>“For evidence of just how quickly this segment is moving along,” we wrote, “just look to the Mazda3, which came in Fourth Place, the winner in the 2014 Big Test. It feels less special now and offers middling performances in almost all of our seven criteria.”</p>

<p>Despite how the compact has aged in the face of newer competitors, in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/mazda3/2017/2017-mazda3-2-5-grand-touring-first-test-review/">2017 First Test of a 2.5-liter model</a>, we said that the Mazda3’s chassis continues to be its defining feature, giving it its sporty driving dynamics. The 184-hp 2.5-liter I-4 provides plenty of power on tap even for climbing up hills and steep grades. The six-speed automatic is responsive and holds gears in manual mode, making it more enthusiast-friendly. However, interior space is on the small side especially when you compare it to newer compact cars such as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2018/">Honda Civic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/">Mazda</a> MX-5 Miata is now available with a Dark Cherry soft top. Sport models now come with a 7.0-inch touchscreen as standard and Club trims now come with heated seats. Heated Recaro seats are now available on the soft-top’s Club trim as part of the BBS/Brembo package. Nappa leather is now available on the Grand Touring trim and can be had in the Auburn color found in the RF Launch Edition, and the Signature trim of the CX-9. The soft top also received some suspension and steering updates for improved ride and handling.</p>

<p>The 2018 Miata gets three new exterior colors that include Soul Red Crystal Metallic, Eternal Blue Mica, and Snowflake White Pearl.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda MX-5 Miata is a rear-drive two-seat convertible that’s offered with a soft top and as a power retractable hardtop model called the Miata RF. Soft-top models are available in three grades while the RF hardtop is only available on the top two trims. RF models can raise and stow the power retractable roof in about 12 seconds. The manual roof on the soft top, on the other hand, can be raised or lowered in about 2-3 seconds thanks to its simple latch system.</p>

<p><strong>MX-5 Miata Sport: </strong>The base Sport grade (only available with the soft top) gets a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, cloth upholstery, full LED headlights, fog lights, keyless entry and start, 16-inch alloy wheels, and a USB port.</p>

<p><strong>MX-5 Miata Club: </strong>Club models come with heated seats, LED fog lights, blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, a nine-speaker Bose audio system, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a second USB port. Models equipped with the standard manual transmission also have a sportier suspension tune, a shock tower brace, and a limited-slip differential as standard. The Club is the base model on the RF and adds a 4.6-inch instrument cluster display as standard.</p>

<p><strong>MX-5 Grand Touring: </strong>Essentially a more loaded comfort-oriented trim, the Grand Touring grade adds navigation, leather upholstery, automatic high beams, lane departure warning, and automatic climate control.</p>

<p>Optional extras on the Miata include Nappa leather upholstery (exclusively on the Grand Touring trim) and the BBS/Brembo package, which adds Brembo front brakes, lightweight 17-inch BBS alloy wheels, a front lip spoiler, black side sills, leather upholstery and a rear spoiler. An upgraded BBS/Brembo package is also available on the soft top with heated Recaro seats. You can only opt for the BBS/Brembo package on the Club trim.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a 2.0-liter I-4 with 155 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque, and offers a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 26/33 mpg city/highway with the manual and 26/35 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Miata. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert come standard on the Club and Grand Touring grades. Lane departure warning is only available on the Grand Touring trim.</p>

<p>The 2018 Miata has a small trunk that measures 4.6 cubic feet on the soft top and 4.5 cubic feet on the RF hardtop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/miata/2016/2016-mazda-mx-5-vs-2015-subaru-brz-comparison/">2015 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/brz/2018/">Subaru BRZ</a>, the Miata won because of its superior performance on the road and on a closed circuit. Its light and responsive character makes it a joy to drive on your favorite winding roads and its suspension tuning is well-balanced, so it doesn’t beat you up on rough roads. As with its predecessors, the 2018 Miata has a surprising amount of body roll, especially for such a lightweight sports car. Interior space is also at a premium.</p>

<p>The heavier, more stylish Miata RF is just as fun to drive as its lighter soft top sibling. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/miata/2017/2017-mazda-mx-5-miata-rf-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we noted that the added roll stiffness doesn’t have as much abrupt body roll, making it easier to control when you’re tossing the car around. On the road, the RF has a quieter interior with the roof up even at high speeds. However, with the roof down, there is more noise due to excessive wind buffeting.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda MX-5 shares its platform with the Fiat 124 Spider.</p>

<p>In addition to an exterior design refresh, the 2018 Mazda6 gets an updated powertrain lineup that includes a 2.5-liter turbo-four option and an updated multimedia system. A new Signature trim is now the range-topping model.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda6 is a front-drive midsize sedan that slots above the Mazda3 and is available in four trims.</p>

<p><strong>Mazda6 Sport: </strong>The base Sport trim gets you a 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth, the MazdaConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, cloth upholstery, a rearview camera, a USB port, keyless entry/start, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>Mazda6 Touring: </strong>Moving up to the Touring grade gets you features like dual-zone climate control, 19-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, a power-operated driver’s seat,  leatherette upholstery, navigation and a low-speed automatic emergency braking system. LED headlights, a sunroof, and a Bose audio system are available in packages.</p>

<p><strong>Mazda6 Grand Touring: </strong>As the second highest trim, the Grand Touring grade gets you adaptive full LED headlights, LED grille accent lighting, a sunroof, leather upholstery, LED fog lights, paddle shifters, a power-operated front passenger’s seat, heated rear seats, and an 11-speaker Bose audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Mazda6 Signature: </strong>The new range-topping model, the Signature, gets you unique features such as brown Nappa leather, real wood and aluminum trim, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster display, an 8.0-inch touchscreen for the MazdaConnect infotainment system, ventilated front seats, and a windshield-projected head-up display.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda6 comes standard with a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter I-4 paired to a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Power figures should be the same as in the CX-5, which is 187 hp and 186 lb-ft of torque. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/">Mazda</a>’s new 2.5-liter turbo-four with 250 hp (227 hp on regular fuel) and 310 lb-ft is optional and is only available with the six-speed automatic. EPA fuel economy ratings are 26/35 mpg city/highway with the automatic, 24/33 mpg with the manual, and 23/31 mpg with the turbo-four.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda6 received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t tested the 2018 model yet but the 2017 Mazda6 received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and an Average rating on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2017 Mazda6 received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the speed of a 25-mph impact by 24 mph (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test). With its solid crash and front crash prevention scores, the 2017 Mazda6 received the Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Available active safety features include adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, automatic high beams, and lane keeping assist. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are available on all trims.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda6 has a 14.8-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/mazda6/2016/2016-mazda6-gt-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said that the Mazda6 is fun to drive and offers great steering feel. However, it does suffer from excessive road noise with the optional 19-inch alloy wheels. The infotainment system works fine, but we wish the system offered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The naturally aspirated 2.5-liter I-4 offers acceptable power and, helpfully, the six-speed automatic transmission is not stingy with downshifts.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda6 is the second model to use the automaker’s 2.5-liter turbo-four after the three-row CX-9.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2018/">2018 Mazda CX-5</a> gets cylinder deactivation for improved fuel economy. Base Sport models get more standard features including a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Touring models get a full suite of active safety features as standard.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2018/">Mazda CX-5</a> is a compact crossover that slots below the larger three-row CX-9 and the subcompact CX-3. Front-wheel drive comes standard and all-wheel drive is optional on all trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Sport</strong>: On the base Sport trim, standard features include LED headlights, 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, the MazdaConnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>

<p><strong>Touring</strong>: The mid-grade Touring model adds leatherette upholstery, keyless entry, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, four USB ports (instead of the standard two), and 19-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Touring:</strong> Range-topping Grand Touring models come standard with leather upholstery, memory function for the driver’s seat, a power-operated passenger seat, adaptive LED headlights, LED taillights and fog lights, navigation, a Bose premium audio system, a power liftgate and a moonroof.</p>

<p>Options include a heated steering wheel, a head-up display and heated rear seats on the Grand Touring model, which are part of the Grand Touring Premium package. The Touring Preferred package adds navigation, a power liftgate, a sunroof, and the Bose premium audio system to the Touring trim.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/">Mazda</a> CX-5 is powered by a 2.5-liter I-4 with 187 hp and 186 lb-ft of torque paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings aren’t out for the 2018 CX-5 but it shouldn’t differ much from the 2017 model, which is rated at 25/31 mpg city/highway in front-drive models and 24/30 mpg with all-wheel drive. A diesel-powered is expected to arrive at some point during the next couple years.</p>

<p>In NHTSA testing, the 2018 CX-5 received a four-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 CX-5 but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side small overlap impact where it hasn’t been crash tested and the headlights test where it received an Acceptable score (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the CX-5 received a Superior rating after it avoided 12- and a 25-mph collisions (Superior is the highest possible rating in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Mazda CX-5 received the 2018 Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS</p>

<p>Standard on all CX-5s is a low-speed automatic emergency braking system, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. Touring and Grand Touring trims come standard with the full suite of active safety features, which includes adaptive cruise control, high-speed automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and lane keeping assist. Sport models, on the other hand, are available with the full active safety suite via the Sport i-ActivSense package.</p>

<p>With the standard 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats in place, the 2018 Mazda CX-5 has 30.9 cubic feet of cargo space and that can be expanded to 59.6 cubic feet. When properly equipped, the CX-5 can tow up to 2,000 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2017/2017-mazda-cx-5-grand-touring-awd-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we noted that due to its additional curb weight, the new CX-5 is slower than its predecessor and it the non-defeatable stability control made it a handful during handling tests. We enjoyed the CX-5’s crisp steering, quick throttle response, and quieter cabin thanks to additional sound deadening. Its handling chops continued to impress where it felt right at home on winding roads and didn’t exhibit much body roll.</p>

<p>The 2017 CX-5 lost a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2017/2017-honda-cr-v-vs-2017-mazda-cx-5-comparison-review/">comparison test</a> to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2017/">2017 Honda CR-V</a> because of the latter’s superior fuel economy, lower cost of ownership, more spacious interior, and is nearly on par with the Mazda in terms of driving dynamics. Although the CX-5 features an interior that’s more luxurious thanks to the extensive use of higher quality materials. However, the CX-5’s seats don’t have much support and feel flat.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mazda CX-5 was the first Mazda vehicle to feature the automaker’s new deconstructed grille design.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The RedArt Edition (SLC300) is new for 2018 and consists of Selenite Grey Metallic paint, chrome hood fins, red brake calipers, 18-inch wheels, exterior red trim, two-tone Black/Silver Pearl leather with red accents, aluminum with dark carbon grain interior trim, heated seats with Airscarf, and exclusive floor mats, steering wheel, and shift lever. The Performance Studio RedArt (AMG SLC43) includes designo Selenite Grey Magno paint, two-tone Black/Silver Pearl Nappa leather with red piping, two-tone Silver Pearl/Black Nappa leather seating, red exterior trim, and RedArt embroidery in the interior. The SLC-Class also receives mirror logo lamps and blind-spot assist (SLC43) as standard and an available Sport steering wheel wrapped in leather and Dinamica.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The SLC is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>’ smallest and most affordable roadster, positioned below the SL-Class and AMG GT roadsters. If you’re considering cabriolets, the C-Class Cabriolet is a softtop with more passenger and cargo space, but with a price that’s a few thousand dollars more than the SLC. Before the roadster was renamed the SLC as part of a 2017 refresh, the car was known for years as the SLK.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Two models make up the SLC-Class including the entry-level <strong>SLC300,</strong> which is powered by a 241-hp, 273-lb-ft 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 that’s EPA-rated at 25/32 mpg city/highway. The higher-performance <strong>AMG SLC43</strong> produces 362 hp and 384 lb-ft of torque from its 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 and delivers 20/29 mpg. A nine-speed automatic backs both engines, and all models send power to the rear wheels. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 SLC43 hit 60 mph in a quick 4.5 seconds. Opening and closing the hard top can be done at speeds up to 25 mph.</p>

<p>Standard features on the SLC300 include a rearview camera, integrated roll bar, Dynamic Select drive modes, electric trunk partition, a sport exhaust system, active LED headlights, 18-inch wheels, ambient lighting, a 7.0-inch display, power Sport seats, and aluminum interior trim with a carbon fiber finish. Available features include Magic Sky Control, Nappa/Dinamica Sport steering wheel, 18-inch AMG multispoke wheels, Designo Nappa leather upholstery, heated seats, Comand system with navigation and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and an in-car WiFi-hotspot. The SLC43 comes standard with many of the above options as well as AMG Ride Control Sport Suspension, an AMG limited-slip differential, AMG Night package, IWC Ingenieur dashboard analog clock, AMG carbon fiber interior trim, AMG illuminated door sills, and red brake calipers.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/slc-class/2018/">2018 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class</a> comes standard with Active Brake Assist (automatic emergency braking), Attention Assist (drowsy driver warning), dual roll bars, Neck-Pro head restraints (helps reduce rear-impact neck injuries), and a rearview camera. Most driver assist safety features can be found in the available Premium Package 3 (expect for Blind Spot Assist) and include Lane Keeping Assist, Distance Pilot Distronic (adaptive cruise control), Parking Assist, and Pre-Safe, a feature that flashed hazard lights, tightens the seat belt, and closes the windows if the system detects an impending collision.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The SLC utilizes exhaust sound flaps based on the engine speed that stay closed most of the time when in Eco and Comfort modes, and open earlier when in Sport mode.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/cls-class/2018/">2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class</a> now comes standard with a rearview camera. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a> also discontinued the CLS400, leaving only the CLS550 and CLS63 S.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/cls-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class</a> is a coupe-like luxury sedan that slots above the smaller CLA-Class and is available in rear- or all-wheel-drive configurations. Two models are available, the CLS550 (CLS550 4Matic is the all-wheel-drive variant) and AMG CLS63 S.</p>

Pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, adaptive high beams, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert are part of the optional Driver Assistance and Lane Tracking packages.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class has a 15.3-cubic-foot trunk and it can be expanded via the optional 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/cls-class/2015/2015-mercedes-benz-cls-class-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>, we said that the CLS550 offers prodigious power and the nine-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly. The standard air suspension also allows the CLS550 to handle well without causing the ride to get too harsh especially in  Sport mode. Even if you choose the AMG CLS63 S, the car rides surprisingly well, meaning it’s possible to drive it daily.</p>

<p>The first-generation Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class helped popularize the trend of coupe-like rooflines in sedans across the industry.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>After a refresh for the 2017 model year, the only update for 2018 is a new 19-inch wheel design.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The three-row GLS-Class may be the largest SUV in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>’ lineup but it’s not the most expensive; the flagship G-Glass starts at almost double the GLS’ starting price. The GLS is positioned above the rest of the SUV lineup that includes the GLA-Class, GLC-Class, and the GLE-Class.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base <strong>GLS450</strong> comes equipped with a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 that produces 362 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque and comes with an EPA-rating of 17/22 mpg city/highway. The next step up is the <strong>GLS550</strong> that is powered by a 4.7-liter twin-turbo V-8 that churns out 449 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque and delivers 14/19 mpg. The range-topping <strong>AMG GLS63</strong> packs a 577-hp, 561 lb-ft of torque twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8 that comes rated at 13/18 mpg. 4Matic all-wheel drive is standard across the board and a nine-speed automatic backs the non-AMG models while a seven-speed automatic backs the AMG GLS63. With the third and second rows folded down, the GLS offers an impressive 93.8 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>

<p>Standard features in the GLS450 include Airmatic air suspension, Dynamic Select drive modes, power-folding third-row, remote start, power folding mirrors with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> logo projector, 19-inch wheels, Nappa leather steering wheel, LED interior lighting, heated front seats, power moonroof, and a power liftgate. Available features include the Active Curve system (active stabilizer bars), an enhanced off-road driving program (adjustable off-road modes), 21-inch AMG wheels, interior aluminum trim, heated and cooled front cupholders, cabin-air purification system, heated second row seats, Nappa leather upholstery, 8.0-inch display with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, a rear seat entertained system, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen BeoSound premium sound system. The AMG GLS63 comes with many of the above features as standard but adds AMG Sport Suspension with adaptive damping plus, an AMG high-performance braking system, an AMG Sport exhaust, and available 22-inch AMG multispoke wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The GLS-Class comes standard with Active Brake Assist (collision warning and automatic braking), Attention Assist (drowsy driver warning), Trailer Stability Assist, Crosswind Assist, Pre-Safe (accident preparation system), and a rearview camera. Opt for the Driver Assistance package and your GLS will get Lane Keeping Assist, Speed Limit Assist, Pre-Safe Plus, adaptive cruise control with Steering Pilot, Active Blind Spot Assist, and Active Brake Assist with Cross-Traffic function (automatic braking for cross traffic and pedestrians). The AMG GLS63 comes standard with all the above features.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>During <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/mercedes-benz-gls-class-2017-suv-of-the-year-contender/">2017 SUV of the Year testing</a>, we sampled the GLS450 and GLS550 and enjoyed the large SUV’s handling prowess as it felt half its size on the track and we felt the transmission programming was spot-on. The new Comand infotainment system is good, but although “its bones are still good—it delivers a great ride and performance and one of the best third rows in the entire segment—it’s clear this is a vehicle nearing the end of its life cycle.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gl-class/2015/2015-mercedes-benz-gl450-4matic-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2015 Mercedes-Benz GL450 (when the model was refreshed for 2017, the name changed from GL to GLS), we liked the efficiency and power of the new twin-turbo V-6 that is more fuel efficient than the outgoing twin-turbo V-8 and provides similar performance. Handling was great for a large SUV but we found the interior a little boring.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Although very capable on the road, the GLS-Class offers 12.5 inches of ground clearance with the air suspension raised all the way up and 23.6 inches of fording depth.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a> gave the 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 a power bump to 385 hp. The AMG Performance Studio package is now available on the GLE43, and Natural Grain Brown Ash, Anthracite Poplar Wood trim, and Anthracite Poplar Wood trim are now available at no cost on the GLE63 and GLE63 S models.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a>’s coupe-like SUV lineup, the GLE-Class Coupe is positioned above the only other such model, the GLC-Class Coupe. When considering all SUVs, the GLE-Class Coupe slots below the GLS-Class and G-Class in price, but above the GLA-Class, GLC-Class, and the traditional GLE-Class.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The GLE-Class Coupe lineup consists of two AMG models including the <strong>AMG GLE43 Coupe</strong> and the <strong>AMG GLE63 S Coupe</strong>. A 385-hp, 384-lb-ft of torque 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 backed by a nine-speed automatic comes equipped in the GLE43 and has an EPA rating of 17/22 mpg city/highway. The GLE63 S uses the same engine found in the AMG GLS63, a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 that churns out a potent 577 hp and 561 lb-ft of torque and delivers 14/18 mpg. The GLE63 S utilizes a seven-speed automatic but both models come with 4Matic all-wheel drive standard. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the GLE43 and GLE63 S hit 60 mph in 5.2 seconds and 3.9 seconds respectively.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gle-class/2018/">2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class</a> Coupe comes well-equipped with standard features that include AMG-enhanced Direct-Steer system, AMG Airmatic Sport suspension, adaptive damping, Active Curve System with active roll stabilization (GLE 63 S), Wi-Fi hotspot, AMG Sport front seats, Nappa leather AMG Sport steering wheel, panorama roof, Active LED headlights, and adaptive high beams. Available features include AMG Dynamic Performance Exhaust (GLE63 S), 22-inch AMG wheels, the AMG Night package, interior aluminum trim, Exclusive Nappa leather upholstery (standard on GLE63 S), multi-contour front seats with massage feature, a rear seat entertainment system, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen BeoSound premium audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The GLE-Class, the SUV on which the GLE Coupe is based, is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS (the highest designation) because the crossover received the highest score of Good in all five crash evaluations and the highest score of Superior for front crash prevention. The crossover was able to completely avoid a 12 mph and 25 mph frontal collision thanks to the optional Active Braking Assist with Cross-Traffic Function (same as in the GLE Coupe) that is found in the Premium 3 package. However, the standard Active Braking Assist did not properly warn the driver of a possible collision and the IIHS did not test this system’s automatic braking feature.</p>

<p>Other standard safety features include Attention Assist (sleepy driver warning), Active LED headlights, blind spot warning, lane keep assist, Pre-Safe (pre-collision preparation), crosswind assist, and trailer stability assist. All of the available driver assist safety features are found in the Premium 3 package and include Distance Pilot Distronic with Steering Pilot (adaptive cruise control with lane centering), Active Brake Assist with Cross Traffic function, Active Blind Spot Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, speed limit assist, Pre-Safe Plus (Pre-Safe with after collision braking), Parking Pilot, and a surround view camera system.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x6/2015/x6-m-range-rover-sport-svr-gle63-s-coupe-cayenne-turbo-s/">four-way comparison</a> among large premium and quick SUVs, The AMG GLE63 S Coupe came in last behind the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/cayenne/2018/">Porsche Cayenne</a> Turbo S, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2018/">Land Rover Range Rover</a> Sport SVR, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x6/2018/">BMW X6</a> M. We didn’t like the brakes, transmission, and weight of the AMG and said, “Combine the noticeable heft of the GLE63 with the slowest-shifting transmission and least enjoyable brakes, and you wind up with a machine that feels massive.” “The transmission shifts quickly, but then there’s a delay and a lag after the shift.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gle-class-coupe/2016/2016-mercedes-benz-gle-coupe-first-test-review/">First Drive</a> of the two GLE-Class Coupe models, we said, “Both SUVs handle like sports cars during straight-line cruising at speeds over 100 mph. They feel heavy but very stable. The ride is quiet and the only noise you hear is from the exhaust, which will likely turn more heads than anything else about the AMG models.” Overall we liked how the coupe-like crossovers drove and said, “The GLE Coupe is comfortable, quiet, and powerful, whether you have the turbocharged V-6 or that wonderful V-8 under the hood.” “The fact that they are not actually coupes doesn’t really matter. Those few who understand what the GLE Coupe offers will be quite content to roll down the road in comfort while going really fast.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The GLE Coupe offers 60.7 cubic feet of cargo space, a significant drop from the non-coupe’s 80.3 cubic feet.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-Benz gave the GLA-Class a mild makeover that includes redesigned front and rear bumpers, a redesigned instrument cluster, new wheels, a new Canyon Beige paint color, and Black Ash matte wood trim replaced Burl Walnut. An 8-inch high-resolution display and a rearview camera are now standard and a limited Ice Edition is now available.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The GLA-Class is Mercedes-Benz’s smallest and least expensive SUV that slots behind the GLC-Class, the GLE-Class, the GLS-Class, and the G-Class in the automaker’s SUV lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 (front-wheel drive) and GLA250 4Matic (all-wheel drive) are powered by a 208-hp, 258-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 mated to a seven-speed automatic. The high-performance AMG GLA45 uses a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 that produces an impressive 375 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque. This hand-built engine is mated to AMG’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic that sends power to an AMG all-wheel-drive system. Neither Mercedes-Benz nor the EPA has yet to release fuel economy figures as of this writing. Mercedes-Benz claims the 0-60 mph time drops from 7.2 and 7.1 seconds with the front- and all-wheel-drive GLA250 models to 4.3 seconds for the AMG GLA45. In Motor Trend testing, however, we clocked an all-wheel-drive GLA250 hitting 60 in 6.9 seconds.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz no longer holds back with standard features such as a power liftgate, remote start with the mbrace apps, 18-inch wheels (19-inch for GLA45), 8-inch infotainment display screen, mbrace services with mbrace Connect, pre-wiring for Garmin Map Pilot, and Dynamic Select driving modes. Generous optional features consist of Android Auto, panorama roof, a 12-speaker harman/kardon sound system, 12-color ambient lighting, and an available Night package. The available Dynamic Plus Package features a front limited slip differential, AMG Ride Control Sport suspension, a Race mode, and a 167-mph top speed.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The GLA-Class now comes standard with Active Brake Assist as standard. This feature will warn the driver of a possible impact and apply the appropriate braking force if necessary. If the driver does not react or reacts too late the system can autonomously apply the brakes to prevent or reduce the impact of a collision. Another new standard feature is the automaker’s Attention Assist, a system that can detect signs of drowsiness and warn the driver. Other standard features include Hill-Start Assist, automatic brake drying, a brake hold feature, and eight airbags. The optional Active Lane Keeping Assist will nudge you back into your lane while Distance Pilot Distronic automatically maintains a selected distance to the vehicle in front during stop and go driving.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla-class/2015/2015-mercedes-benz-gla-class-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla-class/2015/">2015 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class</a>, we liked the driving dynamics of the GLA250 and the power and sound from the GLA45: “The new GLA could be a real problem for a handful of premium compact utes. Those who choose the GLA likely won’t care what makes an SUV real or not. The GLA’s prestigious badge and … low price of entry will be reason enough, especially for the younger buyers.” In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla-class/2015/2015-mercedes-benz-gla250-gla45-amg-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2015 GLA250 and GLA45 we enjoyed the fun-driving GLA250, forgave some of its cheap interior pieces, and loved how exciting the GLA45 is to drive and said, “The GLA45 AMG is a riot on wheels; it’s fast as stink and begs the driver to wring the four-banger out for all it’s worth. Without a doubt, the GLA45 is most at home being throttled mercilessly on winding back-country two-tracks.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla-class/2018/2018-mercedes-benz-gla-first-look-review/">2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class</a> features an optional off-road comfort suspension package that raises the ride height by 1.2 inches.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> expands the E-Class lineup with the addition new advanced safety features, new engines, as well as new wagon, coupe, and cabriolet models.  A more powerful AMG E63 S will be available in sedan and wagon body styles.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>In price, the E-Class is positioned above the entry-level CLA-Class and smaller C-Class but below the more expensive CLS and flagship S-Class. The E-Class is available in several body styles powered by an assortment of turbocharged engines.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base E300 (rear-wheel-drive) and E300 4Matic (all-wheel-drive) are powered by a 241-hp, 273-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbo I-4 engine. A 329-hp, 354-lb-ft 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 powers the E400/E400 4Matic Cabriolet, the E400 4Matic Wagon, and E400/E400 4Matic Coupe. The AMG E43 Sedan (4Matic) uses a more powerful version of the 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 that is tuned to deliver 396 hp and 384 lb-ft. The AMG-handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 produces a whopping 603 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque and comes equipped in the new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-AMG E63 S Sedan and Wagon (both with 4Matic all-wheel drive). All engines are paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission; the AMG E63 models use a beefier AMG Speedshift nine-speed unit.</p>

<p>The 2018 E-Class Coupe and Cabriolet come standard an impressive 12.3-inch high-resolution display with navigation, ambient lighting with 64 colors to choose from, Dynamic Select driving modes, panorama roof on the coupe, and power-adjustable front seats with lumbar adjustability and memory. Available features include a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster (in addition to the 12.3-inch Comand screen), Air Body Control air suspension, head-up display, wireless charging, and multi-contour seats with four different massage functions. The sleek and powerful AMG E63 S Wagon includes many high-performance features like the AMG Dynamic Select drive modes, AMG suspension with full-support multi-chamber air suspension with three different damping modes, an electronically controlled rear limited-slip differential, a specially tuned all-wheel-drive system, dynamic engine mounts, and an available AMG Ceramic Composite braking system for maximum stopping power. The E63 S Sedan comes with the above features but also adds a new AMG Track Pace app for iPhone users that supplements the Racetimer feature. Owners can use the app to analyze vehicle data and improve their track time, share the results with other drivers via Facebook, Vimeo, or YouTube, and can connect to GoPro cameras.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The E-Class offers some of the most advanced active safety features currently on the market. The Pre-Safe Impulse Side feature rapidly inflates the front driver or passenger seat’s side bolster, moving the passenger 2.75 inches away from the impact zone once the system detects a side collision. When the standard Pre-Safe Sound detects an accident, the system will emit a short interference signal if a collision is detected, triggering a protective reflex in the ear helping to reduce hearing loss. Distance Pilot Distronic can follow a vehicle at a pre-selected distance up to 130 mph while Steering Pilot helps the driver stay in the middle of the lane with slight steering wheel adjustments. Evasive Steering Assist will assist the driver in an evasive maneuver by adding calculated steering torque and the Cross-Traffic feature of the Active Brake Assist system can detect cross-traffic and automatically brake if necessary. Active Lane Change Assist will automatically change lanes for the driver if clear. The standard Car-to-X Communication (car-to-car) feature can communicate with other Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with the same feature and help the driver avoid upcoming road hazards they cannot see yet like traffic accidents.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/e-class/2018/2018-mercedes-amg-e63-s-4matic-first-drive-review/">First Test review</a>, we loved the 603-hp, all-wheel-drive AMG E63 S and said it drives “monstrously.” “For the past year, I’ve been running around Los Angeles in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/">Dodge</a> Hellcat: 707 horsepower, 650 lb-ft of torque, 4,530 pounds, and an eight-speed automatic transmission. The E63 feels as if it could snap the Hellcat in half.”</p>

<p>However, this big and fast sedan is not a track car as the E63 tends to understeer on tight corners. The AMG prefers to conquer straight roads. “Time will tell, but until then, rest comfortably in the knowledge that the new E63 does nothing to tarnish the legend of both the mighty sedans that came before or AMG itself. Long live the Hammer.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s90/2017/volvo-s90-t6-cadillac-ct6-20t-mercedes-benz-e300-luxury-sedan-comparison/">2.0-liter turbo-four luxury sedan comparison</a>, the 2017 E300 Sport came in ahead of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/ct6/2017/">2017 Cadillac CT6</a> but behind the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s90/2018/">Volvo S90</a> T6 AWD Inscription. “Although the Mercedes E300 makes a good case for itself behind the wheel, its tight backseat package and inconsistent self-driving suite combined with its test-highest $70,025 sticker price relegate it to second place.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/e-class/2017/2017-mercedes-benz-e400-4matic-wagon-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Mercedes-Benz E400 4Matic Wagon, we felt the E400 was a superb wagon until you switch modes, “Speaking of modes, switching between the Eco, Comfort, Sport and Sport+ settings available for the powertrain, suspension and steering reveals the E400 4Matic’s sole weakness: Inexplicably clumsy calibration of the steering weighting and transmission shift feel. Still, overall we still enjoyed the Mercedes-Benz wagon and said, “In so many ways it’s a worthy successor to the legendary W123 and W124 wagons; durable, high-quality, deeply capable cars that were the stealth-wealth icons of the 70s and 80s. And although a few gigabytes perhaps separate it from sublime greatness – the steering and the transmission niggles are easy software fixes – it is still the world’s best wagon.”</p>

<p>The AMG S63 S Wagon’s handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbo produces an impressive 627 lb-ft of torque from 2,500-4,500 rpm and a peak power rating of 603 hp, providing a Mercedes-Benz claimed 0-60 mph time of 3.4 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Two new special edition CLAs include the <strong>Ice Edition</strong> (400 units) in Cirrus White or Polar White paint with Matte White foil strips, AMG Line exterior body panels, the Night package, LED High-Performance headlights, Premium package, a panorama roof, and 18-inch AMG wheels with black accents. There’s also the <strong>AMG Studio</strong> package, which comes in Night Black or Cosmos Black with contrast AMG stripes in Matte Graphite Gray, yellow exterior accents, 19-inch Black AMG wheels with yellow trim and performance seats.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> markets the CLA-Class lineup as a coupe due to its coupe-like styling, but this entry-level vehicle has four doors and slots below the rest of the automaker’s sedan lineup that includes the C-Class, E-Class, CLS-Class, and S-Class sedans. The CLA is the most affordable vehicle in the Mercedes’ portfolio and was refreshed for the 2017 model year.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The CLA-Class consists of three models including the CLA250, CLA250 4Matic, and the range-topping AMG CLA45 (standard with 4Matic all-wheel drive) that comes powered by a very potent 2.0-liter turbo-four that generates 375 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque and still manages to deliver a respectable 23/30 mpg city/highway. The entry-level CLA250 and CLA250 4Matic both also pack a 2.0-liter turbo-four but tuned to produce a more efficient 208 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque and come with an EPA rating of 24/37 mpg and 24/32 mpg for the 4Matic. Both engines are backed by a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.</p>

<p>The CLA-Class’ standard equipment includes a rearview camera, Active Brake Assist, 8.0-inch center display, adaptive braking technology, Dynamic Select driving modes, dual-zone climate control and 17-inch wheels. Available equipment includes Parking Pilot (self-parking system), a panorama roof, LED headlights and taillights (standard on AMG), a Harman Kardon premium audio system, smartphone integrations with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, 12-color ambient lighting, heated front seats, and the AMG Aerodynamics package (standard on the AMG). The AMG Dynamic Plus package is exclusive to the CLA45 and consists of a front limited-slip differential, AMG Ride Control with adaptive damping, Race mode, and a 167-mph track top speed.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The CLA-Class has not been crash tested but the IIHS gave the sedan the second highest rating of Advanced for front crash prevention because the standard Collision Prevention Plus automatic braking feature was able to reduce a 12 mph collision by 7 mph and a 25 mph collision by 22 mph. However, with the Driver Assist package that includes Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control and Lane Keep Assist, the highest rating of Superior was issued because the system was able to completely avoid a 12 mph and 25 mph collision and properly warned the driver. Attention Assist, a drowsy driver alert, is standard.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>After one year with our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/cla-class/2015/2015-mercedes-benz-cla250-4matic-review-verdict/">long-term 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 4Matic</a>, we appreciated the size of the sedan for the city — not too big to park and not too small to feel vulnerable. The Mercedes drove well but we didn’t care for the transmission that defaults into Eco mode. However, the accurate and nicely weighted steering made the CLA fun to drive. The very small back seats are an issue as they do not fit adults very well, but the Comand infotainment system is impressive. “Dynamically, we hope Mercedes can recalibrate the unappealing transmission shift settings. And because that entry price has surged a bit, sprinkling some of the top technology into this lower-tier model might not be such a stretch.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-mercedes-benz-cla-250-first-test/">2014 CLA First Test</a> review, we felt the sedan had great value with loads of standard equipment and good interior quality but the back seats are very small. The standard sport suspension can be stiff over harsh roads but provided fun driving dynamics. The engine provides quick acceleration and plenty of torque and the sedan’s design is bold. “With the CLA250, engineers have put together a vehicle that melds technology, style, fuel frugalness, and sportiness seamlessly, and a build quality that new brand buyers — both young and old — will devour.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The CLA250’s 258 lb-ft of torque happens very early at just 1,200 rpm, and lasts until 4,000 rpm.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Minor updates include two new exterior colors – Designo Orange Metallic and Designo Ocean Blue Metallic – and the new Designo Manufaktur Red and Black Edition on the G550 and the AMG Performance Studio package on the AMG G63.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The G-Class is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a>’s flagship SUV, positioned above the GLA-Class, GLC-Class, GLE-Class, and GLS-Class in price (although the GLS is bigger). This body-on-frame SUV has one of the highest starting prices in the automaker’s entire lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Powering the G550 base model is a 416-hp, 450-lb-ft of torque twin-turbo V-8 that delivers an EPA-rated 13/14 mpg city/highway. The same engine powers the lifted G550 4×4<sup>2 </sup>model, but that version delivers 11/11 mpg. The AMG G63 is powered by 5.5-liter V-8 that churns out 563 hp and 561 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 12/14 mpg. The range-topping AMG G65 packs a big 6.0-liter twin-turbo V-12 that produces a whopping 621 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque and delivers 11/13 mpg. All models come standard with permanent four-wheel drive (with a two-speed transfer case and three locking differentials) and a seven-speed automatic transmission. The G550 4×4<sup>2 </sup>has an incredible 17.2 inches of ground clearance.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-Benz G-Glass comes standard with a dual side-exit exhaust system, 19-inch AMG wheels, stainless-steel brush guard, LED daytime running lights, Nappa leather upholstery, 10-way power heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, interior ambient lighting, Comand multimedia system with central controller and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. Available features for the G-Class lineup include an AMG Sport exhaust system, an AMG high-performance braking system, 21-inch AMG wheels, Nappa/Dinamica AMG Performance steering wheel, Designo wood trim, a Dinamica Interior Package, an AMG Night package, and a rear seat entertainment system. The G550 4×4<sup>2 </sup>comes standard with 22-inch wheels, wide wheel arches, two-tone paint, portal axles with red suspension springs, stainless steel undercarriage skid plates, AMG carbon fiber trim, and seats and doors panels in Dinamica microfiber with diamond stitching.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The G-Class lineup comes standard with adaptive cruise control, blind-spot warning, Parking Assist Parktronic (front and rear parking sensors), rearview camera, trailer stability assist, and an illuminated entry system. The G-Class does not have any additional driver assist safety features available.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/land-cruiser/2016/jeep-wrangler-mercedes-benz-g550-toyota-land-cruiser-comparison/">three-way comparison</a> among highly capable and expensive off-road SUVs, the AMG G65 came in third: “Although the Mercedes G550 handled everything, we agreed that its poor observed fuel economy, propensity to scrape expensive mechanical bits off-road, and white-knuckle handling characteristics both on the road and in the snow should put this endearing European in third.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2016-mercedes-benz-g550-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the refreshed G550, we liked the power from the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 and the decent ride quality, but the on-road driving dynamics are poor. We enjoyed the G-Glass’ luxury and said, “Part of the G-Wagen’s mountain-crushing weight is all the sound-deadening material they’ve crammed into it over the years. Thanks to that it’s actually pretty comfortable and quiet inside despite the big tires, truck frame, and barn-inspired aerodynamic profile. The leather is absurdly rich for the vehicle, the seats are comfortable and supportive.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The G550 4×4<sup>2 </sup> weighs in at a whopping 6,825 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>C300 and C300 4Matic models receive a new nine-speed transmission and 18-inch five-spoke split wheels are standard on the coupe and cabriolet models. The sedan models now have a power moonroof standard and the C350e gets standard LED headlights. A rearview camera is now standard on coupe models, as is wood trim on the cabriolet models. The coupe and cabriolet models now offer Designo Selenite Grey Magno paint and the AMG Performance Studio package. All AMG models now have the AMG Track App feature.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a>’s sedan lineup, the C-Class is positioned above the entry-level CLA-Class and below the larger and more expensive E-Class and S-Class sedans. The C-Class coupe is the most affordable slotting below the E-Class, CLS-Class, S-Class, and the AMG GT coupes. The E-Class and S-Class cabriolets slot above the smallest of the cabriolets, the C-Class cabriolet.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/c-class/2018/">2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> lineup offers three turbocharged engines – 2.0-, 3.0-, and 4.0-liter – backed by either a nine-speed automatic or a seven-speed automatic for the AMG 63 and 63 S models.

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/c-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> their highest five-star rating and the IIHS considered the C-Class as a 2017 Top Safety Pick. The Top Safety designation was given because the C-Class scored the highest rating of Good in all five crash evaluations and received the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention by avoiding a 12 and 25 mph frontal collision thanks to the available Pre-Safe with Pedestrian Recognition driver assist safety feature. The C-Class missed out on a Top Safety Pick+ rating because the IIHS rated its headlights as Poor.</p>

<p>Collision Prevention Assist warns the driver of a collision and applies the brakes automatically at speeds up to 65 mph if necessary then actives Pre-Safe. If Pre-Safe detects a rollover or collision, the system will tighten the front seat belts, adjusts the front passenger seat, and closes all the windows and the moonroof. Pre-Safe Brake with Pedestrian Detection can detect an impending collision with a large object or pedestrian and can apply up to 100 percent of braking power up to 35 mph. That feature comes in the Premium Driver Assistance package that also includes blind spot assist, adaptive cruise control with Steering Assist, brake assist with cross-traffic assist, Pre-Safe Plus, Active Lane Keeping assist, speed limit assist, satellite radio, and hands-free keyless access.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>During <em><a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/mercedes-benz-c300-coupe-4matic-2017-car-of-the-year-contender/">Motor Trend Car of the Year testing</a></em>, the 2017 C300 4Matic coupe handled great on our test track, with good braking and acceleration, but we felt the ride was terrible over rough road surfaces. The interior is appealing and quality is good but the bad packaging leaves an extremely small rear seat. We also didn’t like the styling of the coupe, preferring the sedan’s styling instead. “Although the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> sedan may have edged ahead of its <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/3-series/">BMW 3 Series</a> rival, its coupe brother makes a less compelling case compared with the better-looking and more dynamic <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/4-series/">BMW 4 Series</a>.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-bmw-330i-audi-a4-mercedes-benz-c300-cadillac-ats-jaguar-xe-lexus-is-200t-volvo-s60-comparison/">Big Test of premium sedans</a>, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300 came in third place out of eight. The C300 handled very well but delivered a stiff ride, but braking and acceleration were impressive. The Mercedes’ interior was the best in the competition, luxurious, comfortable and quiet but crash safety scores were mid-pack. At the end of the comparison we said, “An excellent all-around performer, the Mercedes-Benz C300 is by far the most luxurious car here while still offering serious performance credentials. If its options packages were more value-oriented and the Sport edition carried a more luxurious ride, it might’ve managed the silver instead of bronze.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-quadrifoglio-bmw-m3-mercedes-amg-c63-cadillac-ats-v-comparison/">four-way super premium sedan comparison</a>, the 2017 Mercedes-AMG C63 S came in last place. The best part of the sedan was the powerful and great-sounding 503-hp twin-turbo V-8, but other than that, the AMG fell short in the competition, “The AMG is impressive in the corners, beating everything but the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> in our handling tests. Unfortunately, the experience doesn’t back up the numbers—the C63 feels like an unwilling participant in the sport-sedan game. Its steering turns rubbery as the g-forces rise, and its brake pedal becomes less responsive when the carbon-ceramic front (and steel rear) brakes heat up.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>During <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the rear-drive Mercedes-AMG C63 S (503 hp) hit 60 mph in 4.0 seconds, only 0.2 seconds faster than the all-wheel drive 362-hp AMG C43.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p>The only significant change on the 2018 GLE-Class is an increase of horsepower on the 3.0-liter twin-turbo engine found in the GLE43, from 362 hp to the current model’s 385 hp. Also, with the GLE43 in the lineup, the GLE400 model is gone.</p>

<p>The GLE-Class is positioned above the GLA-Class, GLC-Class, but below the GLS-Class. The GLE-Class is also offered in coupe-like SUV form—that model is positioned above the GLC-Class Coupe in size and price.</p>

<p><strong>2018 GLE350 (and GLE350 4Matic)</strong>: The GLE-Class’ base trim comes equipped with Dynamic Select drive modes, the Active Curve system, 19-inch wheels, aluminum roof rails, all-wheel drive (4Matic model), Nappa leather-wrapped steering wheel, interior LED lighting, Eucalyptus wood trim, Active Brake Assist (automatic emergency braking), Attention Assist, Pre-Safe, rearview camera, 10-way power driver’s seat, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, power sunroof, power liftgate, MB-Tex upholstery, an 8.0-inch display screen with a central controller, and dual USB audio ports.</p>

<p><strong>2018 GLE550e 4Matic</strong>: Slotting above the GLE350 is the GLE550e that comes standard with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, a four-mode hybrid drive mode selector, a radar-based regenerative braking system, topstitched dashboard trim, side-mirror logo projectors, blind-spot assist, lane keep assist, leather upholstery, a 115-volt power outlet, Comand infotainment system with navigation and a touchpad controller, a Harman/Kardon audio system, dual USB audio ports with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and an in-dash DVD/CD player.</p>

<p><strong>2018 AMG GLE43</strong>: The entry-level AMG model is the GLE43, which comes equipped with an AMG-enhanced engine, AMG Performance-focused 4Matic all-wheel-drive system, AMG Dynamic Select drive modes, AMG Sport Airmatic suspension with adaptive damping, aluminum paddle shifters, an AMG Sport exhaust system, AMG body styling, Gloss Black exterior accents, 20-inch AMG five-spoke wheels, a Sport steering wheels, AMG instrument cluster, dual-chrome exhaust tips, and aluminum interior trim.</p>

<p><strong>2018 AMG GLE63</strong>: The next step up is the AMG GLE63 that features a hand-crafted AMG engine, an AMG high-performance braking system, 20-inch AMG 10-spoke wheels, AMG Nappa leather-wrapped performance steering wheel, dual chrome AMG exhaust tips, multi-color interior ambient lighting, active LED headlights, Parking Pilot self-parking system, a surround-view camera system, heated and cooled front cup holders, Exclusive Nappa leather upholstery, and a 10-way power passenger’s seat.</p>

<p><strong>2018 AMG GLE63 S</strong>: The range-topping trim adds a more powerful AMG engine, 21-inch AMG cross-spoke silver wheels, AMG Nappa/Dinamica performance steering wheel, and 14-way power AMG Sport front seats with heated and ventilated controls.</p>

<p>Notable features for the non-AMG models include wood/leather steering wheel, Natural Grain Brown Ash wood trim, designo black Dinamica headliner, Distance Pilot Distronic and Steering Pilot (adaptive cruise control with lane centering), cabin-air purification system, multicontour front seats with massaging feature, and designo Expresso Brown exclusive Nappa leather. AMG models are available with AMG Dynamic Performance exhaust, AMG carbon fiber and black piano lacquer interior trim, and the AMG Night package.</p>

<p>The GLE-Class utilizes one of the few non-turbo engines left in <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>’ portfolio, a 3.5-liter V-6 found in the base GLE350 (rear-wheel drive) and GLE350 4Matic that produces 302 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque. The <strong>GLE350</strong> comes with an EPA rating of 18/23 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and 18/22 mpg with all-wheel drive. The <strong>GLE550e 4Matic plug-in</strong> is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo engine and an electric motor for a combined output of 436 hp and 479 lb-ft and delivers 20/23 mpg, 43 mpge with help from the plug-in hybrid system, and can run on all-electric power for up to 8 miles. The <strong>AMG GLE43</strong> sports a twin-turbo V-6 that now produces 385 hp and 384 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 17/23 mpg. The <strong>AMG GLE63</strong> and range-topping <strong>GLE63 S</strong> pack a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 that produces 550 hp, 516 lb-ft in GLE63 form with 577 hp and 561 lb-ft if you go for the S model. The engine delivers 14/18 mpg in both power outputs. With the exception of the rear-drive GLE350 base model, all models come standard with 4Matic all-wheel drive. The GLE AMG43 is the only GLE model to utilize the nine-speed automatic, the remaining models use a seven-speed automatic.</p>

<p>The GLE-Class is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS (the highest designation) because the crossover received the highest rating of Good in all five conducted crash evaluations and the highest score of Superior for front crash prevention. The GLE completely avoided 12- and 25-mph frontal collisions thanks to the optional Active Braking Assist with Cross-Traffic Function that is found in the available Premium 3 package. Unfortunately, the standard Active Braking Assist system did not properly warn the driver of a possible collision and the IIHS did not test this system’s emergency automatic braking feature. Additional driver assist safety features found in the Premium 3 package include Active Blind Spot Assist, Active Lane Keep Assist, Active LED headlights, Adaptive Highbeam Assist, Parking Pilot (self-parking system), Distance Pilot Distronic with Steering Pilot (adaptive cruise control with lane centering), a surround view camera system, speed limit assist, and Pre-Safe Plus (applies brakes after accident). Standard features include Active Brake Assist, Attention Assist (drowsy driver alert), trailer stability assist, crosswind assist, blind-spot monitoring, lane keep warning, rearview camera, and Pre-Safe (pre-collision preparation).</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> GLE350 (also 4Matic) and GLE550e offer 38.2 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats up and 80.3 cubic feet with the seats folded down. That’s a decent amount of cargo room but slightly less than the three-row <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/xc90/2018/">Volvo XC90</a>’s 85.7 cubic feet of total cargo room. Front seat legroom measures in at 40.3 inches and 38.4 inches for the rear seats.</p>

<p>The GLE-Class comes standard with an 8.0-inch center display with an infotainment system controlled by a rotary central controller, Bluetooth, dual USB audio ports, remote start with cabin preconditioning, and a household-type 115-volt power outlet for electronics. Available technology features include the Comand infotainment system with a touchpad rotary controller, navigation, a rear seat entertainment system featuring two LCD monitors, a 14-speaker 900-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen BeoSound premium sound system, a 4G LTE WiFi hotspot, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and adaptive cruise control that can come to a complete stop, with lane centering. The various mbrace packages offer services including turn-by-turn route guidance through mbrace Concierge and SOS/Emergency Call through mbrace Secure.</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/mercedes-benz-gle-class-2016-motor-trend-suv-of-the-year-finalist/">2016 Motor Trend SUV of the Year testing</a>, the GLE-Class was a finalist. We liked the many engine choices, off-road capability, and on-road behavior, but felt the new “Coupe” model was impractical and had strange styling. We liked the power from the turbocharged V-6 and V-8 engines but wished the new nine-speed automatic was used in all models. Hurting the GLE is its somewhat boring interior: “Same old but slightly more refined Benz interior, particularly the center stack. Time to try something new, guys.”</p>

<p>At the end of our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gle-class/2016/2016-mercedes-benz-gle-class-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2016 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gle-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class</a> lineup, we said that “the GLE, no matter what flavor of powertrain a person selects, is the complete package. It still has the utility to carry all the gear for a hockey team, but it does so with more luxury than before. It can get the groceries, deliver the kids to school, and still be ready for a road trip. That’s the real power to this SUV, it does everything buyers in this segment will want.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The GLC-Class Coupe lineup receives two new and quick variants, the AMG GLC63 and the GLC63 S coupes. Both new GLC Coupe variants are powered by a twin-turbo V-8.</p>

<p>The base model <strong>GLC300 4Matic Coupe</strong> is powered by a 241-hp, 273-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter I-4 that comes with an EPA rating of 22/27 mpg city/highway. The <strong>AMG GLC43 Coupe</strong> packs a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 that produces 362 hp and 384 lb-ft of torque and delivers 18/24 mpg. The <strong>AMG GLC63</strong> and <strong>GLC63 S</strong> are both powered by the same 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 but in different power outputs — 469 hp and 479 lb-ft for the GLC63 and 503 hp and 516 lb-ft for the S model. All models come standard with a nine-speed automatic transmission and 4Matic all-wheel drive. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> claims that the GLC63 S can hit 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, which is very quick for an SUV.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 comes standard with Dynamic Select drive modes, selective damping system, torque vectoring braking, 19-inch wheels, natural grain Brown Ash wood trim, 14-way power driver’s seat, power liftgate, 7.0-inch display with central controller, and dual-zone climate control.

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc-class-coupe/2017/2017-mercedes-benz-glc300-coupe-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc-class/2017/">2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class</a> Coupe, we said, “Mercedes-Benz says the GLC Coupe is “the sports car among the midsize SUVs,” which suggests the marketing folks haven’t driven either the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/macan/2018/">Porsche Macan</a> or the new <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> F-Pace. The GLC300 Coupe is a smidge more nimble, a touch more buttoned-down, than the regular GLC300, but it is no sports car. The chassis doesn’t disappoint, but it doesn’t excite, either. It’s just quietly competent. The GLC300 Coupe steers better and rides better than <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s X4.”  “Push hard, though, and it’s the front end that cries uncle first, the nose running wide until you get off the gas. Dynamically, it’s pretty one-dimensional.”</p>

<p>“AMG’s bigger wheels and tires, different front and rear bumper fascias, and a discreet spoiler across the lip of the rear hatch give the GLC43 Coupe a more muscular street presence than the regular version,” we said in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc-class/2017/2017-mercedes-amg-glc43-coupe-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC43 Coupe. We enjoyed the quick acceleration, smooth nine-speed, and the exhaust’s crackles. The ride didn’t feel anymore harsher than the regular GLC Coupe and the larger tires gave more grip, but the steering doesn’t have much feel. “A little quicker in a straight line and a little sharper in the twisties, the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe doesn’t merely look the part; it is unquestionably a more sporty drive than the GLC Coupe. Which is arguably the whole … er … point.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The new GLC63 and GLC63 S use the same AMG Speedshift nine-speed transmission that debuted in the Mercedes-AMG E63 S.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In an <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/mercedes-amg-s65-bentley-continental-gt-battle-head-2-head/">episode of the <em>Head 2 Head</em></a> series, the 2017 Mercedes-AMG S65 Cabriolet goes up against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bentley/continental-gt/2017/">2017 Bentley Continental GT</a> Speed Convertible Black Edition. Determining the winner ultimately came down to the vehicle with the modern platform. “Driving the two cars back-to-back, that decade of difference and development is quite apparent. With that said, it isn’t one or two small differences, it’s only clear when you add them all up. When you do, it’s clear that the winner of this <em>Head 2 Head </em>needs to be the Mercedes-AMG S65 Cabriolet.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/slc-class/2017/2017-mercedes-benz-s-class-cabriolet-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Mercedes-Benz S550 Cabriolet and Mercedes-AMG S63 Cabriolet, we loved the very luxurious interior of the S550 and said, “From behind the wheel, the ambiance remains über premium. My pearlescent white land yacht featured a maritime-inspired interior of deep-sea blue and porcelain, a fitting combination for the venue and one that felt as sumptuous as it looked, with extensive application of Nappa leather on the seats, doors, and dash.”</p>

<p>Once behind the wheel of the S63, the cabriolet proved to be a high-performance champ, “With standard 4Matic all-wheel drive that is split 33/67 front/rear and AMG’s proven seven-speed automatic, the S63 Cab deftly manages all 577 horses and 664 lb-ft, making not only sub-4.0-second 0-60 blasts seem routinely nonchalant but also Vmax runs to 200 mph seem wholly realistic.”</p>

<p>We compared the pre-refresh 2016 Mercedes-Benz S550 to the 2015 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> 750i in a <em>Head2Head</em> video, watch the episode here:</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Race Start function (launch control) is now available on the S63 and is activated by being in Sport or Sport+ mode and pressing hard on the brake pedal with the left foot while fully depressing the throttle with the right foot at the same time. As soon as the brake pedal is released, the S63 rockets forward with optimal traction, in a manufacturer-claimed 0-60 time of 3.4 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLC300 4Matic won our coveted title of <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/mercedes-benz-glc-class-2017-suv-of-the-year/">2017 Motor Trend SUV of the Year</a>: “The GLC isn’t the sexiest choice for SUV of the Year, but it’s without hesitation the smartest. The design is solid, the interior is first-class, the engineering is as good as small SUVs get, and the value proposition is strong. We have no crash data yet, but the E-Class chassis that the GLC is based upon underpins one of the safest cars on the road. And despite surprising all of us with its power output, displacing just 2.0 liters means that the engine is also scarily efficient.”</p>

<p>“The GLC is just solid, it aces all six of our criteria without skipping a beat.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc-class/2017/2017-mercedes-amg-glc43-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 AMG GLC43, we were impressed with the <em>Motor Trend</em> tested 0-60 mph time of 4.7 seconds and the 13.4-second quarter mile. The GLC43 did well in braking and on the skidpad. We enjoyed the driving dynamics of the SUV, “We loved the GLC300’s chassis, and the GLC43’s power hasn’t ruined it. AMG’s done a fantastic job of integrating the more powerful engine into this car, and it doesn’t just put up better numbers. The GLC43 remains highly composed in corners and puts its power down well. The body rolls a little as you first turn the wheel, but rather than floppy, it feels controlled and calculated.” The ride is firmer but not bad and handling is better. However, we wish the GLC had a snow, rain, and off-road driving modes.</p>

<p>The starting price is high and only gets worse with options, putting the small SUV in the pricing territory of larger SUVs. “Still, if you’re the type who wants your luxury SUV to haul ass, the 2017 Mercedes-AMG GLC43 delivers. Best of all, it does it without giving up any of the qualities that made the GLC-Class our SUV of the Year.”</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong> The SL-Class slots in the middle of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>’ roadster lineup, after the SLC-Class but before the AMG GT roadster. The SL-Class is one of the most expensive lineups offered by the automaker, with starting prices of the V-12 AMG model surpassing $200,000.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong> The SL-Class lineup consists of four models starting with the entry-level SL450 that comes powered by a 362-hp, 369-lb-ft 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 that delivers 20/28 mpg city/highway (2017). The top non-AMG model is the SL500 that comes equipped with a 4.7-liter twin-turbo V-8 that makes 449 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 17/25 mpg (2017). A 577-hp, 664 lb-ft of torque 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 powers the AMG SL63 and is rated at 16/25 mpg (2017). The range-topping SL65 packs the automaker’s 6.0-liter twin-turbo V-12 that produces an impressive 621 hp and a whopping 738 lb-ft of torque and delivers 13/22 mpg. The non-AMG models are backed by a nine-speed automatic while the AMG models utilize AMG’s seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Like a roadster should be, all models are rear-wheel drive. The base SL450 comes standard with Dynamic Select drive modes, ambient lighting, LED Intelligent Light System (adaptive headlights), smartphone integration with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, Parking Assist, a retractable hard top with a panorama view, and a Harman/Kardon surround sound audio system. AMG standard features add an AMG Sport Exhaust System, AMG high-performance compound braking system, 19-inch staggered width alloy wheels, carbon fiber engine cover, Nappa leather upholstery, heated and ventilated seats, and a Dinamica headliner in the SL63, and a Nappa leather headliner in the SL65. Optional features for the non-AMG models include Magic Sky Control (panoramic transparency feature), the Active Body Control with Curve function suspension system, Piano Lacquer wood trim, exclusive Designo Nappa leather upholstery, and active multicontour seats with massage. Available features on the AMG models consist of an AMG Carbon Ceramic braking system, AMG exterior carbon-fiber package, 19/20-inch AMG forged wheels, an AMG Nappa/Dinamica performance steering wheel, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen BeoSound premium sound system (standard on SL65).</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong> The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/sl-class/2018/">2018 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class</a> lineup comes standard with Attention Assist (sleepy driver alert), pop-up roll bars, Collision Prevention Assist Plus and Active Brake Assist, a collision warning and automatic braking system, and Pre-Safe (closes windows and tightens seatbelt before an accident). To get the most of the driver-assist safety system, opt for the Driver Assistance package that includes Distance Pilot Distronic with Steering Pilot (adaptive cruise control with lane centering), blind-spot assist, active lane keeping, Pre-Safe plus (keeps brakes  applied after rear-end collision), cross-traffic assist, Active Brake Assist with forward cross-traffic warning, and Pre-Safe brake (emergency braking when using Distronic).</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong> In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/sl-class/2017/2017-mercedes-benz-sl-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the refreshed 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/sl-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz SL-Class</a>, we liked the handling and acceleration of the roadster, but we weren’t crazy about the design and said: “Its collection of discordant visual treatments that are all clamoring too hard for attention. It’s like a pencil sketch that’s been drawn and erased too many times, every time with a firmer hand.” We also said: “The SL really does handle incredibly well. At the limit, it’s a car of big doses of both brain and brawn, a heavily muscled mechanical athlete that’s thinking much faster than you to keep the car on the road and away from those idyllic trees smearing past.” Surprisingly, we enjoined the SL450 the most and said: “We like the lighter feel and nimbler responses of the V-6-powered SL-Class, and despite it being the least powerful of the bunch, still found it to be faster than anyone would need it to be.” In a three-way <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/sl-class/2013/audi-r8-spyder-mercedes-benz-sl63-porsche-911-s-cabriolet/">super convertible comparison</a>, the 2013 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> SL63 (prerefresh but same model) came in second place, “Now, true, the SL63 is very ugly, the steering isn’t wonderful, and the price is nosebleed high, but what an engine!” We also said: “There are very few cars on the market that pull as hard at 150 mph as they do at 50 mph, and even fewer are convertibles. The power and response of this motor are simply incredible.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong> With the Active Body Control equipped, the SL can lower itself automatically by 0.51 inch, and at the press of a button, the SL can raise itself 1.97 inches if traveling on rough roads.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>AMG adds new variants to the GT lineup: the GT Roadster, GT C Coupe, GT C Roadster, and the quickest variant, the GT R coupe. The GT and GT S models received a facelift.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The GT is the flagship and only model that <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a>’s in-house performance division, AMG, produces, though the brand modifies many other <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a> vehicles. The base AMG GT has the highest starting price of all the automaker’s drop-top models and the second highest starting price of all the automaker’s coupes, after the S-Class Coupe. The AMG GT was bred for high-performance.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>All 2018 AMG GT models come equipped with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 in different power outputs depending on the model. The base GT coupe and GT Roadster produce 469 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque, the GT S coupe delivers 515 hp and 494 lb-ft of torque, The GT C Roadster and coupe both churn out 550 hp and 502 lb-ft of torque, and lastly, the GT R coupe produces an impressive 577 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque. All engines are mated to AMG’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that routes power to the rear wheels.</p>

<p>The 2018 AMG GT Roadster and coupe come standard with Airpanel active air management (automatic grille shutters), AMG Dynamic Select driving modes, AMG sport suspension, a limited slip rear differential, AMG Performance seats, AMG Panamericana grille reminiscent of a classic Mercedes, and a weight-optimized fabric soft top (roadster). On the other end of the spectrum is the GT R that comes standard with forged aluminum wheels (19-inch front and 20-inch rear) wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, adjustable nine-setting AMG traction control system, extensive use of carbon fiber, active rear-wheel steering, electronic limited-slip differential, manually adjustable AMG coil-over suspension, active aerodynamics, and the AMG Dynamic Plus package that includes Dynamic Engine and Transmission Mounts, increased front-wheel negative camber, and increased peak horsepower from 6,000-6,500 rpm.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 AMG GT’s standard features include eight airbags, Adaptive Highbeam Assist, a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring, Lane Keeping Assist, and the Attention Assist system that alerts the driver if the system detects drowsiness. Collision Prevention Assist Plus alerts the driver of a possible collision, applies the ideal amount of braking, and can autonomously apply the brakes at speeds up to 65 mph. Adaptive braking technology consists of Predictive Brake Priming (sets the pads closer to the discs for a more immediate braking response), Automatic Brake Drying (periodically applies the brakes just enough to remove water from the discs), and Hill-Start Assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/amg-gt/2018/2018-mercedes-amg-gt-r-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2018 Mercedes-AMG GT R, we were very impressed with the AMG’s driving dynamics, “This combination of agility and stability is the first thing you notice when hot-lapping the GT R. Compared with the GT S, the front end feels much more alert, responsive, and communicative into a corner. Stability under braking is stunning.” The overall performance of the coupe has significantly increased, “Acceleration, steering, braking, chassis balance: In every way the AMG GT R is noticeably more precise, more responsive, more athletic on the track than the GT S.” However, when compared to its direct competitor, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2018/">Porsche 911</a>, it feels a lot bigger, the driver does not get the same amount of feedback found in the 911, and the dual-clutch transmission is great but not as intuitive as the 911’s PDK transmission. However, “the GT R turned a 7-minute, 10.9-second-lap in the Green Hell, a comfortably quicker time than any 911 has managed.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/amg-gt/2018/2018-mercedes-amg-gt-roadster-first-ride-review/">First Ride review</a> of the new 2018 Mercedes-AMG GT C Roadster, we said, “In short, the dark gray GT C we only got to experience from the wrong seat is emotional, loud, quick, and sexy. It will be available for individuals with a high net worth to purchase by fall 2017. What a little monster.”</p>

<p>In Motor Trend’s <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/amg-gt/2016/2015-motor-trend-best-drivers-car/">2016 Best Driver’s Car testing</a>, the 2015 Mercedes-AMG GT S won the coveted prize out of 10 sports cars. “By the end of the program, it grew obvious that the AMG GT S was greater than the sum of its parts. Part Palm Springs weekend getaway car, part mountain road menace, and part track star, and wholly incomparable.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The available AMG Track Pace feature is an app that owners can use on their smartphone. The app links to the GT and records a host of data in real-time, such as speed, gear, time, position, acceleration, and steering angle.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mini Clubman gets a rearview camera and rear parking sensors as standard. Apple CarPlay is now included as part of the Technology package. A feature called the Attentive Assistant now comes standard and will recognize if the driver needs to take a break.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Mini Countryman is a small four-door hatchback/wagon available in front- or all-wheel drive configurations. The car is unique from other hatchbacks and wagons in that it features barn-style doors out back instead of a traditional hatch.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>There are two engines available in the 2018 Clubman including a base 1.5-liter turbo-three rated at 134 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque or a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 189 hp and 207 lb-ft in the Clubman S, or 228 hp and 258 lb-ft in the high-performance JCW model. A six-speed manual is standard on all models while a six-speed automatic is optional on the base front-drive Clubman. Base models with all-wheel drive, the Clubman S and JCW feature an eight-speed automatic option instead of the six-speed unit. There’s 17.5 cubic feet behind the split-folding rear seats and 47.9 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 24/34 mpg city/highway for the manual-equipped base Clubman and 24/32 mpg with the automatic. Opt for all-wheel drive and those numbers drop to 22/32 mpg with the manual and 23/31 mpg with the automatic. The Clubman S is slightly less efficient at 22/31 mpg with the manual and 23/32 mpg for the automatic. Add all-wheel drive and those numbers drop down to 21/30 mpg and 22/31 mpg for the manual and automatic respectively. The Clubman JCW, which comes standard with all-wheel drive, is rated at 21/31 mpg with the manual or 23/31 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>Standard features include 16-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, keyless start, a 6.5-inch screen, a rearview camera, rear park assist, Bluetooth connectivity, 60/40 split-folding rear seats and adjustable mood lighting. Options include leather upholstery, LED headlights, alloy wheels up to 19 inches in diameter, a head-up display, automatic parking assist, Apple CarPlay integration, an 8.8-inch touchscreen, navigation, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, wireless phone charging, adaptive dampers, 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats, driver’s seat memory, and keyless entry. As with all Mini models, the Clubman is available with an extensive list of customization options that includes racing stripes, chrome side mirror caps, two-tone interior upholstery, and unique roof decals.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash-tested the 2018 Mini Clubman. Models equipped with the Fully Loaded package can be equipped with the Active Driving Assistant, which bundles together adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, and automatic high beam assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mini/clubman/2016/2016-mini-clubman-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a>, we noted that the Mini Clubman S provided plenty of power on tap and that the eight-speed automatic shifted smartly and was always in the right gear. The manual transmission, on the other hand, worked well with the base 1.5-liter turbo-three and has gates that are easy to find, a smooth shifter, and good clutch action. In terms of handling, the Clubman is precise and its steering is not overly heavy. However, the start/stop system is abrupt because it restarts in a rough manner. The car’s interior is a major step up compared to its predecessor, as it now feels more upscale and is well-insulated.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Mini Clubman’s base engine, which is shared with the Hardtop, Convertible and Countryman, is related to the unit found in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/i8/2018/">BMW i8</a> sports car.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Mini Hardtop now comes with a rearview camera and rear parking sensors as standard.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Available in two- or four-door body styles, the 2018 Mini Hardtop is a front-drive subcompact hatchback that currently serves as the entry-level model for the Mini brand.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Mini Hardtop a 1.5-liter turbo-three with 134 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 189 hp and 207 lb-ft in the S or 228 hp and 236 lb-ft in the JCW. Both engines can be paired to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Cargo space is limited in the two-door at 8.7 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 34 cubic feet with them down. The four-door Hardtop is slightly more practical with 13.1 cubic feet behind the second row and 40.7 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the base two-door Hardtop in the Cooper trim are 28/38 mpg city/highway with the manual or 27/35 mpg with the automatic. The more powerful Cooper S and JCW models have the same fuel economy ratings at 23/32 mpg for the manual and 25/32 mpg with the automatic. Opt for the more practical four-door variant and you’ll be seeing 28/37 mpg with the manual or 27/35 mpg with the automatic, both equipped with the base three-cylinder. The more powerful S trim retains the same ratings as its two-door sibling.</p>

<p>Standard features include leatherette upholstery, a 6.5-inch screen, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, 15-inch alloy wheels, and keyless start. Options include navigation, an 8.8-inch screen, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, alloy wheels up to 18 inches in diameter, LED headlights, a head-up display, automatic parking assist, keyless entry, and adjustable dampers. You can also customize the Mini Hardtop extensively with upgrades such as two-tone exterior treatments, Union jack decals, and racing stripes.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Mini Hardtop a four-star overall safety score for the tw0-door model (out of a possible five stars) but it has yet to rate the four-door variant. In IIHS testing, the Hardtop received a Good score on all crash tests and Marginal on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). On the front crash prevention test, the car received an Advanced rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the impact in a 25-mph test by 7 mph (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-mini-hardtop-4-door-cooper-s-first-test-review/">2015 First Test</a> of a four-door Hardtop Cooper S, we said that the shifter is awkward, making it a chore to use the shifter on manual-equipped cars. The 2.0-liter turbo-four offers plenty of power on tap, making it easy to pass at higher speeds. However, the stop/start system is clunky and makes the car feel like its going to stall. Cabin noise is minimal thanks to plenty of sound insulation, making it a great cruiser. The high-performance JCW Hardtop proved plenty fun to drive, especially with the standard six-speed manual.  However, the car’s starting price is quite high and it can get even more expensive with just a few options, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-mini-john-cooper-works-hardtop-first-drive-review/">2015 First Drive</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/gti/2015/comparison-four-fun-sporty-runabouts-under-30000/">2014 comparison test</a> that also included the previous-generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/golf/2018/">Volkswagen Golf</a> GTI, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/wrx/2018/">Subaru WRX</a>, and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2018/">Honda Civic</a> Si, the Mini Hardtop Cooper S placed fourth due to is imprecise gearbox and busy ride. At the track, it wasn’t as confidence inspiring as it rivals because of its tendency to bounce around too much.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Mini Hardtop’s base turbocharged three-cylinder engine is closely related to the unit found in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/i8/2018/">BMW i8</a> hybrid sports car.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Mini Countryman compact crossover is available in front- or all-wheel drive configurations. Along with the Clubman, the Countryman is one of the largest Mini models to date. A plug-in hybrid variant called the Countryman S E All4 is also offered in addition to the traditional gas-powered models.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three powertrain options are available in the 2018 Countryman, a 1.5-liter turbo-three with 134 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 189 hp and 207 lb-ft in the Countryman S or 228 hp and 258 lb-ft in the Countryman JCW, and a plug-in hybrid system that pairs the base 1.5-liter turbo I-3 with an electric motor for a total output of 221 hp and 284 lb-ft. All gas models except for the front-drive Countryman S and the Countryman S E All4 come standard with a six-speed manual. A six-speed automatic is optional on the front-drive base model and standard on the Countryman S E All4 plug-in hybrid. An eight-speed automatic comes standard on the front-drive Countryman S and optional on the all-wheel-drive-equipped base Countryman, Countryman S, and JCW. Cargo space in the 2018 Countryman is 17.6 cubic feet with the split-folding rear seats up and 47.6 cubic feet with them down. The Countryman S E All4 has slightly less cargo space at 17.2 cubic feet behind the second row and 47.4 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings for the base 2018 Countryman are 24/34 mpg city/highway with the manual or 24/32 mpg with the automatic. With all-wheel drive, those numbers drop to 22/32 mpg with the manual and 23/30 mpg with the automatic. The front-drive Countryman S is rated at 23/32 mpg with its standard automatic transmission while the all-wheel-drive Countryman S All4 is slightly less efficient at 21/31 mpg with the manual and 22/31 mpg with the automatic. The performance-minded Countryman JCW is the least efficient model at 21/29 mpg with the manual and 22/30 mpg with the automatic. The plug-in Countryman S E All4 can travel up to 12 miles in EV mode and up to 270 miles with a full charge and a full tank according to the EPA, with 27 mpg combined.</p>

<p>Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, keyless entry/start, a panoramic sunroof, a 6.5-inch screen, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, and split-folding rear seats. Options include leather upholstery, alloy wheels up to 19 inches in diameter, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, a head-up display, an 8.8-inch touchscreen, navigation, Apple CarPlay integration, LED headlights, adaptive damping, automatic parking assist, wireless phone charging and a power tailgate. As with all Mini models, there’s an extensive list of available accessories that will allow you to customize the car accordingly from Union Jack side mirror covers to racing stripes and side stripes.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA hasn’t crash-tested the 2018 Countryman. In IIHS testing, the Countryman received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and a Marginal rating on the new headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). The crossover also received an Advanced rating on the front crash prevention test after it reduced the impact of a 12- and 25-mph crash by 7 mph (Superior is the highest possible score in front crash prevention). Models with the Fully Loaded package can be equipped with the Active Driving Assistant, which bundles forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and high beam assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mini/countryman/2017/2017-mini-countryman-first-drive/">2017 First Drive review</a>, we said that the Countryman drives like a tall hot hatch but it no longer crashes over bumps, making it feel more refined than its predecessor. Material quality in the cabin is also much improved, giving it a more upscale feel and there’s now generous space for rear seat passengers thanks to the longer wheelbase. Despite the more upscale vibe, the Mini Countryman’s quirky character hasn’t been lost. On the road, the Countryman handles well but suffers from more body roll than the Clubman. Even so, its ride remains smooth thanks to its longer wheelbase, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mini/countryman/2017/2017-mini-countryman-s-all4-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>. The latest version of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a>’s iDrive system is also much easier to use and now has a touchscreen controls in addition to the knob and button combo.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact<br/></strong></p>

<p>The Countryman S E All4’s plug-in hybrid powertrain features a battery mounted below the rear seats instead of under the trunk to minimize the amount of space it takes from the cargo area.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mini Convertible gets a rearview camera and rear parking sensors as standard equipment. Base models no longer come with a compact spare tire.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Mini Convertible is a front-drive soft-top convertible with seating for up to four passengers, and is closely based on the Hardtop model.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Mini Convertible including a 1.5-liter turbo I-4 with 134 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque or a 2.0-liter turbo I-4 rated at 189 hp and 207 lb-ft in the S trim or 228 hp and 236 lb-ft in the JCW.  A six-speed manual transmission is standard on all models and a six-speed automatic is optional. EPA fuel economy ratings are 28/37 mpg city/highway for the base car with the manual or 27/35 mpg with the automatic. The more powerful S trim is rated with 23/32 mpg with the manual or 25/32 mpg with the automatic. JCW models are rated at 22/31 mpg with the manual or 25/33 mpg with the automatic. Cargo space is small at 7.6 cubic feet with the top up and 5.7 cubic feet with the top down. Split-folding rear seats come standard for additional cargo space.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base model include 15-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, keyless start, rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, a 6.5-inch screen, Bluetooth connectivity, and interior mood lighting. Options include alloy wheels up to 18 inches in diameter, LED headlights, leather upholstery, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, a head-up display, navigation, an 8.8-inch screen, keyless entry, adjustable dampers, and automatic parking system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Mini Convertible. However, the Mini Hardtop, the car on which the convertible is based, was awarded the IIHS’ Top Safety Pick award after it received a Good score on all crash tests and a Marginal on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). It also received an Advanced rating on the front crash prevention test when it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the severity of a 25-mph one by 7 mph (Superior is the highest possible rating).</p>

<p>On cars with the Fully Loaded package, you can opt for the Active Driving Assistant option that bundles forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking, automatic high beams.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mini/cooper/2016/2016-mini-convertible-cooper-s-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a>, we noted that with the roof in place, the cabin stays quiet and that wind buffeting is well-controlled when it’s down. However, the roof doesn’t stow into the trunk, impeding on rear visibility when the top is down. Steering is twitchy like the Hardtop and torque steer is present when accelerating hard. Handling, on the other hand, is excellent with the car possessing excellent body control and generous grip. The infotainment controller, however, is finicky to use and is positioned too low and too far back.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Unlike most convertibles, the Mini Convertible’s roof can be retracted all the way down or just halfway, and function like a sunroof.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Outlander Sport is Mitsubishi’s entry-level crossover, positioned below the Eclipse Cross and three-row Outlander crossovers.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Outlander Sport comes standard with a 2.0-liter I-4 that produces 148 hp and 145 lb-ft of torque. When backed by the CVT and with front-wheel drive, the crossover delivers an EPA-rated 24/30 mpg city/highway and 23/29 mpg with all-wheel drive (AWD). The base five-speed manual is only available with front-wheel drive and comes with a rating of 23/29. The 168-hp, 167 lb-ft 2.4-liter I-4 can only be paired to the CVT and is rated at 23/28 with front-wheel drive and 22/27 with AWD. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2015 Outlander Sport 2.4 hit 60 mph in 8.6 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a very respectable 115 feet.</p>

<p>Standard features for the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/outlander/2018/">Mitsubishi Outlander</a> Sport include rear LED combination taillights, heated side-view mirrors, 18-inch wheels, a color LCD driver’s display, six-way manually adjustable driver’s seat, automatic climate control, leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, soft touch upper instrument panel and door trim, FUSE Hands-free link with USB port, and a 7.0-inch center touchscreen.

In IIHS testing, the crossover received the second highest score of Acceptable for the small overlap front test and the highest rating of Good for the remaining crash tests (moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and head restraints and seats). Standard safety features include hill start assist, active stability control, a rearview camera, and seven airbags. Forward Collision Mitigation, lane departure warning, and automatic high beam driver assist safety features are located in the new Touring package.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/mitsubishi-outlander-sport-24-gt-awc-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the Outlander Sport 2.4 GT, we said, “Other than the increase in power, the Outlander Sport GT is much the same as the Outlander Sport ES. It has modern exterior lighting and aggressive EVO-like face, and while the black interior initially feels upscale, it’s saddled with some hard plastics throughout. The seats are fairly comfortable but could use a lumbar adjustment. Although the upgraded audio system enriches the sound, particularly with lower frequencies due to the Rockford Fosgate subwoofer. … After all, the compact crossover has only had minor revisions since it went on sale for the 2011 model year.”</p>

<p>We did not like the slow acceleration of the standard 2.0-liter engine in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2015-mitsubishi-outlander-sport-20l-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2015 Outlander Sport 2.0 FWD. Even so, we appreciated the value of the crossover and said, “Despite the lackluster drivetrain, the $23,645 (including $850 destination) 2015 Outlander Sport offers lots of standard and available features.” We concluded our review by saying, “…the 2015 Outlander Sport combines an aggressive face with a tidy exterior that makes parking in urban areas a breeze. Inside, our tester’s black interior felt upscale, and the seats were mostly comfortable on the 9.5-hour drive, though a lumbar adjustment for the front seats would be welcome. The interior isn’t a bad place to be, and the available electronics are appreciated.”</p>

<p>The Outlander Sport is Mitsubishi’s best-selling model.</p>

The USB port has been relocated to the center console and the G4 sedan model now has a standard truck pass through. The Mirage received a mid-cycle refresh for the 2017 model year.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Mirage</strong> <strong>hatchback</strong> and <strong>Mirage G4 sedan</strong> is Mitsubishi’s most affordable and smallest model in the automaker’s lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The subcompact Mirage hatchback and Mirage G4 sedan are powered by a 1.2-liter I-3 engine that produces 78 hp and 74 lb-ft of torque that delivers an EPA-rated 33/41 mpg city/highway with the five-speed manual transmission (33/40 mpg for the G4) and 37/43 with the CVT (35/41 mpg for the G4). In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the pre-refresh <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/mirage/2014/">2014 Mitsubishi Mirage</a> (with a 74-hp version of the same engine) hit 60 mph in a slow 12 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a decent 127 feet.</p>

<p>The base Mirage ES model comes equipped with the previously mentioned 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth phone/audio streaming, a rearview camera, and steering wheels audio and Bluetooth controls. The ES also includes a rear spoiler, an Eco indicator light (on CVT models), and a USB port. The range-topping GT model comes equipped with 15-inch two-tone alloy wheels, HID headlights, heated front seats, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Other available features include a Rockford Fosgate premium audio system, an LED interior illumination package, and a Quick Value package that adds front and rear mudguards, scuff plates, black leather shift knob, cargo mat, cargo net, and an exhaust finisher.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/mirage/2018/">Mitsubishi Mirage</a> a four-star rating for the hatchback’s overall score (the G4 has yet to be tested by the NHTSA). In IIHS testing, the Mirage received the highest score of Good in all but one evaluation, scoring the second-lowest rating of Marginal in the small overlap front test. The G4 sedan model received the same ratings with the exception of the side crash test, scoring the second-highest rating of Acceptable. The Mitsubishi Mirage was not tested for front crash prevention because the Mirage does not offer any active driver assist safety features. The Mirage comes standard with seven airbags, stability control, and is available with front and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/mirage/2014/2014-mitsubishi-mirage-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the pre-refresh 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage, we did not like much about the car. The hatchback has lousy handling, a bumpy ride, very slow acceleration, has a lot of interior noise and vibration, and interior quality is very cheap as well. The best part of the car if the very low starting price and the good fuel economy, “Is that fuel economy, plus the Mirage’s slight pricing advantage, enough to justify the car over its better-driving competition? Not for me, but I can see how some cash-strapped car shoppers without any enthusiast leanings might see otherwise. Whether it beats rolling in an older, used vehicle is debatable, but the 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty makes it an attractive used car alternative.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Mirage and Mirage G4 come with a fully transferable 5-year/60,000 mile limited warranty and a 10-year/100,000 miles powertrain warranty.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Outlander is Mitsubishi’s three-row crossover, positioned above the entry-level Outlander Sport and the new Eclipse Cross crossover.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>With the exception of the range-topping GT model, the standard engine is a 2.4-liter I-4 engine that produces 166 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA-rated 25/30 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 24/29 mpg with all-wheel drive (AWD). The GT trim utilizes a 224-hp, 215 lb-ft 3.0-liter V-6 that is only available in AWD and is rated at 20/27 mpg. The 2.4-liter is backed by a CVT while the V-6 is paired to a six-speed automatic. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the Outlander 2.4 SEL (AWD) hit 60 mph in 9.2 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 119 feet.</p>

<p>The 2018 Outlander comes standard with a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, LED daytime running lights, heated side view mirrors, 18-inch wheels, seven-passenger seating, dual-zone climate control, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever. Many available features are bundled together in the SEL Touring package that includes a multi-view camera system, adaptive cruise control, Forward Collision Mitigation, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, LED headlights and fog lights, heated steering wheel, a 710-watt Rockford-Fosgate sound system, blind-spot warning with lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert, power glass moonroof, and a power remote liftgate.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/outlander/2018/">2018 Mitsubishi Outlander</a> received the highest five-star rating for the AWD model and four stars for the FWD version from the NHTSA for the crossover’s overall score. The Outlander is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ (the highest designation) from the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation. The Superior rating was issued because the Outlander was able to avoid 12 mph and 25 mph frontal collisions thanks to the Forward Collision Mitigation System found in the previously mentioned Touring package that adds all available driver assist safety features.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>After one year with our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/outlander/2016/2016-mitsubishi-outlander-sel-awd-review-verdict/">long-term 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SEL</a>, we enjoyed the fact that the crossover gave us no issues, and was cheap to maintain. We did wish for more power from the equipped 2.4-liter I-4, as it would struggle with more than two people in the crossover, but the fuel economy was good. We liked the driver assist safety features but felt they were a little too sensitive and not as refined as other competitive systems. The interior was conservative and simple, the front seats were comfortable, but the third-row seats are very small, not made for adults. The 63.3 cubic feet of cargo space was great for fitting many things, but the power liftgate was slow to open and close. At the end of our long-term verdict, we said, “Our Outlander had a good amount of content for its $33,095 sticker price. But again, not all of those features work as well as those offered by the competition. I think the Outlander makes a more compelling case as a stripped-down base model. A front-wheel-drive 2017 Outlander ES is a great value at its $24,390 starting price because it offers more room than a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2018/">Honda CR-V</a> and has a standard third row for less money.”</p>

<p>During our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mitsubishi/outlander/2016/2016-mitsubishi-outlander-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the refreshed 2016 Outlander, we felt the crossover was quieter than the previous model year but still not as quiet as we would have liked. The interior was an improvement, especially the more comfortable front seats and the easier-to-fold-down rear seats. Equipped with the I-4, the crossover felt more nimble than the V-6 but needed more power. “The well-equipped SEL front-drive model starts at $25,845, and the V-6 AWD is still a value at $31,845. Will all the improvements, plus the value, add up to more interest from U.S. buyers? They’d be wise to consider the new crossover for its value.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2.4-liter I-4 has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds, while the V-6 more than doubles that at 3,500 pounds.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/titan/2018/">2018 Nissan Titan</a> gets a new Midnight Edition model that comes with dark inserts on the grille, dark headlights, black fog light surrounds, black exterior badges, black side mirror covers, 20-inch black-finished alloy wheels, and black Midnight Edition badges. Only the SV and SL crew cab models can be had as a Midnight Edition variant.</p>

<p><strong>Trim Levels (Interior and Exterior Options)</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/titan/2018/">Nissan Titan</a> is a full-size truck that slots above the midsize Frontier and is available in three cab styles and in rear- or four-wheel drive. Five trims are available including a luxury-oriented Platinum Reserve and off-road-oriented Pro-4X. Above the Titan is the Titan XD, which offers an eight-cylinder diesel engine.</p>

<p><strong>Titan S: </strong>The base S trim comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, a 5.0-inch screen, a USB port, keyless entry and start, Bluetooth, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p><strong>Titan SV: </strong>Moving up to the SV trim adds chrome door handles, satellite radio, and a front overhead console.</p>

<p><strong>Titan Pro-4X: </strong>Off-road-minded Titan Pro-4X models come with a leather-wrapped steering wheel, all-terrain tires, LED low-beam headlights, fog lights, a spray-on bedliner, Bilstein shocks, additional skid plates, leather upholstery, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, an eight-way adjustable power driver’s seat, and navigation.</p>

<p><strong>Titan SL: </strong>Stepping up to the SL trim gets you 20-inch alloy wheels, a 12-speaker Rockford Fosgate audio system, heated front seats, a power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, a power adjustable front passenger seat, chrome side mirror covers, and fixed aluminum running boards.</p>

<p><strong>Titan Platinum Reserve: </strong>As the luxury-oriented trim, the Titan Platinum Reserve gets features like ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s Around View Monitor surround-view camera system, and open-pore wood interior trim.</p>

<p>Features such as navigation, the 7.0-inch touchscreen, the Rockford Fosgate audio system, and heated and ventilated front seats are available on lower trims as part of packages. However, only the Platinum Reserve can be had with the rear-seat entertainment system.</p>

<p>All Titans come with a five-year/100,000-mile basic warranty.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Nissan Titan is powered by a 5.6-liter V-8 with 390 hp and 394 lb-ft of torque that’s paired to a seven-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 15/21 mpg city/highway for rear- and four-wheel drive models. Pro-4X models are less efficient at 15/20 mpg.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Titan crew cab received a four-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). King Cab and Single Cab models were only tested in the rollover test by the NHTSA, where they received four stars.</p>

<p>In IIHS testing, the 2018 Titan received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the passenger side front small overlap test where it hasn’t been tested and the headlights test where it got a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score). The IIHS hasn’t given the 2018 Titan a rating on the front crash prevention test. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are available on the Titan SV and higher trims.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Titan can haul a maximum payload of 1,950 pounds. When properly equipped, it can tow up to 9,740 pounds. As with all full-size trucks, the towing and payload capacities depend on the cab style and drivetrain configuration.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>During our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/nissan-titan-2017-truck-of-the-year-contender/">2017 Truck of the Year evaluations</a>, we liked the Titan’s ride quality and accurate steering. However, the more you loaded the truck up and the higher up in altitude you went, the more it suffered, which meant it struggled up the Davis Dam tow climb.  Interior comfort also lags behind its rivals and the multimedia could be improved.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 5.6-liter V-8 in the 2018 Titan is also used on the Armada full-size SUV and the Titan XD.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/murano/2018/">2018 Nissan Murano</a> receives new standard features including an 8.0-inch touchscreen with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Connect Navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and satellite radio. Also standard on all trims is automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning driver assist systems. The new SV Premium package consists of a surround-view camera system, a driver alert system (sleepy driver alert), adaptive cruise control, a panoramic moonroof, an 11-speaker Bose premium audio system, heated front seats, heated outside mirrors, and 18-inch Gun Metal alloy wheels. The Murano also received a revised center console design, a Midnight Edition package for the SL trim, and a new SL Moonroof package. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert are now standard on the SV trim (one above the base trim).</p>

<p>In Nissan’s SUV and crossover lineup, the Murano is positioned above the Juke, the new Kicks, the Rogue Sport, and the Rogue, but below the larger and more expensive Pathfinder and full-size Armada.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Murano S</strong>: The base trim comes well-equipped with an 8.0-inch touchscreen with NissanConnect Navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and satellite radio. Also standard is emergency automatic braking, forward collision warning, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, automatic headlights, a 7.0-inch driver’s instrument cluster display, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, as well as front and rear USB ports.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Murano SV</strong>: The SV trim adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, remote engine start with climate control, a 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat, four-way power passenger’s seat, fog lights, black roof rails, auto-dimming rearview mirror, blind-spot monitoring, and rear-cross traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Murano SL</strong>: Building off the SV’s features, the SL adds heated leather seats (front and rear), a surround view camera system, a Bose premium audio system, a motion-activated liftgate, interior ambient lighting, silver roof rails, adaptive cruise control, and a heated steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Murano Platinum</strong>: The top Platinum trim adds 20-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, heated and cooled front seats, NissanConnect Services, a power panoramic moonroof, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and power return rear seatbacks.</p>

<p>A Wi-Fi hotspot, wireless smartphone charger, and a frameless auto-dimming rearview mirror with Universal Remote are also available.</p>

<p>The 2018 Murano is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 260 hp and 240 lb-ft and is backed by a CVT that routes power to the front wheels or to the optional all-wheel-drive system. The Murano delivers an EPA-rated 21/28 mpg city/highway in both front- and all-wheel drive systems. The 2015 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/murano/2018/">Nissan Murano</a> Platinum FWD (with the same engine as the 2018 model) hit 60 mph on 7.0 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 120 feet in <em>Motor Trend</em> testing.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2017 Nissan Murano its highest five-star overall rating for the AWD model and a four-star overall rating for the FWD model. The 2018 Murano received the highest rating of Good for five crash tests the IIHS conducted and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention because the crossover avoided a 12 mph frontal collision and reduced speed in a 25 mph collision by 11 mph thanks to the standard emergency automatic braking and forward collision warning systems. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert are standard on the SV trim and the SL trim gets adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>The Murano’s cargo space with the rear seats up measures in at 32.1 cubic feet, and 67.0 cubic feet with the seats down. That is less than the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/edge/2018/">Ford Edge</a>’s 39.2 and 73.4 cubic feet, respectively, but the Murano offers a flatter load floor. The Murano’s front seats offer 40.5 inches of legroom and 38.7 inches for the rear seats. The Edge offers more with 42.6 inches for the front and 40.6 for the rear. However, in a comparison that included a Murano, Edge, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe/2018/">Hyundai Santa Fe</a> Sport, we noted that the Murano had more legroom than the other cars: “The specs allege the Nissan to have the least rear legroom here … but our collective perspective says otherwise. Potential customers’ best course of action is checking everything in person.”</p>

<p>The Murano‘s 8.0-inch touchscreen with NissanConnect Navigation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard on all trims. satellite radio, Bluetooth, and two USB ports are also standard. A 7.0-inch driver’s instrument cluster display is standard but the optional Bose premium audio system is not. The optional NissanConnect Services powered by SiriusXM includes automatic collision notification, emergency call service, and stolen vehicle locator. With the remote services app, owners can start/stop the engine, lock/unlock the doors, flash the lights, honk the horn, and set curfew and speed alerts.</p>

<p>After one year with our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/murano/2015/2015-nissan-murano-sl-awd-review-verdict/">long-term 2015 Nissan Murano SL</a>, we concluded by saying, “The Murano passes my personal test, as well—and does so with a luxurious, quiet, comfortable interior. The exterior styling is bold, polarizing, and conversation-starting. It drives well and is reliable. And although it never hooked me emotionally, I would have no qualms about recommending one to friends and family. Except in orange.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/murano/2015/2015-ford-edge-nissan-murano-hyundai-santa-fe-sport-comparison/">three-way crossover comparison</a> with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> Edge and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe-sport/2018/">Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</a>, the Murano came in first place. We said, “Vehicles able to smartly mix work and play are always welcome in our schedule book. The Nissan will contentedly float along on the freeway, and then, as it’s done since model year 2003, surprise with a one-two punch of a normal-feeling continuously variable automatic and astonishingly engaging handling.”</p>

<p>But visibility is not that good: “The Murano’s visibility was indeed sacrificed to the style deities when it came to the thick A- and kookily-drawn C- and D-pillars.” However, we preferred the quiet, luxurious, and stylish cabin of the Murano over the other two crossovers. “The navigation system was one of the best I have ever worked with, thanks to the large, responsive touchscreen and crisp graphics. The seats were very comfortable.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/armada/2018/">2018 Nissan Armada</a> gets a rearview mirror with an LCD camera as standard (if rear visibility is blocked by cargo or passengers, a digital screen fills the rearview mirror’s display to show what’s behind the vehicle).</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the three-row Pathfinder, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/armada/2018/">Nissan Armada</a> is the brand’s flagship SUV and is closely related to the global-market Patrol and the outgoing <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/qx80/2018/">Infiniti QX80</a>. Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional. The Armada can seat up to eight passengers in its standard configuration or seven with the optional second-row captain’s chairs.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>All 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Armadas are powered by a 5.6-liter V-8 with 390 hp and 394 lb-ft of torque paired to a seven-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 14/19 mpg city/highway for rear-drive models and 13/18 mpg with four-wheel drive. When properly equipped, the Armada can tow up to 8,500 pounds. The Armada has 16.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, 49.9 cubic feet behind the second row, and 95.4 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base SV trim include the NissanConnect infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, keyless entry/start, dual-zone climate control, remote start, Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera, eight-way power adjustable heated front seats with driver memory, cloth upholstery, 60/40 split-folding second and third rows, a 13-speaker Bose premium audio system, USB ports, LED low-beam headlights, parking sensors, and 18-inch alloy wheels. Higher trim levels add leather upholstery, heated second-row seats, ventilated front seats, 20-inch alloy wheels, a heated steering wheel, second-row captain’s chairs, a power liftgate, an entertainment system, and Nissan’s Around View Monitor multi-camera visibility system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Nissan Armada hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. Active safety features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot warning, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, rear automatic emergency braking, and Moving Object Detection are available on the SL trim as part of the Technology package and standard on the range-topping Platinum grade.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think<br/></strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/armada/2017/2017-nissan-armada-platinum-first-test-review/">2017 First Test review</a>, we said that the V-8 provides prodigious power and doesn’t feel tasked with hauling the Armada around even with the optional four-wheel-drive system. The seven-speed automatic has good logic and quick shifts, and at higher speeds, keeps revs under 2,000 rpm. Even with the optional 20-inch alloy wheels, the Armada rides well but its handling is sloppy due to excessive body roll and numb steering. The interior is nearly similar to the one found in the more expensive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> QX80, meaning it’s built well with high quality materials all around. However, the third row seats are cramped.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Automatic emergency braking, a rearview camera, and 5.0-inch center display with Bluetooth streaming audio and Siri Eyes-Free is now standard on all models (except NISMO models). The SV model receives dual zone automatic climate control and 16-inch aluminum alloy wheels. Adaptive cruise control is now standard on the SR 1.8L and SL models. The SL Premium Tech package equipment is now standard on the SL and includes a moonroof, a Bose premium audio system, and NissanConnect Services.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The compact Sentra sedan slots above the enter-level Versa sedan but below the larger and more expensive Altima and Maxima. The Sentra starts significantly less than <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s smallest crossovers, the Juke and Rogue Sport.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/sentra/2018/">2018 Nissan Sentra</a> comes equipped with a standard 1.8-liter I-4 engine that produces 124 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque and has an EPA-rating of 29/37 mpg city/highway with the CVT and 27/35 with the six-speed manual transmission. Both Sentra SR Turbo and NISMO variants use a 188-hp 1.6-liter turbocharged I-4 with 177 lb-ft of torque that delivers 27/33 mpg (25/30 mpg for the NISMO) with the CVT and 26/32 mpg (25/31 mpg for the NISMO) with the six-speed manual transmission. All powertrains send power to the front wheels of the compact sedan. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/sentra/2018/">Nissan Sentra</a> NISMO equipped with the six-speed manual hit 60 mph in 7.3 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a respectable 112 feet. The 2016 Nissan Sentra SL with the CVT hit 60 mph in 10.0 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 128 feet.</p>

<p>The Sentra’s base S model comes standard with a 5.0-inch center display with Bluetooth streaming audio and Siri Eyes Free, three drive modes (Eco, Sport, Normal), automatic headlights, a USB port, and cruise control.</p>

<p>The luxurious SL model comes equipped leather-appointed seats, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, auto-dimming rearview mirror, six-way power driver’s seat, a 5.8-inch touchscreen with NissanConnect with Navigation, a 5.0-inch driver’s display, leather-wrapped steering wheel, LED headlights with accents, fog lights, and 17-inch aluminum wheels, power moonroof, Bose audio system, adaptive cruise control, and Forward Emergency Braking.</p>

<p>The bolder NISMO Sentra is equipped with NISMO-tuned suspension and steering, NISMO sport front seats, NISMO Alcantara and leather-wrapped steering wheel, NISMO leather-wrapped shift knob, NISMO tachometer, 18-inch NISMO wheels, a NISMO aerodynamic body kit, and NISMO black outside mirrors.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA issued the 2017 Nissan Sentra a four-star overall crash safety rating out of possible five stars. However, the Nissan Sentra is considered a 2017 IIHS Top Safety Pick for receiving the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests (though the Sentra has yet to be rated in the new passenger side small overlap test) and for receiving the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation by properly warning the driver of a possible collision, avoiding a collision in a 12-mph test, and for reducing the speed of a 25-mph collision by 10 mph thanks to the now-standard automatic emergency braking driver assist safety feature. Other available driver assist features include blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/sentra/2017/2017-nissan-sentra-nismo-first-test-review/">2017 First Test review</a> of the 2017 Nissan Sentra NISMO, we concluded, “Our test vehicle with the six-speed manual checked in at $27,370, putting it in the same price range as the Civic hatchback, Jetta GLI, and Mazda3 2.5, but from the 2017 Nissan Sentra NISMO’s stiff ride and suspension to its lackluster handling and laggy powertrain, it feels incomplete. Additionally, the interior’s age is amplified by an infotainment system that’s well behind the units found in competitors such as the Civic and in more mainstream compacts such as the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/">Chevrolet Cruze</a>. The 2017 Sentra NISMO could use more power and should handle better, but as it stands, we’re not sure the car is worthy of a NISMO badge considering its performance didn’t improve much over its predecessors from 10 years ago.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2016/2016-2017-big-test-compact-sedans/">seven-way compact sedan Big Test comparison</a>, the 2016 Nissan Sentra SL came in last place, we said, “The seventh-place finisher, the 2016 Nissan Sentra SL, suffered with the least powerful and least efficient engine, dreadful steering and seating, the highest forecasted cost of ownership, and the worst published IIHS crash scores despite being loaded with the most features.”</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> adds Automatic Emergency Braking and adaptive cruise control as standard for the new model year. Additionally, the top 3.5 SL model receives adaptive cruise control and NissanConnect with navigation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The base 2.5 and 3.5 SR models have been removed from the lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>Nissan’s midsize sedan is positioned above the Versa models and the compact Sentra but below the larger and more expensive Maxima. If considering a crossover, the Altima starts slightly more than the compact Rogue Sport but less than the traditional Rogue.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/altima/2018/">2018 Nissan Altima</a>’s base engine is a 179-hp, 177-lb-ft of torque 2.5-liter I-4 that delivers an impressive, EPA-rated 27/38 mpg city/highway (or 26/37 as a 2.5 SR model). The available 3.5-liter V-6 produces 270 hp and 251 lb-ft of torque and comes with a fuel economy rating of 22/32 mpg. Both engines are backed by a CVT that routes power to the front wheels. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Altima 2.5 SV hit 60 mph in 7.8 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 121 feet.</p>

<p>The base 2.5 S model comes standard with 16-inch wheels, a 5.0-inch center display, Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, a 4.0-inch driver display, and a USB port. The top 3.5 SL model features 18-inch wheels, NissanConnect with navigation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 7.0-inch center touchscreen, leather appointed seats, eight-way power heated front driver’s seat, heated steering wheel, power moonroof, rear air conditioning vents, remote engine start, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/altima/2018/">Nissan Altima</a> received the highest five-star rating from the NHTSA for the sedan’s overall rating and the 2017 model is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all crash five tests and for the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention for properly warning the driver of a possible collision, avoiding a 12 mph collision, and reducing the impact of a 25 mph collision by 10 mph. This is thanks to the now standard and previously mentioned Automatic Emergency Braking and Intelligent Forward Collision Warning systems. Rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot warning are standard and the 2.5 SV model and above and the adaptive cruise control feature is standard on the 3.5 SL model.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/altima/2016/2016-nissan-altima-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the refreshed 2016 Nissan Altima, we liked the new SR sports model and the improved fuel efficiency of the 2.5-liter engine but felt the paddle shifters were gimmicky and denied many shifts. We enjoyed the new sound deadening and said, “Back-to-back runs in mainstream 2015 and 2016 models reveal that the new car sounds a full price class quieter than its predecessor. We’re talking near deep-space quiet to match the NASA zero-gravity seats.” The Altima also drove better, “Grip and body-motion control on the SR seem a noticeable step ahead of most of its ‘sport’ competitors. Lean hard enough into a turn to find the understeer limit then lift, and the nose tucks in exactly as a proper performance car’s nose should.”</p>

<p>We concluded by saying, “To these eyes the 2016 Altima looks better (I’d deem it the best Energetic Flow design because the budget didn’t allow for overstyling the body sides and C-pillars), it handles better, and it feels more refined. It even delivers better efficiency.”</p>

<p>“Were <em>Motor Trend</em> to ever organize a WGMSDR (World’s Greatest Midsize Sedan Drag Race), the 2017 Altima would be fighting for the lead. We clocked a 0–60 time on our moderately equipped tester of just 7.8 seconds, which may not sound all that great before you remember this is the base engine,” we said during a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/altima/2017/2017-nissan-altima-25-sv-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Nissan Altima 2.5 SV. That feat is hard to accomplish while also having great fuel economy, “Although your mileage may vary depending on how often you take advantage of the Altima’s relative quickness, [the car’s EPA ratings] put it near the top of the class.” The CVT has been tuned to respond faster and not drone as much as previous models did.</p>

<p>We wished the 7.0-inch center screen was larger and placed higher in the dashboard. Even so, “the 2017 Nissan Altima gets most of the basics right. The car is as spacious as you’d expect, and it’s quicker than other midsizers from <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/">Hyundai</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> [this review was written before the 2018 Camry, which hits 60 mph just slightly quicker, arrived]. The updated front styling isn’t for everyone (I’m not a fan), but if the low-mounted 7.0-inch touchscreen doesn’t bother you and CVTs don’t scare you, add the 2017 Altima to your list.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The good fuel economy can be partly attributed to the Altima’s impressive drag coefficient of 0.26, better than the Leaf’s 0.28.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue/2018/">2018 Nissan Rogue</a> Sport carries over unchanged save for a new Technology package for the SV trim, which replaces the Premium package. Features originally found on the SL’s Platinum package have been integrated to the Premium package.</p>

<p><strong>Trim Levels (Interior and Exterior Options)</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue/2018/">Nissan Rogue</a> Sport is a subcompact crossover that slots below the larger Rogue and above the upcoming Kicks. It’s available in three trims with front-wheel drive as standard and all-wheel drive as an option.</p>

<p><strong>Rogue Sport S: </strong>The base S trim comes standard with 16-inch steel wheels with covers, a four-speaker audio system, a 5.0-inch screen, Bluetooth, a USB port, a rearview camera, cloth upholstery, and keyless entry.</p>

<p><strong>Rogue Sport SV: </strong>Move up to the SV trim and that adds 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, a six-speaker audio system, dual-zone climate control, keyless start, an eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s Divide-N-Hide cargo divider system.</p>

<p><strong>Rogue Sport SL: </strong>Range-topping SL grades get leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, remote start, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, heated front seats, Siri Eyes Free, Nissan’s Around View Monitor surround-view multi-camera system, a heated steering wheel, and fog lights.</p>

<p>Features like the heated front seats, navigation, remote, start, the Around View Monitor, the 7.0-inch touchscreen, and the heated steering wheel are available as part of optional packages in the SV grade. The SL trim is available with the Premium package, which adds LED headlights, a moonroof and a full suite of active driver assistance features.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Rogue Sport is powered exclusively by a 2.0-liter I-4 rated at 141 hp and 147 lb-ft of torque paired exclusively to a CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings are 25/32 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 24/30 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Rogue Sport received a Basic rating for having an available forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>Active driver assistance features are available only on the SV and SL grades. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are available on both SV and SL trims but lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, and high beam assist are only available on the SL model as part of the Premium package.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>

<p>With the split-folding rear seats in place, the 2018 Rogue Sport has 22.9 cubic feet of cargo space (20 cubic feet on the SV and 19.9 cubic feet on the SL). Fold the rear seats down and cargo space expands to 61.1 cubic feet in the S trim or 53.3 cubic feet on the SV and SL grades.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue-sport/2017/2017-nissan-rogue-sport-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that thanks to its size, the Rogue Sport is easy to maneuver and rides comfortably. The multimedia system, however, lacks Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Sportiness isn’t what the Rogue Sport excels at because although its got secure handling, the steering is numb and uncommunicative.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/no-mans-land/">2017 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/compass/2018/">Jeep Compass</a> and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue-sport/2018/">Nissan Rogue Sport</a> placed third because of its dated infotainment system, tight back seats, and slow acceleration. Ride quality, on the other hand, is smooth as the suspension does a good job of absorbing bumps. Off the pavement, our all-wheel-drive Rogue Sport tester easily got stuck in the sand and its lack of power kept it from freeing itself.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In other markets, the 2018 Rogue Sport is known as the Qashqai.</p>

The new Heritage Edition, which is available on the base model, features a Chicane Yellow or Magnetic Black exterior paint. Yellow cars feature black mirror caps and exterior graphics, while black cars feature silver exterior graphics. Both cars have yellow interior trim.</p>

<p>Although it’s now in its 10th model year, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> updated all 370Z models with revised headlights and taillights, smoked chrome door handles, rear fascia, and a new EXEDY clutch for manual-equipped cars.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The rear-drive two-seat <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/370z/2018/">2018 Nissan 370Z</a> coupe and roadster are the automaker’s entry-level sports cars that slot below the four-seat all-wheel-drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/gt-r/2018/">2018 Nissan GT-R</a> supercar.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Power for all 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/370z/2018/">Nissan 370Z</a> models come from a naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V-6 mated to a six-speed manual with Downshift Rev Matching or a seven-speed automatic transmission. Most models make 332 hp at 7,000 rpm and 270 lb-ft of torque at 5,200 rpm, while the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/gt250r/2015/2015-nissan-370z-nismo-first-look/">370Z NISMO coupe</a> makes 350 hp at 7,400 rpm and 276 lb-ft at 5,200 rpm. Base and Touring models feature an open rear differential, while Sport, Sport Tech, NISMO, and NISMO Tech models feature a viscous limited-slip differential (VLSD).</p>

<p>Inside, the base audio system features and AM/FM/CD with four speaker, while a 240-watt, eight-speaker Bose audio system is available. Tech models feature a hard-drive navigation system with 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, USB input, and DVD player.</p>

<p>Eight-way manual driver’s and four-way passenger manual cloth are standard, while eight-way (four-way power, four-way manual, and adjustable lumbar) driver’s and four-way power passenger leather and synthetic suede seats are optional.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p><a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/370z/2011/2011-nissan-370z-touring-test/">In testing, a 2011 Nissan 370Z Touring</a> reached 60 mph in 4.9 seconds and finished the quarter-mile in 13.4 seconds at 105.4 mph. A set of massive Akebono brakes stopped the Z in 102 feet while a set of 19-inch Rays Engineering forged alloy wheels wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza RE050A rubber helped our tester pull 1.01 g lateral average on the skidpad.</p>

<p>Despite its additional power, <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/370z/2015/2015-nissan-370z-nismo-first-test/">our 2015 Nissan 370Z Nismo tester</a> was slightly slower than our 2011 tester (4.9 seconds, 13.5 seconds at 105.4 mph), and took longer to stop (114 feet). We concluded: “Although our time behind the wheel of the 2015 Nissan 370Z NISMO was enjoyable, there were some definite shortcomings. For the $46K price tag, we would have liked more creature comforts, such as power seats and more upscale materials. But as it sits, the new 370Z NISMO is a track car for the streets… In the end, the 2015 Nissan 370Z is one of those cars that is fun to drive but hard to justify buying.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Nissan 370Z was one of the first cars with a rev-matching manual transmission.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Pathfinders gets automatic emergency braking standard on all trim levels and gets a new rear door alert system that reminds you to check the rear seats if something was left behind. SL models can now be had with the Midnight Edition package, which adds 20-inch black alloy wheels, black side mirror covers, and a black roof spoiler.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/pathfinder/2018/">2018 Nissan Pathfinder</a> is a three-row crossover slotting above the compact Rogue and two-row Murano but below the larger, full-size Armada. Unlike some previous generations of the Pathfinder, the current-generation model comes standard with front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive is an option. When it was first introduced for the 2013 model year, the current Pathfinder was also available as a hybrid; however, that model was short-lived as it was discontinued after only being in the market for a single model year.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/pathfinder/2018/">Nissan Pathfinder</a> is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 with 284 hp and 259 lb-ft of torque that’s paired exclusively to a CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings stand at 20/27 mpg city/highway for front-drive models and 19/26 mpg with all-wheel drive. Cargo space is 16 cubic feet with all seats in place, 42.4 to 47.8 cubic feet behind the second row depending on the position of the sliding second row, and 79.8 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include an 8.0-inch touchscreen, a multi-information display, a rearview camera, tri-zone climate control, keyless entry/start, 18-inch alloy wheels, and Bluetooth connectivity. Higher trims get alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, parking sensors, remote start, heated and ventilated front seats, leather upholstery, Nissan’s Around View Monitor, a heated steering wheel, a power liftgate, a Bose premium audio system, LED headlights, and a panoramic sunroof.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The IIHS and NHTSA haven’t tested the 2018 Pathfinder but the 2017 model received a five-star overall score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2017 model received the Top Safety Pick award after it earned a Good score on all crash tests (Good is the highest possible score). It missed the highest rating, Top Safety Pick+, due to the headlight rating of Marginal (instead of Acceptable or Good). On the front crash prevention test, a 2017 Pathfinder received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the impact of 25-mph crash by 14 mph. Automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning are now standard on all 2018 Pathfinders while other active safety tech like blind spot spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, Moving Object Detection, and adaptive cruise control are available only on higher trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Although the additional power didn’t make the Pathfinder quicker, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/pathfinder/2017/2017-nissan-pathfinder-sv-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> that the crossover didn’t feel underpowered. The crossover is easier to drive in urban areas because its car-based underpinnings make it easier to maneuver. Inside, the Pathfinder has plenty of space in all three rows and can easily accommodate adult passengers. However, the material quality in the lower S and SV trims are subpar due to excessive amounts of hard plastics and a hard dash. The Pathfinder’s 7.0 inches of ground clearance also means it isn’t as capable off-road as its predecessor.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The current generation Nissan Pathfinder switched rides on a unibody platform shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/altima/2018/">Nissan Altima</a>, Maxima, and Murano.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa/2018/">2018 Nissan Versa</a> gets a new exterior color called Deep Blue Pearl. The SL trim has been discontinued, making the SV the new range-topping model.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa/2018/">Nissan Versa</a> is a front-drive subcompact sedan that slots below the larger Sentra and is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s entry-level vehicle. A hatchback variant called the Versa Note is also available.</p>

<p><strong>Versa S</strong>: The base Versa S comes with 15-inch steel wheels with covers, cloth upholstery, Bluetooth connectivity, and a four-speaker stereo system.</p>

<p><strong>Versa S Plus</strong>: Building on the base S trim, the S Plus adds cruise control, chrome exterior door handles, a rear spoiler and air deflectors.</p>

<p><strong>Versa SV</strong>: On the range-topping SV trim, additional standard features include an upgraded instrument cluster, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, a USB port, and keyless entry.</p>

<p>Notable options include the SV Special Edition package, which adds fog lights, 15-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, fog lights, a 5.0-inch screen for the infotainment system, a Special Edition badge, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p>The 2018 Nissan Versa is powered by a 1.6-liter I-4 rated at 109 hp and 107 lb-ft of torque. It can be paired to either a five-speed manual transmission or a CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings are 27/36 mpg city/highway for the manual or 31/39 mpg with the CVT.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Versa a four-star rating on the front crash and rollover tests (out of a possible five stars). The 2018 Versa hasn’t been crash tested by the IIHS but the 2017 model received a Good score on the three categories it has been tested in, side impact, roof strength and head restraints and seats (Good is the highest possible score). There are no active safety and driver assistance features on the 2018 Nissan Versa.</p>

<p>For a subcompact sedan, the 2018 Nissan Versa has a massive trunk at 14.9 cubic feet and on the SV trim, it can be expanded with the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa/2012/2012-nissan-versa-sedan-first-drive/">2012 First Drive</a>, we said that the despite its small exterior footprint, the Nissan Versa has a spacious cabin for front- and rear-seat passengers. Ride comfort is good for a small car but it’s slow to accelerate. Interior materials quality is cheap with extensive amounts of hard plastics throughout the interior. We also noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa/2012/2012-nissan-versa-sl-test/">2012 First Test</a> that on the highway, the Versa doesn’t feel comfortable and the steering feels overboosted and doesn’t firm up enough. Also, the powertrain doesn’t respond to the driver’s inputs very well.</p>

<p>In global markets, the Nissan Versa is also known as the Latio, Sunny, and Almera.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/titan/2018/">2018 Nissan Titan</a> XD gets a new Midnight Edition model that comes with black grille inserts, dark headlights, black fog light surrounds, black side mirror covers, black door handles, 20-inch black alloy wheels, black badges, and black Midnight Edition badges. This particular model is only available on the crew cab SV and SL trims with the optional diesel engine.</p>

<p><strong>Trim Levels (Interior and Exterior Options)</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/titan/2018/">Nissan Titan</a> XD is a heavy duty truck that slots above the standard, full-size Titan. The truck is available in three cab styles and in rear- or four-wheel drive configurations. There are five trims available including an off-road-minded Pro-4X trim and a luxury-oriented grade called the Platinum Reserve.</p>

<p><strong>Titan XD S: </strong>The base S trim gets cloth upholstery, a 5.0-inch screen, a four-speaker audio system, a USB port, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, keyless entry and start, and 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Titan XD SV: </strong>Moving up to the SV trim adds front tow hooks, a six-speaker audio system, Siri Eyes Free, and a front overhead console.</p>

<p><strong>Titan XD Pro-4X:</strong> The off-road-oriented Titan XD Pro-4X adds 18-inch alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bilstein shocks, a spray-in bedliner, skid plates, a receiver hitch, leather upholstery, eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat,  LED headlights, fog lights, chrome door handles, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, and navigation.</p>

<p><strong>Titan XD SL: </strong>SL models are more premium-oriented and comes with 20-inch alloy wheels, fixed running boards, a 12-speaker Rockford Fosgate audio system, a power-adjustable steering column, remote start, as well as front and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Titan XD Platinum Reserve: </strong>Sitting at the top of the Titan XD range is the Platinum Reserve model that adds <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s Around View Monitor surround-view multi-camera system, heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, and open-pore wood trim.</p>

<p>The Platinum Reserve is the only model available with the rear entertainment system option.</p>

<p>The Titan XD comes standard with a five-year/100,000-mile basic warranty.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/titan-xd/2018/">2018 Nissan Titan XD</a> comes standard with a 5.6-liter V-8 rated at 390 hp and 394 lb-ft of torque paired to a seven-speed automatic transmission. A 5.0-liter turbodiesel V-8 with 310 hp and 555 lb-ft is optional and comes paired to a six-speed automatic. Heavy duty trucks including the Titan XD, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-250/2018/">Ford F-250</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/2500/2018/">Ram 2500</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> Silverado 2500 aren’t rated by the EPA.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/titan-xd/2018/">Nissan Titan XD</a> hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is available on the SV and higher grades. No other active driver assistance features are offered.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>

<p>When properly equipped, the single cab variant can tow up to 12,760 pounds depending on the engine, cab style and the drivetrain. Maximum payload capacity on the 2018 Titan XD is 2,710 pounds depending on the cab style, engine, and drivetrain configuration.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/titan-xd/2016/2016-nissan-titan-xd-v-8-platinum-reserve-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said that the Titan XD didn’t perform as well as expected on the incline test at Davis Dam due to its weight and powertrain calibration, which caused it to hold gears at redline and not shift to the next one. During standard acceleration tests, the Titan XD with the 5.6-liter V-8 is noticeably slower than the standard Titan due to its weight. Seat comfort was also not the Titan XD’s forte because the front seats lack support and the rear seats felt like slabs. Its infotainment system looked dated and the resolution is grainy. Ride quality, on the other hand, is good but its interior gets very noisy and the steering wheel transmits an excessive amount of vibration to the driver’s hands.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The optional diesel engine on the 2018 Titan XD is build by Cummins in Columbus, Indiana.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/gt-r/2018/">2018 Nissan GT-R</a> gets a new base trim level called the Pure, slotting below the Premium grade.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/gt-r/2018/">Nissan GT-R</a> is the automaker’s flagship supercar and it comes standard with all-wheel drive. Four trims are available in the 2018 GT-R.</p>

<p><strong>GT-R Pure:</strong> Standard features on the base Pure trim includes 20-inch Rays forged alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, a six-speaker audio system, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, Apple CarPlay integration, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, keyless entry/start, dual-zone climate control, leather and synthetic suede upholstery, full LED headlights and heated front seats.</p>

<p><strong>GT-R Premium: </strong>The Premium trim adds an 11-speaker Bose audio system with active noise cancellation, an active sound enhancer, and a titanium exhaust system.</p>

<p><strong>GT-R Track Edition: </strong>Slotting between the GT-R Premium and the GT-R NISMO, the Track Edition gets additional adhesive bonding for improved body rigidity, a NISMO-tuned suspension that’s lighter and stiffer, 20-inch NISMO forged alloy wheels, NISMO-specific tires, Recaro front bucket seats and a carbon fiber rear spoiler.</p>

<p><strong>GT-R NISMO: </strong>In addition to the added power, the GT-R NISMO gets the same body and suspension modifications as the Track Edition but adds a NISMO-specific aero kit, a different carbon fiber rear spoiler, and an Alcantara-trimmed steering wheel.</p>

<p>Notable options include all-season tires and a Premium Interior package with hand-stitched semi-aniline leather upholstery.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> GT-R is powered by a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6 paired to a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. On the Pure, Premium and Track Edition, it’s rated at 565 hp and 467 lb-ft of torque while the NISMO is rated at 600 hp and 481 lb-ft. EPA fuel economy estimates are 16/22 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 GT-R. There are no active safety features available on the 2018 GT-R.</p>

<p>Trunk space in the 2018 GT-R is 8.8 cubic feet and can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/gt-r/2017/2017-nissan-gt-r-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that the GT-R’s power delivery is immediate and more linear than older versions. The improved steering also requires less corrections when driven hard, making the GT-R easier to drive fast. However, the dual-clutch transmission isn’t very quick to respond to downshifts with some lag occurring before it actually switches cogs. Seat comfort has improved without sacrificing their ability to hold you in place during enthusiastic driving. The updated multimedia system is easier to use but it’s slow to respond to your inputs whether it’s using the controller knob or the touchscreen. Interior noise has also been lessened thanks to additional sound insulation.</p>

<p>The GT-R placed second in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/nsx/2017/2017-acura-nsx-vs-nissan-gt-r/">2016 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/nsx/2018/">Acura NSX</a> because of its excessive understeer during enthusiastic driving and the transmission, which sometimes responded quickly but other times reacted too slowly.</p>

<p>The 2018 GT-R’s available titanium exhaust system first appeared for the 2015 model year on the GT-R NISMO.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>For the 2018 model year, the Rogue crossover adds ProPilot Assist as an available option and NissanConnectSM featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard. A motion-activated liftgate is now standard on the SV model and adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure assist, and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection are now standard on the SL model. The Midnight Edition package has been revised with a new black front and rear fascia accents, black rear license plate finisher, black V-motion grille, and black emblems. Scarlet Ember and Midnight are new exterior colors.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The compact Rogue is positioned above the smaller Juke and Rogue Sport but below the larger and more expensive Murano, Pathfinder, and Armada. The Rogue hybrid is currently <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s only hybrid vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue/2018/">2018 Nissan Rogue</a> is powered by a 170-hp 2.5-liter I-4 with 175-lb-ft of torque. The engine gets an EPA-rated fuel economy of 26/33 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 25/32 mpg with all-wheel drive. The <strong>Rogue Hybrid</strong> utilizes a 141-hp, 144-lb-ft 2.0-liter I-4 engine paired to a 40-hp, 118-lb-ft electric motor and delivers 33/35 mpg with front-wheel drive and 31/34 with all-wheel drive. All engines are back by a CVT.</p>

<p>Above the base Rogue S is the Rogue SV, which comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, privacy glass, push-button ignition, eight-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support, roof rails, automatic headlights, heated front seats, remote engine start, and a motion-activated liftgate. The SL model receives leather front seats, a Bose audio system, NissanConnect with navigation, a 7.0-inch touchscreen display, a surround-view camera system, 18-inch wheels, heated steering wheel, and automatic high beams. The Rogue Hybrid adds a standard automatic engine start/stop and an energy flow guide. The Platinum Reserve Interior package includes premium tan leather-appointed seats with special quilted leather inserts. A panoramic moonroof and LED headlights are part of the Premium package.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue/2018/">Nissan Rogue</a> received a four-star overall safety rating out of five stars from the NHTSA. However, the crossover is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick from the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in five crash tests, the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the headlights evaluation, and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention by properly warning the driver of a possible collision, avoiding a 12 mph collision, and reducing the speed of a 25 mpg collision by 23 mph thanks to the automatic emergency braking system with pedestrian detection that’s standard on the SL model. Other driver assist safety features include the standard blind-spot monitoring and rear-cross traffic alert systems, as well as lane departure warning, lane keep assist, and adaptive cruise control. The new ProPilot Assist driver assist feature is located in the SL Platinum package and provides assisted steering, braking, and accelerating during highway driving.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue/2017/2017-nissan-rogue-hybrid-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Nissan Rogue Hybrid, we liked how the premium for the hybrid was only about $1,000 and costs less than the RAV4 hybrid. However, we did not care for the hybrid’s sluggish acceleration and somewhat rough transition from electric to hybrid power. Additionally, the Real MPG and EPA fuel economy figures are lower than those of the RAV4 Hybrid, but higher than the traditional Rogue. The brakes have an unnatural feel and the steering is very slow. The front seats are comfortable but rear visibility is not good (as with most modern crossovers).</p>

<p>“In a way, the front- and all-wheel-drive Nissan Rogue Hybrid is a value,” we wrote in the review. “The hybrid is offered at about $1,000 more than the same trim in nonhybrid form, an impressively low premium. Even so, it’s tough to recommend the Nissan because its prime competition is quicker, more efficient in our testing, drives better, and has more cargo space.

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa/2018/">2018 Nissan Versa</a> Note lineup gets cut down to three trim levels with the discontinuation  of the SL grade, making the SR the new range-topping model.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa/2018/">Nissan Versa</a> Note is a subcompact hatchback that slots below the compact Sentra. It is closely related to the Versa sedan but features more flexibility and more cargo space.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa-note/2018/">2018 Nissan Versa Note</a> is powered by a 1.6-liter I-4 rated at 109 hp and 107 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired exclusively to a CVT (a manual is available on the Versa sedan). EPA fuel economy ratings are excellent at 31/39 mpg city/highway, making it one of the more efficient subcompact cars available. Cargo capacity is 18.8 cubic feet with the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats up and 38.3 cubic feet with them folded. In addition to the folding rear seats, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa-note/2018/">Nissan Versa Note</a> features storage underneath the cargo floor, which also doubles as a divider.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base S trim include 15-inch steel wheels with covers, cloth upholstery, a four-speaker audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, and four-way manual adjustable seats. The SV trim adds a 5.0-inch screen, 15-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, keyless entry, a rearview camera, and six-way adjustable front seats. On the range-topping SR trim, it gets 16-inch alloy wheels, faux suede upholstery, fog lights, keyless entry/start, side sills, a roof-mounted spoiler, turn signals integrated into side mirrors, and the Easy-Fill tire alert system. The SV Special Edition package adds features from the SR trim to the SV grade like fog lights, keyless entry/start, and the Easy-Fill tire alert system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Versa Note a three-star front crash and a four-star rollover rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t crash-tested the 2018 Versa Note. There are no active safety features available on the 2018 Versa Note in any trim level.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/versa-note/2014/2014-nissan-versa-note-sv-with-sl-tech-package-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>, we said that the front and rear seats are spacious and there’s no center tunnel cutting into the passenger foot well in the back. However, material quality is poor because the interior is composed mostly of hard plastics. The 1.6-liter I-4 doesn’t have much power and is sluggish off the line, meaning you need t0 plan your highway passes. Handling is also a weak point due to the car’s numb steering, uninspiring chassis and low-rolling resistance tires that easily lose grip and howl the moment you take a corner.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In Japan, the Nissan Versa Note, which is called the Note, is offered in an e-Power hybrid model that’s powered solely by an electric motor backed by a gas engine that acts as a generator.</p>

<p><strong>Trim Levels (Interior and Exterior Options)</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/nv200/2018/">Nissan NV200</a> is a compact commercial vehicle slotting below the larger <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> NV1500. It’s available in S and SV grades. In addition to the cargo van, there’s also a taxi variant available.</p>

<p><strong>NV200 S: </strong>The base S trim gets you 15-inch steel wheels with covers, Bluetooth, a 5.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, cloth upholstery, a USB port, and a two-speaker audio system.</p>

<p><strong>NV200 SV: </strong>Moving up to the SV trim adds keyless entry, six floor-mounted D-rings in the cargo area, cruise control, a chrome grille, body-colored bumpers, and two 12-volt outlets.</p>

<p><strong>Performance and Fuel Economy</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Nissan NV200 is powered by a 2.0-liter I-4 with 131 hp and 139 lb-ft of torque that’s paired to a CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings are 24/26 mpg city/highway. Taxi variants are less efficient at 23/26 mpg.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Nissan NV200 hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. There are no available active driver assistance features on the 2018 NV200.</p>

<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>

<p>There’s 122.7 cubic feet of cargo space in the 2018 NV200 and the van can haul up to 1,480 pounds of payload depending on the trim level. The 2018 NV200 isn’t rated for towing.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/nv200/2013/2013-nissan-nv200-sv-long-term-verdict/">2013 Long Term Verdict</a>, we said that the NV200’s 2.0-liter I-4 and CVT was laggy and the transmission is loud until you get to cruising speeds, where it settles down. Stability was good at city speeds but it can get unstable at higher speeds. The sliding doors and rear barn doors make it easy to load and the engine didn’t feel tasked even when packed to the brim.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Frontier is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s smallest truck, positioned below the full-size Titian truck. The Frontier is also the most affordable truck on the market.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/frontier/2018/">2018 Nissan Frontier</a>’s standard engine is a 2.5-liter I-4 engine that produces 152 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque and delivers an EPA rated 19/23 mpg city/highway when backed by the five-speed manual and 17/22 mpg with the five-speed automatic. The 2.5-liter I-4 is only available with rear-wheel drive.</p>

<p>The optional 4.0-liter V-6 engine produces 261 hp and 281 lb-ft of torque and is rated at 16/22 mpg with the six-speed manual transmission (16/21 mpg with four-wheel drive) and 16/23 mpg with the five-speed automatic (15/21 mpg with four-wheel drive). The Frontier is available in king cab and crew cab configurations with standard and long beds. The Frontier’s maximum towing capacity is 6,690 pounds when properly equipped. In <em>Motor Tren</em>d testing, the 2015 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/frontier/2018/">Nissan Frontier</a> Pro-4X hit 60 mph in 7.8 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in a long 139 feet.</p>

<p>The Frontier is available with heated and power adjustable leather-appointed front seats, a Rockford Fosgate audio system, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 5.8-inch touchscreen with NissanConnect with navigation, a shift-on-the-fly electronically controlled four-wheel-drive system (2WD/4HI/4LO modes), and an electronic locking rear differential. The PRO-4X model includes off-road-tuned Bilstein high-pressure performance gas shocks, skid plates (oil pan, fuel tank, and transfer case), and a limited-slip rear differential.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>In IIHS testing, the 2017 Nissan Frontier scored the second lowest rating of Marginal for the small overlap front crash test and the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the head restraints and seats evaluation. The highest score of Good was issued for the moderate overlap front, roof strength, and side collision crash test. Front crash prevention was not tested because the Frontier does not offer a collision warning system or emergency automatic braking feature. The NHTSA issued the truck a four-star overall rating out of a possible five stars for the crew cab model; the king cab model has only been tested for the rollover evaluation, where the truck received three stars out of five.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>After <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/frontier/2012/2012-nissan-frontier-4x4-pro4x-verdict/">one year with our long-term 2012 Nissan Frontier</a> Pro-4X 4×4, we said, “Though the aging interior and trusty V-6 engine seemed to be a common complaint when the <em>Motor Trend</em> staff borrowed the truck, the Frontier is enduring and fun to drive with carlike steering, an easy-to-shift six-speed gearbox, the PRO-4X suspension package that rides well on- and off-road, and the ‘just-my-size’ feel for the weekend projecteer or the on-the-fly adventure seeker.”</p>

<p>“We worked our tester to its capacities on a regular basis,” we wrote, “and the truck shined through it all. Though it doesn’t have the power or luxury of a full-size truck, the Frontier can haul, tow, and play just as hard.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>If you are looking to haul a lot of cargo, opt for the base, rear-drive S V-6 model that provides the maximum payload capacity of 1,460 pounds with the five-speed automatic (1,450 with the six-speed manual).</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Maxima is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a>’s flagship sedan that slots above the smaller and less expensive Altima, Sentra, and Versa sedans.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/maxima/2018/">2018 Nissan Maxima</a> sedan is powered by a 300-hp, 261-lb-ft of torque 3.5-liter V-6 engine backed by a CVT that routes power to the front wheels and delivers 21/30 mpg city/highway. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, 2016 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/maxima/2018/">Nissan Maxima</a> Platinum hit 60 mph in 5.7 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 122 feet.</p>

<p>The base Maxima S comes standard with 18-inch aluminum wheels, a Drive Mode selector, fog lights, an 8.0-inch center display screen with navigation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 7.0-inch instrument cluster digital display, two USB ports, LED daytime running lights, dual mufflers with chrome tips, dual-zone automatic climate control, eight-way power driver’s seat, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.</p>

<p>The range-topping Platinum model includes LED headlights, panoramic moonroof, a surround-view multi-camera system, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, adjustable interior ambient lighting, rear window power sunshade, climate-controlled front seats (heated and ventilated), heated steering wheel, Premium Ascot leather-appointed seats with diamond-quilted leather inserts, Mahogany wood-tone faceted interior trim, an 11-speaker Bose Centerpoint 2 premium audio system, and active noise cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The Nissan Maxima received top honors from both crash-test-rating institutions in 2017: the NHTSA gave it a five-star overall rating and the IIHS made it a 2017 IIHS Top Safety Pick+. The Maxima received the TSP+ designation for receiving the highest rating of Good in all six crash test evaluations (including the new small overlap front passenger side test), for receiving the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the headlights evaluation, and for receiving the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention for avoiding a collision in a 12-mph test, and for reducing the impact of a 25-mph collision by 11 mph thanks to the standard Intelligent Forward Collision Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking features. The SL trim adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and adaptive cruise control. The Platinum trim receives Moving Object Detection, an Intelligent Driver Alertness system, as well as front and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/maxima/2016/2016-nissan-maxima-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Nissan Maxima, we liked the improved and retuned CVT and the quick acceleration. However, the Maxima’s back seats and trunk space aren’t as large as in some rivals. “Buyers who want more than the average midsize sedan can offer but know how quickly the MSRP adds up on German luxury sport sedans should definitely add the 2016 Nissan Maxima to their shopping list. As long as expectations are kept in check in terms of interior and cargo space, the Maxima is one of the better semi-premium midsize sedans around.”</p>

<p>After <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/maxima/2016/2016-nissan-maxima-sr-review-verdict/">one year with our long-term 2016 Nissan Maxima SR</a>, we liked the sedan’s performance, handling, and interior comfort, we said, “After nearly 30,000 miles, we decided the 2016 Nissan Maxima SR was a nice place to spend time. Although it may not compete against traditional sport sedans, it offers a dose of sport with a roomy interior for everyday use or a road-trip-with-room for two couples or a family with two teenaged children.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In Sport mode, engine throttle response increases, the CVT shifts more aggressively under braking and holds simulated gears longer, the steering weight increases, and the Active Sound Enhancement feature increases in volume.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Entering its second generation, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Leaf has been completely redesigned for the new model year, featuring a more powerful electric motor, a longer driving range, and more technology.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Leaf is Nissan’s only EV and is positioned above the Versa sedan and Versa Note, the Sentra, and the Altima when comparing starting price.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Nissan Leaf’s electric powertrain consists of a 40 kWh battery pack that powers an electric motor that produces 147 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque and has a Nissan-claimed driving range of 150 miles. A one-speed transmission routes power to the front wheels. The hatchback’s battery pack can be fully recharged in just 40 minutes using a DC Fast Charging station or eight hours using a Level 2 charger (240-volt). If you are short on time, a one-hour charge on a Level 2 charger will give you 22 miles of range and half an hour on a DC Fast Charger will give you 88 miles of range. Expect a more powerful battery pack and electric motor for the next model year.</p>

<p>The base Leaf S comes standard with a 7.0-inch driver’s display screen, automatic temperature control, the Nissan Connect EV App, and the new e-Pedal, a one-pedal regenerative braking driving system. The mid-grade SV model gets 17-inch wheels, a Quick Charge Port, and a Nissan navigation system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The range-topping SL features leather-appointed seats, Bose Energy Efficient Series premium audio system, a portable charge cable, and LED headlights with LED daytime running lights. The All Weather package includes heated outside mirrors, rear heating/cooling ducts, and heated front seats and steering wheel. Nissan’s new ProPilot Assist system is now available in the 2018 Leaf, see the Safety section for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The S model comes standard with Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection, the SV adds Intelligent Cruise Control, and the SL adds Intelligent Around View Monitor camera system and blind spot warning. The remaining driver assist safety features include high-beam assist, rear cross traffic alert, Intelligent Lane Intervention, and ProPilot Assist. ProPilot Assist uses an adaptive cruise control system that atomically accelerates and brakes for the driver and will maintain the speed of the vehicle ahead, even to a complete stop, and will automatically accelerate once the vehicle ahead does. The system also uses a lane keeping system that helps the driver keep the Leaf in its lane.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/leaf/2018/2018-nissan-leaf-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2018 Nissan Leaf, we preferred the new design of the Leaf and the extra power and range from the electric powertrain. The ProPilot Assist system worked very well, “Yet what elevates it to the same conversation as AutoPilot is how accurately it also threads down the center of the road.”</p>

<p>The e-Pedal driving feature worked very well: “If that stop is on a hill, the Leaf’s motor will just hold it motionless (after pausing, you can lift your feet from both pedals; no need to hold the brake). The new Leaf could quickly become the most popular car in San Francisco.” However, we were not impressed with the 150-mile driving range due to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2018/">Chevrolet Bolt EV</a>’s 238-mile range and the base <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/">Tesla Model 3</a>’s 225-mile range. We said, “Maybe anticipating criticism, the Leaf will offer an even-better-chemistry 60-kW-hr pack next year (SL trim), likely extending its leash to about 225 miles (a two-tier strategy akin to the Model 3’s estimated 50 and 75 kW-hrs). Thus, the Bolt’s singular battery size will be bookended by its competitors, with the Nissan’s upgraded pack matching it and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/">Tesla</a>’s smaller pack offering Bolt-competitive range due to better sedan aerodynamics.” At the end of our drive, we were excited with the news of an <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/nissan-prepares-leaf-nismo-concept/">upcoming Leaf NISMO</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The more powerful battery pack in the new Leaf is the exact same size as the previous one thanks to a 67-percent increase in battery energy density versus the 2010 Leaf.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> NV including a 4.0-liter V-6 with 261 hp and 281 lb-ft of torque coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission. The more powerful engine is a 5.6-liter V-8 with 375 hp and 387 lb-ft paired to a seven-speed automatic. The V-6 engine is standard on the NV1500 and NV2500HD but not available on the largest variant, the NV3500HD. As for the V-8 engine, it’s optional on the NV2500HD and standard on the NV3500HD.</p>

<p>Standard roof variants have 234.1 cubic feet of interior space and high roof models have 323.1 cubic feet of interior space. The 2018 NV can haul up to 3,860 pounds of payload and when equipped with a tow hitch receiver, it can tow up to 9,400 pounds. Passenger variants can accommodate up to 12 passengers and the seating configuration can be modified in 324 different ways.</p>

<p>The base S trim comes with 17-inch steel wheels, cloth upholstery, manually adjustable seats, and a two-speaker radio. Options include a rearview camera, cruise control, the NissanConnect infotainment system with a 5.8-inch touchscreen, navigation, Bluetooth connectivity, keyless entry, and a USB port. Passenger variants can be had with heated front seats, a power driver’s seat, and leather upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/four-things-learned-moving-2017-nissan-nv-3500-high-roof-sl-v8/">a review</a> of a 2017 Nissan NV3500HD van in SL trim, we remarked at how much improved the updated 375-hp version of the 5.6-liter V-8 felt compared to the outgoing 317-hp engine, and liked how smooth the seven-speed automatic performed. We said the step-in height to the cargo area was a bit high, though, and noted that the NV’s one wheelbase size should work for many buyers (but there’s no longer-wheelbase option).</p>

<p>As for the van’s ride, we noted in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2012-nissan-nv-2500hd-long-term-verdict/">2012 Long Term Verdict</a> that when the NV2500HD is empty, it gets bouncy and only smooths out when it’s loaded. There’s also minimal sound insulation in cargo variants of the NV, making its interior extremely loud.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

A new cabin filter has also been added.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Formerly the entry-level model of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/">Porsche</a>’s sports car lineup, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/718-boxster/2018/">Porsche 718 Boxster</a> is a mid-engine, rear-drive, two-seat convertible that’s closely related to the 718 Cayman. With the Cayman now taking the place of the Boxster as the 718 line’s base model, the Boxster is now more expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 718 Boxster including a 2.0-liter turbo flat-four with 300 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque in the base model, or a 2.5-liter turbo flat-four with 350 hp and 309 lb-ft in the S model. Both engines can be paired to either a standard six-speed manual or an optional seven-speed twin-clutch automatic gearbox. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/28 mpg city/highway for the manual and 22/29 mpg with the automatic when equipped with the base engine. The more powerful 2.5-liter is rated at 20/26 mpg with the manual and 21/28 mpg with the automatic. Because the 718 Boxster is a mid-engine sports car, it has cargo areas up front and in the back. The trunk can has a 4.4-cubic foot capacity and the front trunk, or “frunk,” is slightly larger at 5.3 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, partial leather upholstery, the PCM interface, a rearview camera, parking sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, and HID headlights. Options include alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, leather upholstery, adaptive sport seats, heated and ventilated front seats, navigation, a premium audio system from Bose or Burmester, Porsche’s torque vectoring system, carbon ceramic brakes, a sport exhaust system, active suspension, a larger fuel tank, a heated multi-function steering wheel, LED headlights and dual-zone climate control. Like other Porsche models, the 2018 718 Boxster can be extensively customized with unique exterior colors, two-tone interior upholstery, contrast stitching, metal and wood trim, and seat belts of different colors.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Some safety features include lane change assist and adaptive cruise control with Porsche Active Safe, which bundles automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/718-boxster/2017/2017-porsche-718-boxster-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that both new turbo engines offer excellent levels of power and both transmission are easy to operate. However, the six-speed manual’s active rev-matching function turns on in Sport and Sport+ mode and can’t be turned off. The 718′ Boxster’s handling remains excellent thanks to its light but direct steering and excellent chassis that makes it feel like an extension of the driver.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Like all Porsche models, the 718 Boxster can be ordered and picked up in Germany via Porsche’s European delivery program, which enables an owner to custom order the car and pick up the car in either Leipzig or Zuffenhausen. Additionally, U.S. customers can also pick up their Boxsters at the Porsche Experience center in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/">Porsche</a> Panamera has 17.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the split-folding rear seats and 47.3 cubic feet behind the front seats. Plug-in hybrid models have slightly less, at 14.3 cubic feet with the second row in place and 44 cubic feet with them down. The Panamera Executive has the most cargo space at 17.6 cubic feet wit the rear seats up and 52.6 cubic feet with them down; however, opting for the hybrid variants drops capacity down to 14.3 cubic feet and 49 cubic feet, respectively. The newest addition, the Panamera Sport Turismo offers 18.3 cubic feet with the second row in place and 49 cubic feet with them down. Hybrid variants also take a hit in cargo capacity to 16 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 45 cubic feet with them down.</p>

<p>Standard equipment includes 19-inch alloy wheels, the PCM interface with navigation and a 12.3-inch touchscreen, a 10-speaker audio system, LED headlights, Bluetooth connectivity, Apple CarPlay integration, keyless drive, two-zone climate control, a rearview camera and heated front seats. Options include heated rear seats, ventilated and massaging front and rear seats, alloy wheels up to 21 inches in diameter, adaptive sport seats, soft close doors, premium audio systems from Bose or Burmester, a rear entertainment system, a 360-degree view camera system, rear-wheel steering, adaptive air suspension with active suspension management, carbon ceramic brakes, and a sport exhaust system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Porsche Panamera; however, it is available with active safety features such as lane change assist, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, traffic jam assist, turn assist, night vision assist, and Porsche Active Safe, which combines forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/panamera/2017/2017-porsche-panamera-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we noted that the Panamera 4S’ new twin-turbo V-6 engine and the Panamera Turbo’s new 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 are smooth and at home driving at high speeds. Put the Panamera in Sport+ mode and you get a more buttoned-down ride, excellent throttle response, and crisp handling accompanied by quick shifts from the twin-clutch automatic and crackling noises from the car’s exhaust. Even in Comfort mode, the Panamera stays planted at high speeds and never feels sloppy. The Panamera E-Hybrid, on the other hand, is a stealth hybrid, featuring only small hints at its electrified nature such as the acid green accents and brake calipers. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/panamera/2018/2018-porsche-panamera-hybrid-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive,</a> we noted that the same crisp driving dynamics remains on the electrified Panamera. However, since it has a dual-clutch transmission, there’s shunting at low speeds especially when the car is slowing down.</p>

<p>The more practical Panamera Sport Turismo retains the same strong acceleration as its hatchback siblings but with more practicality and seating for up to five. However, the center rear seat is best reserved for smaller passengers since it’s quite tight, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/panamera/2018/2018-porsche-panamera-sport-turismo-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a>. Despite the additional weight of the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid, its acceleration is explosive and feels right at home on the track despite it being such a large car. Out on the road, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/panamera/2018/2018-porsche-panamera-turbo-s-e-hybrid-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a> that the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid is also an excellent cruiser and can travel in electric mode for a short time.</p>

<p>The 2018 911 gets three new variants including the GTS trims (for the Carrera, Cabriolet, and Targa models), plus the high performance GT2 RS and GT3 models.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2018/">2018 Porsche 911</a> is the German automaker’s iconic rear-engine sports car that’s available in rear- or all-wheel drive configurations. In addition to the coupe, the 911 is also available as a convertible and as targa, which is essentially a power retractable roof section that stows away.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Standard features on the base 911 Carrera include 19-inch alloy wheels, the PCM interface with navigation and a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, Apple CarPlay integration, an eight-speaker audio system, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, a 4.6-inch multi-information display, two-zone climate control, front sports seats, partial leather upholstery, and HID headlights. Options include premium audio systems from Bose or Burmester, leather upholstery, adaptive seats, LED headlights, a sport exhaust system, a GT sport steering wheel, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, heated and ventilated front seats, a front axle lift system, carbon-ceramic brakes, power steering plus, and an adaptive sport suspension. Cargo capacity is 5.1 cubic feet in the front trunk (sometimes known as a frunk) and 9.1 cubic feet behind the front seats when the rear seats are folded down.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>When equipped with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, the 911 can be had with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/">Porsche</a> Active Safe system that combines forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Lane change assist is a standalone option on the 911 lineup.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette/2017/2017-chevrolet-corvette-grand-sport-vs-2017-porsche-911-carrera-s/">2016 comparison test</a> against the Corvette Grand Sport, the 911 Carrera S lost by a narrow margin mainly because it didn’t offer the same level of excitement as the Corvette until you go into its sportiest setting and drive it hard. However, in terms of refinement the 911 was superior thanks to its well-built cabin and more compliant ride. Even heavier variants of the 911 remain highly capable as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2017/2017-porsche-911-targa-4s-first-test-review/">2017 911 Targa 4S First Test</a>. The car combines exceptional performance and handling with daily usability thanks to its excellent ride comfort even in poorly maintained surfaces. The 3.0-liter twin-turbo flat-six provides prodigious power for passing and accelerating on the highway. However, like all 911 models, its price can skyrocket with options.</p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2018/2018-porsche-911-gts-review/">911 Carrera GTS</a> offers even more performance while retaining its daily usability. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2017/2017-porsche-911-carrera-gts-first-drive/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that all-wheel-drive-equipped models offer prodigious levels of grip more stability. The manual transmission, while slick and easy to use, can’t be rushed or you risk accidentally shifting to the wrong gear.</p>

<p>On the higher end of the 911 spectrum, the 911 Turbo S proves that you can have a seriously potent supercar that won’t beat you up on the daily grind thanks to the adjustable dampers, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2017/2017-porsche-911-turbo-s-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>. Even the less powerful 911 Turbo (compared to the 911 Turbo S) offers explosive power and unflappable handling even with less body rigidity in convertible form. However, in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2017/2017-porsche-911-turbo-cabriolet-first-test-ultimate-socal-car/">2017 First Test</a>, we noted that there’s way too many buttons for nearly every feature and function.</p>

<p>Those seeking the most track-focused 911 should look to the 911 GT3 and with a new six-speed manual option or a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. We noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/911/2018/2018-porsche-911-gt3-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive</a> that the dual-clutch transmission is an excellent companion that responds quickly with snappy shifts in automatic and manual modes.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/macan/2018/">2018 Porsche Macan</a> gets a new cabin air filter and an updated instrument cluster display that shows cabin air circulation.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting below the midsize Cayenne, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/macan/2018/">Porsche Macan</a> is the brand’s entry-level compact luxury crossover and comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Macan including a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 252 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque in the base model or a 3.6-liter twin-turbo V-6 in the S, GTS, and Turbo variants. The twin-turbo V-6 is rated at 340 hp and 339 lb-ft in the Macan S, 360 hp and 369 lb-ft in the Macan GTS, and 400 hp and 406 lb-ft in the Macan Turbo. With the optional Performance package, the Macan Turbo’s output rises to 440 hp and 442 lb-ft, and adds bigger brake pads, active suspension, the Sport Chrono package, and a Sport+ mode. The only transmission available on all Macan models is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/">Porsche</a>’s seven-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 20/25 mpg city/highway for the base Macan and 17/23 mpg for all models equipped with the 3.6-liter twin-turbo V-6. There’s 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row and it can be expanded to 53 cubic feet with them down. All variants of the Macan can tow up to 4,409 pounds of payload when properly equipped.</p>

<p>Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, the PCM multimedia interface, parking sensors, a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, a 7.0-inch multi-information display, a power tailgate, HID headlights, power front seats, 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats, and tri-zone climate control. Options include navigation, alloy wheels up to 21 inches in diameter, leather upholstery, adaptive sport seats, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a premium audio system from Bose or Burmester, a rear entertainment system, active air suspension, Porsche’s torque vectoring system, a sport exhaust system, and carbon ceramic brakes on more powerful variants.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Porsche Macan. Lane change assist can be had as a standalone option or bundled with lane keep assist. Adaptive cruise control comes bundled together with Porsche Active Safe system, which combines forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/macan/2015/2015-porsche-macan-s-turbo-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, we said that the Macan drives as a Porsche should, offering strong acceleration and sure-footed handling when the road starts turning. Steering feel, however, could be improved with more feedback. When the pavement ends, the Macan is surprisingly capable; however, it’s no rock crawler and should be limited to light trails and not extreme rock crawling. Pricing — especially when equipped with desirable options — is a bit above some of its rivals.</p>

<p>The mid-level Macan GTS splits the difference between the Macan S and Turbo but also provides an even more driver-centric experience just like every GTS model. In terms of handling, the Macan GTS is superior to the other models in the lineup including the more powerful Macan Turbo thanks to its superior suspension setup. On the road, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/macan/2017/2017-porsche-macan-gts-first-test/">2017 First Test</a> that the Macan GTS drives just like one would expect out of a Porsche, offering confident handling and quick acceleration with its twin-turbo V-6.</p>

<p>However, some issues caused the Macan GTS to place third in <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/f-pace/2017/jaguar-f-pace-s-mercedes-amg-glc43-porsche-macan-gts-comparison/">a recent comparison test</a> to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-AMG GLC43 and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> F-Pace S, which was the winner. Its cabin, for instance is cramped and the seats give up too much comfort in the name of sporty driving, and it felt out of its element on the highway. Surprisingly the Macan GTS’ twin-clutch automatic isn’t as polished as it is on other Porsche vehicles, shifting harshly and sometimes interrupting power delivery. The twin-turbo V-6 also suffers from turbo lag and runs out of power the closer you get to its redline.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The base 2.0-liter turbo-four in the Porsche Macan is shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a4/2018/">Audi A4</a>, A5, A6, Q5, and Q7.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the smaller Macan, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/cayenne/2018/">Porsche Cayenne</a> is the brand’s midsize crossover that comes standard with all-wheel drive and is available in gas or plug-in hybrid variants.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/">Porsche</a> Cayenne is available with five different engine options that are all paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. All variants of the Cayenne have a towing capacity of 7,716 pounds when properly equipped.</p>

<p>Behind the split-folding rear seats, the 2018 Cayenne has 23.6 cubic feet of cargo space and it can be expanded to 62.8 cubic feet, which is on the small side for a crossover its size. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid has slightly less capacity at 20.5 cubic feet behind the second row and 59.7 cubic feet behind the front seats due to the hybrid system’s extra components.</p>

<p>Standard features include 18-inch alloy wheels, HID headlights, eight-way power adjustable front seats, 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats, a power lift gate, Bluetooth connectivity, and the PCM multimedia system with navigation. Options include LED headlights, all0y wheels up to 21 inches in diameter, parking sensors, a rearview or 360-degree view camera system, a panoramic sunroof, soft close doors, heated and ventilated front and rear seats, a rear entertainment system, premium audio systems from Bose or Burmester, adaptive sport seats, an active air suspension system, Porsche’s torque vectoring system, dynamic chassis control, carbon ceramic brakes, power steering plus, and a sport exhaust system.</p>

<p>Like all Porsche models, the Cayenne can be customized with a full range of upholsteries and unique exterior colors. This includes two-tone interior schemes with unique contrast stitching, colored seatbelts, and interior trim ranging from wood and metal to carbon fiber.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Cayenne hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. Lane keep assist and lane change assist are bundled together as a single option. Adaptive cruise control is bundled together with Porsche Active Safe (PAS), a system that combines automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning. Lane departure warning is a standalone option.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/cayenne/2015/2015-porsche-cayenne-s-turbo-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>, we noted that the Cayenne S has a smooth engine with plenty of power on tap; however, those looking for the best straight line performance should immediately look to the Turbo models with their twin-turbo V-8s, both of which offer prodigious power that’s enough to push you back into your seat when you hit the gas. To go with its excellent on-road manners, the Cayenne is also right at home doing some off-road driving where it easily goes crawls over rocks and hills. However, the Cayenne is no rock crawler. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x6/2015/x6-m-range-rover-sport-svr-gle63-s-coupe-cayenne-turbo-s/">2015 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-AMG GLE63 Coupe, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover/2018/">Land Rover Range Rover</a> Sport SVR, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/x6/2018/">BMW X6</a> M, the Porsche Cayenne Turbo S placed third due to excessive amounts of turbo lag, a clinical driving experience, and the fact that it felt dated compared to its rival.</p>

<p>The Cayenne S E-Hybrid proved that it’s still capable when the road starts to turn with its excellent handling despite the additional weight added by the hybrid powertrain’s extra components. However, as with most hybrids, the Cayenne S E-Hybrid’s steering is lackluster and not very communicative. The plug-in hybrid powertrain offers plenty of power and is right at home at high speeds, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/cayenne/2015/2015-porsche-cayenne-s-e-hybrid-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>. Interior quality is typical Porsche with soft touch, high-grade materials throughout the cabin.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Alongside the Panamera, the Cayenne is one of two Porsche models that’s available with a plug-in hybrid variant.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/718-cayman/2018/">2018 Porsche 718 Cayman</a> adds customization options that includes a gloss black rear spoiler, contrasting colored stitching and seat belts. There’s also a new cabin air filter.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary<br/></strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/718-cayman/2018/">Porsche 718 Cayman</a> is a mid-engine, rear-drive, two-seat coupe that’s less expensive than the rear-engined 911, and is a sister vehicle to the 718 Boxster.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 718 Cayman is powered by one of two turbocharged flat-four engines including a 2.0-liter with 300 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque in the base model or a 2.5-liter with 350 hp and 309 lb-ft in the Cayman S. Both engines can be paired to a standard six-speed manual or an optional seven-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission.</p>

<p>The EPA hasn’t given the 2018 718 Cayman its fuel economy ratings but its sister vehicle, the 718 Boxster is rated at 21/28 mpg city/highway with manual and 22/29 mpg with the automatic when powered by the base engine. Opting for the more powerful 2.5-liter unit drops those numbers down to 20/26 mpg with the manual and 21/28 mpg with the automatic. Since the 718 Cayman is a mid-engine vehicle, it has 5.3 cubic feet of cargo space in its frunk and 9.7 cubic feet in the rear hatch.</p>

<p>Standard features include partial leather upholstery, 18-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, the PCM interface, Bluetooth connectivity, parking sensors, and HID headlights. Options include navigation, adaptive sport seats, premium audio system from Bose or Burmester, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, leather upholstery, an active suspension system, carbon ceramic brakes, a torque vectoring system, a sport exhaust, a larger fuel tank, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated multi-function steering wheel, LED headlights and dual-zone climate control. Additionally, you can also customize the 718 Cayman with different interior treatments such as two-tone color schemes, contrasting seat belts and stitching, and metal or wood trim.</p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/">Porsche</a> 718 Cayman, which is available with lane change assist, adaptive cruise control and Porsche Active Safe, which bundles together forward collision and automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/718-cayman/2017/2017-porsche-718-cayman-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that with the smaller yet more powerful engine, the 718 Cayman drives as a Porsche should. The base 2.0-liter turbocharged engine features linear power delivery and doesn’t suffer from much turbo lag. However, its engine note isn’t as pleasing as the six-cylinder unit it replaced. The larger 2.5-liter flat-four has a wider power band and offers even more effortless acceleration. Handling, on the other hand, is excellent thanks to the improved steering system taken out of the 911 Turbo, improved chassis, and wider tires.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Before it received the 718 name, the Cayman was more expensive than the Boxster.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/promaster/2018/">Ram ProMaster</a> is a large commercial van that slots above the smaller ProMaster City. There are no trim levels available but the van can be had in either low or high roof variants and with three wheelbase lengths.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/">Ram</a> ProMaster Cargo Van:</strong> The ProMaster cargo van comes standard<strong> </strong>four-way manual seats, a UConnect infotainment system with a 5.0-inch touchscreen, a USB port, Bluetooth connectivity, keyless entry, 16-inch steel wheels, and a rearview camera.</p>

<p>Notable options include remote start, parking sensors, navigation, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch aluminum wheels, side windows, and power adjustable side mirrors.</p>

<p>The 2018 Ram ProMaster comes with two engine choices, a 3.6-liter V-6 with 280 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque or a 3.0-liter turbodiesel I-4 rated at 174 hp and 295 lb-ft. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission available with the 3.6-liter V-6 while the diesel comes with a six-speed automated manual.</p>

<p>The smaller ProMaster 1500 short-wheelbase model has 259 cubic feet of cargo volume. Moving up to the medium-wheelbase model increases cargo volume to 304 cubic feet for low-roof variants and 353 cubic feet for high-roof variants. On the larger ProMaster 2500, the high-roof medium-wheelbase model has 353 cubic feet of cargo volume and the long-wheelbase model comes in at 420 cubic feet. The largest model, the 3500 cargo and window vans have 420 cubic feet of cargo volume because they’re available exclusively with the long wheelbase. Should you need more space, the extended high-roof ProMaster 3500 cargo van has 463 cubic feet of cargo volume.</p>

<p>When it comes to hauling payload, the 1500 can carry up to 3,990 pounds provided you choose the gas-powered short-wheelbase ProMaster cargo van with the low roof. The most capable ProMaster 2500 is the medium-wheelbase low-roof model, which can haul 4,740 pounds of payload. For the ProMaster 3500, the V-6-powered model is the most capable with a max payload of 5,2oo pounds.</p>

<p>When properly equipped with a trailer, all variants of the 2018 Ram ProMaster can tow up to 5,100 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/promaster/2014/2014-ram-promaster-first-drive/">2014 First Drive review</a>, we said that with the 3.6-liter V-6, the ProMaster accelerated easily and didn’t get excessively noisy. Ride comfort was good when the van was empty but improved when it had a payload. We also liked the ProMaster’s low load height, making it easy to put cargo into the van. The driving position, however, is awkward and lacks adjustments, making it hard to get comfortable. Its touchscreen is also small and can be distracting to use when driving.</p>

<p>The Ram ProMaster is called the Fiat Ducato in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The 1500 is Ram’s entry-level pickup truck, positioned below the larger and more expensive 2500 and 3500 series trucks.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/1500/2018/">Ram 1500</a>’s base engine is a 3.6-liter V-6 that produces 305 hp and 269 lb-ft and delivers an EPA-rated 17/25 mpg city/highway with rear-wheel drive and 16/23 mpg when equipped with four-wheel drive.

Besides the sole six-speed automatic, all engines come standard with an eight-speed automatic. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/1500/2018/">2018 Ram 1500</a> is available in a regular cab with an 8-foot or 6-foot-4-inch bed, a quad cab with a 6-foot-4-inch bed, or a crew cab with a 5-foot-7-inch bed or a 6-foot-4-inch bed. The Ram 1500 can tow up to 10,620 pounds when properly equipped.</p>

<p>Standard features for the base Tradesman include a spray-in bed liner, 17-inch wheels, a full-size spare, a 3.5-inch instrument cluster driver’s display, vinyl upholstery, a rear backlight, a Class IV trailer hitch, a USB port, and Radio 3.0 user interface.

<p>For the ultimate in luxury, opt for the Limited Tungsten package that includes a Frost/Indigo leather interior, body-color door handles, a sport performance hood, Platinum Chrome bodyside moldings and badges, body-color R-A-M tailgate lettering, black bezel Sport projector headlights, Sport LED taillights, Platinum Chrome R-A-M logo grille, and 20-inch Satin Carbon painted aluminum wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>All 2018 Ram 1500 models (crew, quad, regular, 2WD, 4WD) received a four-star overall NHTSA rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the Ram 1500 received the second lowest score for the small overlap front and roof strength crash teat evaluations but received the highest score of Good in the moderate overlap front and head restraints and seats evaluations. The front crash prevention evaluation was not conducted because the Ram 1500 does not offer a collision warning or emergency automatic braking system. Safety features include the standard rearview camera system and available front and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/1500/2014/comparison-2015-ford-f-150-vs-ram-1500-chevrolet-silverado/">three-way pickup truck comparison conducted late in 2014</a>, the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel topped the (last-generation) <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2018/">Ford F-150</a> 4×4 and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> Silverado Z71, we said, “Forget ‘jack-of-all-trades.’ This truck masters every one of them.” “With the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel, you get a truck that’s quick when you want it to be, efficient most all of the time, always comfortable loaded or unloaded, luxurious, and always ready to work. It’s amazing how capable this truck is — the more time I spend with it, the more I’m reminded why it’s our first-ever back-to-back truck of the year winner.”</p>

<p>The 2014 Ram 1500 (same model) won the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-ram-1500-is-motor-trend-2014-truck-of-the-year/">2014 <em>Motor Trend</em> Truck of the Year</a> award, “We’ve been awarding Truck of the Year since 1979 and have never given the award to the same truck two years in a row. The Ram 1500 makes history as the first back-to-back Truck of the Year winner because it offers all the things truck buyers want in a rig: choice, value, great design, and more than enough power and torque. And with the EcoDiesel, you can add efficiency and guts to that list. Ram has made a game-changing decision by bringing diesel to the full-size market. It’s a bold move truck lovers have been begging for, which is why the Ram 1500 is our 2014 Truck of the Year.”</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/2500/2018/">Ram 2500</a> is powered by a 5.7-liter V-8 that produces 383 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. The available 6.4-liter V-8 cranks out 410 hp and 429 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are backed by a six-speed automatic. The range-topping 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel I-6 engine is rated at 350 hp and 660 lb-ft of torque with the six-speed manual transmission but gets an increase with the six-speed automatic transmission to 370 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque. All models are available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The 2500 HD is available in a few configurations that include a regular cab with a long bed, Crew Cab with a short or long bed, and the Mega Cab with a short bed.</p>

The Limited model adds Premium Natura leather, premium full-length floor console, and heated second-row seats. For the ultimate in Ram luxury, opt for the Limited Tungsten package that consists of a suede headliner, power-folding Platinum mirrors, a Limited tailgate applique, bodyside moldings, body color R-A-M tailgate lettering, a unique Ram grille, and 20-inch aluminum wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Ram 2500 received a four-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars) for rear- and four-wheel-drive models. Standard features include an electronic trailer brake controller (except on base Tradesman model), backup camera, and a tire-pressure monitoring system. Front/rear parking sensors and a cargo-view camera are optional.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/ram-2500-3500-hd-2017-truck-of-the-year-contender/">2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year Testing</a>, the Ram 2500 and 3500 lost to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/">Ford</a> Super Duty. We loved the power from the Cummins turbodiesel but felt the 3500 had a terrible ride and drivetrain lash, “I felt bumps and other vibrations like no other truck here on parts of the drive loop that I didn’t feel anything in any other truck.” The off-road package equipped 2500 actually had a much better ride. We felt the Ford Super Duty beat the Ram Heavy Duty model in just about every category except looks, “The heavy-duty Rams’ biggest problem, however, is that everything it can do, both Ford Super Duties can do better. Towing, hauling, phone connectivity, mirror coverage, interior features and fabrics—you name it, the burly Ford has the Ram beat. Except for one thing: looks.” “Even if the bull’s-nostrils grille isn’t your thing, you have to admire the big Ram’s Kardashianesque hips.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/2500/2017/chevrolet-colorado-zr2-vs-ford-f-150-raptor-vs-ram-2500-power-wagon/">three-wayoff-road truck comparison</a>, the Ram 2500 Power Wagon topped the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/colorado/2018/">Chevrolet Colorado</a> ZR2 and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2018/">Ford F-150</a> Raptor. We concluded, “During the worst of [our long off-road journey], when the Colorado was skipping over bumps and the Raptor was sliding sideways, the Ram tracked straight and true. The Power Wagon’s Bilstein monotube shocks aren’t as fancy as the Raptor’s Fox shocks or ZR2’s Multimatic dampers, but you can’t tell from behind the wheel. The ride is slightly stiffer, mostly because of its size and higher payload capacity, but it’s never punishing. The Power Wagon always grips no matter what stands in its path. Focus on your line. The Ram has everything else handled. It’s the right truck for the terrain we encountered on the entirety of the Trans-Labrador Highway.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The special off-road gear for the Power Wagon includes front and rear locking differentials, a 4.10 axle ratio, tow hooks, fuel tank and transfer case skid plates, <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/how-to-use-the-2017-ram-2500-power-wagon-electric-winch/">a front electronic winch</a>, electronic disconnecting front anti-roll bar, Ram Articulink front suspension, and 17-inch polished aluminum wheels shod in 285/70RD OWL all-terrain tires.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/3500/2018/">Ram 3500</a> Heavy Duty is the automaker’s most powerful and expensive pickup truck. The 3500 slots above the 2500 and 1500 models.</p>

A diesel-powered 2016 Ram 3500 HD Limited hit 60 mph in 8.6 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 134 feet during <em>Motor Trend</em> testing.</p>

<p>For those needing to tow and haul heavy loads, opt for the Dual Rear Wheels package (it also includes clearance lamps for the cab, box, and fenders) and the fifth-wheel/gooseneck towing prep package that includes an in-bed seven-pin harness connector and mounting points for the fifth wheel or gooseneck hitches. The DOT-certified Roadside Safety Kit includes a DOT fire extinguisher, three reflecting triangles, two red vinyl flags, and spare fuses.

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Cummins 6.7-liter turbodiesel inline-six engine is the only six-cylinder in the segment and uses a whopping 12 quarts of engine oil and 23.8 quarts of coolant. For comparison, the gas-powered 6.4-liter V-8 uses 7.0 quarts of oil and 16.6 quarts of coolant.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>Powering the front-drive 2018 ProMaster City is a 178-hp, 174 lb-ft of torque 2.4-liter I-4 engine backed by a nine-speed automatic. EPA-rated fuel economy comes in at 21/28 mpg city/highway. In the cargo van configuration, the ProMaster City can tow up to 2,000 pounds and the passenger wagon model can tow up to 1,914 pounds. Payload capacity for the cargo van is 1,886 pounds and 1,760 pounds for the passenger wagon. The van offers up to 131.7 cubic feet of cargo capacity in the cargo van model and 101.7 cubic feet for the passenger wagon.

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/promaster-city/2015/2015-ram-promaster-city-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the 2015 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/promaster-city/2018/">Ram ProMaster City</a>, we liked the quick off the line acceleration thanks to the short first gear and the smooth shifting nine-speed automatic. The engine provides plenty of power, even with cargo, but at idle the van does vibrate a lot. The City provides good fuel economy for the segment and a good ride when loaded thanks to its fully independent suspension and plenty of storage cubbies. The van also handles well around town but has a strange driving position (flat steering wheel and far away pedals).</p>

<p>“It gets the stamp of approval of this former delivery driver. It’s easy to load and unload, it’s the right size for most small businesses, it gets good fuel economy, it fits nicely through small alleys and tight parking lots, and it’s even a bit of fun to drive. If you’re going to drive a van all day, you can do much worse than this one, and you’d be hard-pressed to do better.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Ram ProMaster City van is built in Bursa, Turkey at the joint venture TOFAS plant and is then upfitted into its final form at the FCA US Transformation Center in Baltimore, MD.</p>

<p>During <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/smart-fortwo-electric-drive-2018-car-of-the-year-contender/">2018 Motor Trend Car of the Year</a> testing, we liked the 2018 Fortwo Electric Drive for its fun handling dynamics and small size for the city, but felt the car was uncompetitive as a result of its very short driving range (57-58 miles) and its lack of comfort. “The car gets very upset on rough surfaces,” we said. “Imperfections that are minor bumps to other cars feel very threatening when encountered in the Smart.”</p>

<p>“Value is simply not there,” we said. “It’s priced high at $24,550-$29,230, especially relative to the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Leaf.” We concluded by saying, “There’s simply no reason to own one in the U.S.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/smart/fortwo/2017/2017-smart-fortwo-electric-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Smart Fortwo Electric Drive, we weren’t sure who would buy the Smart Electric Drive when the larger <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-bolt-ev-2017-car-of-the-year/">Bolt EV</a> and its much longer range is available for not much more. “And unless you’re one of the few people in the U.S. who absolutely, positively needs an electric vehicle no more than 106.1 inches long, chances are you’re going to want the electric car that takes you a lot farther for the money, and is roomier and more fun to drive,” we said. “In other words, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/">Chevy</a> Bolt.” However, the electric Smart wasn’t all that bad: “It’s smoother, quicker, and quieter than its internal combustion engine powered siblings, thanks to the [electric motor] that delivers 118 lb-ft of torque the moment you squeeze the accelerator pedal.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>After a full redesign for the 2017 model year, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/impreza/2018/">2018 Subaru Impreza</a> gets automatic headlight activation, which turns on the headlights when the windshield wipers are activated.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/impreza/2018/">Subaru Impreza</a> is an all-wheel drive compact car that slots below the midsize Legacy. Sedan and hatchback body styles are available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a> Impreza is powered by a 2.0-liter flat-four rated at 152 hp and 145 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on the base and Sport models, and a CVT is optional (Premium and Limited trims come only with the CVT). Trunk space on the sedan is 12.3 cubic and can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats. The hatchback offers more space at 20.8 cubic feet behind the split-folding rear seats and 55.3 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings vary depending on the model. With the manual, the sedan is rated at 24/32 mpg city/highway while the hatchback is rated at 24/31 mpg. Opt for the CVT and that jumps to 28/38 mpg for the sedan and 28/37 mpg for the hatchback. The Sport trim is the least efficient, with manual-equipped models rated at 22/31 mpg for the sedan and 23/30 mpg for the hatchback. CVT-equipped Sport models are rated at 27/36 mpg for the sedan and 27/35 mpg for the hatchback.</p>

<p>The base Impreza comes standard with 16-inch steel wheels, cloth upholstery, Bluetooth connectivity, Subaru’s Starlink infotainment system with a 6.5-inch touchscreen, a USB port, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration, and a rearview camera. Higher trims can be had with automatic climate control, navigation, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, keyless entry/start, leather upholstery, fog lights, adaptive full LED headlights, alloy wheels ranging from 16 to 18 inches in diameter and heated front seats. The Impreza Sport features a sport-tuned suspension and Active Torque Vectoring.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Impreza received a five-star rating on the side impact and rollover test from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t crash tested a 2018 Impreza yet but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and the new headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front collision prevention test, the Impreza received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest possible rating in the front collision prevention test). As a result, the IIHS awarded the Impreza the 2017 Top Safety Pick+ award.</p>

<p>Subaru’s EyeSight suite is available on all but the base trim of the 2018 Impreza. It bundles adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, as well as lane departure and sway warning. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert are bundled together with EyeSight and automatic high beams or fog lights that turn into corners.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/impreza/2017/2017-subaru-impreza-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we said that the Impreza feels solid thanks to its new platform and improved steering, which makes it feel more responsive. The interior has high-quality materials with plenty of soft touch bits. Subaru’s newest infotainment system is easy to use and easily integrates with your smartphone via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. There’s also minimal exterior noise entering the cabin while passenger and cargo space is generous all around. However, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/impreza/2017/2017-subaru-impreza-sedan-hatchback-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, that the 2.0-liter flat-four is underpowered. Throttle tip-in is touchy and can get jerky when accelerating from a stop. Ride comfort, on the other hand, is smooth even on poor surfaces except in the Sport trim with its 18-inch alloy wheels and sport-tuned suspension, which can get rough and unsettled. Handling is respectable on all models but the Sport trim doesn’t really make any noticeable improvements over the base, Premium, and Limited models.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/wrx/2018/">2018 Subaru WRX</a> receives a revised front fascia, an upgraded suspension, a new Performance package, a larger multi-information display, updated EyeSight safety suite, and available Recaro seats. The higher-performance WRX STI comes standard with new 19-inch wheels, Brembo brakes, and a revised all-wheel-drive system.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/wrx/2018/">Subaru WRX</a> is a sports sedan that’s well-regarded for its rally heritage and all-wheel-drive performance capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 WRX is powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-four with 268 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque; the quicker WRX STI model gets a 2.5-liter turbo-four with 305 hp and 290 lb-ft. A six-speed manual is standard on the WRX and a CVT is optional. The WRX STI comes exclusively with a six-speed manual gearbox. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 WRX stand at 21/27 mpg city/highway for the manual or 18/24 mpg with the CVT. The more powerful WRX STI has yet to be rated but the 2017 model returned 17/23 mpg. Trunk space stands at 12 cubic feet and it can be expanded with the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include a new 5.9-inch instrument cluster display, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a>’s Starlink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth connectivity, cloth upholstery, front sport seats, and a rearview camera. Options include navigation, a Harman Kardon audio system, adaptive LED headlights, dual-zone climate control, power-operated front sport seats, leather upholstery, a sunroof, fog lights, and 18-inch alloy wheels. The new Performance package for the WRX adds Recaro seats, Jurid brake pads, red brake calipers and deletes the sunroof.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Subaru WRX hasn’t been crash tested but the 2017 model received a Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS, earning a Good score on all but the headlights test where it received a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score). In the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the WRX received a Superior rating when it avoided a 12- and 25-mph collision. Subaru’s EyeSight safety suite features adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, lane keeping assist and sway warning, and lane departure warning. However, the technology is only available on the range-topping Limited trim.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/wrx/2015/2015-subaru-wrx-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, we said that despite being slower than previous-generation model, the current WRX offers better road holding capabilities, giving it superior handling. The active torque vectoring control system keeps body roll and understeer in check. However, with the more rigid chassis, the car rides rougher and stiffer than before. The more powerful WRX STI lost a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/golf/2015/2015-subaru-wrx-sti-vs-2015-volkswagen-golf-r/">2015 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/golf/2018/">Volkswagen Golf</a> R because of its rough ride that made it too bouncy. Turbo lag is also prominent in the WRX STI and it lacks the refinement of the Golf R despite having similar performance capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The WRX’s 2.0-liter turbo-four first appeared in the Forester XT.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/outback/2018/">2018 Subaru Outback</a> gets a revised exterior design, a retuned suspension for a smoother ride, an updated multimedia system, and available adaptive full LED headlights.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/outback/2018/">Subaru Outback</a> is a midsize crossover-like wagon that slots above the slightly smaller Forester and comes standard with all-wheel drive on all trim levels.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a> Outback can be had with a 2.5-liter flat-four that produces 175 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.6-liter flat-six with 256 hp and 247 lb-ft. A CVT is the only transmission available on all trims. EPA fuel economy ratings are 25/32 mpg city/highway for the four-cylinder and 20/27 mpg with the six-cylinder.</p>

<p>Cargo space is generous at 35.5 cubic feet with the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats in place and 73.3 cubic feet with them folded. When properly equipped, the 2018 Outback can tow up to 2,700 pounds regardless of the engine choice.</p>

<p>Standard equipment on the base Outback include 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, Bluetooth connectivity, Subaru’s Starlink multimedia system with a 6.5-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a four-speaker audio system, and a rearview camera. Higher trims can be optioned with navigation, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, dual-zone climate control, up to four USB ports, heated front and rear seats, keyless entry/start, leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, power-adjustable front seats, a moonroof, and adaptive full LED headlights.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Subaru Outback a five-star side impact rating and a four-star rollover score (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Outback received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and Acceptable on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2018 Outback received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest possible score in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the 2018 Subaru Outback received the IIHS’ 2017 Top Safety Pick+ award.</p>

<p>Subaru’s EyeSight safety suite is available on the Premium trim and higher. The safety features included are forward collision warning, automatic front and rear emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure and sway warning, and lane keeping assist. Automatic high beams as well as blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist also come bundled with the EyeSight suite.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>When powered by the base 2.5-liter flat-four, the Outback isn’t very quick, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/outback/2015/2015-subaru-outback-25i-limited-first-test/">2015 First Test</a> and throttle tip in is touchy just like in its sibling, the Legacy midsize sedan. For a tall wagon-based crossover, the Outback offers respectable handling thanks to its standard all-wheel-drive system. The interior has high-quality materials and Subaru’s Starlink intotainment system is easy to use. The larger 3.6-liter flat-six offers better acceleration, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/outback/2015/2015-subaru-outback-36r-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, but it comes at the cost of fuel economy.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Outback was one of the first crossover wagons on the market when it debuted in the 1990s as a variant of the Legacy wagon.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The new Black Edition package for the 2.5i joins the lineup and Active Torque Vectoring is now standard on the 2.0XT Touring model. Touring models now feature EyeSight Driver Assist Technology as standard, and High Beam Assist and Reverse Auto Braking is added to the EyeSight suite of driver assist features.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the smaller Crosstrek and below the larger but similarly priced Outback, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/forester/2018/">2018 Subaru Forester</a> is the brand’s compact offering and one of its best-selling models. Like other <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a> models except for the BRZ coupe, the Forester comes standard with all-wheel drive. For now, it’s also the only crossover sold by Subaru that’s available with a turbocharged engine.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Engine choices in the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/forester/2018/">Subaru Forester</a> crossover include a 170-hp, 174-lb-ft of torque 2.5-liter flat-four as standard and paired to either a six-speed manual (22/28 mpg city/highway) or a CVT (26/32 mpg). The 250-hp, 258-lb-ft 2.0-liter turbo-four, which is essentially a less powerful version of the unit found the WRX sports sedan, is the optional powertrain paired exclusively to a CVT and delivers an EPA-rated 23/27 mpg. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 Subaru Forester 2.0XT hit 60 mph in a quick 6.8 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 115 feet.</p>

<p>The Forester 2.5i Premium is one step above the base 2.5i and comes standard with a panoramic power moonroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, X-Mode off-road mode (CVT only), automatic climate controls, 10-way power driver’s seat, rear roof spoiler, raised roof rails, reclining rear seats, a 4.3-inch color driver’s display, and a 7.0-inch Starlink Multimedia Plus infotainment system. The top 2.0XT Touring model comes equipped with leather-trimmed upholstery, 18-inch wheels, LED steering responsive headlights, dual chrome exhaust outlets, a sport-design front fascia, heated front seats, one-touch folding rear setbacks, leather-wrapped heated steering wheel, paddle shifters, dual-zone automatic climate control, power liftgate, navigation with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, and a Harman Kardon audio system. The new Black Edition package includes 18-inch black aluminum wheels, a Sport grille, fog lights, black rear badging, black painted side view mirrors, seat bolsters, and a shifter handle with leather boot and Gloss Black trim.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Subaru Forester earned the NHTSA’s highest overall safety rating of five stars and is considered an IIHS 2017 Top Safety Pick+ (the highest honor). The Top Safety Pick+ designation was earned because the Forester received the highest rating of Good in five out of the six crash tests, the highest rating of Superior for front crash avoidance, and the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the headlights evaluation. The Forester received the second-lowest rating of Marginal for the new passenger-side small overlap front crash test. The Superior rating was achieved because the Forester properly warned the driver of a possible collision, avoided a collision in 12-  and 25-mph frontal tests thanks to the optional EyeSight suite of driver assist safety features that includes adaptive cruise control, an emergency automatic braking system, lane departure and sway warning, and lane keep assist. High beam assist, blind-spot monitoring, reverse automatic braking, and rear-cross traffic alert are also available. A rearview camera is standard on all models.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/forester/2017/2017-subaru-forester-20xt-touring-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Subaru Forester 2.0XT, we were very impressed with the crossover’s acceleration, which was the best in the segment. Although we did not like the aggressive initial throttle response and somewhat stiff suspension, the Forester handled well. We liked the improved cabin insulation, updated technology, and the new Saddle Brown leather interior that feels and looks good. We weren’t fans of the old-looking dual-screen layout  or the display screen resolution. However, we loved the large and spacious cabin for passengers and cargo and the great outward visibility. We concluded our review by saying: “Although the Forester won our 2014 SUV of the Year award, its competition has advanced just as far, and in terms of design and technology, even more quickly. Just think of rivals that offer Apple CarPlay, a head-up display, and larger touchscreens with crisp graphics. Luckily the faithful Forester remains quick and all-around functional, qualities many of its rivals still haven’t mastered.”</p>

<p>In a nine-way compact <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2016/small-crossover-comparison-big-test/">crossover Big Test comparison</a>, the 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i finished fourth. “Just ahead of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> goes our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-suv-of-the-year-subaru-forester/">2014 SUV of the Year</a> champ, the Subaru Forester,” we wrote. “Age hasn’t been kind the Forester, and although it still has impressive fuel economy and safety scores that you can hang your hat on, an interior that leaves us wanting, loud cabin, and jumpy throttle response do in the Subbie.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Forester 2.0XT’s 2.0-liter turbo-four engine produces 250 hp at 5,600 rpm, the WRX 2.0-liter turbo-four engine does 268 at that same rpm. However, both engines make 258 lb-ft of torque from 2,000 rpm, but the WRX holds that power until 5,200 rpm versus the Forester’s 4,800 rpm.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/legacy/2018/">2018 Subaru Legacy</a> gets a mild exterior design revision and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  as standard. Higher trim levels are now available with adaptive LED headlights and a larger eight-inch touchscreen for the updated Starlink infotainment system.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/legacy/2018/">Subaru Legacy</a> is a midsize sedan slotting above the compact Impreza. In its class, the Legacy is the only midsize sedan that comes standard with all-wheel drive. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/fusion/2018/">Ford Fusion</a> also offers all-wheel drive, but only on a higher-cost engine option.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engine options are available in the 2018 Legacy including a 175-hp 2.5-liter flat-four or a 256-hp 3.6-liter flat-six. Both engines are paired exclusively to a CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 Legacy have yet to be announced but shouldn’t deviate much from the 2017 model, which is rated at 25/34 mpg city/highway with the 2.5-liter and 20/28 mpg with the 3.6-liter. Trunk space is generous at 15 cubic feet and it can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a>’s Starlink infotainment system with a 6.5-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, and cloth upholstery. Options include power front seats with driver memory, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a Harman Kardon audio system, navigation, a new and larger eight-inch touchscreen for the Starlink infotainment system, adaptive LED headlights, and alloy wheels up to 18 inches in diameter.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Subaru Legacy hasn’t been crash tested yet, but the 2017 model received high scores including a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS evaluations, the car received a Good score on all crash tests and the new headlight safety test, and a Superior rating on the front crash prevention test after it avoided a 12-mph and 25-mph collision (Good is the highest possible score). Subaru’s EyeSight suite of active safety and driver assistance features is available and includes automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, forward collision warning, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Thi</strong><strong>nk</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/legacy/2015/2015-subaru-legacy-25i-limited-first-test/">2015 First Test</a>, we said that the CVT  operates quietly and doesn’t sound like one. However, since the Legacy doesn’t have a torque converter, its CVT is abrupt and jerky from a standstill even with the lightest throttle application.  The base 2.5-liter flat-four doesn’t offer much power but due to the car’s standard all-wheel-drive system, it offers decent handling and good grip levels. Inside, the material choices are good and even the fake wood trim feels high quality.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Subaru Legacy is closely related to the Outback crossover.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> has been redesigned for the 2018 model year. Built on a new platform, the crossover features an updated engine, a standard six-speed manual, Stablex dampers, active torque vectoring, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as available reverse automatic braking and Steering Responsive headlights.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The Crosstrek is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a>’s smallest crossover. Based on the Impreza hatchback, the Crosstrek has a lower starting price than the Forester and Outback.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/">2018 Subaru Crosstrek</a> crossover packs the Impreza’s 2.0-liter I-4 with 152 hp and 145 lb-ft of torque, mated to a CVT that sends power to Subaru’s Symmetrical all-wheel-drive system. That’s a small bump in power from the outgoing 2.0-liter I-4, which produced 148 hp. A six-speed manual is the standard transmission. The Crosstrek returns 27/33 mpg city/highway when equipped with the CVT and 23/29 with the six-speed manual. The Crosstrek sports 8.7 inches of ground clearance that give the vehicle a more crossover-like stance.</p>

<p>The Crosstrek 2.0i base model includes a 6.5-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, multi-function driver’s display, 17-inch wheels, and integrated roof rails. Opt for the Premium model and your Crosstrek will come standard with LED daytime running lights and headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, Steering Responsive headlights, leather upholstery with orange contrast stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, 6-way power driver’s seat, and an 8.0-inch display screen.  Available features include blue footwell lighting, Harman Kardon audio system, map and dome LED lighting, remote start, an STI rear spoiler and 18-inch STI alloy wheels. Available accessories include a multitude of different Thule branded roof carriers, crossbar set, and bike hitch carrier.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Subaru Crosstrek has yet to be crash tested by the IIHS and NHTSA. However, its platform mate, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/impreza/2017/">2017 Subaru Impreza</a> has, and the hatchback model was given the highest five-star rating from the NHTSA and the highest honor of 2017 Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Subaru offers two packages that include EyeSight driver assist technologies for the 2018 Crosstrek. The EyeSight system includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane departure warning with sway warning and lane keep assist. One package also includes high beam assist, reverse automatic braking, and a moonroof. The other package includes all the features from the previous package and adds Starlink 8.0-inch multimedia with navigation and an eight-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think </strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/crosstrek/2018/2018-subaru-crosstrek-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek, we were impressed with its off-road capability and improved rigidity, “With 8.7 inches of ground clearance (and 18/29 degrees of approach/departure angle), the Crosstrek’s intelligent all-wheel-drive system and off-road calibrated ABS put fears of ever getting stuck in anything less than rock-crawling situations to rest.”</p>

<p>However we were not impressed with the power from the updated powertrain that still provides slow acceleration. “The Crosstrek “wants” to have 200 horsepower. The last time we tested a 2015 Crosstrek (with 148 hp vs the current 152 hp), it sauntered to 60 mph in 10.3 seconds—or 1 to 3 seconds behind its main competitors.”</p>

<p>Even so, the interior did impress us: “The new interior rivals class leaders in terms of layout, quality, and materials choices.” At the end of our review we said that “for those who want the off-road capability and upscale features of either a Forester ($23,710–$37,005) or an Outback ($26,810–$39,605) but in a smaller package at a more manageable price, the Crosstrek follows where the Legacy Outback wagon or Outback Sport once blazed the trail before it grew to become a bona fide SUV in 2015.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The new Crosstrek may look similar to the outgoing one, but according to Subaru, the 2018 model is 90 percent new.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/brz/2018/">2018 Subaru BRZ</a> gets a new tS variant that comes with Brembo brakes, an adjustable rear wing, Bilstein shocks, 18-inch alloy wheels in black, and a more aggressive suspension setup for sharper handling.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/brz/2018/">Subaru BRZ</a> is a rear-drive sports coupe and the only vehicle in <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a>’s U.S. lineup to not come with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Subaru BRZ is powered by a 2.0-liter flat-four with 205 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the standard six-speed manual transmission. With the optional six-speed automatic transmission, the engine is rated at 200 hp and 151 lb-ft. EPA fuel economy ratings are 21/29 mpg city/highway with the manual and 24/33 mpg with the automatic. Trunk space is small at 6.9 cubic feet, but it can be expanded with the single-piece folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features include a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth connectivity, Subaru’s Starlink multimedia interface with a 6.2-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, LED headlights, keyless entry, cloth upholstery, and a USB port. The Limited trim adds dual-zone climate control, keyless start, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, heated front seats, Alcantara/leather upholstery, and fog lights. Navigation is available via a mobile phone-based app. Optional only on the Limited trim, the Performance package sharpens the BRZ’s handling by adding wider tires, Brembo brakes on all four corners, Sachs dampers, and black 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 BRZ received a four-star rating on the front crash test and five stars on the rollover test from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 BRZ but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the front small overlap test where it got an Acceptable rating (Good is the highest possible score).  The IIHS has yet to test the BRZ’s headlights. Active safety features aren’t available on the 2018 BRZ.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/brz/2017/2017-subaru-brz-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a> review, offers even better handling than the pre-refresh BRZ thanks to its improved suspension and a new Track mode that keeps the electronic nannies from interfering too much. Driving enjoyment remains the focus in the Subaru BRZ, which makes it easy to drift on a track. The 2.0-liter flat-four, however, still needs to be revved because there’s still not much mid-range grunt.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Subaru BRZ’s 2.0-liter flat-four is the only Subaru-made engine to feature <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s D-4S direct- and port injection system.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/">Tesla</a> is not your average automaker in many ways, including how the company avoids the traditional model year designations and model year updates. Instead, Tesla prefers rolling out over-the-air updates and adding and dropping powertrain variants throughout the vehicle’s lifecycle. In recent months, Tesla has dropped the base 60 kWh powertrain and the 90 kWh powertrain, replaced by the now base 75 kWh powertrain and the range-topping 100 kWh powertrain, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Model S is one of the most popular EVs in the world and is Tesla’s flagship vehicle, positioned above the new Model 3 sedan. The Model S has a slightly lower starting price than the Model X crossover but has a longer range and quicker acceleration. During the third quarter of 2017, the 100 kWh models got <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cuts-the-price-of-its-most-powerful-models/">price cuts</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2018/">Tesla Model S</a> 75D utilizes a 75 kWh battery pack that powers the front and rear mounted electric motors (all-wheel drive) that together produce 518 hp and have an EPA-rated driving range of 259 miles (listed ratings are for 2017 model year). The mid-level 100D is powered by a 100 kWh battery pack that also consists of front and rear mounted electric motors and has a long range of 335 miles (2017), currently the longest of any electric car. The top P100D utilizes the same battery pack to power more powerful front and rear-mounted electric motors that produce a whopping 680 hp and 791 lb-ft of torque and come rated with a 315-mile driving range (2017). All powertrains use a one-speed transmission.</p>

<p>As for charging times, using a 75 kWh home wall charger will take about three hours of charging time for 100 miles of driving range. A 100 kWh home wall charger will take approximately two hours for 100 miles, but a Tesla Supercharger will only take 15 minutes of charge time for 100 miles of driving range. For 300 miles of driving range (only possible on the 100 kWh), a Tesla Supercharger only takes about an hour of charging time, but the 75 kWh home charger will take about nine hours.</p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2017/2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-first-test-review/"><em>Motor Trend</em> testing</a>, the Model S P100D hit 60 mph in a record-braking 2.3 seconds, quicker than any other production car we have tested.</p>

<p>The Tesla Model S comes standard with a 17.0-inch captive touchscreen with navigation, a Wi-Fi hotspot, heated power-folding side view mirrors, two USB ports for smartphone connectivity and charging, 12-way power and heated front seats, lighted door handles, LED interior ambient lighting, and LED fog lights. If you order the $5,000 Premium Upgrade package, your Model S will also come with a HEPA air filtration system (includes bioweapon defense mode), an 11-speaker custom audio system, satellite radio, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, wiper blade defrosters, and washer nozzle heaters. The Enhanced Autopilot (semi-autonomous self-driving system) will set you back $5,000 but adds three more cameras and 12 ultrasonic sonar sensors. The Full Self-Driving Capability (not full but semi-autonomous) package is an additional $3,000 and doubles the number of cameras to eight. The two small rear-facing seats will set you back $4,000.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2017/">2017 Tesla Model S</a> received the second highest score of Acceptable for the IIHS’ small overlap front crash test and the highest rating of Good from the remaining four crash evaluations (moderate overlap front, side, roof strength, and head restraints and seats). The Model S’ automatic emergency braking system avoided a collision in the 12- and 25 mph crash tests. In NHTSA testing, the Tesla was only tested for the rollover evaluation and received the highest five-star rating. Safety features include collision avoidance and automatic emergency braking and dynamic LED rotating headlights.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2017/2017-chevrolet-bolt-ev-vs-2016-tesla-model-s-60/">comparison review</a> between the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2018/">Chevrolet Bolt EV</a> and the Tesla Model S 60, we liked the fact that the Tesla can receive over-the-air updates and the quick acceleration provided by the powerful electric motor. We also enjoyed the big premium sedan feel and the quietness of the electric powertrain. The Model S is more of a cruiser, providing a comfortable ride and decent cornering ability. The interior of the Tesla is well-packaged and the 17.0-inch display screen is one of the best in the industry. The rear seats lack some headroom and the floor is a little high. We concluded by saying, “Ultimately the Bolt and Model S 60 quite close in performance and function. The Model S remains a technical tour de force three years after its release, with Tesla appearing to have no intention of letting its flagship car wither on the vine. If semi-self-driving technology and a proven quick-charging capability with worldwide infrastructure for long-distance travel is what you’re after, there’s really no choice but the Tesla.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2015/2015-tesla-model-s-p90d-ludicrous-upgrade-first-test-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2015 Tesla Model S P90D, we said, “Aside from the horsepower bonus, the P90D remains the Model S we know and love; the ride is luxury-car compliant despite the big wheel and tire package, and steering is still sharp for a vehicle that’ll never be described as ‘light’.” We concluded by saying, “The P90D can run 10.9-second quarter miles right out of the Tesla showroom, and it offers up hypercar acceleration for around $130,000. The takeaway here shouldn’t solely be that the Model S P90D is currently the quickest four-door on the market. Rather, the focus should be that it does it without burning a single ounce of gasoline.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In <em>Motor Trend’s</em> instrumented testing, the Tesla Model S P100D hit 30 mph in 0.9 seconds and 100 mph in 6.0 seconds. Those are extremely quick acceleration rates for any production car.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Currently, like the Model S, the Model X has three variants, the 75D, 100D, and the range-topping P100D. The 75 and 90 variants are no longer offered. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/">Tesla</a> recently <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-lowers-starting-price-model-x/">lowered the starting price</a> of the Model X.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The Model X is currently the electric automaker’s only crossover, with the compact Model Y crossover on the way. The Model X has a higher starting price than the Model S sedan and has a lower driving range.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 75D is currently the Model X’s base model and comes with an EPA-rated driving range of 238 miles (all range figures refer to 2017 EPA ratings) thanks to a 75 kWh battery pack that powers front and rear-mounted electric motors (all-wheel drive) that produce a combined total of 518 hp. The 100D’s 100 kWh battery pack powers more powerful front and rear-mounted electric motors and comes with a driving range of 295 miles. The P100D variant utilizes the same battery pack as the 100D but power is increased to 680 hp and 791 lb-ft of torque and the driving range slightly decrease to 289 miles (2017). All Teslas use a one-speed transmission. To give you an idea of charging time, charging time for 150 miles of driving range using a 75 kWh home wall charger will take about five hours and about three hours using a 100 kWh home wall charger. A Tesla Supercharger will only take half an hour for 150 miles of driving range. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the now discontinued Model X P90D hit 60 mph in a very quick 3.2 seconds and braked from 60 mph in an impressive 106 feet.</p>

<p>The Model X comes standard with air suspension with a 17.0-inch capacitive touchscreen with media connectivity, 14-way power adjustable and heated front seats, hand-wrapped microfiber and synthetic leather interior surfaces, GPS memory (for automatic ride height adjustment), a very large panoramic windshield, Falcon Wing doors, power liftgate, interior ambient lighting, heated front seats, a towing package, LED fog lights, LED taillights, power-folding and heated side view mirrors, and navigation with traffic information. A five-seat configuration is standard but a six- and seven-seat configurations are available. Opt for the Premium Upgrades package and your Model X will also come with a HEPA filtration system, a self-presenting front door, a custom audio system, satellite radio, heated seats for all passengers, a heated steering wheel, wiper blade defrosters, and heated washer nozzles. The Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability system (actually semi-autonomous) are additional available features.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the Model X the institution’s highest overall rating of five stars and received five stars in all categories (frontal crash, side crash, and rollover). The Model X comes standard with collision avoidance and automatic emergency braking systems and rotating LED headlights. The Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving Capability semi-autonomous driving systems can be considered safety features because they help drivers avoid accidents. The IIHS has yet to evaluate the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-x/2018/">Tesla Model X</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-x/2016/2016-tesla-model-x-75d-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Model X 75D, we said, “Bottom line: If you long for the daily sense of wonderment that can come from driving a futuristic pod that essentially does everything slightly differently from “normal” vehicles and if your SUV needs pretty much start and end with a high seating position and enough hood to distinguish you from the hordes of minivan drivers, then rest assured that a Model X 75D (or perhaps even a 60D) will absolutely deliver 90 percent of the everyday adventure you’d get from the top-performing Ludicrous models at a price that starts out $42,500 cheaper than a P90D with Ludicrous Speed upgrade. Just understand that with any Model X, you won’t be carrying big things, and you may occasionally be required to leave apology notes on the windshields of parked cars your doors have attacked.”</p>

<p>“In fact, say what you like about Tesla’s gimmicks, but the Model X, like its sedan sibling, is such a well-done piece of machinery that it makes you look at all other cars as if they’ve come straight out of the past. It’d be a better SUV without the falcon doors, the monopost seats, and the windshield, but as it sits now, the Model X is one hell of a people hauler. And at 3.2 seconds to 60, its ability to haul tail is anything but a gimmick,” we concluded in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-x/2016/2016-tesla-model-x-p90d-ludicrous-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-x/2016/">2016 Tesla Model X</a> P90D.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Model X 100D weighs in at a hefty 5,421 pounds, has an even weight distribution of 50/50, and its air suspension provides up to 8.3 inches of ground clearance.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Everything. The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/">Tesla Model 3</a> represents the automaker’s first effort to build an affordable sedan for the mainstream consumer.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/">Tesla</a> Model 3 slots below the full-size <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2017/">Model S sedan</a> and three-row <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-x/">Model X crossover</a>. Where the Model S sedan features a rear hatch with available rear jump seats for up to seven passengers, the Model 3 is a traditional five-seat sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Although Tesla hasn’t divulged full specs about the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/tesla-model-3-first-look-review/">new Model 3 sedan</a>, the automaker has made a few claims about its more affordable model. Pricing for the Model 3 is said to start at $35,000 before government incentives. In contrast, the base rear-drive <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2018/">Tesla Model S</a> 60 starts around $70,000.</p>

<p>Tesla says the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-model-3-behind-the-scenes/">Model 3 sedan</a> will have a 215-mile range and accelerate to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds. The five-seat sedan is also said to have been designed to earn a five-star safety rating. Other features include autopilot hardware and the ability to use the company’s supercharger network designed for the Model S.</p>

<p>Inside, the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2017/tesla-model-3-second-ride-review/">Model 3 features a simplified interior</a> compared to the Model S and Model X vehicles. In production-ready models, expect a large center-mounted horizontal screen replacing both the driver information display and the vertical infotainment screen used in automaker’s current models.</p>

<p>Despite its fastback profile, the <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-model-3-photos-analysis/">Tesla Model 3 is a traditional sedan</a> about the size of a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/3-series/2018/">BMW 3 Series</a>/4 Series Gran Coupe, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/c-class/2018/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a>. Unlike the Model S’ aluminum-intensive body, the Model 3 is constructed of a steel unit-body with aluminum panels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Tesla anticipates a five-star crash test rating, and we expect the automaker to offer lots of active safety tech in conjunction with the automaker’s autopilot hardware.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Initial impressions from our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/tesla-model-3-first-ride-review/">Tesla Model 3 First Ride review</a>: “Our Model 3, which was a fairly well-equipped dual-motor version with air suspension and what we think could be a 70 kWh battery pack, shot effortlessly forward when our Tesla minder flattened the accelerator. Despite the fact that our car was loaded down with five people, acceleration was quick, smooth, and quiet. Typical Tesla. While the Model 3 won’t throw you back in your seat like a Model S P90D will, it’s not going to leave drivers wanting for more oomph. Think of the difference in acceleration compared to a Model S like a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> 328i versus an M3; both are quick, but one feels a bit more so. Handling from the passenger seat felt solid, too. With the center of gravity kept low by the floor-mounted battery pack, there was little if any body roll detectable during our mini-slalom course, but count on Motor Trend for a full, instrumented track test once we can get our hands on a production-spec model.”</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tacoma/2018/">2018 Toyota Tacoma</a> gets the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Safety Sense-P safety suite as standard. The five-speed manual option has been discontinued on the SR and SR5 trim. TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, and Limited trims are now available with the Cement exterior color. TRD Pro models get the Cavalry Blue exterior color, which replaces Cement. Midnight Black replaces Black in all trims. All trims except for the TRD Pro get a revised grille.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tacoma/2018/">Toyota Tacoma</a> is a midsize truck that slots below the larger, full-size Tundra and is available in rear- or four-wheel drive configurations. Two bed lengths and three cab variants are available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Tacoma comes standard with a 2.7-liter I-4 with 159 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque, and is paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. There’s also an optional 3.5-liter V-6 with 278 hp and 268 lb-ft that can be had with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>EPA ratings for the base four-cylinder are 19/23 mpg city/highway for rear-drive models and 19/22 mpg with four-wheel drive. Opting for the V-6 doesn’t come at the cost of fuel economy with the automatic-equipped rear-drive Tacoma rated at 19/24 mpg and the four-wheel drive version coming in at 18/23 mpg. The least efficient Tacoma is the TRD Pro, which is rated at 18/21 mpg with the manual and 17/20 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>Four-cylinder variants can tow up to 3,500 pounds of payload when properly equipped. With the available V-6 Tow Prep package, the V-6-powered Tacoma can tow up to 6,800 pounds in the rear-drive Access Cab configuration with the standard bed or 6,500 pounds with four-wheel drive. Double cab models with the V-6 can tow up to 6,700 pounds in rear-drive guise and 6,400 pounds with four-wheel drive. Opting for the long bed drops the rear-drive double cab’s towing capacity down to 6,600 pounds.</p>

<p>Standard features include 16-inch steel wheels, cloth upholstery, Toyota’s Entune multimedia system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, a USB port, Bluetooth connectivity, and a rearview camera. Options include a larger 7.0-inch touchscreen, a JBL premium audio system, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, keyless entry/start, a wireless phone charger, dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, a moonroof, alloy wheels up to 18 inches in diameter, heated front seats, power-adjustable front seats, and parking sensors.</p>

<p>The Tacoma TRD Pro is distinguished with its standard Fox shocks, Rigid Industries LED fog lights, a unique grille with a heritage-inspired Toyota badge, a TRD Pro skid plate, a TRD exhaust, a hood scoop, and TRD Pro 16-inch alloy wheels wrapped in all-terrain tires.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Tacoma a four-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 Tacoma but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side front small overlap impact where it hasn’t been tested yet and the headlights test where it received a Poor rating (Good is the highest possible score). The IIHS hasn’t crash-tested the 2018 Tacoma’s front crash prevention features.</p>

<p>Now standard on all Tacomas for the 2018 model year is Toyota Safety Sense-P, which bundles together forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, and lane departure warning. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available only on the TRD Sport and higher trims.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tacoma/2016/2016-toyota-tacoma-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a> review, we said that the more rigid chassis and body makes the Tacoma feel more solid and refined on the road, giving it a quieter cabin. However, the brakes are overly sensitive. Steering has poor on-center feel and makes it feel like you’re driving a larger truck, and the six-speed automatic has a tendency to hunt for gears. Interior quality, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tacoma/2016/2016-toyota-tacoma-v-6-first-test-review/">2016 First Test,</a> is good, but the rear seats were tight.</p>

<p>The off-road-oriented Tacoma TRD Pro was right at home outside of the pavement. It handled rough terrain with ease and wasn’t hard to control. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tacoma/2017/2017-toyota-tacoma-trd-pro-off-road-review/">2017 First Drive</a>, we also noted that the 3.5-liter V-6 needs more revs than the old 4.0-liter V-6 it replaces.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris/2018/">2018 Toyota Yaris</a> iA is unchanged.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris/2018/">Toyota Yaris</a> iA is a front-drive subcompact sedan that slots below the larger Corolla.</p>

<p>Like other former Scion models, the 2018 Yaris iA comes only in a single trim with standard features that include keyless entry/start, 16-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, a six-speaker audio system, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, two USB ports, Bluetooth, and cloth upholstery.</p>

<p>Available accessories include an armrest, a rear spoiler, a tablet holder, and navigation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris-ia/2018/">2018 Toyota Yaris iA</a> is powered by a 1.5-liter I-4 rated at 106 hp and 103 lb-ft of torque paired to either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 30/39 mpg city/highway with the manual and 32/40 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Yaris iA a five-star overall rating (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing, the Yaris iA received a Good score on all but the passenger side front overlap impact where it hasn’t been evaluated (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2018 Yaris iA avoided a 12-mph impact, allowing it to get an Advanced rating (Superior is the highest rating on the front crash prevention test). A low-speed automatic emergency braking system comes standard on the 2018 Yaris iA.</p>

<p>Trunk space is 13.4 cubic feet and can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/scion/ia/2016/2016-scion-ia-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we noted that the Yaris iA has a quiet engine but its throttle response is on the lazy side. On cars with a manual, the clutch is light and the take-up is easy to find. Since it’s essentially a Mazda2 (a car we no longer get in the U.S. as a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/">Mazda</a>), the Yaris iA is surprisingly nimble thanks to its light weight. However, you will need a few downshifts when the car is loaded with more people. Although the interior is mostly hard plastic, touch points are well-finished and the controls are laid out logically. The cabin, however, does lack many storage cubbies because of the lack of a center console storage area.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris-ia/2018/">Toyota Yaris iA</a> is essentially a Mazda2 sedan underneath and it’s built in Mazda’s factory in Mexico.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/avalon/2018/">2018 Toyota Avalon</a> Hybrid is unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/avalon/2018/">Toyota Avalon</a> Hybrid is the hybrid variant of the full-size Avalon sedan and it comes exclusively in a front-drive configuration. A non-hybrid six-cylinder Avalon model is also available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Avalon’s powertrain consists of a 2.5-liter I-4 coupled to an electric motor, a nickel metal hydride battery and a CVT. Total system output is 200 hp. EPA fuel economy ratings are 40/39 mpg city/highway, making the 2018 Avalon Hybrid one of the most fuel efficient large sedans available. Trunk space, however, drops to 14 cubic feet from 16 cubic feet in the gas-only Avalon due to the extra components of the hybrid system.</p>

<p>The base Avalon Hybrid <strong>XLE Plus</strong> trim comes with keyless entry/start, 17-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, leather upholstery, a rearview camera, dual-zone climate control, Toyota’s Entune multimedia system, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, and eight-way power front seats. Move up to the Avalon Hybrid <strong>XLE Premium</strong> trim and you’ll get navigation, driver’s seat memory, a wireless phone charger, blind-spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. The range-topping Avalon Hybrid <strong>Limited</strong> trim adds heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, a JBL premium audio system, HID headlights, 17-inch chrome look alloy wheels, interior ambient lighting, and tri-zone climate control.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Avalon Hybrid a five-star overall safety score (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 Avalon Hybrid but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crash worthiness tests and an Average rating on the new headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). On the front crash prevention test, the Avalon received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and a 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest possible score). As a result, the Avalon Hybrid received the Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Toyota Safety Sense-P, which bundles together adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high beams come standard on all 2018 Avalon Hybrid models. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard only on the XLE Premium and Limited grades.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Although we haven’t tested a 2018 Avalon Hybrid, <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-toyota-avalon-limited-hybrid-first-test/">we did review a 2014 model</a> and said that it offers plenty of power on tap and has a CVT that’s willing to leave the car in the middle of its power band. For a large sedan, the Avalon Hybrid is also not as floaty as past Avalons thanks to its stable ride. Inside, the cabin is well-insulated and the infotainment system features two large knobs and a responsive touchscreen. However, the excessive amount of chrome in the cabin can cause too much glare in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The hybrid system in the 2018 Avalon Hybrid is also found on the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es/2018/">Lexus ES</a> 300h, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/nx/2018/">Lexus NX</a> 300h, and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4/2018/">Toyota RAV4</a> Hybrid.</p>

<p>In addition to a new front fascia, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris/2018/">2018 Toyota Yaris</a> receives an upgraded infotainment system and a new instrument cluster in the L and LE trims with a multi-information display. Blue Eclipse replaces Blue Streak Metallic and Crushed Ice with a black roof is replaced by Blue Streak with a black roof as the second two-tone exterior color.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting below the compact Corolla, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris/2018/">Toyota Yaris</a> is the Japanese brand’s entry-level vehicle available in two- or four-door hatchback variants. A sedan based on the global market Mazda2 called the Yaris iA is also available.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>All Yaris hatchbacks are powered by a 1.5-liter I-4 with 106 hp and 103 lb-ft of torque, paired to a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. The EPA hasn’t released fuel economy ratings for the 2018 model but the 2017 Yaris was rated at 30/36 mpg city/highway with the manual or 30/35 mpg with the automatic. There’s 15.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the split-folding rear seats in the two-door variant or 15.6 cubic feet in the four-door model.</p>

<p>Standard features include Bluetooth connectivity, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, a USB port, Siri Eyes Free, cloth upholstery, and a multi-information display. The SE trim gets a larger 7.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, and 16-inch alloy wheels as additional standard features.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Yaris hasn’t been crash tested but the 2017 model received a four-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The car was also tested by the IIHS and it received a Good score on all but the small overlap front crash where it got a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score). The IIHS gave the 2017 Yaris a Basic score for front crash prevention. Standard on the 2018 Yaris the TSS-C active safety feature suite that includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/yaris/2015/2015-toyota-yaris-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>, we said that Yaris has a good bit of body roll and it gets worse the harder you push the car. Keeping up your speeds in the Yaris is easy since it doesn’t weigh much; however, the tall gearing means acceleration is slow and lacks torque, making it a challenge to get it up a hill. Steering, on the other hand, is responsive and makes the car feel nimble.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Yaris is one of two affordable subcompact cars that features automatic emergency braking, the other being the Yaris iA sedan.</p>

<p>The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-c-hr-9-unique-features-paris-motor-show/">2018 Toyota C-HR</a> is the newest entry among subcompact crossovers, America’s fastest-growing segment. Compared to some other subcompacts, the C-HR puts an emphasis on style instead of practicality with its controversial exterior design.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting below the compact RAV4, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/c-hr/2018/">2018 Toyota C-HR</a> will be the newest and smallest crossover entry when it arrives next year.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Not much is known regarding what engine will power the North American-spec 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/c-hr/2018/">Toyota C-HR</a> but it’s likely a 2.0-liter I-4 paired only to a CVT. It’s also likely that a new turbocharged engine could make its debut in the North American C-HR. A new version of the Entune infotainment system should find its way into the Toyota C-HR.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>As with all Toyota models except the 86 sports coupe, the 2018 C-HR could get the TSS-P suite of active safety features as standard. It includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We expect the 2018 Toyota C-HR to be a more interesting drive than most Toyota vehicles available since it’s underpinned by Toyota’s new TNGA platform. The car’s polarizing styling should also cause a lot of heads to turn since it stands out from the crowd more than most cars today.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>In the European market, the 2018 Toyota C-HR is offered with the same hybrid powertrain found in the fourth generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">Toyota Prius</a>.</p>

<p>The redesigned <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/">2018 Toyota Camry</a> rides on Toyota’s new TNGA platform that underpins the Prius and C-HR.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>Slotting above the Corolla and below the Avalon, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/">Toyota Camry</a> is the latest generation of the most popular sedan in the U.S., and one of the best-selling nameplates today. A hybrid variant joins the four- and six-cylinder gas variants.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Camry features three updated powertrains including a base 2.5-liter I-4, a 3.5-liter V-6 with Toyota’s direct- and port-injection system, and a hybrid that now features the revised 2.5-liter I-4 and a lithium-ion battery in all but the base trim level. The base 2.5-liter I-4 and the optional 3.5-liter V-6 come paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic while the hybrid is only available with a CVT.</p>

<p>Available features include an updated version of Toyota’s Entune multimedia interface with an eight-inch touchscreen, a 10-inch head-up display, a seven-inch LCD cluster in between the gauges, a panoramic sunroof, a JBL premium audio system, leather upholstery, alloy wheels ranging from 16- to 19 inches, a 360-degree view camera system, navigation, and Bluetooth.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Toyota’s TSS-P suite of active safety features comes standard in the 2018 Camry and includes high beam assist, lane departure warning with steering assist, adaptive cruise control, and the Pre-Collision system, which bundles forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Other available safety features include blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a drive of a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/2018-toyota-camry-prototype-drive-review/">2018 Camry prototype</a>, we said that the redesigned Camry feels better planted on the road thanks to its new underpinnings and suspension, solid brake pedal feel, and improved handling. The car’s steering feel is also much improved, making it feel livelier than ever.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/sienna/2018/">2018 Toyota Sienna</a> gets the TSS-P active safety suite of technologies, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, additional USB ports, an optional 360-degree view camera system, and an updated rear-seat entertainment system. A revised front fascia freshens the 2018 Sienna’s styling.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/sienna/2018/">Toyota Sienna</a> offers seating for up to eight passengers and is the only minivan available in front- <em>and</em> all-wheel-drive configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>All 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Siennas are powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 with 296 hp and 263 lb-ft of torque, an engine that comes exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings haven’t been released for the 2018 Sienna but the 2017 model was rated at 19/27 mpg city/highway for front-drive models or 18/24 mpg with all-wheel drive. Cargo space stands at 29.1 cubic feet behind the third row, 87.1 cubic feet behind the second row, and 150 cubic feet behind the front seats. Front-drive models are rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds but all-wheel drive variants aren’t rated for towing.</p>

<p>Standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, a multi-information display, tri-zone climate control, cloth upholstery, and keyless entry. Options include navigation, a power liftgate, a rear-seat entertainment system, Toyota’s Enture 3.0 multimedia system with navigation and an app suite, leather upholstery, HID headlights, a JBL premium audio system, keyless entry/start, a heated steering wheel, a 360-degree view camera system, and heated front seats.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Sienna hasn’t been crash tested but the 2017 model received a five-star overall score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS evaluations, the previous model received a Good score on all tests except for the small overlap front crash test where it received an Average rating (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the car received an Advanced rating after it reduced a 12-mph impact by 9 mph and a 25-mph crash by 7 mph. The TSS-P suite comes standard with automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams, and pedestrian detection.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/town-&amp;-country/2015/the-big-test-2014-2015-minivans/">2015 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/">Nissan</a> Quest, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sedona/2018/">Kia Sedona</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/odyssey/2018/">Honda Odyssey</a>, and the outgoing <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> Town &amp; Country (now replaced by the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica/2018/">Chrysler Pacifica</a>), the Toyota Sienna placed third thanks to its quick acceleration and easy-to-remove center seat in the second row. However, its cabin was filled with hard plastics and the SE trim’s sport-tuned suspension hurts the minivan’s overall ride quality, which got bouncy over rough pavement.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>A version of the 3.5-liter V-6 that powers the Sienna is also used in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rx/2018/">Lexus RX</a> 350 and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">Toyota Highlander</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/mirai/2018/">2018 Toyota Mirai</a> gets two additional USB ports and a larger wireless phone charging pad. In late 2017, the Mirai received an updated navigation system, a Wi-Fi hotspot, and Destination Assist Connect. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> also discontinued the hydrogen station finder phone app.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/mirai/2018/">Toyota Mirai</a> is a hydrogen fuel cell sedan that’s currently available only in California and is expected to go on sale in five northeastern states sometime in the 2018 calendar year. It’s available only as a single loaded model.</p>

<p>Standard features include Toyota’s Entune multimedia system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, Bluetooth, a JBL audio system, dual-zone climate control, leatherette upholstery, a heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, keyless entry and start, 17-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights, front and rear parking sensors, and rain-sensing wipers.</p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Mirai features a hydrogen fuel cell stack powering an electric motor with 151 hp and 247 lb-ft of torque coupled to a single-speed automatic transmission, and a nickel-metal hydride battery. It has two high pressure carbon fiber-reinforced hydrogen tanks with a total volume of 122.4 liters. The 2018 Mirai’s EPA-rated driving range is 312 miles.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mirai hasn’t been crash-tested by the NHTSA and IIHS. Standard active driver assistance features include adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and the Pre-Collision System, which bundles together automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning.</p>

<p>Trunk space is small in the 2018 Mirai at 12.8 cubic feet, though that’s still one cubic foot larger than the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/clarity/2018/">Honda Clarity</a> Fuel Cell.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/mirai/2016/2016-toyota-mirai-first-drive/">2016 First Drive</a> review, we said that the Mirai’s user interface works well even with all the touch-sensitive buttons. On the road, the Mirai doesn’t snap off the line like some electric vehicles do but it does drive smoothly once you get going. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2017/hyundai-ioniq-hybrid-vs-toyota-prius-chevrolet-volt-vs-prius-prime-bolt-ev-vs-ioniq-ev-vs-honda-clarity-vs-mirai/">2017 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/">Honda</a> Clarity, we noted that the Mirai is quieter and more comfortable. Even so, the Clarity won that comparison thanks to its five-seat capacity, superior range, and better driving dynamics, in comparison to the Mirai.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/mirai/2016/2016-toyota-mirai-review-long-term-verdict/">2016 long-term verdict</a> review after six months with the car, we said that the Mirai’s driving range was somewhat disappointing because we only managed 279 miles per tank most of the time and rarely broke past the 300-mile mark. We also found that the lack of hydrogen fuel stations made it inconvenient to fuel up and not all stations functioned smoothly. Its low beltline meant visibility out of the car was excellent, and we appreciated its comfortable ride and high-quality interior. The Mirai’s vague handling proved to be a weak point, however, and the car felt heavy through corners.</p>

<p>The Toyota Mirai’s name in Japanese translates to future in English.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/4runner/2018/">2018 Toyota 4Runner</a> gets two new option packages including the Wilderness package, which adds roof rack crossbars, all-weather floor liners and a cargo tray.  The TRD Enhancement package comes with 17-inch matte gray alloy wheels and a TRD front skid plate. The Wilderness package is available on the SR5, SR5 Premium, TRD Off-Road and TRD Off-Road Premium trim while the TRD Enhancement package is only available on the latter two grades. Three new exterior colors—Super White, Midnight Black, and Calvary Blue—are exclusive to the 4Runner TRD Pro,.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/4runner/2018/">Toyota 4Runner</a> is one of the last truck-based SUVs left in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> lineup, slotting below the larger Sequoia. Rear-wheel drive comes standard and four-wheel drive is optional. Some trim levels including the TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro comes standard with four-wheel drive. Depending on the model, the 4Runner can be equipped with a third-row, increasing seating capacity from five to seven.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota 4Runner is powered by a 4.0-liter V-6 with 270 hp and 278 lb-ft of torque, paired to a five-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 17/21 mpg city/highway for rear-drive models and 17/20 with four-wheel drive.</p>

<p>Cargo space stands at 9.0 cubic feet behind the optional third row, 47.2 cubic feet behind the split-folding second row seats, and 89.7 cubic feet behind the front seats. The optional sliding deck cuts cargo space down to 46.3 cubic feet behind the second row and 88.8 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the 2018 4Runner can tow up to 5,000 pounds of payload.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base SR5 trim include 17-inch alloy wheels, Toyota’s Entune infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera, keyless entry, 40/20/40 split-folding rear seats, a power liftgate, a multi-information display, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cloth upholstery, and an eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat. The SR5 Premium adds leatherette upholstery, heated front seats, navigation, and a power-operated passenger seat. The Limited trim features more creature comforts like dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, driver’s seat memory, 20-inch chrome alloy wheels, and a JBL premium audio system.</p>

<p>The TRD models come with features that improve off-road performance such as a locking rear differential, the Multi-Terrain Select System, Crawl Control, skid plates, off-road tires, a TRD-tuned suspension with Bilstein shocks, and Toyota’s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension system. The Limited trim also comes with a unique suspension setup that features a locking center-mounted limited-slip differential, the X-REAS Sport Enhancement Suspension, and full-time four-wheel drive with Active Traction Control.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota 4Runner received a four-star overall safety score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The 2018 model has yet to be tested by the IIHS but the 2017 4Runner received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except the front small overlap crash where it received a Marginal rating, and the headlights test where it got a Poor rating (Good is the highest possible score). No active safety features are available on the 2018 Toyota 4Runner.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/4runner/2017/2017-toyota-4runner-trd-pro-first-test-review/">a 2017 First Test review</a>, we were impressed with 4Runner’s off-road capability. Despite all of its credentials when the road ends, the 4Runner’s ride is comfortable on pavement, even in TRD Pro guise with knobby all-terrain tires. Handling, however, is sloppy due to the slow steering, and there’s plenty of dive when performing panic stops. The utilitarian cabin is dated with its ancient infotainment system and tiny touchscreen that’s clunky to use.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Toyota 4Runner is closely related to the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gx/2018/">Lexus GX</a> and the global-market Land Cruiser Prado.</p>

Three new colors, Midnight Black Metallic, Shoreline Blue Pearl, and Toasted Walnut Pearl, have been added.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/sequoia/2018/">Toyota Sequoia</a> is a full-size body-on-frame SUV that slots above the midsize, car-based Highlander. Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Sequoia’s only engine is a 5.7-liter V-8 with 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque, and it’s paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. The EPA has yet to rate the 2018 Sequoia’s fuel economy but the 2017 model was rated at 13/17 mpg city/highway for rear- and four-wheel-drive variants.</p>

<p>When properly equipped, the 2018 Sequoia can tow up to 7,400 pounds of payload for rear-drive models or 7,200 pounds for four-wheel-drive models. There’s 18.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row and it can be expanded to 66.6 cubic feet behind the second row and 120.1 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard and available features include Toyota’s Entune multimedia interface, Bluetooth connectivity, a 4.2-inch multi-information display between the gauges, LED headlights, leather upholstery, and second row captain’s chairs.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Toyota Sequoia. Toyota’s Safety Sense-P suite of active safety and driver assistance features comes standard and includes automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, lane departure alert, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/sequoia/2017/2017-toyota-sequoia-4x4-platinum-first-test-size-matters/">2017 First Test of the pre-refresh model</a>, we said that the Sequoia’s standard V-8 engine offers plenty of power for hauling the massive SUV; however, its handling takes a hit because of its size and weight. As for comfort, the Sequoia offers large seats that are great for long road trips and it’s coupled with a smooth ride. The infotainment system, however, is old and isn’t up to par with newer units</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Toyota Sequoia is closely related to the Tundra full-size truck.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">2018 Toyota Prius</a> gets a large 11.6-inch touchscreen option on the Four and Four Touring trims.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">Toyota Prius</a> is a hybrid hatchback that slots above the smaller Prius C. A Touring model with a different suspension calibration is also available in the Three and Four grades, and is distinguished by the standard 17-inch alloy wheels and a higher-efficiency Eco model is also offered based on the Two trim. A plug-in variant called the Prius Prime is also available.</p>

<p><strong>Prius One:</strong> The base One grade comes with a rearview camera, full LED headlights, 15-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry and start, a customizable 4.2-inch instrument cluster display, cloth upholstery, and a 6.1-inch touchscreen.</p>

<p><strong>Prius Two:</strong> Moving up to the Two or Two Eco gets you a rear window wiper and a spare tire.</p>

<p><strong>Prius Three:</strong> Three variants get more features including navigation, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, the Entune app suite, padded upper door trims, and a wireless charging pad. Three Touring models also get 17-inch alloy wheels and leatherette upholstery as standard.</p>

<p><strong>Prius Four:</strong> The range-topping Four grade gets a large 11.6-inch touchscreen, heated front seats, and leatherette upper door trims and armrests. Four Touring models get the same 17-inch alloy wheels as the Three Touring.</p>

<p>Available options include a head-up display, automatic parking assist, and a JBL audio system.</p>

<p>Powering the 2018 Prius is a 1.8-liter I-4 paired to an electric motor, a CVT, and either a nickel-metal hydride battery in the base model or lithium-ion battery on higher grades. Total system output is 121 hp. EPA fuel economy ratings are 54/50 mpg city/highway for all but Prius Two Eco, which is even more efficient at 58/53 mpg.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Prius received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS testing it received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests except for the passenger side small front overlap impact, where it hasn’t been tested (Good is the highest possible score). On the new headlights test, the 2018 Prius received an Acceptable rating; as a result, it qualified for the IIHS’ Top Safety Pick rating.</p>

<p>On the IIHS’ front crash prevention test, the 2018 Prius received a Superior rating after it avoided collisions in 12- and 25-mph tests (Superior is the highest rating on the front crash prevention test). All 2018 Prius cars include Toyota Safety Sense-P (TSS-P), which bundles together adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, lane departure warning with steering assist, pedestrian detection, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on the Four and Four Touring models, and optional on the, Two, Two Eco, Three and Three Touring.</p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Prius has 27.4 cubic feet of cargo space that can be expanded via the standard split-folding rear seats. The Two, Three, and Three Touring models have slightly less cargo capacity at 24.6 cubic feet.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2016/2016-toyota-prius-four-touring-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we said that the Prius handles surprisingly well and the steering is precise for a hybrid, but acceleration is sluggish.

Brake pedal feel can be unpredictable as a result of the car not having smooth transitions from regenerative to mechanical braking. In a 2017 comparison test against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/ioniq/2018/">Hyundai Ioniq</a> Hybrid, the Toyota Prius won because it offered a smoother driving experience, superior fuel economy, and slightly better interior quality to justify its slightly higher price.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">2018 Toyota Highlander</a> is unchanged after a refresh in the 2017 model year.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">Toyota Highlander</a> is a three-row midsize crossover with seating for up to eight passengers. The crossover slotts above the compact RAV4 and below the full-size Sequoia. Front-wheel drive comes standard and all-wheel drive is optional. A hybrid variant is available and it comes with all-wheel drive standard. Another affordable <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>-branded three-row vehicle is the Sienna minivan, which is also available with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Highlander offers three engine choices including a 2.7-liter I-4 185 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5-liter V-6 with 295 hp and 263 lb-ft, and a hybrid powertrain that combines the 3.5-liter V-6 with three electric motors, a CVT and a nickel metal hydride battery for a total output of 306 hp. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission available with the base four-cylinder engine and the V-6 comes exclusively with an eight-speed automatic.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 20/24 mpg city/highway for the front-drive four-cylinder model and 20/27 mpg for V-6 models with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive models are rated at 20/27 mpg for the LE Plus, 19/26 mpg for the LE, and 20/26 mpg in the XLE, SE, Limited, and Limited Platinum trims. The most efficient Highlander is the Highlander Hybrid at 30/28 mpg for the LE Plus trim and 29/27 mpg for the XLE, Limited and Limited Platinum trims.</p>

<p>Cargo space is 13.8 cubic feet behind the third row, 42.3 cubic feet behind the second row and up to 83.7 cubic feet behind the front seats on the LE and LE Plus models. The XLE, SE and Limited trims have slightly less maximum cargo space at 83.2 cubic feet and adding the panoramic sunroof drops capacity even more to 82.6 cubic feet. When properly equipped, the four-cylinder Highlander can tow up to 1,500 pounds while the V-6-powered ones can tow 5,000 pounds. The Highlander Hybrid can only tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base Highlander <strong>LE</strong> trim includes 18-inch alloy wheels, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, cloth upholstery, 50/40 split-folding second- and third-row seats, keyless entry, five USB ports, Toyota’s Entune infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity and a rearview camera. The Highlander <strong>LE Plus</strong> grade adds a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, tri-zone climate control, power adjustable front seats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Jump up to the Highlander <strong>XLE</strong> trim and you get navigation, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a sunroof and keyless start. The Highlander <strong>SE</strong> trim features similar equipment as the XLE but adds sporty design cues like black leather upholstery with contrast stitching, a unique suspension tune and 19-inch alloy wheels finished in black.</p>

<p>Move up to Highlander <strong>Limited</strong> trim and it adds perforated leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, second-row captain’s chairs, a JBL premium audio system, 19-inch chrome-look alloy wheels, and LED accent strips on the headlights. The range-topping Highlander <strong>Limited Platinum</strong> gets a panoramic sunroof, dark chrome look 19-inch alloy wheels, a 360-degree view camera system, a heated steering wheel, and heated second-row seats. Second-row captain’s chairs are also available on the XLE trim while the rear-seat entertainment system is available on all but the LE and LE Plus models.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Highlander received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS hasn’t tested the 2018 Highlander but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and Acceptable on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Highlander received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the impact of a 25-mph impact by 24 mph (Superior is the highest possible rating on the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Toyota Highlander received the IIHS’ Top Safety Pick+ rating.</p>

<p>Standard on all 2018 Highlanders is Toyota Safety Sense-P, which bundles together forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available only on the XLE, SE, Limited and Limited Platinum trims.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2017/2017-toyota-highlander-se-awd-first-test/">2017 First Test</a>, we said that the SE trim’s sportier suspension tuning produces a harsher ride than in other variants with minimal improvements to handling. Throttle response wasn’t as responsive, as the eight-speed automatic always wanted to upshift to the highest gear and had a tendency to shuffle between gears even while cruising. Off pavement, the Highlander performed well and was able to handle dirt without getting bogged down too much.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2016/2017-gmc-acadia-2016-mazda-cx-9-2017-toyota-highlander-comparison/">2016 comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/acadia/2018/">GMC Acadia</a> and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-9/2018/">Mazda CX-9</a>, the Highlander placed second thanks to its powerful V-6 engine and roomy second row. The third row, however, isn’t comfortable for adults on a long drive, and some cheap materials scattered throughout the cabin kept it from getting the win.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>Two of the Toyota Highlander’s powertrain choices are shared with the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/rx/2018/">Lexus RX</a> crossover.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/">2018 Toyota Camry</a> Hybrid is all-new and features a new exterior design, an updated infotainment system, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s super efficient hybrid system. The car also rides on the new TNGA platform that underpins the Prius and the C-HR, which features a new fully independent suspension design with control arm rear suspension at the rear.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/">Toyota Camry</a> Hybrid is the hybrid variant of the Camry midsize sedan and it comes exclusively in a front-drive configuration. In terms of size, the Camry Hybrid slots above the more compact Prius hatchback and the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid but below the larger Avalon sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry-hybrid/2018/">2018 Toyota Camry Hybrid</a> is powered by a new direct- and port-injected 2.5-liter I-4 that’s coupled to an electric motor, a lithium-ion or nickel metal hydride battery, and a CVT. Combined power output is 208 hp. EPA fuel economy ratings are 51/53 mpg city/highway in the base LE trim, which comes equipped with the lithium-ion battery, and 44/47 mpg on the SE and XLE grades, both of which use the nickel metal hydride battery.</p>

<p>Thanks to the TNGA platform, the Camry Hybrid’s batteries are now positioned under the rear seats, which means it now has the same 15.1-cubic-foot trunk as the gas-only variants and it can be expanded 60/40 split-folding rear seats. The gas-only Camry’s base L trim has the least cargo space at 14.1 cubic feet and doesn’t come with split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>The base Camry Hybrid <strong>LE</strong> trim comes with LED headlights, 16-inch steel wheels, dual-zone climate control, Toyota’s Entune infotainment system, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, a six-speaker audio system, a USB port, a rearview camera, cloth upholstery, 60/40 split-folding rear seats,  keyless entry/start, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control and a 4.2-inch multi-information display. Move up to the Camry Hybrid <strong>SE</strong> trim and you get 18-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, a rear spoiler and a Sport mode for the drive mode selector. The range-topping Camry Hybrid <strong>XLE</strong> trim gets a 7.0-inch multi-information display, leather upholstery, adjustable rear headrests, a 10-inch head-up display, two extra USB ports, and a chrome-tipped exhaust. Options include a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, a JBL premium audio system, a wireless phone charger, a 360-degree view camera system, and adaptive headlights.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Like its gas-only sibling, the entire 2018 Camry Hybrid lineup comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense-P, which bundles together forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert comes standard on the XLE grade or as part of an optional package in the LE and SE trim. The XLE trim also gets rear automatic emergency braking as standard equipment.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/2018-toyota-camry-first-drive-review/">2018 First Drive review</a>, we said that the new Camry’s handling is much improved offers composed handling and a comfortable ride thanks to the new chassis. Steering, however, is light and doesn’t have much feel. The cabin is well-insulated thanks to generous amounts of sound deadening. Visibility is excellent thanks to the wide windows and low belt line. Toyota’s updated infotainment system is user-friendly but doesn’t come with support for Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.</p>

<p>Although the car doesn’t have as much power as the available V-6 engine, the Camry Hybrid still offers plenty of power, especially in Sport mode when the electric motor adds extra power. The CVT does a convincing job imitating gears in Sport mode with its quick upshifts; however, when you downshift, it doesn’t cause the car to decelerate much.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Camry Hybrid is the first to utilize the electrified version of Toyota’s Dynamic Force 2.5-liter I-4, which has a thermal efficiency of 41 percent in hybrid applications.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4/2018/">Toyota RAV4</a> Hybrid slots below the larger three-row Highlander Hybrid and comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid/2018/">2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid</a>’s powertrain system combines a 2.5-liter I-4, three electric motors, a nickel metal hydride battery, and a CVT. Combined output is 194 hp, making it more powerful than the gas-only RAV4, which has 176 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque. EPA fuel economy ratings for all variants are 34/30 mpg city/highway, making the RAV4 Hybrid one of the most efficient compact crossovers available. Despite the added hybrid powertrain components, cargo space is still generous at 35.6 cubic feet behind the split-folding second row and 70.6 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard features on the hybrid model’s base XLE trim include 17-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s Entune infotainment system, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, cloth upholstery, and keyless entry/start. The SE trim adds LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, a power driver’s seat, and heated front seats. On the range-topping Limited trim, additional standard features include parking sensors, a height-adjustable power liftgate, a larger 7.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, and driver’s seat memory. A 360-degree camera system and a JBL premium audio system are optional on the SE and Limited trims. The higher end multimedia systems are available as part of optional packages on the XLE and SE grades.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 RAV4 Hybrid a five-star overall safety score (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 RAV4 Hybrid but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crash worthiness tests and Average on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the RAV4 Hybrid received a Superior rating after it avoided 12-mph and 25-mph collisions (Superior is the highest possible score in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the IIHS gave the RAV4 Hybrid the 2017 Top Safety Pick+ award.</p>

<p>Standard on all 2018 RAV4 Hybrids is Toyota Safety-Sense-P, which bundles together automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high beams. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is standard on the SE and Limited trims and part of an optional package for the base XLE grade.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4/2016/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-first-drive-review/">2016 First Drive</a> review, we noted that the RAV4 Hybrid features a vastly improved interior with higher quality materials and surprisingly punchy acceleration. The hybrid system also has a seamless interplay between the gas engine and electric motors, making it more refined on the road. We also said in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid/2016/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a> that despite the additional components of the hybrid powertrain, the cargo area remains spacious and family friendly, making the RAV4 Hybrid an excellent choice for hauling gear and people. The RAV4 Hybrid’s brakes are a standout since they transition smoothly from regenerative to mechanical braking.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2018/">2018 Toyota Corolla</a> iM carries over unchanged.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2018/">Toyota Corolla</a> iM is a compact front-drive four-door hatchback that slots above the subcompact Yaris.</p>

<p>Available as a single well-equipped trim, the 2018 Corolla iM comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, a chrome exhaust tip, LED daytime running lights, automatic headlights, dual-zone climate control, keyless entry, a rearview camera, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a six-speaker Pioneer audio system, a USB port, Bluetooth, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>

<p>Navigation is available as an option. There are a number of accessories available in the 2018 Corolla iM that includes a roof spoiler and TRD goods such as a performance air filter.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla-im/2018/">2018 Toyota Corolla iM</a> is powered by a 1.8-liter I-4 rated at 137 hp and 126 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual gearbox comes standard and a CVT is optional. EPA fuel economy estimates are 27/35 mpg city/highway with the manual and 28/36 mpg with the CVT.</p>

<p>The 2018 Corolla iM hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA. In IIHS testing, the 2018 Corolla iM has only been evaluated for side and moderate overlap front impact tests where it received a Good score (Good is the highest possible rating).</p>

<p>The hatchback’s front crash prevention features haven’t been tested yet but the IIHS gave the 2018 Corolla iM a Basic rating for front crash prevention for its standard forward collision warning system (Superior is the highest rating for front crash prevention). <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Safety Sense-C comes standard on the 2018 Corolla iM and it bundles together automatic high beams, lane departure warning and the Pre-Collision System, which bundles together forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.</p>

<p>There’s 20.8 cubic feet of cargo space and can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2016-scion-im-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we noted that the Corolla iM isn’t very quick, especially with a CVT. Even in Sport mode, which improves throttle response, the throttle response is better but the car is no quicker. The Corolla iM’s four-wheel independent suspension gives it a comfortable ride, making it a good car for commuting. Passenger space is generous up front and in the rear. The Corolla iM has a dated multimedia system and isn’t available with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>

<p>In other global markets, the Corolla iM is also called the Toyota Auris.</p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">2018 Toyota Prius</a> C gets <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Safety Sense-C, a rearview camera, black roof rails and black body cladding with silver accents as standard.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">Toyota Prius</a> C is a subcompact hybrid hatchback that slots below the standard Prius hatchback and comes in four trims.</p>

<p><strong>Prius C One:</strong> The base One trim comes with 15-inch alloy wheels, black roof rails and body cladding, LED headlights, a rearview camera, cloth upholstery, a 3.5-inch instrument cluster display, keyless entry, four-way adjustable front seats, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, a four-speaker audio system, a USB port, and automatic climate control.</p>

<p><strong>Prius C Two:</strong> Moving up to the Two trim adds cruise control, six-way adjustable driver’s seat, and a six-speaker audio system.</p>

<p><strong>Prius C Three:</strong> Building on the Prius C Two, the Three grade adds navigation and keyless entry and star as standard.</p>

<p><strong>Prius C Four:</strong> The range-topping Four model gets leatherette upholstery, heated front seats, leatherette-wrapped steering wheel, fog lights, heated side mirrors, and a moonroof.</p>

<p>The moonroof is available on the Three trim as an option and the Four grade can be had with 16-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>The 2018 Prius C is powered by a hybrid system that couples a 1.5-liter I-4 with an electric motor, a CVT and a nickel metal-hydride battery. Total system output is 99 hp and the car is EPA-rated at 48/43 mpg city/highway.</p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Prius C received a four-star overall rating (out of a possible four stars). In IIHS testing, the 2018 Prius C got a Good score on all but the driver’s side front small overlap test where it got an Acceptable rating (Good is the highest possible score). The 2018 Prius C hasn’t been crash tested for the passenger side front small overlap crash.</p>

<p>Toyota Safety Sense-C comes standard on the 2018 Prius C, which features lane departure warning and the Pre-Collision System that bundles together automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning.</p>

<p>The 2018 Prius C has 17.1 cubic feet of cargo space that can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius-c/2014/2014-toyota-prius-c-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>, we said that the Prius C’s acceleration is extremely sluggish and noted that the cabin is small. The car’s turning radius does increase when you opt for the optional 16-inch alloy wheels but the standard 15-inch units hurt its handling. Ride comfort also takes a hit with the 16-inch wheels.</p>

<p>Like the fourth-generation Prius, the smaller Prius C’s battery is placed under the rear seats to keep it from decreasing the car’s overall cargo capacity.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/avalon/2018/">2018 Toyota Avalon</a> is unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/avalon/2018/">Toyota Avalon</a> is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s flagship front-drive full-size sedan slotting above the midsize Camry. In addition to the gas-only model, the Avalon is also available as a hybrid.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Avalon is available with two powertrain choices, a 3.5-liter V-6 with 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque paired to a six-speed automatic transmission or a hybrid system that couples a 2.5-liter I-4 to an electric motor, a CVT, and a nickel metal hydride battery for a total output of 200 hp. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 are 21/30 mpg city/highway for the V-6 and 40/39 mpg for the hybrid. Trunk space in the gas-only Avalon is generous at 16 cubic feet, but the Avalon Hybrid only has 14 cubic feet due to extra powertrain components taking up space. Neither variant of the Avalon has split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base Avalon XLE trim include 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth connectivity, a multi-information display in between the gauges, keyless entry/start, a rearview camera, and Toyota’s Entune infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen. Higher trims can be had with navigation, a JBL premium audio system, perforated leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a wireless phone charger, three-zone climate control, HID headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, and a moonroof.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Avalon received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 Avalon but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and Acceptable on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Avalon received a Superior score after it avoided a 12-mph and 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest possible score for the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Toyota Avalon received the Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Toyota Safety Sense-P comes standard on all Avalon models. The safety tech package includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, and automatic emergency braking. Blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is available on all trims except the XLE and XLE Plus.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/taurus/2013/the-big-test-2013-2014-full-size-sedans/">2013 comparison test</a>, the Toyota Avalon placed third out of five cars thanks to its generous interior space, especially in the rear seats. However, interior material quality wasn’t as impressive and its ride wasn’t as composed and had a tendency to crash over bumps. The cabin also gets noisy over rough surfaces.</p>

<p>The hybrid variant offers strong acceleration and with the smaller 17-inch alloy wheels, features a ride that’s more buttoned down and composed, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2014-toyota-avalon-limited-hybrid-first-test/">2014 First Test.</a></p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Toyota Avalon features the same powertrain choices as the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/es/2018/">Lexus ES</a>.</p>

<p>The refreshed <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tundra/2018/">2018 Toyota Tundra</a> receives a slightly revised front fascia with a new grille and a new TRD Sport trim that comes with a hood scoop, 20-inch alloy wheels, a mesh grille, a TRD shift knob, TRD Sport floor mats, Bilstein shocks, and TRD front and rear anti-roll bars. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s Safety Sense-P suite of active safety features now comes standard on all 2018 Tundra models.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tundra/2018/">Toyota Tundra</a> is a full-size truck that slots above the midsize Tacoma and is available in three cab styles, two bed lengths, and in either rear- or four-wheel-drive configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Tundra including a 4.6-liter V-8 rated at 310 hp and 327 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7-liter V-8 with 381 hp and 401 lb-ft. A six-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox available. The EPA hasn’t released fuel economy ratings for the 2018 Tundra, but the 2017 model was rated at 15/19 mpg city/highway for rear-drive trucks with the base 4.6-liter V-8 or 14/18 mpg with four-wheel drive. The more powerful 5.7-liter unit was rated at 13/18 mpg for rear-drive models and 13/17 mpg with four-wheel drive equipped.</p>

<p>Depending on the cab style, bed length, engine and drivetrain, the 2018 Tundra can haul between 1,440 to 2,080 pounds of payload. When properly equipped, the truck has a towing capacity of 6,400 to 10,500 pounds depending on body style, drivetrain, engine and bed length.</p>

<p>Standard and available features include LED taillights, Bluetooth connectivity, Toyota’s Entune infotainment system, leather upholstery, alloy wheels up to 20 inches in diameter, a rearview camera, and a multi-information display in between the gauges.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 Toyota Tundra. The outgoing 2017 Tundra received a four-star overall safety score from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). In IIHS evaluations, the extended cab variant received a Good score on all crash tests except the front small overlap test where in received a Marginal rating (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>Standard on all models is the Toyota Safety Sense-P suite of active safety features, which includes forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure alert, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tundra/2015/2015-ram-1500-rebel-4x4-hemi-vs-2015-toyota-tundra-trd-pro-comparison/">2015 comparison test</a> against the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ram/1500/2018/">Ram 1500</a> Rebel, the Toyota Tundra TRD Pro won because it offered a comfortable ride and superior off-road capability all in one package. However, in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/tundra/2014/2014-toyota-tundra-1794-edition-crewmax-4x4-first-test/">2014 First Test</a>, we noted that the Tundra’s interior lacks insulation with plenty of exterior noise entering the cabin. Front seat comfort is also lacking as the seats are hard, flat, and lacking lateral support. Rear seat accommodations, on the other hand, proved generous and the available 5.7-liter V-8 has plenty of power on tap.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The base 4.6-liter V-8 in the 2018 Tundra is also used in the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/lexus/gx/2018/">Lexus GX</a> 460.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/86/2018/">2018 Toyota 86</a> gets a second trim level with more standard equipment—the new trim is similar to the 860 Edition from last year except for the stripes and the Supernova exterior color.</p>

<p>Formerly the Scion FR-S, the 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/86/2018/">Toyota 86</a> is a rear-drive sports coupe that <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> co-developed with <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/">Subaru</a>.</p>

<p>The base trim comes with a leather-wrapped steering wheel, six-way driver’s seats, a four-way adjustable front seats, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, cloth upholstery with suede-like inserts, keyless entry, a USB port, 17-inch alloy wheels, full LED headlights and an eight-speaker Pioneer audio system.</p>

<p>Higher-trim models get goodies like heated front seats, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, a rear spoiler, keyless start, fog lights and dual-zone climate control. Navigation is optional. A host of TRD accessories are also available for the 2018 86 including an exhaust system, cold air intake, air filter, lowering springs, 18-inch alloy wheels with staggered tires, and short shifter kit.</p>

<p>The 2018 86 is powered by a 2.0-liter flat-four rated at 205 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque with the standard six-speed manual transmission or 200 hp and 151 lb-ft with the optional six-speed automatic. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 86 are 21/28 mpg city/highway with the manual or 24/32 mpg with the automatic.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Toyota 86 a four-star frontal crash and five-star rollover rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 86 but the 2017 model received a Good score on all but the driver’s side front small overlap impact where it received an Acceptable rating and the passenger side small overlap where it hasn’t been tested yet (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>The 2018 86 has 6.9 cubic feet of trunk space and can be expanded via the standard folding rear seats.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/86/2017/2017-toyota-86-860-edition-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a>, we were impressed with the 86’s exceptional handling prowess thanks to its impeccably tuned chassis and precise steering. The standard six-speed manual transmission is easy to operate with its short, precise throws and a clutch with an engagement point that’s easy to find. However, there’s not much torque under 4,000 rpm, meaning you have to rev it high to get any power out of the engine.</p>

<p>Inside, there are hard plastics everywhere and the infotainment system is dated and slow to respond. Although it technically seats four, the small rear seats in the Toyota 86 are best used as an extension of the small trunk. Comfort is also a weak point because the 86’s stiff chassis means the car has a harsh ride over rough pavement.</p>

<p>The Toyota 86’s engine is a Subaru-designed flat-four equipped with Toyota’s D-4S direct- and port injection system.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4/2018/">2018 Toyota RAV4</a> gets a new special-edition model called the RAV4 Adventure, which comes with the Tow Prep package, a higher ride height, 18-inch alloy wheels, lower body guards, black headlight bezels and fog light surrounds, a 120V power outlet in the cargo area, all-weather floor mats, special interior trim panels, and a leather-wrapped shift knob.</p>

<p>Additional new features for the 2018 RAV4 include a heated steering wheel, and optional heated and power operated front seats on lower-trim models with cloth upholstery.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4/2018/">Toyota RAV4</a> is a compact crossover that slots below the larger, three-row Highlander and the above the new subcompact C-HR. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. In addition to the gas-only model, the RAV4 is also available as a hybrid with all-wheel drive as standard.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>A 2.5-liter I-4 rated at 176 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque is the base engine in the 2018 RAV4 and it’s paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic transmission. The RAV4 Hybrid takes the 2.5-liter I-4 and pairs it to three electric motors for a total output of 194 hp and swaps the six-speed automatic in favor of a CVT. EPA fuel economy ratings for the 2018 RAV4 haven’t been released but the 2017 model was rated at 23/30 mpg city/highway for the front-drive LE and XLE, or 23/29 for the SE and Limited grades. Opting for all-wheel drive drops those numbers down to 22/28 mpg. The RAV4 Hybrid is the most fuel efficient at 34/30 mpg despite having the most power and all-wheel drive.</p>

<p>When properly equipped, the 2018 RAV4 can tow up to 1,500 pounds while the RAV4 Hybrid can haul 1,750 pounds. Cargo space is massive inside the RAV4 with 38.4 cubic feet behind the split-folding rear seats and 73.4 cubic feet behind the front seats. The RAV4 Hybrid has 2.8 cubic feet less cargo space across the board due to the additional powertrain components, checking in at 35.6 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 70.6 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard and available features include Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s Entune infotainment system with a 6.1- or 7.0-inch touchscreen, a sunroof, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, a programmable power tailgate, LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, a 360-degree view camera system, a 4.2-inch multi-information display in between the gauges, and leatherette upholstery. Unique to the SE trim is a sport-tuned suspension that slightly improves the RAV4’s handling.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash tested the 2018 RAV4 but the outgoing 2017 model earned high marks. It received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars) and the Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS after it scored Good on all crash tests, Superior on the front crash prevention test for avoiding a 12- and 25-mph collision, and an Acceptable in the new headlight safety test (Good is the highest possible score).</p>

<p>Starting from the 2017 model year, the Toyota RAV4 comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense-P, a suite of active safety and driver assistance features that include automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2016/small-crossover-comparison-big-test/">2016 comparison test</a> that included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/tucson/2018/">Hyundai Tucson</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/cr-v/2018/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mazda/cx-5/2018/">Mazda CX-5</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/forester/2018/">Subaru Forester</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/escape/2018/">Ford Escape</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/rogue/2018/">Nissan Rogue</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/kia/sportage/2018/">Kia Sportage</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jeep/cherokee/2018/">Jeep Cherokee</a>, the Toyota RAV4 placed fifth. The crossover was praised for its spacious interior but the fit and finish lags behind its competitors due to the excessive amounts of low-quality materials. Handling also proved to be another RAV4 weak spot and we found the steering to be numb.</p>

<p>The RAV4 Hybrid, on the other hand, is a better package, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid/2016/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>, thanks to its smooth powertrain and well-calibrated brakes that smoothly transition between regenerative and mechanical braking. However, since it isn’t a plug-in hybrid, the RAV4 Hybrid doesn’t have much EV mode range and can only travel around 0.5 miles on electricity.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The SE is the only RAV4 trim level that can be had with a cool two-tone exterior color scheme.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2018/">2018 Toyota Corolla</a> adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel for the SE and XLE trims. All models get an illuminated sunvisors for the driver and front passenger. The Corolla iM hatchback models carry over unchanged for the 2018 model year.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2018/">Toyota Corolla</a> is a front-drive compact car that slots below the midsize Camry and above the subcompact Yaris. In addition to the sedan, the 2018 Corolla is also available as a hatchback called the <strong>Corolla iM</strong> (formerly the Scion iM), which comes as a single well-equipped package.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> Corolla is powered by a 1.8-liter I-4 with 132 hp and 128 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired to a six-speed manual transmission or a CVT. In the Corolla Eco, that engine makes 140 hp and 126 lb-ft but it only comes with the CVT. The Corolla iM uses the same engine as the Corolla Eco sedan but rated slightly lower at 137 hp and 126 lb-ft. In the Corolla iM hatch, the engine can be paired to a six-speed manual or a CVT.</p>

<p>EPA fuel economy ratings are 27/35 mpg city/highway for manual-equipped Corolla sedans and the Corolla iM hatchback, and 28/36 mpg with the CVT. The Corolla Eco is the most efficient at 29/38 mpg with the 16-inch alloy wheels or 30/40 mpg with the 15-inch steel wheels. The Corolla sedan has a 13-cubic-foot trunk that can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats. For additional practicality, the Corolla iM features 20.8 cubic feet behind the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>Standard features on the 2018 Corolla sedan include 60/40 split-folding rear seats, a USB port, a rearview, Bluetooth connectivity, Toyota’s Entune infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, LED headlights, 15-inch steel wheels, and cloth upholstery. Higher trims can be had with alloy wheels up to 17 inches in diameter, a moonroof, multi-beam LED headlights, leatherette upholstery, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, keyless entry/start, heated front seats, and navigation with a 7.0-inch touchscreen.</p>

<p>The Corolla iM hatchback comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, dual-zone climate control, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a six-speaker Pioneer audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, and a USB port. Navigation is optional along with a number of visual accessories.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Corolla sedan a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 model but the 2017 Corolla received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and Acceptable on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Corolla received a Superior rating after it avoided a 12-mph and a 25-mph collision (Superior is the highest possible score in the front crash prevention test). As a result, the Toyota Corolla sedan received the Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS. The Corolla iM hasn’t been crash tested by the NHTSA and IIHS.</p>

<p>Every 2018 Corolla sedan comes with standardToyota Safety Sense-P, which bundles together adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high beams. The Corolla iM comes with Toyota Safety Sense-C, which only comes with forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and automatic high beams.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2017/2017-toyota-corolla-first-drive-review/">2017 First Drive</a> review, we said that during panic stops, the brakes don’t inspire much confidence and that its acceleration is sluggish. Interior space, on the other hand, is generous with plenty of rear-seat space and we appreciated that the car comes standard with advanced safety features.</p>

<p>The Corolla iM hatchback offers a more comfortable ride thanks to its independent rear suspension. However, we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2016-scion-im-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a> that it’s also slow because it still uses the same engine from the Corolla sedan. Cabin insulation is surprisingly good, with minimal noise entering the cabin. Like the Corolla sedan, the Corolla iM has a roomy cabin with plenty of space for all passengers and the hatch makes it even more practical.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Toyota Corolla’s 1.8-liter I-4 was originally introduced in the 10th generation model when it debuted for the 2008 model year.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/land-cruiser/2018/">2018 Toyota Land Cruiser</a> gets a standalone rear-seat entertainment system option.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/land-cruiser/2018/">Toyota Land Cruiser</a> is the range-topping four-wheel-drive SUV from <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a> that slots above the full-size Sequoia. The Land Cruiser comes as a single fully loaded package with only one option, and the nameplate traces back to Toyota’s start in the U.S. decades ago.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser is powered by a 5.7-liter V-8 with 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy ratings are 13/18 mpg city/highway. When properly equipped, the 2018 Land Cruiser can tow up to 8,100 pounds. Cargo space is respectable for a three-row SUV with 16.1 cubic feet behind the third row, 43 cubic feet behind the second row, and 81.7 cubic feet behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Standard features on the 2018 Land Cruiser include Toyota’s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension, Crawl Control, the Multi-Terrain Select System, full LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, four-zone climate control, a wireless phone charger, heated and ventilated power adjustable front seats, heated second-row seats that split 40/20/40, 50/50 split-folding third row, leather upholstery, keyless entry/start, a JBL premium audio system, Toyota’s Entune infotainment system with navigation and a 9.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, a rearview camera, and front- and side-mounted cameras. The rear-seat entertainment system is the only option available.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>Toyota Safety Sense-P is standard on all 2018 Land Cruisers. The package includes automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, and automatic emergency braking. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert also come standard on the 2018 Land Cruiser.</p>

The SUV’s interior is also quiet and well-insulated; however, the brakes are touchy and the transmission is tuned for fuel economy. The interior, compared to the pre-facelift car, now has better quality materials and the 5.7-liter V-8 never feels like its struggling, as we noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/land-cruiser/2016/2016-toyota-land-cruiser-first-test-review/">2016 First Test</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">2018 Toyota Highlander</a> Hybrid is unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2018/">Toyota Highlander</a> is currently the only mainstream hybrid three-row crossover available and it comes standard with all-wheel drive. There’s seating for up to eight passengers in the LE and XLE grades; however, the Limited only seats seven because it features second row captain’s chairs instead of a bench setup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>On the 2018 Highlander Hybrid, a 3.5-liter V-6 is coupled to three electric motors, a nickel metal hydride battery, and a CVT. Total system output is 306 hp, making the Highlander Hybrid one of the most powerful mainstream three-row midsize crossovers available. EPA fuel economy ratings are 30/28 mpg city/highway for the LE trim and 29/27 mpg for the XLE and Limited grades. Despite the additional components of the hybrid powertrain, the Highlander Hybrid still offers plenty of cargo space at 13.8 cubic feet behind the third row, 42.3 cubic feet behind the second row, and 83.7 cubic feet behind the front seats. When properly equipped, the Highlander Hybrid can tow up to 3,500 pounds.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base Highlander Hybrid <strong>LE</strong> trim include 18-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s Entune infotainment system, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, a 4.2-inch multi-information display, cloth upholstery, keyless entry/start, five USB ports, and Bluetooth connectivity. The Highlander Hybrid <strong>XLE</strong> trim adds a height adjustable power liftgate, a sunroof, tri-zone climate control, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, navigation, leather upholstery, heated front seats, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.</p>

<p>The range-topping Highlander Hybrid <strong>Limited</strong> trim comes with 19-inch alloy wheels, a JBL premium audio system, heated and ventilated front seats, blue LED interior ambient lighting, and a tonneau cover for the cargo area. Optional on the Limited trim is the <strong>Platinum</strong> package that adds a heated steering wheel, heated second-row captain’s chairs, and a 360-degree view camera system.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander-hybrid/2018/">2018 Toyota Highlander Hybrid</a> received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 Highlander Hybrid but the 2017 model received a Good score on all crash worthiness tests and Average on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2017 model received a Superior rating after in avoided a 12-mph collision and reduced the speed of a 25-mph impact by 24 mph (Superior is the highest rating for the front crash prevention test). As a result, the IIHS awarded the Highlander Hybrid the Top Safety Pick+ award.</p>

<p>Toyota Safety Sense-P comes standard on all Highlander Hybrid models and it bundles together adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high beams. Blind-spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on the XLE and Limited trims and unavailable on the base LE grade.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We’ve yet to review a 2018 Highlander Hybrid but on our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/highlander/2014/2014-toyota-highlander-35-fwd-hybrid-awd-first-test/">First Test of the pre-refresh model</a>, we noted that the hybrid variant was slower than the gas-only Highlander in a straight line. We also found it hard to keep the Highlander Hybrid in EV mode without causing the gas engine to kick in. Lower trims feature lower-quality plastics throughout the cabin, but higher grade models have better quality materials, making it feel more premium. The third row is best used for short trips as it’s not very comfortable for adults.</p>

<p>The Prius Prime does not receive any significant changes for the new model year.</p>

<p>The four-passenger Prius Prime is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/">Toyota</a>’s only plug-in vehicle and the most expensive model in the Prius family that also includes the Prius C, Prius liftback, and Prius V wagon.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Prius Prime Plus</strong>: The Prime comes standard with 15-inch alloy wheels, quad-LED projector headlights, LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, charge port with illumination and charge indicator light, a 7.0-inch center display with Entune Premium Audio with navigation and SiriusXM satellite radio, a 4.2-inch instrument panel driver’s display, remote climate control, a six-way manually adjustable driver’s seat (four-way for passenger), heated front seats, quick entry with push-start ignition, and the Toyota Safety Sense P package of driver assist safety features.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Prius Prime Premium</strong>: Moving up to the Premium adds automatic headlights, a charging cable lock, a large 11.6-inch center display (same Entune system), SoftTex-trimmed (synthetic leather) seats, eight-way power driver’s seat, and a wireless charging pad.</p>

<p><strong>2018 Prius Prime Advanced</strong>: Building off the Premium trim, the top Advanced trim adds LED fog lights and accents lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, Entune Premium JBL Audio with Prime Apps and a 10-speaker JBL GreenEdge audio system, a heated steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, Safety Connect remote vehicle assistance, a color head-up display, a self-parking system, front and rear parking sensor with automatic reverse braking, and blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">2018 Toyota Prius</a> Prime’s hybrid powertrain consists of a 95-hp, 105-lb-ft of torque 1.8-liter I-4 engine paired to two electric motors for a total system output of 121 hp. A CVT routes power to the front wheels. The Prius Prime delivers an EPA-rated (2017 figures) 55/53 mpg city/highway when in hybrid mode and can travel up to 25 miles on all-electric power (133 mpg-e combined). The Prime has a long driving range of 640 miles based on 45-percent highway and 55-percent city driving. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius/2018/">Toyota Prius</a> Prime hit 60 mpg in a slow 10.0 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in 125 feet.</p>

<p>The NHTSA did not evaluate the Prime model, but the regular 2018 Prius liftback received the highest overall rating of five stars. The 2018 Prius Prime is considered a 2018 Top Safety Pick from the IIHS for receiving the highest rating of Good in all conducted crash tests, the second-highest rating of Acceptable for the headlights evaluation, and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention test by avoiding 12- and 25-mph frontal collisions thanks to the automatic emergency braking feature with pedestrian detection found in the standard Toyota Safety Sense P package of driver assist safety features. Safety Sense P also includes lane departure alert with steering assist, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius-prime/2018/">2018 Toyota Prius Prime</a> offers up to 19.8 cubic feet of cargo space under its hatch, almost doubling the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/volt/2018/">Chevrolet Volt</a>’s 10.6 cubic feet. The regular Prius liftback holds between 24.6 and 27.4 cubic feet of cargo. Front and rear legroom is 43.2 inches and 33.4 inches, respectively, the same as the traditional Prius.</p>

<p>Standard tech found in the Prime Plus includes Entune Premium Audio with navigation displayed on a 7.0-inch center screen, SiriusXM satellite radio, and Siri Eyes Free. In the Premium trim, the screen is upgraded to 11.6 inches and a wireless phone charging pad is added. The top Entune Premium JBL Audio system found in the Advanced trim adds Prime Apps (on top of the App Suite) and a 10-speaker JBL GreenEdge audio system. The Advanced trim also adds a color head-up display, a self-parking system, front and rear parking sensors, and blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross traffic alert on top of the standard Safety Sense P package. With the standard remote climate control system, passengers can check and adjust the Prime’s temperature and with Prime Apps, passengers can find their vehicle, find a charging station, see the battery’s charge status, and much more. Safety Connect offers emergency assistance, stolen vehicle locator, roadside assistance, and automatic collision notification.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/prius-prime/2017/2017-toyota-prius-prime-first-drive-review/">First Drive</a> review of the 2017 Prius Prime, we like the longer all-electric driving range versus the outgoing Prius plug-in. The Prime provides decent handling dynamics, quick initial acceleration, and a better ride than the standard Prius. The rear seats only fit two passengers but offer plenty of space. Due to the larger battery, there is less cargo room, a hump of about one inch in the cargo floor, and an uneven load floor with the seatbacks down. We were impressed with the optional 11.6-inch center display, the carbon-fiber reinforced rear hatch, and Toyota’s standard Safety Sense P package.</p>

<p>We concluded by saying, “Toyota seems to have the ingredients for a good argument here. The Prime finally has (just) enough battery for most folks’ needs and provides a proper EV experience—with it all backed up by the world’s most popular hybrid mode.”</p>

<p>In a comparison <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/bolt-ev/2017/hyundai-ioniq-hybrid-vs-toyota-prius-chevrolet-volt-vs-prius-prime-bolt-ev-vs-ioniq-ev-vs-honda-clarity-vs-mirai/">between the Prius Prime and Chevrolet Volt</a>, we liked that if you floor the Prime in EV mode, the engine will not turn on until you hit 84 mph. The larger battery pack adds weight to the rear and that can be felt when cornering and can make the Prius heave over road undulations. “So despite the Prius Prime’s peculiarities (the recorded piano accompaniment to ingress and egress sounds like the sappy soundtrack to a daytime soap opera), its usability, packaging, acceptable EV range, and much better hybrid-mode mileage give it the edge,” we concluded.</p>

A performance variant called the Jetta GLI is also available for those seeking a spicier compact sedan.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Three turbocharged four-cylinder engines are available in the 2018 Jetta. The base S and SE trims comes with a 1.4-liter unit with 150 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque that can be paired to a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. On the Sport and SEL trims, the Jetta gets a 1.8-liter with 170 hp and 184 lb-ft that’s coupled exclusively to a six-speed automatic. At the top of the range is the Jetta GLI, which comes with a 2.0-liter unit with 210 hp and 207 lb-ft paired to either a six-speed manual or six-speed dual-clutch automatic. There’s 15.7 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk and it can be expanded via the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats.</p>

<p>The base S trim comes with 15-inch steel wheels, Bluetooth connectivity, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, LED daytime running lights, a 5.0-inch touchscreen, a rearview camera, a USB port, and cloth upholstery. The SE trim adds keyless entry/start, leatherette upholstery, blind spot warning, heated front seats, leatherette upholstery, 16-inch alloy wheels, and a sunroof.

The Jetta GLI comes with similar features as the SEL trim but it doesn’t have any driver assistance features other than blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Jetta received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 Jetta but a 2017 model received a Good score on all crash tests and Acceptable in the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2018 Jetta received an Advanced rating after it reduced the impact of a 12-mph collision by 9 mph, but didn’t reduce speed at all in a 25-mph test (Superior is the highest rating for front crash prevention).</p>

<p>On higher trims, the 2018 Jetta comes with forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2222036&amp;action=edit">recent compact car comparison test</a> that also included the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2018/">Honda Civic</a>, Mazda3, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/elantra/2018/">Hyundai Elantra</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/cruze/2018/">Chevrolet Cruze</a>, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/corolla/2018/">Toyota Corolla</a>, and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/nissan/sentra/2018/">Nissan Sentra</a>, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> Jetta placed fifth in part because its interior didn’t feel as solid as other Volkswagen models.</p>

<p>We noted in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2016/2016-volkswagen-jetta-14t-first-test-review/">2016 First Test </a>that the new base 1.4-liter turbo-four in the Jetta offers plenty of torque for strong acceleration; however, there’s plenty of road noise entering the cabin and the ride isn’t very comfortable at low speeds. Handling, on the other hand, is respectable, as the Jetta stays composed on turns and the steering is responsive.</p>

<p>As we wrote in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2015/2015-volkswagen-jetta-first-drive/">2015 First Drive</a>, the optional 170-hp 1.8-liter turbo-four offers plenty of power on tap and the six-speed automatic shifts smartly. Despite its age, the Jetta’s infotainment system is easy to use and there’s plenty of space for front and rear passengers in the cabin.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Jetta is the first vehicle in the U.S. to use Volkswagen’s new 1.4-liter turbo-four.</p>

A new 2.0-liter turbo-four replaces the old 1.8-liter turbo-four as the new base engine.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/passat/2018/">Volkswagen Passat</a> is a front-drive midsize sedan that slots above the compact Jetta and below the upcoming, near-luxury Arteon.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Passat including a 2.0-liter turbo-four that is estimated to have 174 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque or a 3.6-liter V-6 with 280 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard on the base 2.0-liter turbo-four while the V-6 comes with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. EPA fuel economy ratings are 25/36 mpg city/highway for the four-cylinder and 20/28 mpg with the V-6.

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> Passat received a five-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). Although the IIHS has yet to test the 2018 model, the 2017 Passat received a Good score on all crash tests and Poor on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the 2017 Passat received an Advanced rating after it avoided a 12-mph collision but didn’t reduce the speed at all in a 25 mph test (Superior is the highest rating for front crash prevention). As a result, it was able to get the Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS.</p>

<p>Standard on all 2018 Passats is forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Higher trim levels can be had with blind-spot warning, lane keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and parking assist.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We’ve yet to review the 2018 Passat with the new 2.0-liter base engine but in a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/passat/2016/2016-volkswagen-passat-review/">2016 First Test</a>, we noted that the Passat’s interior is spacious and has user-friendly center stack controls. Handling is respectable for its size but it falls slightly short of sportier entries such as the Mazda6. On the road, there’s minimal road and wind noise, making the Passat’s cabin a nice place to be. As for the exterior styling, even after 2016-model-year updates, its exterior design is still on the conservative side in its segment.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The current-generation Volkswagen Passat was the first vehicle to roll out of Volkswagen’s Chattanooga, Tennessee assembly plant.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>We haven’t yet driven a production 2018 Volkswagen Atlas, but we did have the opportunity to <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2018-volkswagen-b-suv-first-drive-big-hitter/">drive a pre-production mule before the Atlas name was announced</a>. About that prototype, we said it felt “big and substantial.”</p>

<p>“A broad, flat hood stretches way out ahead,” we wrote, “announcing to all (especially the owner) that this ain’t no minivan derivative. You can’t see the ground right in front of the vehicle, but a 360-degree around-view camera system helps when maneuvering in tight quarters. In highway mode, the VR6 accelerated the B up to gravel-road speeds with reasonable authority—at least with two people aboard.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/golf/2018/">2018 Volkswagen Golf</a> GTI has been refreshed with an updated exterior design, a new multimedia system with a larger touchscreen, and more power on the base trim. The high-performance Golf R also gets new standard features including <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a>’s Digital Cockpit and an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic replacing the six-speed unit.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/golf/2018/">Volkswagen Golf</a> GTI is the performance-focused variant of the Golf hatchback and slots above the less potent standard model. In addition to the front-drive <strong>GTI</strong>, the <strong>Golf R</strong> model has more power and comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Golf GTI’s 2.0-liter turbo-four is rated at 220 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, and can be paired to a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed dual-clutch automatic. A 2.0-liter turbo-four also powers the 2018 Golf R but is rated at 292 hp and 280 lb-ft. Transmission choices for the Golf R include a standard six-speed manual or a new-to-the-model seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.</p>

<p>The EPA hasn’t rated the 2018 Golf GTI for fuel economy yet but the 2017 model was rated at 24/34 mpg city/highway with the manual and 24/32 mpg with the automatic. The more powerful Golf R is rated at 21/29 mpg with the manual and 22/29 mpg with the automatic. Thanks to their hatchback body style, the 2018 Golf GTI and Golf R can double as small family cars with 22.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the standard 60/40 split-folding rear seats and that can be expanded to a generous 52.7 cubic feet with the second row folded.</p>

<p>Standard features on the base S trim include LED taillights, a 6.5-inch touchscreen, automatic high beams, auto engine stop/start (with the automatic only), 18-inch alloy wheels, plaid cloth upholstery, LED fog lights, as well as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration. The SE trim adds a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, full LED headlights and keyless entry/start. Additional standard features on the Autobahn trim include navigation, Dynamic Chassis Control, 12-way power driver’s seat, a panoramic sunroof, adaptive cruise control, and a Fender premium audio system.</p>

<p>The Golf R comes standard with features like Volkswagen’s Digital Cockpit, full LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry/start, heated front seats, a 12-way power driver’s seat, and leather upholstery. Move up to the DCC with Navigation trim and the Golf R gets 19-inch alloy wheels, adaptive cruise control, a Fender premium audio system, navigation, blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane keeping assist, high beam assist, Dynamic Chassis Control, and automatic parking assist.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The NHTSA gave the 2018 Golf GTI and Golf R a five-star overall safety rating (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test the 2018 Golf GTI but a 2017 model received a Good score on all crashworthiness tests and a Poor score on the headlights test (Good is the highest possible score). In the front crash prevention test, the Golf GTI only received an Advanced rating after it reduced the impact speed of a 12-mph collision by 10 mph and a 25-mph impact by 1 mph (Superior is the highest possible score for the front crash prevention test).</p>

<p>On the SE trim and higher, the Golf GTI comes standard with automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, blind-spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Adaptive cruise control is only available on the range-topping Autobahn trim where it comes standard. The Driver Assistance package on the Autobahn trim adds lane keeping assist, automatic park assist, and high beam assist. The Golf R is also available with the same active safety features as the GTI but they’re exclusive to models equipped with Dynamic Chassis Control and navigation where they come standard.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Although we haven’t tested the 2018 Golf GTI, we have reviewed the pre-refresh model. In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/gti/2015/comparison-four-fun-sporty-runabouts-under-30000/">2014 comparison test</a> that also included the Mini Hardtop Cooper S, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/subaru/wrx/2018/">Subaru WRX</a>, and the previous generation <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2018/">Honda Civic</a> Si, the Volkswagen Golf GTI won thanks to its blend of daily drivability and performance. At the track, the Golf GTI proved to be an excellent companion thanks to its sporty chassis and a stability control system that wasn’t very intrusive. Despite its excellent handling, the Golf GTI doesn’t have a rough ride and is surprisingly comfortable as a daily driver. Overall, the car feels more expensive than it actually is.</p>

<p>The more powerful Golf R won a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/golf/2015/2015-subaru-wrx-sti-vs-2015-volkswagen-golf-r/">2015 comparison test</a> against the WRX STI because that pre-refresh model takes the GTI formula up a notch but doesn’t come at the cost of daily drivability. At the track, however, the Golf R understeers too much when pushed to its limit. Out on public roads, the Golf R shined because it felt composed and stable thanks to its solid chassis.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The original Volkswagen Golf GTI arguably invented the hot hatch segment when it first debuted in the mid-1970s; however, the U.S. market didn’t get the Golf GTI until the second-generation model arrived in the 1980s.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Beetle coupe received a four-star rating in the front crash and rollover tests from the NHTSA (out of a possible five stars). The IIHS has yet to test a 2018 Beetle but a 2017 model received a Good rating on all but the small overlap crash where it got a Marginal score (Good is the highest possible score). On higher trims, the Beetle can be had with rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot warning.</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/beetle/2017/2017-volkswagen-beetle-dune-convertible-first-test-review/">2017 First Test</a> of the Beetle Dune, we noted that it rides stiffer than expected and doesn’t stay as composed as other Beetles over poor surfaces. On the road, the Beetle Dune isn’t very sporty due to its vague steering. There’s also plenty of road noise on the convertible variant regardless of whether you have the roof up or down. Design inside and out gives the Dune more character, and its multimedia controls are easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Beetle is one of the first cars to utilize the newest version of <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a>’s 2.0-liter turbo-four.</p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The T8 plug-in hybrid eAWD model is now available, and the base T5 trim can now be had with all-wheel drive (AWD). Starting with the 2018 model year, <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/">Volvo</a> adds 4.5 inches to the wheelbase on all models, and the T5 AWD and T6 AWD models now come standard with a panoramic moonroof, blind-spot warning with rear-cross traffic alert, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and retractable sideview mirrors. The Inscription model adds a tailored dashboard and upper door panels, power-operated sun curtains for the rear and rear side windows, and optional 20-inch eight-spoke silver alloy wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The S90 is Volvo’s flagship sedan positioned ablvd the S60 sedan. With the exception of the V90, the S90 has the highest starting price of the brand’s entire lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The base T5 model comes standard with a 250-hp, 258-ft-lb 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine that delivers an EPA-rated 24/34 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 23/32 mpg with AWD. The T6 comes standard with AWD and sports a 2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged I-4 that cracks out 316 hp and 295 ft-lb of torque and comes rated at 22/31 mpg. The range-topping T8 plug-in hybrid model (AWD) packs the above engine paired to an electric motor for a total system output of 400 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque and delivers 26/33 mpg and can drive up to 21 miles on all-electric energy. In<em> Motor Trend </em>testing, the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s90/2017/">2017 Volvo S90</a> T6 hit 60 mph in a quick 5.6 seconds.</p>

<p>The 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s90/2018/">Volvo S90</a> comes standard with a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear shift knob, leather upholstery, 10-way power front driver’s seat, a 9.0-inch center display, an 8.0-inch digital driver’s display, a panoramic moonroof, 18-inch wheels, and LED headlights with Thor’s Hammer daytime running lights. For additional features, opt for the Convenience package to receive heated washer nozzles, a 360-degree view camera system, Park Assist Pilot, and a power-operated trunk lid. The Luxury package will add a Nubuck headliner, ventilated and heated rear seats, front massaging seats, and a deluxe rear sear center armrest.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The Volvo S90 is considered an IIHS 2017 Top Safety Pick because the sedan received the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention for properly warning a driver of a possible collision and avoiding both a 12 mph and 25 mph frontal collision thanks to the standard City Safety automatic emergency braking system. The 2018 S90 also comes standard with many driver assist safety features including rear parking sensors, Pilot Assist (semi-autonomous drive system) with adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind-spot warning with rear-cross traffic alert, road sign information, front emergency braking, after collision automatic braking, driver alert control (drowdy driver assist), and a rear collision alert system.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s90/2017/2017-volvo-s90-t5-first-test-review-e300-530i-alternative/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Volvo S90 T5, we said the car isn’t sporty and has a fussy infotainment system, but “if you’ve ever ventured beyond a <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> or <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/bmw/">BMW</a> dealership for a midsize luxury car, the Volvo S90 should interest you. The car is different yet still premium, and it is a value compared to top-tier luxury brands as a base model or loaded car. Despite its faults, the S90 is worth consideration whether you don’t mind the lack of a three-pointed star or blue-and-white badge on the hood or if that’s the very reason Volvo is on your list at all.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s90/2017/volvo-s90-t6-cadillac-ct6-20t-mercedes-benz-e300-luxury-sedan-comparison/">three-way, turbocharged 2.0-liter premium sedan comparison</a>, the Volvo S90 T6 was the winner, topping both the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/ct6/2018/">Cadillac CT6</a> 2.0T and the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes</a>-Benz E300 Sport. We said, “The price further elevates the Volvo’s standing in this comparison, as this nearly loaded S90 undercuts the Mercedes and <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> by three to four grand. For its few faults, the Volvo S90 is the Goldilocks of the three: It’s not the outright sportiest, nor is it the roomiest, but its properly luxurious, the best to drive, and the best at driving itself. The Volvo S90, quite simply, is 2.0-liter luxury done right.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Volvo S90 utilizes a multi-link rear suspension with a transverse leaf-spring, a very uncommon type of suspension set-up, especially for premium sedans.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors:</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Minor updates for the new model year include an available power adjustable passenger seat for the base V60 (the feature is already standard on other trims), as well as heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The V60 is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/">Volvo</a>’s entry-level wagon that shares the same platform as the S60 sedan and slots below the larger and more expensive V90 wagon. Expect a redesigned V60 wagon in the next couple years.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v60/2018/">2018 Volvo V60</a> T5 base model is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 that produces 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque and comes with an EPA rating of 25/36 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 22/33 mpg with all-wheel drive (AWD). The <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v60-cross-country/2017/2017-volvo-v60-cross-country-t5-awd-first-drive-review/"><strong>Cross Country model</strong></a> (a raised model with 7.9 inches of ground clearance) comes standard with AWD and exclusively uses that T5 engine to deliver 22/30 mpg.</p>

<p>If you stick with the more traditional non-Cross-Country model, upgrading to the T6 will result in AWD and the more powerful 2.0-liter supercharged and turbocharged I-4 that churns out 302 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque and comes rated at 22/32 mpg. The high-performance <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v60/2017/2017-volvo-v60-polestar-first-test-review/">Polestar model</a> packs the same engine but tuned to produce 362 hp and 347 lb-ft of torque and with 20/27 mpg ratings. In <em>Motor Trend</em> testing, the 2017 V60 Polestar hit 60 mph in a quick 4.8 seconds and stopped from 60 mph in an impressive 105 feet.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v60/2018/">Volvo V60</a> comes standard with HID headlights with LED daytime running lights, leather upholstery, eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, illuminated gearshift knob, interior aluminum trim, glass moonroof, an R-design grille, 18-inch diamond-cut wheels, and Sensus Connect. For additional luxury opt for the Navigation/Audio package that includes Sensus Navigation and a Harman Kardon premium audio system or the Sport package that consists of a sport-tuned chassis, power steering personalization, paddle shifters, and 19-inch black alloy wheels. The V60 Polestar comes standard with Polestar exterior and interior trim and badging, six-piston Brembo brakes, Ohlins shock absorbers, 20-inch Polestar exclusive wheels with performance summer tires, carbon fiber rear view mirror covers, and a carbon fiber front splitter.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The Volvo V60 is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick+, the IIHS’ highest designation, for receiving the highest score of Good in all five crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention for properly warning the driver of a possible collision, avoiding a 12 mph collision, and reducing the speed of a 25 mph collision by 16 mph thanks to the optional Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection found in the Technology package. When equipped with the standard City Safety feature, the wagon received the rating of Advanced for avoiding a 12 mph collision and reducing the speed of a 25 mph collision by 2 mph, but did not warn the driver. Additional safety features found in the Technology package are adaptive cruise control, active high beams, lane keep assist, Driver Alert Control (sleepy driver alert), Distance Alert, and road sign information. Blind Spot Information System, rear cross-traffic alert, and a rear view camera with rear parking sensors are found in the Vision package. Active bending lights are standard.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v60/2017/2017-volvo-v60-polestar-first-test-review/">First Test review</a> of the 2017 Volvo V60 Polestar, we liked the wagon’s immediate and quick acceleration and the snarly engine note. Handling prowess has improved over the outgoing inline-six engine model and the new eight-speed transmission is eager to downshift but the wagon still likes to understeer as it did before. The ride is good considering the stiffer suspension and the seats are very comfortable but the infotainment system is outdated. “That said, it doesn’t get more special than the Volvo V60 Polestar, especially in our tester’s eye-catching Rebel Blue Metallic paint. And with the next-generation V60 just around the corner, we’re hopeful Volvo will continue to supply us with our fix of fast and fun wagons.”</p>

<p>After <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v60/2015/2015-volvo-v60-t5-drive-e-long-term-verdict-review/">one year with our long-term 2015 V60 T5</a>, we had few complaints that included an annoying auto start/stop feature and hard sport seats and said, “Although I may not be Volvo’s quintessential customer—I have no kids or pets—the Volvo V60 T5 Drive-E quickly became one of my favorite vehicles I’ve had the pleasure of driving in the past few years. The combination of performance, styling, comfort, and safety make this sweet wagon one I would consider purchasing with my own money if I had the $45,625 to spare. We’re sad to see it go, and look forward to the next chance to drive such a fun sporty wagon.”</p>

<p>Many of Volvo’s competitors have dropped out of the wagon segment, and that gives the V60 an advantage. In sedan form, the S60 felt dated and placed last in <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-bmw-330i-audi-a4-mercedes-benz-c300-cadillac-ats-jaguar-xe-lexus-is-200t-volvo-s60-comparison/#399-lease-deal-special-front-end-in-motion">a 2017 large test of compact luxury sport sedans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>The Polestar model utilizes MacPherson strut suspension front and rear, versus the standard V60’s more traditional multi-link set-up.</p>

<p><strong>Key Competitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>The V90 Cross Country is now available in the base T5 trim along with a Plus package. <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/">Volvo</a> also added a new Denim Blue exterior color and a Maroon Brown interior color.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The V90 is Volvo’s flagship wagon that is also available in the raised all-wheel drive Cross Country model. Positioned above the smaller V60 wagon, the V90 has a higher starting price than the S90 and XC90.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>A 250-hp, 258-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 powers the base T5 model, including the front-wheel drive regular wagon (EPA-rated 24/34 mpg city/highway) and the Cross Country version (23/31 mpg). The T6 models are powered by a 2.0-liter supercharged and turbocharged I-4 that produces 316 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque and delivers 22/31 mpg in the regular V90 wagon (standard AWD for the T6) and 22/29 mpg in the Cross country. Volvo claims that the V90 T5 can hit 60 mph in 6.7 seconds while the T6 can do it in 5.8 seconds.</p>

<p>The V90 comes standard with many features including an R-design grille, 19-inch Matte Black diamond cut wheels, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a panoramic moonroof, LED headlights and fog lights, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, interior ambient lighting, 10-way power driver’s seat, front sport seats, a Charcoal headliner, an R-Design leather steering wheel and gearshift knob, illuminated door sills, a drive mode selector, a 9.0-inch center display with Sensus Connect and Sensus navigation, and a sport-tuned suspension. For additional features, opt for the Convenience package and receive a 360-degree surround view camera system, Park Assist Pilot (self-parking system), grocery bag holder, Homelink, rear view mirror compass, and heated washer nozzles. The Heated Seats/Heated Steering Wheel package includes exactly that. The Luxury package consists of power-adjustable front seats (including side bolsters and cushion extension), fully color-coordinated door sills and bumpers, massaging front seats, perforated Nappa leather, power cargo cover, four-zone climate control with glove box cooling, heated rear seats, rear side sun curtains, and tailored dashboard and upper door panels.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v90/2018/">Volvo V90</a> has yet to be crash tested but the IIHS did evaluate the S90 (the sedan on which the V90 is based) and the sedan is considered a 2017 Top Safety Pick for receiving the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for the front crash prevention evaluation thanks to the standard City Safety system that is also standard in the V90. The City Safety crash mitigation system properly warned the driver of a possible collision and avoided a collision in 12 and 25 mph tests. The V90 comes standard with many driver assist safety features including Blind Spot Information System with Cross Traffic Alert, lane keep assist, Pilot Assist semi-autonomous drive system with adaptive cruise control, road sign information, rear parking sensors, emergency brake assist, and Collision Mitigation Support, a feature that will steer the vehicle away from an oncoming collision.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v90/2017/2017-volvo-v90-cross-country-t6-awd-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v90/2017/">2017 Volvo V90</a> Cross Country, we liked how the optional air suspension soaked up rough road conditions and the four drive modes. We also enjoyed how the Pilot Assist semi-autonomous system works and the Sensus infotainment system.</p>

<p>We loved the interior of the Volvo V90 wagon in our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/v90/2018/2018-volvo-v90-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> and said, “The interior is spectacular, an unmistakably Swedish take on luxury without the smorgasbord of clichés. With the rear seats upright, the V90 will swallow 19.8 cubic feet of stuff; with the seats folded flat, capacity balloons to 53.9 cubic feet.”</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of precision and grip through the turns,” we said, “so it can be hustled along a winding two-lane deceptively quickly. But this big Volvo is not trying to be a sports car; its transient responses are deliberate, measured. The V90 is a roomy, comfortable, practical, enjoyable wagon. It’s Volvo doing what Volvo has long done best, just more stylishly and luxuriously so.”</p>

<p><strong>Cool Fact</strong></p>

<p>When compared to the V90 wagon, Volvo made over 200 tweaks to the Cross Country’s chassis in order to properly handle off-road excursions.</p>

New safety features include Oncoming Lane Mitigation, which is designed to prevent head-on collisions.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>Although we haven’t driven the 2018 XC60 yet, we have high hopes, considering the XC90 was <a href="//www.motortrend.com/news/2016-volvo-xc90-is-the-motor-trend-suv-of-the-year/">our 2016 <em>Motor Trend</em> SUV of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/xc90/2016/2016-volvo-xc90-first-drive/">First Drive review</a> of the 2016 Volvo XC90, aside from vague steering feel and strange braking feel on the XC90 T8 hybrid, we liked the crossover and said: “This new 2016 Volvo XC90 really is a worthy successor to the name. Like the original, it advances the brand’s design markedly, it introduces all-new technology to the industry, it drives and performs well, and it comes at just the right time for the brand. It’s not wildly charismatic like some sporty crossovers and SUVs but rather like an old friend that’s always there for you, even before you know you need them.”</p>

<p>In our <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/xc90/2016/2016-volvo-xc90-t6-inscription-first-test/">First Test review</a> of the 2016 Volvo XC90, we liked the interior and exterior styling of the crossover, the high quality and luxurious interior, and the long list of safety features. The twin-charged engine provides brisk acceleration and the optional air suspension is very comfortable and offers six modes. “The 2016 Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription performs as well as its direct competitors, earns better fuel economy, and still comes to the table at or below their prices (base and loaded).”</p>

<p>The Volvo XC90 was the 2016 Motor Trend SUV of the Year.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>New for 2018</strong></p>

<p>Minor changes for the new model year include the addition of optional heated front seats and steering wheel and an available power front seat. Expect a redesigned S60 for the 2019 or 2020 model year.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Summary </strong></p>

<p>The S60 is <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/">Volvo</a>’s entry-level vehicle, the smallest and most affordable sedan in the automaker’s lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s60/2018/">2018 Volvo S60</a> sedan comes standard with a 240-hp, 258-lb-ft of torque 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 engine (T5) that routes power to the front wheels (EPA-rated 25/36 mpg city/highway) or to an all-wheel drive (AWD) system (22/33 mpg). The <strong>raised Cross Country model</strong> utilizes the same engine with AWD as standard and delivers 22/30 mpg. The available 2.0-liter supercharged and turbocharged I-4 power plant (T6) produces 302 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque and is only paired to an AWD system delivering 22/32 mpg. The <strong>range-topping Polestar model</strong> is only available with AWD and is rated at 20/27 mpg. In Motor Trend testing, the 2017 S60 T6 AWD (Platinum) hit 60 mph in a quick 5.2 seconds and broke from 60 mph in an impressive 111 feet.</p>

<p>The base 2018 <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s60/2018/">Volvo S60</a> T5 Dynamic comes standard with LED daytime running lights, leather upholstery, leather wrapped steering wheel, interior ambient lighting, eight-way power driver’s seat, milled aluminum interior trim, remote engine start, 18-inch Tucan Diamond Cut wheels, and a powered glass moonroof. Available features include an R-Design steering wheel and gearshift knob, sport pedals, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system, powered front passenger seat, digital instrument cluster, Sensus Connect with navigation, 19-inch Ixion alloy wheels, and a sport-tuned chassis. The rang-topping, high-performance S60 Polestar comes standard with exclusive 20-inch Polestar wheels with performance summer tires, Brembo six-piston front brakes, Polestar Ohlins shocks, a Polestar carbon fiber front splitter, Polestar carbon fiber rearview mirror covers, Polestar rear spoiler, Polestar sport leather upholstery, heated front and rear seats, and a Polestar grille and badging.</p>

<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>

<p>The 2018 S60 received a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA (the highest possible rating). The IIHS considers the S60 to be a 2017 Top Safety Pick+, the highest designation, because the Volvo received the highest rating of Good in all five crash tests and the highest rating of Superior for front crash prevention. In testing, the S60 managed to properly warn the driver of a possible collision, avoided a 12-mph collision, and reduced the impact of a 25-mph impact by 14 mph thanks to the optional Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection driver assist safety feature found in the Technology Package. The standard City Safety automatic braking system was issued the second highest rating of Advanced because the system was only able to reduce the impact of a 25-mph impact by 2 mph but still avoided the 12-mph collision. Active bending HID lights are also standard. Other driver assist safety features are found in the Technology package and include adaptive cruise control, active high beams, Driver Alert Control (drowsy driver alert), lane keep assist, road sign information, and distance alert (front collision alert). The Vision package adds blind spot assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking sensors.</p>

<p><strong>What We Think</strong></p>

<p>In an <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-bmw-330i-audi-a4-mercedes-benz-c300-cadillac-ats-jaguar-xe-lexus-is-200t-volvo-s60-comparison/">eight-way Big Test comparison</a> of premium sedans, the Volvo S60 T6 came in last place. We commended the sedan on its high safety scores and comfortable seats but felt the S60 has become very outdated and said, “Far and away the oldest car in the test, it was outclassed at nearly every turn. Thoughtful updates have kept it on life support, but a new engine is no substitute for the comprehensive updates needed to make the S60 truly competitive, and the all-new car can’t come soon enough.” “Stylish and safe, the Volvo can’t escape its long-past sell-by date. It’s an old car in a hyper-competitive class, and it just can’t keep up anymore.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="//www.motortrend.com/cars/volvo/s60/2017/2017-volvo-s60-v60-polestar-first-drive-review/">First Drive review</a> of the 2017 Volvo S60 and V60 Polestar, we said, “The updated Polestars are better than the cars they replace. That much is certain. However, please remember that they aren’t aimed squarely at the top dogs from the Big German Three.” “Compared to the S4, 340i M Sport, and C43 (previously known as the C450 AMG Sport), the S60 and V60 Polestars are quite compelling. The biggest demerit against the Swedes would be the frankly outdated navigation and entertainment system.”</p>
