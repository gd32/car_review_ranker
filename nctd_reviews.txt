[<p>The Jeep Wrangler is all-new for 2018, slightly larger, roomier, more refined, yet with improved off-road capability. The 2018 Wrangler comes in two-door and four-door Unlimited models.</p>, <p>Jeep is a brand name that has been expanded to cover five (soon to be six) different nameplates, but for serious off-road enthusiasts only one vehicle really merits that hallowed badge and this is it. Though it’s been refined and mechanically enhanced over the decades, the Jeep Wrangler continues to embody the rugged go-anywhere can-do spirit of the original, a vehicle General George C. Marshall characterized as America’s greatest contribution to World War II. (Greatest technical contribution, that is. General Marshall did not discount the millions of men and women who served in the armed forces from 1941 through 1945.)</p>, <p>How much does the latest Wrangler resemble the ones that rolled ashore at Normandy in 1944? Well, there are those seven vertical grille vents, which have persisted over the decades with all Jeeps, great and small. And like the Willys original, the Wrangler is a body-on-frame design: the body joins the chassis late in the assembly process.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56122" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-unlimited.jpg" width="200"/>No other Jeep meets that description. All are unitbodies, i.e., the body shell and frame rails are unitized. The same applies to all Jeep competitors. The advantage of unitbody construction is higher chassis rigidity and lower curb weight.</p>, <p>The advantage of body-on-frame is its ability to take a beating in rough going. Which is what this Jeep is all about.</p>, <p>Without a side-by-side comparison, previous generation and new, it would take a real Jeep expert to see the difference. Not surprising. The Wrangler is a sacred property, revered by many thousands of owners, and the design team trifles with its basics at their peril. Remember the firestorm that greeted the square headlights of the 1986 model?</p>, <p>So the new Wrangler looks very much like its predecessor: squarish fenders, rectilinear styling, removable doors, removable windshield, side curtains, rear mounted spare.</p>, <p>But there are many differences. For one, this is a slightly bigger Wrangler on a longer, sturdier wheelbase. And while bigger, it’s also fractionally lighter. A new 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine option. Increased off-road capability. More ground clearance for the Rubicon model. More interior room. More comfort. Enhanced infotainment and connectivity.</p>, <p>And an irony. While the two-door Wrangler continues to be the most iconic of all Jeeps, with the closest ties to the WW II, the four-door version is the best seller, to the tune of 80 to 85 percent of Wrangler sales.</p>, <p>There are four Wrangler trim levels: Sport, Sport S, Sahara, and Rubicon.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56121" height="138" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-rear.jpg" width="200"/>As noted, to a casual observer, the new Wrangler is all but indistinguishable from its predecessor. But there are many, and to Jeep cognoscenti some, at least, will be immediately apparent.</p>, <p>For example, not only is the new windshield easier to remove, its angle is less upright, improving the Wrangler’s aerodynamics. That seven-slot grille is more upright in its lower two-thirds, then cants rearward in the upper third. The headlights are closer to the grille The tailgate-mounted spare tire mount is a little lower, and the rearview camera sits at the center of the mount.</p>, <p>Also, though not visible to the naked eye, the tailgate is composed of magnesium, with an aluminum skin, part of the Wrangler’s weight reduction. Similarly, the hood, doors, and fenders are aluminum.</p>, <p>The soft top on the classic two-door is easier to remove, and the soft top version of the four-door Sahara is power operable, a Wrangler first.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56119" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Comfort isn’t the first word that comes to mind with a vehicle such as the Wrangler, but it’s an attribute that’s an appreciated part of the new Wrangler’s persona. It’s partly attributable to increased room, particularly in the rear seat, partly to improved materials. Interior noise levels are surprisingly civilized on paved roads, and of course there’s up-to-date infotainment and connectivity with Chrysler’s Uconnect system and available 8.4-inch touch screen.</p>, <p>The latest Wrangler has no luxury pretenses, but the product planners reason that rugged off-road creds and contemporary comfort aren’t mutually exclusive concepts.</p>, <p>The Wrangler’s aluminum hood shelters Jeep’s tried-and-true 3.0-liter V6 engine (285 horsepower, 260 pound-feet of torque), updated with a higher compression ratio, stop-start technology, and improved EPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city, 23 highway, paired with a new eight-speed automatic transmission, replacing the previous five-speed.</p>, <p>The new automatic is optional with the V6 engine; an equally new Aisin six-speed manual is standard.</p>, <p>As noted, a new turbocharged eTorque 2.0-liter four joins the Wrangler powertrain inventory. Rated for 270 hp and 295 lb-ft, the new turbo four also has an motor generator that provides an electric assist feature, making it a sort of mild hybrid.</p>, <p>The new eTorque 2.0-liter will be paired only with the eight-speed automatic.</p>, <p>As you’d expect, the Wrangler offers a number of off-road features: two four-wheel drive systems, more robust Dana axles front and rear, locking front and rear differentials, a taller wheel/tire package (32 inches versus the previous 31-inch tire), as well as a vast catalogue of Jeep Performance and Mopar goodies.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56118" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-wrangler-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The most surprising element of the new Wrangler’s public road performance is smooth ride quality. This is true on pavement, and, more impressively, on graded dirt with stretches of nasty washboard.</p>, <p>Similarly, the cabin is reasonably quiet in most situations, although some wind noise begins to intrude at freeway speeds. Design enhancements may improve the Wrangler’s progress through the air, but aerodynamic efficiency it not this vehicle’s strong suit. It’s still essentially a brick, and still punches a good-sized hole in the air.</p>, <p>Other small demerits: acceleration with the V6 engine is unhurried; weight reduction notwithstanding, the new Wrangler is still pretty chunky for a vehicle of its size. The two-door is just 166.8 inches long, the four-door is 188.4, but curb weights range from just under two tons to over 4300 pounds, according to Jeep.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter turbo’s abundant torque yields a little more off-the-line enthusiasm, but acceleration nosebleeds are not a Wrangler concern.</p>, <p>On the plus side, the eight-speed automatic is a smooth operator. And Wrangler faithful will be pleased that this rugged individualist retains a manual transmission option.</p>, <p>Good marks on regular roads, which is where a lot of Wranglers spend most of their time.</p>, <p>But where the Wrangler continues to upstage every other vehicle with off-road pretensions is, yes, off road. Part of the experience at the Wrangler press introduction, near Tucson, included driving a Wrangler Rubicon up a slope consisting of small to medium-size boulders that didn’t even vaguely resemble a trail.</p>, <p>It was a slope that would have been difficult to climb on foot. But Like the Little Engine that Could, the Wrangler chuffed and snorted and marched up the hill, skid plates scraping, occasionally teetering on two wheels, sometimes with just one wheel delivering traction.</p>, <p>This is the environment that makes the Wrangler special.</p>, <p>There are Wranglers that never leave pavement, and of all the Jeeps this one makes an automotive fashion statement that’s hard to ignore. But where it excels is where the pavement ends. There are Land Rovers that can tackle the rough stuff, but for the money the Wrangler has no peers.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-volvo-v90/
[<p>Introduced for 2018, Volvo V90 is the brand’s latest premium wagon, sharing engines, structure and features with the S90 sedan and XC90 crossover. It’s the longest and largest wagon currently sold in the U.S.</p>, <p>The 2018 Volvo V90 is part of a chain of V-series wagons that go back a long way with Volvo, usually related to S sedans with similar or identical powertrains and features.</p>, <p>2018 V90 wagons come in a range of models, including Cross Country models that sit taller and are capable of modest off-highway duty.</p>, <p>Two distinct engine choices are offered. In T5 models, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder develops 250 horsepower. T6 models adopt a 316-horsepower version of that four-cylinder engine, which is both turbocharged and supercharged. Each engine mates with an 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>V90 wagons come in several trim levels: R-Design and Inscription, in addition to a base model and an Ocean Race Edition. The latter commemorates Volvo’s connection to maritime racing.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard on the base T5 model. T6 versions and Cross Country wagons come only with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>More flamboyantly designed and sporty-looking than most wagons, V90s demonstrate clean Scandinavian elegance. V90 Cross Country models have higher ground clearance and can be fitted with lower-body cladding that provides a more rugged appearance.</p>, <p>No crash-test data has been released by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. However, the latter agency gave the related S90 sedan several Good scores, plus Superior frontal crash prevention, though headlights were deemed problematic.</p>, <p>Advanced safety technology has long been a Volvo hallmark, which continues with the V90. Standard safety features include blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision prevention, and adaptive cruise control. Volvo’s City Safety object-detection system can now warn of large animals ahead.</p>, <p>An updated version of Volvo’s semi-autonomous driving system, introduced on the 2016 XC90 crossover, is standard on V90 wagons. Pilot Assist allows the wagon to accelerate, slow down, and come to a halt on its own. The wagon can also steer itself between highway lane markings, and detect road edges. The driver cannot take his or her hands off the steering wheel for more than about 15 seconds at a time.</p>, <p>V90 Cross Country wagons can be found and purchased at Volvo dealerships in the usual way. For regular V90 wagons, Volvo turned to a pre-order procedure, shipping a vehicle only after the purchase has been completed.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56110" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v90-2.jpg" width="200"/>V90 T5 R-Design FWD ($49,950) comes with the 250-horsepower engine, leather seat trim, a panoramic moonroof, 12.3-inch touchscreen, blind-spot information system, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, collision mitigation, 19-inch wheels, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and navigation. T5 Inscription FWD ($51,950) adds such features as a hands-free tailgate and sunshades. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>T6 R-Design AWD ($55,950) and T6 Inscription AWD ($57,950) include the 316-hp engine.</p>, <p>T5 Cross Country AWD ($52,300) has taller ground clearance and rugged-look detailing, with the 250-horsepower engine. T6 Cross Country AWD ($56,100) substitutes the 316-horsepower engine. T6 Cross Country Ocean Race Edition AWD ($60,500) adds design elements to mark Volvo’s tie to maritime racing.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56113" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v90-rear.jpg" width="200"/>More than most automakers, Volvo still knows how to create a brilliant-styled wagon, without adding complexity. Bodysides manage to maintain a soft, organic appearance, while front- and rear-end elements suggest kinship to the company’s heritage. Hints of the celebrated P1800 sport coupe from the Sixties can even be discerned.</p>, <p>Distinctively complex LED lighting arrays flank the grille, ahead of a long hood. A blacked-out rear hatch emphasizes the tapering bodysides and the enticing roofline. Cross Country wagons differ primarily in plastic fender flares and modestly-elevated ride height.</p>, <p>Not only is the V90 roomy and commendably comfortable, its starkly simple cabin serves as a model of Scandinavian design. Some elements and attributes of the cleanly upright layout are shared with Volvo’s highly praised XC90 crossover.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56112" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v90-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v90-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v90-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Highlights include wood and metal detailing, a sublime infotainment screen, and a digital instrument cluster. Welcome levels of utility and flexibility blend with an overall sense of quality.</p>, <p>Seating excellence has been a Volvo tradition, and it’s immediately evident here. Front seats are impressively supportive and broadly adjustable, with long cushions. Back seats aren’t far behind, either, though door openings seem somewhat constricted for a full-size vehicle. Leather-trimmed seats are standard, with the prospect for upgrading to softer-yet upholstery.</p>, <p>Split rear seatbacks flip forward readily, creating a flat floor for the spacious cargo hold. However, the shape of the hatch restricts cargo-area height at the rear. An underfloor compartment permits additional small-item storage.</p>, <p>Active noise cancellation helps keep the cabin pleasantly quiet. Over choppy pavement, V90 riders are likely to notice more road noise than passengers in an S90 sedan.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56111" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v90-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Even though no version of the V90 qualifies as sincerely sporty, Volvo’s largest wagon promises a relaxing, upscale road experience. Quiet and comfortable, each wagon yields a soft ride, while virtually silencing the world outside. In doing so, the V90 strikes a balance between utility and performance.</p>, <p>Little pitching of the body occurs when traversing lumpy pavement and heaving surfaces. Again, the V90 reaches for the middle ground, promising and delivering a ride that’s well-controlled as well as providing a sense of plush motoring.</p>, <p>In T6 form, the V90 accelerates to 60 mpg in about 5.5 seconds – not quite startling, but ready to satisfy all but the most demanding drivers. With the 250-horsepower T5 engine, performing that feat approaches 7 seconds. Volvo’s smooth-shifting automatic transmission adds to the pleasure.</p>, <p>Even with the driving mode set to Dynamic, fitted with Volvo’s available air suspension, the T6 wagon feels rather softly sprung. Handling proves satisfying, as the V90 suspension behaves evenly as well as predictably. Accelerating out of a corner can be accomplished gracefully, with a feeling of finesse.</p>, <p>Fuel economy isn’t bad, considering vehicle size and weight. The V90 T5 is EPA-rated at 24/34 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers the estimate to 22/31/25 mpg. The all-wheel-drive T6 Cross Country is EPA-rated at 23/31 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>In its current corporate guise, Volvo may not quite warrant the all-out luxury status of some competitive premium-level automakers. Regardless, the new V90 wagon has plenty to offer in terms of style, generous feature content, and plenty of interior space. Each version is amply-equipped, infotainment systems excel, and numerous options are available. Cross Country variants stand a bit taller and look ready for action, but off-roading aspirations are relatively modest.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M.

[<p>The Volvo XC90 is a superb luxury sport-utility, and this second-generation model launched for the 2015 model year, is a major competitor in the premium crossover class thanks to high-level technology and sharp styling.</p>, <p>Little has changed for the 2018 model year, except for making Apple CarPlay and Android Auto standard. Four trim levels are offered: Momentum, R-Design, Inscription, and Excellence. The XC90 may be fitted with any of three turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines, including a plug-in hybrid.</p>, <p>The base T5 engine produces 250 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. In T6 models, a supercharger is added to the turbo configuration, resulting in output of 316 horsepower and 295 pound-feet.</p>, <p>In the T8 plug-in hybrid, a 10.4-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and electric motors team with the T6 gasoline engine, yielding 400-horsepower total system output. Not only is the T8 the most fuel-efficient version, it’s the swiftest.</p>, <p>Each engine mates with a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. Base T5 versions come with standard front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is standard on T6 and T8 editions, but optional for the T5.</p>, <p>Two- and three-row seating configurations are available. Rear occupants in the T8 Excellence get individual seats separated by a long console.</p>, <p>As expected from a brand long known for emphasis on safety, the XC90 has an impressive list of standard advanced safety features. Systems include blind-spot monitoring, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, road sign recognition, and rear collision mitigation. A rearview camera also is standard.</p>, <p>Each XC90 includes Pilot Assist II. This semi-autonomous system can operate the vehicle, steering lightly and braking, with no input from the driver beyond holding the steering wheel.</p>, <p>Crash-test scores have been superlative. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the XC90 five-star ratings overall and for both frontal and side impact. It earned a four-star score (typical of tall crossovers) for rollover protection, which is a calculated figure.</p>, <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it Good ratings for side-impact crashes, as well as both small and moderate frontal overlap incidents. Frontal crash protection was deemed Superior, if an appropriate option is installed, but headlights were rated Marginal.</p>, <p>T5 Momentum ($46,900) has front-wheel drive and includes a power tailgate, four-zone automatic climate control, power front seats, synthetic leather upholstery, and 18-inch wheels. A vertically-oriented 9.0-inch touchscreen includes navigation. Five- and seven-passenger cabins are offered.</p>, <p>T5 AWD Momentum ($49,100) includes all-wheel drive. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>T5 R-Design ($51,900) has a sportier look, including 20-inch wheels, a blacked-out grille, and heated front seats. Volvo offers five- and seven-passenger versions. T5 AWD R-Design ($54,100) substitutes all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>T6 AWD 7-Passenger Momentum ($54,350) comes with the supercharged/turbo engine, standard all-wheel drive, leather upholstery, and three-row seating. T6 AWD 7-Passenger R-Design ($57,950) is equipped similar to T5 R-Design, but with T6 engine. T6 AWD 7-Passenger Inscription ($59,450) adds a digital instrument cluster, wood interior surfaces, upgraded audio, Nappa leather upholstery, all-wheel drive, and active noise cancellation.</p>, <p>T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid 7-Passenger Momentum ($64,950) is equipped similar to regular Momentum, with plug-in hybrid powertrain. T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid 7-Passenger R-Design ($68,500) is equipped similar to regular R-Design. T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid 7-Passenger Inscription ($70,050) is equipped similar to T6 Inscription. T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid Excellence ($104,900) includes an air suspension, 21-inch wheels, premium Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio, heated/ventilated four-passenger seating, massaging function, a beverage cooler, crystal gearshift, head-up display, and panoramic moonroof.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56106" height="148" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xc90-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Beauty doesn’t have to be complex, as the XC90 demonstrates masterfully. Elegant, yet bold, simplicity is the secret.</p>, <p>Perhaps most notably, the crossover looks smaller than its actual dimensions predict, and far smaller than its hefty weight would suggest.</p>, <p>Wheels reach forcefully toward the corners. Positioning the engine farther back than usual gives the XC90 an extended nose, plus proportions that suggest rear-wheel drive rather than front-drive. Although the windshield is less steeply angled than some rivals, the tail end displays aerodynamic sculpting. Abundant glass translates to good outward visibility.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56105" height="142" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xc90-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Blending upscale traditional luxury with modern sensibility, the lovely XC90 cabin incorporates high-quality materials and luxury-level craftsmanship.</p>, <p>Front seats promise long-haul comfort, and just about anyone can find a suitable driving position. Adults fit well in the second row, though seats could use additional padding. Seats slide fore/aft to apportion leg clearance for second- and third-row passengers. Adults fit into the third row (if installed), but youngsters would be happier.</p>, <p>Most passengers get good views, helped by elevated “stadium-type” seating in back rows.</p>, <p>With second- and third-row seatbacks folded flat, cargo space totals 85.7 cubic feet. Volume dips to 41.8 cubic feet with the second row upright. With the third-row upright, space drops to 15.8 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Volvo’s Sensus infotainment system is among the most functional, dominated by a vertically-oriented 9.0-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56104" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xc90-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xc90-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xc90-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Power is sufficient with the base T5 powertrain, but without much surplus to propel weighing well over two tons. Torque output emerges at low engine speed, but eases as the revs rise. Passing can be hesitant, especially on mountain upgrades.</p>, <p>Though the stronger turbo/supercharged T6 engine is more complex, it’s quiet, capable, and largely refined. Performance leader is the T8 plug-in hybrid, which also is the thriftiest choice, as well as the most costly.</p>, <p>With any powertrain, the XC90 handles like a smaller car. Driver feedback from the electric power steering feels impressively natural. Body roll is limited, despite 9.3-inch ground clearance and a tall body.</p>, <p>Ride quality is comfortably quiet, whether the XC90 has base 18-inch tires or optional 22-inchers. Choosing an air suspension instead of the conventional setup doesn’t necessarily smooth the ride.</p>, <p>In most models, drivers can select Comfort, Eco, Dynamic, or Off Road mode – or elect a customized program. Each mode program controls shift points, throttle sensitivity, and steering heft. T8 drivers choose from Hybrid, Power, Pure, and Comfort modes.</p>, <p>Fuel economy exceeds expectations. T5 versions with all-wheel drive are EPA-rated at 22/28 mpg City/Highway, or 24 mpg Combined. Front-wheel drive raises the ratings slightly, to 22/29/25 mpg. T6 engines are EPA-rated at 20/27 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The T8 plug-in can now travel up to 19 miles on electricity alone. When the battery is depleted, it’s rated at 27 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Volvo offers quite a range of trim and powertrain choices for its XC90, helping to boost its competitive position. Comfortable and quiet-running, Volvo’s largest crossover is impressively equipped, even in Momentum trim, while priced well below many rival luxury models.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection.

[<p>The Volvo V60 is an upscale wagon available in a dizzying variety of versions that emphasize comfort or performance. Each has a distinctive personality. The V60 lineup includes sporty R-Design and Polestar models, a rugged Cross Country version, and the standard Dynamic model, practical and comfortable.</p>, <p>Closely related to the S60 sedan, the 2018 Volvo V60 wagon sees little change for the model year. A cold weather package has been made standard, including heated seats and steering wheel.</p>, <p>A redesigned V60 is expected to go on sale during 2018.</p>, <p>Once a staple of suburban family life, wagons have for years been disappearing, though Jaguar, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi have continued to introduce new models.</p>, <p>Available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, the Volvo V60 Dynamic holds a T5 turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 240 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. An 8-speed automatic transmission is standard on all V60 versions.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56100" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60cc-walk.jpg" width="200"/>The V60 Cross Country has a taller ride height and a chunkier appearance. It comes with the 240-horsepower engine. It’s sort of a cross between a wagon and a crossover.</p>, <p>Stepping up a notch, the V60 R-Design has a firmer suspension, bigger alloy wheels, and a turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter engine called the T6 that develops 302 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>The V60 Polestar is fitted with a racing-derived Ohlins suspension, making it the hottest compact luxury wagon on today’s market. In Polestar form, the turbo/supercharged 2.0-liter engine generates 362 horsepower and 347 pound-feet.</p>, <p>Volvo has long been known for its first-rate safety record. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet crash-tested a V60, but its S60 sedan mate earned top five-star ratings all around. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the V60 a Good rating for its small front overlap (driver’s side), and for the moderate front overlap crash. Front crash protection was deemed Superior, with certain optional equipment installed.</p>, <p>A rearview camera is optional rather than standard on the base Dynamic model. All versions include low-speed automatic emergency braking. Upper trim levels add full-speed automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, which are optional for Dynamic and Cross Country versions. Blind-spot monitoring is standard on upper trims, but part of the $1,950 Vision Package for Dynamic models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56095" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-final.jpg" width="200"/>V60 T5 Dynamic ($38,250) has front-drive and is well-equipped with leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, HID headlights, automatic emergency braking, and 18-inch alloy wheels. (Prices do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>T5 Dynamic AWD ($40,250) substitutes all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Cross Country ($41,850) is equipped similar to V60 Dynamic, with taller ride height.</p>, <p>Cross Country Platinum ($45,700) adds HID headlights, Harman Kardon audio, and full-speed automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>T6 R-Design Platinum AWD ($49,100) gets the more potent turbo/supercharged engine and all-wheel driving, along with a firmer suspension and 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Polestar AWD ($61,600) moves up to the 362-horsepower variant of the 2.0-liter turbo/supercharged engine.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56097" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Appropriately curved, the V60 is far removed from upright, boxy-profile wagons of the distant past. Essentially, Volvo has built upon the conventional S60 sedan’s shape, adding a sizable dose of utility that integrates nicely into the overall design.</p>, <p>Each V60 version has a look of its own. Base Dynamic models incorporate a moderate amount of chrome. R-Design editions get more racy body details, along with bigger wheels. Among other distinctive styling elements, the Polestar rides on lovely wheels wearing low-profile tires.</p>, <p>Cross Country models feature additional ground clearance. Rugged-look body details include unpainted fender flares.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56096" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>On the whole, the V60 wagon echoes the attributes of Volvo’s S60 sedan, boasting comfortable front seats, though space can be snug with all seats occupied. Back-seat room is good for a compact, but unexceptional.</p>, <p>Controls are somewhat awkward, with an abundance of buttons, in a cabin that looks dated, even grim. Standard aluminum trim can be replaced by glossy and matte wood surfaces for a more sprightly appearance.</p>, <p>High-quality materials are the rule. Standard nicely-grained, soft-touch leather upholstery is available in several shades, beyond beige and black. Polestar models get synthetic suede with contrasting stitching. Cross Country wagons are offered with thickly grained, saddle-hue leather.</p>, <p>Heated front seats now are standard, with heated back seats optional. Though stretch-out space is limited in back, the rear bench is well padded, with decent head clearance.</p>, <p>Cargo volume is about 20 cubic feet with second-row seatbacks upright, growing to 48 cubic feet with the split-folding rear seatback folded. Those figures match many small crossover models.</p>, <p>Long on buttons but short on features, the infotainment system is outdated and cumbersome. Though the 7.0-inch screen is crisp and bright, the system lacks Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56094" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-v60-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Surprisingly sporty when fitted with the stronger engines, the V60 is competent overall, though not as refined as some. Even the Polestar edition isn’t quite a model of high-performance, as promised by its styling.</p>, <p>The base T5 engine delivers admirable thrust, with minimal turbo lag and a sense of serenity. Compared to similar-size engines from German automakers, though, it sounds coarse when underway. At idle speed, thrumming sounds can be heard within the cabin. Steering is well-weighted, and the suspension is soft enough to deliver a relaxed, comfortable ride.</p>, <p>In R-Design models, the T6 engine feels significantly strong, though not much more refined. The suspension is stiffer, and 19-inch tires aren’t as adept at smoothing out minor road flaws. Overall, an R-Design might feel too firm for some tastes, though it rides and handles with a sporty sensibility.</p>, <p>Helped by Ohlins suspension struts, the Polestar is more compliant, as well as more stimulating, without excessive harshness. With 2 extra inches of ground clearance, the Cross Country adds confidence on a trail or when coping with snow, but it’s not ready for serious off-roading.</p>, <p>Fuel economy reaches above average, though all-wheel drive takes its toll. With front-drive, the T5 engine is EPA-rated at 25/36 mpg City/Highway, or 29 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive sinks the rating to 22/33 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined. The Cross Country dips to 22/30/25 mpg.</p>, <p>With its turbo/supercharged engine, the R-Design is EPA-rated at 22/32 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined. Picking a Polestar shrinks the rating to 20/27/22 mpg. All versions have a stop/start system.</p>, <p>Among smaller luxury cars, Volvo’s V60 wagon stands out for its sensible, practical benefits. Few competitors exist anymore. Each V60 is well-equipped for its price, and Volvo offers a broad range of configurations. As expected, prices can get out of hand as options are added.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Jaguar XF line broadened for 2018, with more engine choices and the addition of a new Sportbrake sport wagon.</p>, <p>2018 Jaguar XF sedans offer a pair of 2.0-liter turbocharged engines, in addition to a supercharged V6 and a 2.0-liter diesel engine. Jaguar’s lushly sleek, midsize luxury sedan entered its second generation for the 2016 model year.</p>, <p>The gorgeous XF Sportbrake wagon joined the U.S. lineup mid-2017 and comes with the supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 380 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque. Sportbrake wagons come only with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Jaguar XF sedans are available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The newly available 2.0-liter 25t four-cylinder engine produces 247 horsepower; the 2.0-liter 30t delivers 296 horsepower. Jaguar’s 2.0-liter diesel four generates 180 horsepower. Each engine mates with an 8-speed automatic transmission that includes paddle shifters.</p>, <p>XF sedans feature a lightweight, fully independent suspension. Sportbrake wagons incorporate a set of air springs.</p>, <p>We found the XF has communicative steering, excellent transmission shifts, and a highly composed ride. Strong V6 power and taut, supple handling combine to provide thoroughbred sports sedan dynamics in the XF S. Acceleration to 60 mph takes about 5.0 seconds (5.3 seconds in the Sportbrake). A rear-wheel-drive XF with the 2.0-liter 25t engine can reach 60 mph in 5.4 seconds, very quick performance.</p>, <p>Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested the XF sedan or Sportbrake wagon. A rearview camera is optional on base models, but standard for higher trim levels. Upper versions may include such safety technology as adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and a surround-view camera system. Depending on trim level, safety features may be either standard or optional. A head-up display also is available.</p>, <p>An XF may be equipped with base InControl Touch infotainment, with 8.0-inch touchscreen. Upper models get a Pro version with 10.2-inch touchscreen, plus a 12.3-inch panel that replaces conventional gauges.</p>, <p>The Jaguar XF 25t Sedan ($47,775) comes with the 247-horsepower four-cylinder gasoline engine, 8.0-inch touchscreen, and 380-watt Meridian audio.</p>, <p>Rear-wheel drive is standard. All-wheel drive is available. (Prices do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>The 2018 Jaguar XF also comes in XF Premium ($49,765), XF Prestige ($54,225), XF R-Sport ($58,125), XF S ($63,865), and XF Portfolio ($67,425).</p>, <p>Premium adds a rearview camera, power-adjustable steering column, and split-folding rear seat. Prestige gets heated power front seats, leather upholstery, parking sensors, and navigation. R-Sport has distinctive styling touches, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist, and adaptive LED headlights.</p>, <p>Sportbrake S AWD Wagon ($70,450) gets V6 with all-wheel drive, S body kit, self-leveling air suspension, power gesture tailgate, and 20-inch wheels, panoramic roof.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56088" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xf-final.jpg" width="200"/>Straightforward XF design closely resembles that of Jaguar’s smaller XE sedan: somewhat spare, but displaying handsome detailing. Though the grille is similar to XE’s, fender vents and slim headlights help separate the two models.</p>, <p>With its dramatically stretched-out roofline, the Sportbrake ranks as utterly enticing to the eye, complementing its ability to cling tenaciously to the pavement. Far more than the sedan, the new wagon is attuned to Jaguar’s illustrious past.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56089" height="258" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xf-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The cockpit is suitably functional and logically organized, and fit and finish stand above the norm. The cabin has a dark ambience, devoid of the glamour of old classic Jaguars.</p>, <p>While passenger space is ample, seats could be better-shaped with softer cushions, providing greater support. Front cushions are flat, with thin side bolstering. Yet, they hold both occupants neatly in position. The driver enjoys considerable elbow room.</p>, <p>The XF boasts sufficient space for 6-foot occupants in the back seats.</p>, <p>Sedan trunks are huge, measuring 19.1 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Sportbrake wagons hold 31.7 cubic feet of cargo behind the back seat, expanding to 69.7 cubic feet with seatbacks folded forward, though the cargo hold isn’t tall.</p>, <p>Strong V6 power and taut, supple handling combine to provide thoroughbred sports sedan dynamics. The XF has communicative steering, excellent transmission shifts, and a highly composed ride. Acceleration to 60 mph takes about 5.0 seconds (5.3 in the Sportbrake).</p>, <p>Turbodiesel sedans start off eagerly, delivering potent torque though a narrow engine-speed range.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56087" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xf-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xf-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xf-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Ride/handling characteristics cooperate expertly. Dead-even 50/50 weight balance helps give the XF a neutral feel when cornering, as well as compliant behavior. Steering is accurate if lighter than in some rivals, with moderate body lean. Yet, the XF always feels well-controlled.</p>, <p>Superior ride quality is further enhanced on models with adaptive dampers, permitting casual confidence on any road surface.</p>, <p>As expected, the turbodiesel is the fuel-economy champ, EPA-rated at 31/42 mpg City/Highway, or 35 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers the estimate to 30/40/34 mpg.</p>, <p>The gasoline turbo four is EPA-rated at 25/34 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined. Mileage dips to 23/33/27 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s supercharged V6, in the S sedan, is EPA-rated at 20/29 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined with rear-drive; or 20/28/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. Sportbrake wagons are EPA-rated 18/25 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>All Jaguar XF models excel in performance and equipment content, with options offered in logical groupings. The sedans don’t stand out dramatically from the four-door European sedan pack. Jaguar’s gorgeous rendition of a sport wagon harks back to the British motorcar maker’s renowned design heritage.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-volkswagen-passat/
[<p>The Volkswagen Passat is easily overlooked because it’s not flashy, just efficient. It doesn’t do anything to any extreme, it just works, all the time. Smoothly and easily. Just good, solid, German engineering. It’s hard to find a car like that.</p>, <p>Passat features a new engine for 2018, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder TSI powerplant to replace the 1.8-liter engine. It’s the most advanced 2.0-liter engine Volkswagen has ever made (as it should be), with more horsepower and better fuel mileage. In the front-wheel-drive Passat it makes 174 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque, mated to a smooth 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56080" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-passat-r-line.jpg" width="200"/>A 3.6-liter V6 making 280 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 6-speed clutchless manual automatic transmission called the DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox), also front-wheel drive, is available on the Passat SEL and standard on the Passat GT. If the four-cylinder doesn’t move along the 3300-pound sedan quickly enough for you, this V6 certainly will. But there’s a price to pay at the fuel pump, as the 2.0-liter gets an EPA Combined 29 miles per gallon, while the 3.6-liter gets just 22 mpg.</p>, <p>The Passat GT model is new for 2018, boasting 19-inch aluminum wheels, sport suspension, a custom-tuned double exhaust, GTI-inspired front red accent line, red brake calipers, carbon-fiber interior trim and a black roof, spoiler, mirrors and window trim.</p>, <p>Automatic emergency braking is an option with every model, and the Passat scores well in crash-testing.</p>, <p>The 2018 Volkswagen Passat comes standard with a 2.0-liter engine ($22,995). Passat SE retails for $26,295, the SE with the Technology package is $29,595, the SEL Premium is $31,650, the R-Line $24,995. The SEL with the V6 models is $34,650. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination fee.)</p>, <p>All models but the S get Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Also, new for 2018, all Passats come with the People First Warranty, a six-year or 72,000-mile (whichever occurs first) bumper-to-bumper New Vehicle Limited Warranty, which is transferable to a new owner if the car is sold. New for 2018, the S model will have an available Driver’s Assistance Package, with Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking (Front Assist) and Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56083" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-passat-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Passat isn’t going to turn heads. It has similar lines to the smaller Volkswagen Jetta, but the Jetta carries them more cleanly. Different models have different trims in the grille and low front air intakes, and the less chrome cross-hatching, the better. That’s why we like the GT nose the most, although we could do without the boy-racer red outline around the black grille.</p>, <p>The cabin is one area where the Passat is outstanding. It’s narrower than rivals like Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, but there’s more legroom in the rear, and the trunk’s capacity of nearly 16 cubic feet also is at the top of the segment.</p>, <p>The quality of the interior materials is high, but there’s less standard equipment than rivals offer and fewer features.</p>, <p>The SE might cost more, but we think it’s a better value, with standard automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, synthetic leather upholstery, moonroof, CarPlay/Android Auto, and dual-zone automatic climate control.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56081" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-passat-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-passat-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-passat-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The new 2.0 turbo is impressively smooth. It might not be fast enough for some, with only 174 horsepower, but that’s what the V6 is for, with its huge increase in power of more than 100 horsepower.</p>, <p>The 6-speed automatic transmission matches the smoothness of the engine, and the 6-speed manual automatic DSG made by Volkswagen has long been the sharpest of the twin-clutch bunch.</p>, <p>The steering is responsive but still light, and the ride is on the firm side, firmer than the Accord and, especially, the Camry. Which is a good thing, since it’s always comfortable. The suspension doesn’t make the Passat a sport sedan, but it does make the car confident and composed on a highway with curves.</p>, <p>Volkswagen Passat is a well-engineered vehicle, but it’s pricey, and up against a strong competitor in the form of the all-new Honda Accord.</p>, <p>Compiled with staff reports by The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-mustang/
[<p>The 2018 Ford Mustang benefits from a major refresh, with significant changes in styling, drivetrain, suspension, and interior. It’s better looking, the V8 is more powerful, the EcoBoost turbo four is improved, and there’s a new 10-speed automatic transmission. The V6 is retired after faithful decades of service.</p>, <p>The Mustang is smarter than ever: more capable, more fun, better balanced, and faster. Styling changes, with redesigned grille and hood, are subtle but make the car striking. The 2018 Mustang draws stares, casual observers noticing something has changed.</p>, <p>The cabin is cleaner, at least the optional upgrade is, and interior materials better. There’s also an optional digital instrument cluster and active exhaust.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56073" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-mustang-convertible.jpg" width="200"/>The two EcoBoost models use a new 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that makes a superb 310 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque. The two GT models use the brilliant 5.0-liter V8 that now makes 460 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque (increased from 435 hp and 400 lb ft). With either engine, you can get a six-speed manual transmission, or ten-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Adaptive suspension is available on every model. It uses dampers with magnetic fluid, and allows a driver to set the ride at soft for around-town comfort, or firm for sharp handling. The Mustang is just catching up to the Camaro that’s been using these advanced shocks for years.</p>, <p>The new active exhaust is available on the Mustang GT. Its sound level can be set by the driver. It transforms the car’s character, and makes acceleration fun. We think it’s worth it.</p>, <p>There is a 12-inch digital instrumentation display available on the top two trims. Most of the information is driving data. It’s a beautiful interface, not sprawling like the Audi’s, and the gauges can be configured by the driver, for example shift lights. It’s especially useful with the Track Apps performance package. It’s something that the Camaro and Dodge Challenger don’t have.</p>, <p>The 2.3-liter turbo hardtop with the 10-speed automatic gets 21 mpg city, 32 highway, 25 combined, the convertible gets 2 less mpg. Also 2 mpg less if with the Performance Pack for the engine. The 5.0-liter V-8 with the 10-speed automatic gets 16/25/19 mpg.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56075" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-mustang-rear-convertible.jpg" width="200"/>2018 Mustang comes as Fastback EcoBoost ($25,585), Fastback EcoBoost Premium ($30,600), Fastback GT ($35,095) and Fastback GT Premium ($39,095). (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>The Mustang Convertible doesn’t come with GT trim. The six-speed manual gearbox is standard with all models; the 10-speed automatic is ($1595) extra.</p>, <p>Not to be forgotten is the Shelby GT350 ($55,845).</p>, <p>Standard equipment includes automatic LED headlamps, active noise cancellation, keyless ignition, leather-wrapped steering wheel, six-speaker sound system, and rearview camera.</p>, <p>Premium models add heated and cooled front seats, leather seats, Sync 3 infotainment with 8.0-inch touchscreen, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The new digital instrument cluster is available only with Premium. It’s bundled with navigation, upgraded leather with accent stitching, colored door trim, heated steering wheel, WiFi hotspot, and remote start.</p>, <p>For 2018 there’s also a new Performance Package for both the EcoBoost ($2495) and GT ($3995), adding bigger wheels with grippier tires, firmer suspension, beefier rear differential, enhanced cooling, and Brembo six-piston front brakes. The performance packages don’t include the active suspension with magnetic dampers, which are extra ($1695).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56071" height="87" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-mustang-profile.jpg" width="200"/>The Mustang was redesigned for 2015, and the change was not universally accepted by Mustang fans. So for 2018 Ford has cleaned things up in the front and rear.</p>, <p>Headlamps, taillamps and bumpers have been tweaked, but more than that, the nose has been lowered, bringing out the shark. Only 20 millimeters, less than one inch, but it makes a striking difference; the car has a presence it didn’t have before. However we’re not sure what this will mean when parking with the nose against curbs. You might want to watch that.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56072" height="169" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-mustang-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The headlamps are more shapely and more deeply set, which accentuates the nose. New marker lights sit against vertical vents.</p>, <p>New taillamps are subtly angled and arced, making the back look slimmer. Unfortunately the optional spoiler looks like a low-cost aftermarket job, just slapped on. But fortunately, it only comes with the Performance Package, and buyers can tell Ford to keep it. Ford doesn’t even charge extra, for declining this inferior product.</p>, <p>It’s safe to say that most Mustangs are owned by single people or couples, and for them the seating is great. All three types of bucket front seats work well: the base fabric upholstery, leather and upgraded leather, or Recaro sport seats. They are comfortable around town and supportive in the corners. They’re a bit snug, announcing the car’s preparedness if not intention, but the side bolsters are soft enough to give. And there’s a wide range of adjustment, so even tall drivers have enough headroom and legroom in front.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56076" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-mustang-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-mustang-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-mustang-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Don’t expect much from the rear seating. The Mustang is a 2+2, not a four-seat sedan. So the legroom is seriously limited back there. With just 29 inches, it’s less than the Camaro. But at least the two slim seats are supportive, as occupants sink in.</p>, <p>Climbing in and out is a challenge without hitting your head on the roofline, although it’s easier than the Camaro which has even less headroom.</p>, <p>The most fun rear passengers will have is in the convertible, with the top down. It’s a breeze to squeeze in and out standing up, and with infinite headroom, they’ll forget about their cramped knees. So, if rear passengers are part of your lifestyle, consider going topless.</p>, <p>The trunk size is slim, too; so a road trip will fill the trunk and the rear jump seats. But compared to the Camaro, the Mustang’s trunk is massive: 13.5 cubic feet vs 9.1 cu ft. Comparing convertibles, it’s Mustang 11.4 v Camaro 7.2. However when you bring in the Dodge Challenger hardtop, its 16.2 cubic feet blows the Mustang away.</p>, <p>The Mustang came back in 2005 as retro, but Ford went too far retro with the cabin. Primitive ugly instrumentation and hard plastics. It got better with the 2015 refresh, but for 2018 disappointments remain. Despite handsome fabric or leather inserts, the upper doors feel cheap and hollow. The center console has premium elements around the shifter, but still is the same story as the doors.</p>, <p>The centerstack has a nice design, and the Premium model features sweet toggle switches. The plastic background looks perfectly like machined aluminum. Carbon-fiber is available that replaces the plastic with carbon-fiber galore, on the instrument panel, doors, spreading onto the gearshift knob. Curiously, it’s not available with the digital dash panel or available Recaro seats.</p>, <p>The cabin improvements are all on the options list. The Equipment Package makes it classier. Upgraded leather comes in basic black, red, or cool black with blue piping. It also adds heated and cooled front seats, Sync 3 infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, and dual-zone automatic climate control.</p>, <p>The optional digital instrument panel comes only with the Premium trim. It’s on the driver’s side and is focused on driving information. With programmable gauges, it gives an upscale air to the cabin, over the basic analog gauges.</p>, <p>The performance of the 2018 Mustang is more complete and compelling than it’s ever been. Not only for the new power and available active magnetic suspension, but also for its stout brakes and steering rack that’s weighted just right.</p>, <p>They used to call the V6 Mustang a chick’s car, with its lower power output, and it was a favorite of young women. Now with the V6 gone, will the EcoBoost twin-turbo continue to be a chick’s car? They won’t have to say it’s only a V6, they can boast that it’s a twin-turbo. No question twin turbo sounds hotter than V6.</p>, <p>The base 2.3-liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine gets more torque, making it easier to drive because torque means grunt, responsiveness. Ford engineers learned a lot from the Focus RS with its same-sized engine. The horsepower remains the same, at an awesome 310; but the torque blasts up from 320 to 350 foot-pounds. Picture secretaries doing burnouts.</p>, <p>The new 10-speed automatic transmission is the result of a joint project between Ford and General Motors. The 10-speed has worked in the Ford F-150, Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, and GM’s full-size SUVs.</p>, <p>With the 2.3-liter engine, the upshifts and downshifts are crisp and predictable, and not just when the car is set in a sporty or performance driving mode, but even when it’s in the normal driving mode.</p>, <p>But the 10-speed transmission doesn’t work with the 5.0-liter twin-cam V8 engine, which revs quickly and has so much power. Or at least the programming in the GT model we drove during our test drive in Southern California wasn’t right. It felt like there’s just too much engine for the 10-speed to handle. During our seat time, the transmission seemed to get confused, and was sometimes slow to respond.</p>, <p>We drove a Mustang with both the Performance Package and Magnetic Ride Control, features that theoretically make it the most agile and composed Mustang ever built. In Sport mode, the dampers stiffen to produce handling that’s sharp and steady even on rough roads, forgiving in terms of balance, predictable, composed. It’s much advanced over the old solid rear axle.</p>, <p>When the dampers are set to their softest mode, and the exhaust system to its quietest tuning, the Mustang feels like a grand touring car.</p>, <p>The staggering Shelby GT350 uses a 5.2-liter V8 and the magnetic-damper suspension. It’s a bit brittle on the street; it belongs on the track. See Motor Authority’s first drive of the Ford Shelby GT350.</p>, <p>The GT with its V8 can accelerate from zero to sixty in less than four seconds, a stunning performance at its low price point. The active exhaust system makes it downright charming. You can tune the exhaust as easy as you turn up the volume on your TV. From almost silent, to the deep base of a V8 rumble, to a menacing bellow.</p>, <p>And last but not least you can do flawless burnouts at the push of a button and press of a pedal, thanks to Ford’s hilarious electronic line lock, standard equipment.</p>, <p>The Mustang with the new 10-speed automatic and 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine deliver strong power and torque in a four-cylinder. For sportiness and driving fun, a Mustang GT with the V8 and six-speed manual is a killer car for the money.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with driving impressions by The Car Connection staff.</p>]

[<p>When the current-generation Fusion debuted for the 2013 model year, it essentially established a new standard for style in a midsize family sedan. Now, its gracefully lean, carefully-proportioned body continues to attract admirers. Eyes are particularly drawn to its gloriously simple, horizontal oval grille.</p>, <p>Little has changed on Fusions for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p>Fusion choices practically set a record for diversity. Four powertrains are offered, with five trim levels: S, SE, Titanium, Sport, and Platinum. Ford also offers both a regular Hybrid and a Plug-in Hybrid variant. All Fusions use a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Base engine is a 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder, which doesn’t stand out in any way. Substituting a 1.5-liter EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder raises output only slightly, to 181 horsepower, but adds stop/start technology that’s meant to improve fuel economy.</p>, <p>Upper-level Fusions are equipped with a stronger 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbo four that produces 245 horsepower. Top dog beneath the hood, standard in the Sport sedan, is a 2.7-liter EcoBoost twin-turbo V6, generating 325 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. That model comes with standard all-wheel drive, but others have front-drive as the standard configuration and AWD as an option.</p>, <p>Both Hybrid sedans blend a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with twin electric motors and trunk-mounted lithium-ion battery packs. Combined output totals 188 horsepower. The Energi Plug-in Hybrid can go 22 miles on electricity alone.</p>, <p>Recharging a wholly depleted battery takes 3 to 4 hours, using a Level 2 (240-volt) charging station. Plugging into a 120-volt household outlet, charging takes about 7 hours.</p>, <p>The regular Hybrid comes in four trim levels, the Energi plug-in version, in three.</p>, <p>Every Fusion has a rearview camera, as well as Bluetooth audio streaming. A considerable selection of active-safety technology is available, though most of those features are options, rather than standard.</p>, <p>Forward collision warning, with automatic emergency braking, is available for all except the base S model. A Driver Assist Package includes lane-departure warning, active lane control, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, rear parking sensors, and active parking assist.</p>, <p>Crash-testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration resulted in a five-star rating overall and for side-impact, but four-star for frontal crash protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given the Fusion Good scores, provided it’s equipped with forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>Fusion S ($22,120) comes with the 2.5-liter engine, front-drive, cloth seats, cruise control, air conditioning, rearview camera, pushbutton start, SYNC infotainment, 16-inch wheels, steering-wheel controls, and a four-speaker AM/FM/CD player. All-wheel drive is not available. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $885 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Fusion SE ($23,395) adds power front seats, 17-inch wheels, satellite radio, and LED exterior lighting. All-wheel drive is available, as part of an option package ($4,890) that includes other features.</p>, <p>Fusion Titanium ($30,395) has the 2.0-liter turbo four. Also standard are heated front seats, SYNC 3, dual-zone automatic climate control, sport seats with leather surfaces, 12-speaker Sony audio, HD radio, 18-inch wheels, and ambient lighting. All-wheel drive adds $2,000.</p>, <p>Fusion AWD Sport ($33,750) gets the 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6, adaptive shock absorbers, shift paddles, 19-inch wheels, LED headlights and foglamps, leather/suede seats, nine-speaker audio, and active noise cancellation. All-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>Fusion Platinum ($36,895) includes the 2.0-liter turbo four, a sunroof, ventilated front seats, navigation, and 19-inch wheels. Safety features include items optional on other models: pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and blind-spot monitoring. All-wheel drive adds $2,000.</p>, <p>Fusion Hybrid S ($25,295) has a battery/gasoline powertrain, nine-speaker audio, and 17-inch wheels. Fusion Hybrid SE ($26,245) adds power front seats, satellite radio, and LED lighting. Fusion Hybrid Titanium ($30,775) includes SYNC 3 infotainment, HD radio, 12-speaker Sony audio, and 18-inch wheels. Fusion Hybrid Platinum ($37,275) comes with cooled front seats, sport grille, leather-wrapped steering wheel, sunroof, and active-safety features including pre-collision system.</p>, <p>Fusion Energi SE ($31,305) has a plug-in hybrid powertrain, leather seats, heated front seats, SYNC, and satellite radio. Fusion Energi Titanium ($32,305) includes 12-speaker Sony audio, ambient lighting, and rear spoiler. Fusion Energi Platinum ($39,305) is equipped similar to Hybrid Platinum, including active-safety features.</p>, <p>Viewed from any direction, Ford’s Fusion is about as fine-looking a family sedan as you’ll find anywhere. Although its graceful body proportions and gallant stance might suggest premium German automobiles, the stylish low grille looks as if it was plucked off a British Aston Martin.</p>, <p>More than most competitors, the Fusion asserts a presence that seems practically timeless. At the rear, the Fusion profile carries the aura of a more costly car, centered on LED taillights that are split by a chrome strip.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56068" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-fusion-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Unlike the eye-grabbing Fusion body, its plainly-trimmed cabin ranks around average. Functionality has improved, helped by a rotary gearshift knob and additional storage bins. Trim is better than it used to be, though glossy black plastic is fairly prominent.</p>, <p>Simple metallic rings surround instruments and controls. Base-model display screens are small. Fusions run quietly, except for a rumbling exhaust sound on Sport models.</p>, <p>Comfortably bolstered front seats are shapely and supportive, if somewhat thinly padded. Six-footers should have ample headroom and leg space. Tall doors help make entry/exit easy. Visibility excels, courtesy of a high driver’s seat, abundant glass, and narrow roof pillars.</p>, <p>Back-seat space is about average – rather flat, and short on head clearance for taller riders. Four adults fit nicely, though a fifth might not. Some rival midsize sedans offer significantly more legroom. Trunk space totals an ample 16 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Upper trim levels flaunt some plush details, including quilted leather seats and door panels in the Limited. Sport models get suede seats and aluminum pedals. Base models have lesser-grade cloth upholstery. Hybrids have a glass-covered cluster of gauges, which can be configured to show the desired data and graphics.</p>, <p>Essentially a family sedan, thus short of sporty, the Fusion yields a tightly controlled ride that’s firm, yet absorbent. In Sport models, despite adaptive dampers, the ride tends to be excessively firm, though short of harsh.</p>, <p>Fusions respond smartly to driver inputs, handling with admirable firmness. Delivering an impressive blend of charming ride and taut handling, the Fusion benefits from adeptly-tuned electric power steering. Base sedans aren’t especially agile, but the Sport model supplies an eager, consistent steering feel.</p>, <p>Most Fusion engines promise strong acceleration, but the performance range is broad. Less powerful than rival base engines, Ford’s 2.5-liter four reaches peak torque at fairly high engine speed, limiting performance potential. The 1.5-liter turbo feels stronger for everyday duties, despite its small displacement, because it’s tuned to deliver low-end torque.</p>, <p>Expect swift-revving energy with minimal vibration from the 245-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbo four. Starting off strongly from a standstill, it’s well matched to the paddle-shifted 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Accelerating briskly, a Fusion Sport with the 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 sounds lusty, too. Long highway passing maneuvers unreel without fuss, while 0-60 mph acceleration takes a little over six seconds. Set up for firm responses, the Fusion Sport furnishes crisp steering, along with tautly-controlled body motions. Adaptive dampers help to smooth the pavement surface, but 19-inch wheels make that task tougher.</p>, <p>Four-cylinder engines help keep Fusions economical. S and SE sedans are EPA-rated at 21/32 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. The Eco’s 1.5-liter turbo manages 23/34/27 mpg, and has standard stop/start.</p>, <p>In Titanium and Platinum trim, the 2.0-liter turbo with 6-speed automatic and front-drive is EPA-rated at 21/31 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops the estimate to 20/29/23 mpg. Fusion Sport, with all-wheel drive and the 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6, is EPA-rated at 17/26 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Hybrid Fusions carry on most of the regular Fusion virtues, augmented by better fuel economy – though not the best. The front-drive Hybrid is EPA-rated 43/41 mpg City/Highway, or 42 mpg Combined. The Plug-in Energi edition is rated 42 mpg in hybrid mode, 97 MPGe when using battery power. Newer hybrid competitors are thriftier, especially the newest Toyota Camry (EPA-rated at 52 mpg).</p>, <p>Hybrid pleasures begin with a quiet ride and friendly handling, though steering is on the slow side. Because engine responses are more closely in accord with road speed than before, the current Hybrid promises more conventional driving feel. Rewarding handling abilities help make this battery/gasoline model enjoyable to drive. Low-rolling-resistance tires produce little sound.</p>, <p>Today’s Fusion continues to promise an attractively-proportioned body, confident ride and handling, and abundant technology. Top value is probably the amply-equipped Fusion SE, now available with optional adaptive cruise control and forward-collision warning. Among the Hybrids, the best value may be the base model.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett and John Voelcker, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-transit-connect/
[<p>When it debuted in the U.S. as a 2010 model, Ford’s European-derived cargo van and passenger wagon promised practical virtues and versatility, aiming mainly at businesses. For family use, the modest-size wagon could substitute for a full-size minivan.</p>, <p>Redesigned for 2014, the Ford Transit Connect added a touch of beauty, compared to the original version’s more boxy profile. Modifications for the 2018 model year are limited to minor feature upgrades. Sync 3 infotainment with a 6.5-inch LCD touchscreen and rearview camera now are available for the XLT Van and Wagon. Automatic headlights are newly standard on XLT and Titanium Wagons; optional on XLT Cargo Van.</p>, <p>Cargo Vans come in two trim levels: XL and XLT. Five- and seven-passenger Transit Connect Wagons are offered in three trims, topped by a Titanium version. Five-passenger Wagons ride a shorter wheelbase.</p>, <p>In each Transit Connect, a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine makes 169 horsepower, mating with a 6-speed automatic transmission and front wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56060" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-transitconnect-van.jpg" width="200"/>Designed for the European market, where compact vans are popular, the Transit Connect may be the most polished compact van on sale in the U.S. Cargo and passenger versions score well for carlike styling, driving ease, capabilities, and features.</p>, <p>Quiet and comfortable, each Transit Connect drives like a passenger car. Compared to a minivan, they’re almost fun to operate.</p>, <p>Ford offers a broad range of configurations and features. Owners benefit from the taller stance, while comparative fuel-efficiency makes these Fords excellent alternatives to bigger, heavier full-size vans. Interior space is undeniably tighter than a full-size minivan would provide.</p>, <p>No Transit Connect has been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the 2018 Wagon five stars overall, with five stars for side-impact collision but only four stars each for frontal-impact and rollover protection (the latter a calculated figure).</p>, <p>Even the two-seat commercial versions contain six airbags. Passenger models have two-row side airbags for the five-seat version and three-row side curtains for the seven-seater. Carlike options abound, but modern active-safety features are absent.</p>, <p>Various rear-body styles and configurations are available for the Cargo Van. With an optional Tow Package, the Wagon can tow up to a ton, though maximum payload is a moderate 1,270 pounds.</p>, <p>Transit Connect XL Cargo Van ($23,120) comes with vinyl two-passenger seating, vinyl front floor covering, power front windows, remote keyless entry, 16-inch wheels, cruise control, swing-out cargo doors, and sliding side doors. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Transit Connect XLT Cargo Van ($24,645) adds heated power mirrors, MyKey personalized vehicle settings, cloth seat upholstery, front carpeting, CD player, driver’s lumbar support, and foglamps. A rearview camera and Sync 3 voice-activated infotainment with 6.5-inch touchscreen are optional.</p>, <p>Transit Connect XL seven-passenger Wagon ($25,805) has XL Van equipment, but with three-row seating, a rear liftgate, reverse sensing, and power second-row windows.</p>, <p>Transit Connect XLT seven-passenger Wagon ($25,810) gets XLT Van equipment plus automatic headlights, rain-sensing wipers, roof rails, a power driver’s seat, and rearview camera. A five-passenger, short-wheelbase XL Wagon is available.</p>, <p>Transit Connect Titanium six-passenger Wagon ($28,435) comes with second-row bucket seats and includes dual-zone automatic climate control, cornering foglamps, Sync 3, 16-inch alloy wheels, and leather seat upholstery. A five-passenger, short-wheelbase Wagon is available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56059" height="135" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-transitconnect-rear.jpg" width="200"/>In its second-generation form, the Transit Connect exhibits gracefulness and refinement that were absent from the original version. As a result, it stands above such competitors as the Chevrolet City Express, Nissan NV200, and Ram ProMaster City.</p>, <p>Ford designers managed to achieve a proper balance between functionality and visual flair. Body lines are significantly more stylish than those of rivals.</p>, <p>All vehicles in this category essentially amount to a large box, attached to a carlike front end. Compared to the slab-sided first-generation, which placed practicality above form, the current version exudes considerably greater appeal.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56063" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-transitconnect-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Excelling in versatility, the 2018 Transit Connect boasts a carlike cabin to complement its attractive exterior. Up front, at least, it feels almost like a compact sedan.</p>, <p>Tight and quiet, the interior is remarkably comfortable for what still amounts to a business-oriented model. The flexibility of the seven-passenger Wagon is especially impressive.</p>, <p>Plenty of buttons dot the dashboard, but overall it’s modern and admirably functional. At the same time, controls and displays are appropriate for tougher commercial conditions. Quality of materials is equivalent to a compact car, though some hard plastic components and tough-looking fittings betray its function-focused background. Standard cloth upholstery promises welcome comfort and is breathable,</p>, <p>Because seats are mounted at normal car height, a high step-up isn’t needed when entering. However, passengers sit higher than usual. Front seats are comfortable and supportive, while providing more than a foot of head clearance.</p>, <p>Passenger comfort also excels in the rear. Two adults fit easily on the second-row bench, but three will feel more crowded than in a minivan. The backrest of the 60/40-split bench can flip forward, allowing the entire seat to drop into the floor. Two seats in the third row slide and fold flat.</p>, <p>Loading is easier than in any other vehicle of this size, helped by a huge tailgate opening and wide sliding doors on each side. Liftover is comparatively low, too. Twin side-hinged rear doors are available as a substitute for the tailgate, but the doors’ central pillars obstruct rearward vision.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56062" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-transitconnect-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-transitconnect-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-transitconnect-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Carlike qualities aren’t limited to appearance. Despite its basic identity as a small commercial van, the Transit Connect drives easily and handles like a passenger car.</p>, <p>Though considerably taller than the compact Focus on which it’s based, the Transit Connect reflects the responsive handling and well-weighted steering found on that sedan and hatchback. The Wagon, in particular, might well qualify as the more nimble and sporty three-row vehicle on the U.S. market.</p>, <p>Performance isn’t as spirited. A Transit Connect can keep up with traffic easily enough, but acceleration falters when it’s filled with passengers or hauling heavy cargo.</p>, <p>Fuel economy beats that of full-size vans, but varies depending on wheelbase, configuration, and features. The commercial Cargo Van is EPA-rated at 20/27 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. The Wagon is EPA-rated at 19/27 mpg City/Highway, or 22 mpg Combined. That latter rating applies to both standard and long-wheelbase Wagons.</p>, <p>Transit Connects can accept E85 ethanol/gasoline fuel. Commercial users can order versions modified to accept natural-gas and LPG fuel.</p>, <p>Small businesses still account for most Transit Connect sales. Even so, families searching for a sensible, flexible people-carrier that’s smaller than a minivan might consider the Wagon. The lighter five-passenger version, in particular, presents a unique blend of practicality and rather enjoyable driving. Beware, though: the complete lack of active-safety options doesn’t bode well for families.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by John Voelcker, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-ridgeline/
[<p>The unique Honda Ridgeline came back redesigned for 2017, after its first generation ended with discontinuation in 2014. It’s mechanically unchanged for 2018, just some package and trim tweaks. (A refined version is being launched for 2019.)</p>, <p>What makes Ridgeline unique is that it’s technically a crossover; that is, the body is integrated with the chassis, like a car. It isn’t bolted onto the frame, like every other pickup truck in the world.</p>, <p>A body-on-frame design is more rugged, so it’s better for the demands a truck usually encounters, but it’s heavier and less rigid. The mid-size Ridgeline uses the platform of the full-size Honda Pilot SUV, so it rides and handles more like a crossover SUV than a truck. And the current-generation Ridgeline has 28 percent more torsional rigidity than the previous generation.</p>, <p>Ridgeline front-wheel drive, with available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Rivals like the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon are quite civilized, but in terms of ride quality, quiet operation, and general comfort, the Ridgeline is tops. Honda says it has the roomiest cabin in its class.</p>, <p>The engine is also the same as the Pilot’s, a 3.5-liter V6 with 6-speed automatic transmission. It was increased in power in 2017, to 280 horsepower with 262 pound-feet of torque. The acceleration is adequate but can be challenged when towing.</p>, <p>Fuel mileage is solid, at 19 mpg City, 26 Highway with front-wheel drive, and one less mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Ridgeline also grew a bit with its redesign; unlike before, it now can hold a sheet of plywood that’s 48 inches wide in the bed, with a payload rating of 1584 pounds. It’s rated to tow 5000 pounds with all-wheel drive, or 3500 pounds with front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>If towing or hauling are priorities, however, the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon, both offer the option of diesel power, with more torque.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Ridgeline comes in a broad variety of trim levels. Among them: Ridgeline RT ($29,630); Sport ($33,170); RTL ($33,930); RTL-T ($36,080); and RTL-E ($41,620). All-wheel drive is optional ($1900). (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56055" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ridgeline-styling.jpg" width="200"/>The styling changed for 2017, because that first generation was too original and radical to be accepted the way Honda wanted it to be. There was sales resistance. The current four-door crew cab Ridgeline looks more like a truck, including the grille that is recognizably Honda, unlike the first Ridgeline.</p>, <p>It still looks like a car, though. The Chevy Colorado is a better-looking truck for truck lovers.</p>, <p>The Ridgeline is 210 inches in length, on a wheelbase of 125.3 inches.</p>, <p>With a cargo bed that’s 64 inches long, the plywood fits with the tailgate dropped. The tailgate is hinged at the side as well as the bottom, so it opens like a door to make loading easier; and it locks to create a huge in-bed trunk, when it’s equipped with a bed cover. (Other trucks do this with traditional dropping tailgates.)</p>, <p>A 400-watt power inverter can power a big screen TV in the bed, with another option of six speakers integrated in the cargo bed walls. Equipped this way, the Ridgeline can be the ultimate tailgate party special.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56054" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ridgeline-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ridgeline-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ridgeline-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Ridgeline is abundantly roomy, as crew cab only, no regular or extended cab versions. There’s plenty of leg, head, and hip room in for all three passengers in the rear. The rear seats fold to create cargo space that Honda boasts is best in class, for full-size crew cab pickups.</p>, <p>The interior materials are high quality, while the front seats are comfortable all day, with a relaxed fit. The sound systems range from good to excellent.</p>, <p>The controls that are actual knobs are attractive, straightforward and intuitive, no manual required to figure them out. The touch controls on the big screen at the center of the dash have large icons, but they aren’t so simple, including, maddeningly, the audio adjustment, an old Honda challenge. That said, the navigation system is fairly easy to function, and the infotainment and connectivity options, which now include the choice of Apple Car Play or Android Auto, are contemporary.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56056" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ridgeline-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ridgeline-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ridgeline-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Ridgeline is a very smooth operator, composed and compliant on all surfaces from bumpy paved to graded gravel. It’s hard to find flaws in the driving dynamics. The steering could have a bit more weight and provide more feedback, but the same could be said of any contemporary truck with electric power steering. All-wheel drive Ridgelines include torque vectoring at the rear axle, lending stability in corners, especially when traction is reduced by the road surface.</p>, <p>The unibody structure feels exceptionally solid, and the suspension is a little firmer than on the Pilot in order to handle a truck’s payloads, but that firmness doesn’t diminish the ride.</p>, <p>Acceleration performance is respectable but not thrilling. Its weight of about 4500 pounds is a lot for 280 horsepower to pull. The towing capacity of 5000 pounds with all-wheel drive, 3500 pounds for front-wheel drive, is near the bottom of the list of midsize pickups.</p>, <p>Available safety features include adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning and lane assist. The lane departure feature is a little too eager to assert itself, jiggling the steering wheel when the truck’s trajectory even slightly heads toward a painted line at the edge of the road. That would be the apex of any curve. On a winding two-lane road, as with every such system we’ve ever experienced, the false alarms are constant. All they do by crying wolf is destroy their own credibility.</p>, <p>The Ridgeline is the standard in pickup truck refinement, if not ruggedness. It’s a creative blend of engineering and imagination, adept at truck work or daily transportation. The cabin is roomiest in the class, and the bed can do tricks that other trucks can only envy. Honda’s 3.5-liter V6 is proven and capable in this application.</p>, <p>Compiled with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-bolt/
[<p>The Chevrolet Bolt EV electric car is a tall compact five-door hatchback with the passenger space of a midsize car, thanks to a chassis that pushes the wheels outward. With a range of 238 miles between charges, it’s the first mass-market electric car to break the 200-mile barrier, something that otherwise only a $70,000 Tesla can achieve. With its interior room, range, and a price that makes the cost-per-mile numbers work for commuter travel, it’s the first mainstream electric vehicle.</p>, <p>The EPA classifies the Bolt as a small wagon, and that’s close enough; meanwhile Chevrolet calls it a crossover, but that’s a stretch because there’s no all-wheel drive nor higher ground clearance. We see it as a tall compact car. It’s built on dedicated architecture for electric cars, although some suspension components and accessories are shared with other GM vehicles. It handles well enough in turns.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Bolt’s powerplant is a simple design. A big flat 60-kilowatt hour lithium-ion battery pack sits under the floor and powers an electric motor that drives the front wheels. That motor is rated 150 kilowatts (200 horsepower), and can squirt the Bolt to sixty miles per hour in less than seven seconds. With that kind of acceleration you’ll never get in anyone’s way in the city. In fact, big bulky gas burners will be in your way. You will feel superior, and be shouting, “Get those dinosaurs out of my way!”</p>, <p>The EV’s onboard charger operates at up to 7.2 kilowatts. A 120-volt charging cord is stored under the rear cargo area. Chevrolet believes most buyers will install a 240-volt outlet in their garage (it might already be in the laundry room), so they will be able to charge the battery pack using a 240-volt Level 2 charging station. GM says that with Level 2, it takes less than two hours to get 50 miles of charge; so that would be overnight for a full charge of 200-plus miles. The Bolt also offers an available 50-watt DC fast-charging port, which GM says will give you 90 miles of range in 30 minutes of charging. It costs $750, and uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) protocol adopted by all U.S. and German makers except Tesla. It makes the Bolt EV do-able for road trips.</p>, <p>The battery pack, electric motor and drive unit are manufactured in Korea, but the Bolt is built in Michigan.</p>, <p>Unlike BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen, GM doesn’t plan to finance the building of fast-charge infrastructure across the country. That’s also unlike Tesla, with its nationwide network of Supercharger sites.</p>, <p>Gasoline-powered rivals include the Hyundai Accent, Mazda2, and Toyota Yaris. The Bolt is bigger and has more standard equipment than those cars, including HID headlamps, LED daytime running lights, rearview camera, 60/40 split folding rear seat, automatic climate control, two USB ports, 10.2-inch color touchscreen, digital rearview mirror, and 17-inch painted aluminum wheels. And that’s just the base LT model.</p>, <p>The Bolt is rated by the EPA at 119 MPGe. Miles Per Gallon Equivalent, or MPGe, measures the distance a car can travel electrically on the amount of energy in a gallon of gasoline. The Bolt’s score is beaten only by one model of the BMW i3. As for its overall green virtues, it’s a big argument we won’t get into here. Lithium production and coal-powered electric plants must be considered in the car’s pollution scorecard.</p>, <p>The  NHTSA hasn’t crash tested the Bolt, but the IIHS awards it the top “Good” rating in every category, enough to make it a Top Safety Pick. This despite calling its headlights “Poor.” Many other cars get that Poor rating from the IIHS, and we’re inclined to agree with them. There is a big difference in the lighting effectiveness of cars for sale today.</p>, <p>For $495 there is a safety package adding forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning with active lane control, and automatic high beams. But adaptive cruise control and high-speed emergency braking isn’t available.</p>, <p>The lack of an engine and transmission up front required some innovative crash engineering in the stubby nose. Crash forces are absorbed and diverted around the passenger compartment by a lower cradle holding the traction motor and driveline, plus an upper cradle that contains the power electronics. Each is attached at four points.</p>, <p>The Bolt was the first car on the market to use the new Michelin self-sealing tire; if it picks up a nail it fixes itself, and you never know it. So there’s no spare tire in the Bolt, or even an inflation can, because it’s not necessary.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56048" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-ev.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-ev.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-ev-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Bolt EV LT ($36,620) and Premier ($40,905) boast government incentives, including a $7500 Federal income tax credit and a $2500 rebate from the State of California. So if you do optimistic arithmetic, you’ve got a quick little five-seat hatchback for $27,500 and no gas bills whatsoever.</p>, <p>The LT gets three option packages. A comfort and convenience package adds heated front seats, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, and an auto-dimming rear-view mirror. A safety package called Driver Confidence I includes blind-spot monitors, lane-change alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking assist.</p>, <p>Those features are standard on the Premier, along with leather seat upholstery, heated seats for the rear, a false cargo floor that hides a compartment below, light piping in the interior, GM’s new digital rearview mirror, with a rear-facing camera that gives a wide 80-degree image in the crisp digital display that replaces the mirror glass.</p>, <p>Two option packages are offered on the Premier. An infotainment package bundles a premium audio system, two more USB ports for the rear seats, and wireless device charging in the console. And the Driver Confidence II package adds forward-collision alert with pedestrian detection, low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56044" height="160" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Bolt has family resemblance to other small Chevy cars, including the new Spark and aging Sonic. It’s an upright hatchback with a short nose, racy lines, sharp creases, rising windows, and wheels pushed out to the corners. This shape makes it look smaller than it is. There’s a plate in front where a grille would otherwise be, because there’s no gas-burning engine needing air for cooling.</p>, <p>Electricity aside, the Bolt’s standout quality is its cabin space. Its 94.4 cubic feet of interior volume just edges out the much larger and more expensive Tesla Model S, although the electric Nissan Leaf is nearly as good, with 92.4 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56046" height="206" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The cabin is light and airy, and fits four adults in comfortable seats; with five, it’s pushing the comfort level. Everyone, including the driver, sits high and upright, a position unlike that in the rakish Chevy Volt midsize electric/gas sedan. The front seats are thin, but there’s a lot of legroom thanks to the flat floor and slim dash and console. And the short nose allows superb visibility for the driver, especially useful for parking in tight spaces.</p>, <p>The interior is attractive enough, despite some economy-grade hard plastic. There’s a digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel, and 10.2-inch color touchscreen fixed on the center stack. The thin fonts on white background look sophisticated, and more importantly are easy to read.</p>, <p>One unique high-tech feature is GM’s new digital rearview mirror, which uses a rear-facing camera to give a wide 80-degree image in a digital display that replaces the mirror glass. Compare that to the 22 degrees of a rearview mirror, usually blocked by rear headrests, roof pillars, wiper, and window frame. The image is crisp, although there can be glare.</p>, <p>The rear seat folds flat to create a deep cargo bay with a storage compartment under its floor that slides out for easier loading. It can fit into a slot in the seatback to gain several inches of height in the cargo bay.</p>, <p>It’s quiet inside. Well duh, it’s an electric car. We heard only occasional motor or electronics whine.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56045" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bolt-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>We spent six hours behind the wheel of a Bolt EV, logging 240 miles along California coastal roads and freeways at varying speeds and elevations. Our drive depleted the battery, but other automotive journalists on the same route tried harder, and arrived with as much as 25 miles left. So the EPA-rated 238-mile range is not only real, but can be increased with careful attention to efficient driving.</p>, <p>Even with four adults inside, the Bolt accelerates with authority, and can even chirp the inside front tire out of a turn. The torque is awesome. To add to the Bolt’s 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts), the motor makes 266 pound-feet (360 Newton-meters) of torque. You won’t find a vehicle that small with that much torque, this side of a tractor. The Bolt can leap like a spider away from stoplights, and jump like a cockroach into holes in city traffic.</p>, <p>It corners fairly flat on 17-inch alloy wheels, with steering that has a nice positive self-centering action.</p>, <p>There are two distinct drive modes. In the normal Drive mode, selected on a lever like a transmission lever but not, the car behaves like it has an automatic transmission. The brake feel was consistent enough that we didn’t feel any transitions between regenerative and friction braking.</p>, <p>But in the Low mode, the regenerative braking is much stronger, and will actually stop the car without the brakes being applied. It extends the range, but it takes some getting used to, to be appreciated. Some like it, some don’t. One thing is, you have to unlearn the smooth style you’ve come to know. You can’t just lift the throttle and glide gradually to reduce speed or stop. When you lift the throttle, the car puts on the brakes, so you have to run up closer to a stop sign before you back off. We can’t see any plus to what amounts to late-braking.</p>, <p>The Bolt EV is the first electric car that makes an economic argument, but depreciation remains a wild card. And that argument comes at the expense of taxpayers, since it’s government subsidies that make Bolt’s numbers work. Meanwhile, mechanically it works. Quick acceleration, nimble handling, good interior room in a small exterior package. Spring another $750 for the fastest charging system, and find a place on the road to use it, and you can even drive farther than 240 miles at a time.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac CT6 offers a new option called SuperCruise that allows hands-free driving with the adaptive cruise control. Other, more minor, changes for the 2018 CT6 include new colors and improvements to the Park Assist feature.</p>, <p>With sleek looks and graceful handling, the CT6 was an all-new product for 2016, a luxury flagship sedan that aspired to challenge the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7 Series, and Audi A8.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Plug-In hybrid model joined the lineup, primarily for California.</p>, <p>An American V6 propels the CT6 as quickly as the German V8s power the heavy German cars, a benefit of the lighter weight of the CT6. That American V6 is also fuel-efficient and silky smooth. For spirited driving, the CT6 is available as a 400-horsepower four-wheel-drive Cadillac.</p>, <p>Three engines are available in addition to a plug-in hybrid. All use direct injection and are mated to an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder comes standard making 265 horsepower and comes with rear-wheel drive. (All-wheel drive is not available with the four-cylinder.)</p>, <p>A 3.6-liter V6 makes 335 hp, while a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 delivers 404 hp. Both V6s come with all-wheel drive (rear-wheel drive is not available with the V6s).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56038" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ct6-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Cadillac CT6 ($54,095) comes standard with the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and rear-wheel drive. Standard equipment includes rearview camera, while available safety features include forward-collision warnings with automatic braking, blind-spot monitors, and surround-view cameras. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge, taxes, cash allowances or discounts.)</p>, <p>Optional is the 3.6-liter V6 with all-wheel drive ($55,090) or the 3.0-liter Twin Turbo engine and all-wheel drive. The CT6 Plug-In ($76,090) features an 18.4-kWh Lithium-ion propulsion battery paired with a 2.0-liter turbo direct injection engine.</p>, <p>Luxury, Premium, and Platinum trim levels are available. Options include massaging rear seats and 34-speaker sound systems.</p>, <p>The lovely CT6 has sharp sheetmetal creases, LED blade lenses, and other similar styling details. But because the CT6 is bigger, it stands out as the flagship, with a classic long Cadillac hood and trunk.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56040" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ct6-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ct6-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ct6-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The CT6 boasts the finest cabin Cadillac has ever made, as it should, being the most modern flagship. The interior is rife with high-quality materials that fit as well as anything we’ve ever seen from Cadillac. Its design is spare and pure, an exciting direction for Cadillac. Yet it’s short on warmth.</p>, <p>It lacks the evocative flourishes of its German competition. It can’t compete with the Mercedes S-Class with its gorgeous arcs of chrome and glowing LED rainbows, or the fantastic sandwiched wood-and-metal trim in the Audi A8.</p>, <p>The driver’s seat is very firm and flat. We think it needs either more bolstering or softer cushions as well as a wider range of adjustment. There’s a large center console under an armrest. The CUE infotainment system is standard, appearing on a 10.2-inch hi-resolution screen. The pioneering rear camera mirror takes some getting used to.</p>, <p>The CT6 has exceptional room, especially rear legroom, although the center rear passenger will be perched high and uncomfortable on the transmission tunnel, while the tall passengers on either side of him or her will be fine. An optional Rear Seat Package massages and reclines the seats, and shows entertainment on the 10-inch screens, in your 400-horsepower four-wheel-drive Cadillac.</p>, <p>The rear seats don’t fold flat, while the rear seatbelt receivers are too deep in the seats, and hard to find especially when the armrest is down. There’s a trap door over the armrest to the trunk, to carry long thin things. The trunk holds a big 15.3 cubic feet.</p>, <p>It’s quiet inside because the engine has a steel block, says Cadillac. A steel block is quieter than aluminum. That means less interior sound-deadening material is needed. That material weighs more than the difference between a steel block and an aluminum block. That’s the efficient engineering. There appears to be some racing heritage in here. It’s an area where Cadillac has been extremely successful for more than a decade.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56039" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ct6-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ct6-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-ct6-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2.0-liter turbocharged model, 428 pounds lighter than the V6 models, is agile and light on its feet, and taut. In fact sometimes it’s too taut; if you want your CT6 to feel like a sport sedan, the four-cylinder is the way to go. But if you want more than that, the CT6 has nothing for the Mercedes AMG or BMW M models.</p>, <p>The turbocharged four-cylinder can hit sixty miles per hour from a standing start in 6.1 seconds, while the V6 can do it in 5.3 seconds. Power from the V6 is strong and smooth, equal to a V8.</p>, <p>The aluminum-and-steel chassis is rigid, and the electric steering is direct, with a pleasant heft and zesty response. But because the CT6 is long and wide, there’s too much car to feel truly sporty; the V6 with its heavier nose tends to understeer when pushed.</p>, <p>There’s an Active Chassis Package including magnetic dampers with a firm grip on body motion, and rear-steer system to help the car turn in better. The rear wheels turn in the opposite direction, up to 3.5 degrees, helping the car rotate in low-speed turns, and providing stability in quick high-speed maneuvers.</p>, <p>However the magnetic dampers don’t offer as much range as the suspensions do on the S-Class and A8. The CT6 rides firm all the time, no matter which mode it’s in, from Tour to Sport. The Mercedes and Audi know when to soften up.</p>, <p>Of course, the Mercedes is about 1000 pounds heavier than the CT6 with the 2.0 engine. The heaviest CT6, the twin-turbo V6 with all-wheel drive, that 400 horsepower four-wheel-drive model, is still 225 pounds lighter than a BMW 7.</p>, <p>The Cadillac CT6 is a worthy flagship. It’s sleek, light, and handles well. It’s big and roomy, quiet and luxurious, and fast enough for its purpose at three levels. The 8-speed automatic is sharp, and the three engines meet different desires. Overall we like the silky non-turbo V6 the most; but it’s hard to deny that honkin’ twin-turbo 404-horsepower baby.</p>, <p>Sam Moses filed this report, with driving impressions by The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-cadillac-escalade/
[<p>The Cadillac Escalade is the aged veteran of luxury SUVs. Not a car-based crossover, the Escalade is built on the Chevy Silverado pickup truck platform, although significantly refined.</p>, <p>Escalade comes with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. It can seat up to eight people and tow up to 8300 pounds, more than Range Rover, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz.</p>, <p>There is nothing subtle about a Cadillac Escalade: It’s big and in your face. Its styling is literally edgy, with ongoing sharp angles, but not figuratively edgy, as it now looks aged. And still excessive after all these years.</p>, <p>Escalade was last redesigned for 2015. It got a number of changes for 2017, including an excellent high-resolution rearview screen and self parking.</p>, <p>For 2018 the only change is a new 10-speed automatic transmission that was developed with Ford and is shared with its rival, the new Lincoln Navigator.</p>, <p>Escalade uses much of the running gear of the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon, including its solid rear axle. Overcoming that stiff primitive axle, the standard Magnetic Ride Control dampers give the Escalade a ride that’s nearly as good as its luxury rivals.</p>, <p>Cadillac ESV is a long-wheelbase model that’s 20 inches longer overall. Seventeen feet total. More than three tons. Suburban-size.</p>, <p>The Escalade is powered by 6.2-liter V8 making 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque, and able to accelerate from zero to sixty in six seconds, which is strong performance.</p>, <p>With direction injection and cylinder cutout, as well as the new 10-speed, Escalade with rear-wheel drive earns an EPA-rated 15/22 miles per gallon City/Highway, or 17 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>They come with 2-inch receiver hitches for towing trailers.</p>, <p>Escalade earns four stars in crash testing from NHTSA, with a low three-star rating for rollover protection. Standard safety equipment includes an innovative airbag that protects front occupants that might be thrown toward the center of the car during side impact.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56028" height="154" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-2.jpg" width="200"/>Cadillac Escalade ($74,695) comes in Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Platinum trim levels. Similar story with the long-wheelbase ESV ($77,695). (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge, taxes, cash allowances or discounts.)</p>, <p>Standard equipment includes surround-view camera, front and rear parking sensors, automatic parking, navigation, heated steering wheel, digital instrument cluster, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 16 speakers, and adaptive ride control.</p>, <p>Luxury adds automatic emergency braking. A Driver Assist package is available on Luxury and above includes adaptive cruise control and front and rear automatic braking. A Driver Awareness package adds a lane departure warning system that steers the vehicle back into its lane if the system thinks it’s necessary.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56029" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The angular Escalade is covered with chrome. The profile is identical to the Tahoe, and the Escalade ESV’s profile is identical to the Suburban. It used to be conspicuous, but it’s been unchanged for so long, now it passes largely unnoticed. But it’s still imposing and unmistakable.</p>, <p>Its face remains from the time when Cadillac’s Art and Science design language was fresh, with the logo on the grille illuminated by vertical LED headlamps. The taillamps are tall and thin, and look sophisticated and crisp.</p>, <p>The cabin is warmly sculpted, unlike the sharply creased exterior. Even the base model drips with leather, its plastic and padded surfaces a cut above the Tahoe and Yukon. The Escalade Premium model is downright decadent, with more aromatic leather (Kona brown is beautiful) and wood than we’ve seen this side of a Rolls Royce.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56030" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The dashboard is dominated by Cadillac’s tablet-like CUE infotainment system, which can be frustrating; it’s difficult to navigate and the graphics are unattractive. The standard touchscreen is 8.0-inches (12.3-inch optional), moved by voice, capacitive touch or swipe gestures. CUE includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, as well as a Bose Centerpoint 2.0 audio system. Its digital gauges can be configured in four themes.</p>, <p>OnStar 4G LTE connectivity is standard, with a WiFi antenna for hotspot capability. A head-up display is available, as is rear seat entertainment with one or two screens.</p>, <p>The standard heated and cooled seats are nicely padded, with available suede trim, and it’s quieter than it used to be, thanks to pounds of sound deadening and Bose active noise cancellation.</p>, <p>The second- and third-row seats fold flat at the touch of a button, although the second row has to be raised by hand. The second row’s heated individual bucket seats are narrow and the padding is thin.</p>, <p>The cargo floor is high, because of that solid rear axle, but sometimes that’s easier on the back when you’re loading heavy things. There’s 15.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, 39.3 cubic feet with the ESV, having a wheelbase that’s longer by 14 inches. With the third row folded it’s 51.6 and 76.7 cubic feet, and with both rows down it’s a vast 94.2 and 120.9 cubic feet.</p>, <p>There’s also stellar storage for small things. The center console bin can hold a laptop, and there are many cubbies. It boasts a stretch of piano black plastic.</p>, <p>One of the interiors of the Platinum model is called Maple Sugar. Nearly every part of the cabin is covered with rich, supple, tan leather, making it feel like a vat of melted caramel.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56031" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-escalade-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The excellent 6.2-liter V8 is a truck engine that’s smooth, sonorous and fast. It’s refined and free of drama. It makes 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque, with seamless cylinder deactivation to run on just four cylinders when that’s all that’s needed. Just enough of the exhaust note from the engine makes its way into the cabin to remind you that it’s the same basic engine as in the Corvette and Camaro SS.</p>, <p>The new 10-speed automatic feels better in the V8 Escalade than it does in the turbocharged V6 Lincoln Navigator, with quick upshifts and almost invisible downshifts, during relaxed driving. When you hit the throttle the transmission will shift down harder, sometimes two or three gears at a time, but that’s normal. The new 10-speed is at least as good as the 8-speeds the Range Rover Sport SUV or BMW X5 crossover.</p>, <p>Magnetic Ride Control prevents most of the waddle and sway that makes body-on-frame SUVs feel so primitive. It’s tuned more for a smooth ride than carving corners. Even with the optional 22-inch wheels, the Escalade delivers a stable and comfortable ride that is decidedly not truck-like. Ruts and potholes don’t faze it. We could still feel them, but the shudder that runs through most body-on-frame SUVs is minimal.</p>, <p>At more than 6000 pounds, the Escalade is as heavy as they get. Still, it’s poised in corners, if not agile. You can feel the big SUV roll, squat and dive, because three tons can’t be disappeared, but the feelings aren’t intrusive. The motions are predictable and easy to live with; the Escalade is stable at high speeds on the freeway.</p>, <p>The suspension engineers also did a good job with the steering, with a slow and easy 17.3:1 steering ratio in the electric power steering. The weight of the steering is just right, The dead zone at neutral is fairly small. The car still feels connected to the front axle. The Range Rover and Mercedes-Benz GL-Class are more poised and nimble in curves, but the Escalade is not bad.</p>, <p>The Cadillac Escalade has some solid selling points, and for 2018 offers a silky new 10-speed automatic transmission to go with the beefy and satisfying V8. The styling is dated. It remains a large SUV capable of hauling passengers and their luggage in comfort or towing trailers.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-cadillac-xts/
[<p>The 2018 Cadillac XTS has a fresh look, with reworked front/rear fascia and a refined bumper design.</p>, <p>Fenders and the grille have been redesigned for 2018, joining new LED headlights. Chassis modifications promise improved ride quality, with increased sound insulation. Inside, upgrades to Cadillac’s CUE infotainment system yield quicker response, with updated graphics, personalized profiles, and smartphone-like navigation.</p>, <p>When the current-generation XTS emerged as a 2015 model, Cadillac took the traditional large-sedan concept and gave it an appealing, modern interpretation. This feat was accomplished without relying on nostalgia for the distant past. Still, the XTS has also become a latter-day substitute for Lincoln’s old Town Car, attracting limousine-service operators. Cadillac even offers a funeral coach.</p>, <p>Most XTS sedans come with a 3.6-liter V6 that develops 304 horsepower and 264 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>In the XTS V-Sport, a 410-horsepower, twin-turbo 3.6-liter V6 produces 369 pound-feet. Both engines mate with a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard. All-wheel drive is optional.</p>, <p>Four trim levels are available: XTS, Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Platinum, plus V-Sport Premium Luxury and Platinum models with twin-turbo power. Though equipped well in each trim level, an XTS can be packed full of posh features for additional cost. Platinum trim could almost be dubbed decadent, while the base XTS is set up well for limo duties.</p>, <p>Most trim levels can be fitted with a comprehensive set of collision-avoidance technology, but not much is standard. Crash-test results for the 2018 XTS are impressive. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the XTS five stars overall. Testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety yielded Good ratings in each category, though the tricky small-overlap test has not yet been given. Automatic full-speed emergency braking, if installed, gets a Superior score from IIHS. Bundled with adaptive cruise control in a Driver Assist Package, it’s available only for the top two trim levels. A Driver Awareness Package, including blind-spot monitoring and low-speed automatic emergency braking, is standard on upper models and available for the Luxury edition.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac XTS ($45,595) has the 304-horsepower V6, front-wheel drive, Magnetic Ride Control, Brembo front brakes, CUE infotainment, eight-speaker Bose audio, power front seats, leather seating surfaces, pushbutton, OnStar connectivity with a 4G LTE, and 19-inch alloy wheels. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge, taxes, cash allowances or discounts.)</p>, <p>XTS Luxury ($49,595) includes navigation, auto-dimming outside mirrors, automatic parking assist, heated front/rear seats, ventilated front seats, and a heated steering wheel. All-wheel drive ($2,000) is available.</p>, <p>XTS Premium Luxury ($56,095) comes with a head-up display, 12.3-inch configurable screen, tri-zone automatic climate control, 14-speaker Bose surround-sound, and adaptive forward lighting. The standard Driver Awareness Package includes forward collision and lane-departure warnings, lane-keeping assist, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-zone monitoring, and surround-view camera. All-wheel drive ($2,000) is optional.</p>, <p>XTS AWD V-Sport Premium Luxury ($64,095) has the 410-horsepower twin-turbo V6, 20-inch wheels, and all-wheel drive. XTS Platinum ($67,095) gets semi-aniline leather upholstery, 20-inch alloy wheels, more lavish interior trim, and front-wheel drive. XTS AWD V-Sport Platinum ($72,695) gets all-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56013" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xts-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Modest updating for 2018 maintains the upscale conservative appearance of the XTS, while improving its overall appeal. Nothing has changed in the body profile, but several details have been freshened.</p>, <p>No one is likely to call an XTS exuberant. Few will be directly reminded of oversize big Cadillacs of yesteryear, either. Designers melded curves and angles in a harmonious totality, while largely concealing the sedan’s relatively abundant dimensions.</p>, <p>Horizontal chrome elements have given the grille a cleaner appearance, in keeping with other Cadillac models. Even the front fenders have been revised.</p>, <p>Some cabins are best judged from the driver’s seat. For others, the most worthy assessments are made from the back seat. Cadillac’s XTS falls into the latter group.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56016" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xts-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Front occupants get plenty of space, on seats that are wide and flat, with abundant power adjustments. Seats may be short on bolstering, but the driver and front passenger can anticipate adequate support and all-day comfort. Visibility is helped by a seating position that’s a little higher than customary.</p>, <p>In back, three adults can expect vast room to stretch out in luxuriant comfort, while reveling in the lovely upholstery and detail work. Large rear doors make it easy to get in and out of the back seat. Headroom isn’t a concern for passengers over six feet tall.</p>, <p>Finishes are luxurious even in the base model, which flaunts generous leather. Surroundings reach past plush at Platinum trim level, which boasts glorious glossy wood as well as better-grade leather.</p>, <p>Traditional buttons are in short supply on the dashboard, which is highlighted by an 8.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment. Capacitive switches that control most functions can become frustrating.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56011" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-xts-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Strong V6 engines and a smooth-responding, well-behaved 6-speed automatic set the tone for satisfying performance in a big sedan. Regular models can accelerate to 60 mph in a respectable 6.8 seconds. An XTS feels passably swift, but might be a tad overmatched when fully packed.</p>, <p>For a more sizzling big-car experience, the twin-turbo V6 in V-Sport editions is the logical choice. That one can hit 60 mph in just over 5 seconds.</p>, <p>No XTS is really meant for dashing through serious curves, but the more taut-feeling V-Sport comes close to qualifying as a sport sedan. Every XTS V-Sport has all-wheel drive, which helps the sedan make best use of the additional engine power.</p>, <p>What makes any XTS a great cruising machine isn’t its handling talents, so much as its magnificent ride quality. Available Magnetic Ride Control, with a rear air suspension, smooths the ride further yet.</p>, <p>Except when braking, an XTS doesn’t feel as hefty as its two-ton weight suggests. Even with standard Brembo front brakes, nosedive is noticeable at times. V-Sport models feel a little more agile, helped by a firmer suspension.</p>, <p>Fuel economy isn’t bad for a large sedan. With front-wheel drive, the 2017 V6 was EPA-rated at 18/28 mpg City/Highway, or 22 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive dropped the estimate to 17/26/20 mpg. The V-Sport managed only 16/23 mpg City/Highway, or 18 mpg Combined. All versions run on regular-grade gasoline.</p>, <p>Ride comfort is a strong selling point for big sedans, and the XTS scores highly. All versions, led by the base model, are quite well-equipped. For performance, V-Sports are the prime choice, but prices are hefty. Valuable active-safety features are available, but mainly at additional cost and limited to specific trim levels.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-acura-rlx/
[<p>The 2018 Acura RLX sedan features subtly revised styling that improves its looks and upgraded interior materials. The standard V6 model gets a new 10-speed transmission.</p>, <p>RLX offers two drivetrains: front-wheel-drive V6 or all-wheel-drive hybrid gas-electric.</p>, <p>The standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 that’s been in the RLX since 2014, making 310 horsepower. It’s front-wheel drive, and for 2018 gets a new 10-speed automatic, replacing the previous 6-speed. It gets an EPA-rated 20 mpg City, 29 Highway, or 23 Combined.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56004" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-2.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-2.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-2-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The available hybrid powertrain borrows technology from the spectacular Acura NSX sports car/supercar. The all-wheel-drive RLX Sport Hybrid combines the 3.5-liter V6 with a paddle-shifting 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and three electric motors for a total of 377 horsepower. The hybrid rates 28/29/28 mpg, indicating it’s much more efficient around town.</p>, <p>Premium gasoline is required for both models.</p>, <p>Safety equipment includes rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, and lane departure warning. RLX Sport Hybrids add a surround-view camera system and parking sensors. For 2018, there is Traffic-jam Assist, which provides some autonomous driving by following the car ahead at speeds up to 40 mph. Safety scores are top-notch with five stars in every test from the NHTSA, and a top Good score in every test from the IIHS, who make the RLX a Top Safety Pick.</p>, <p>The 2018 Acura RLX ($55,865) comes with leather upholstery, heated power front seats, keyless ignition, navigation, ELS premium audio, and the safety equipment.</p>, <p>The RLX Sport Hybrid ($62,865) adds surround-view camera system, heated rear seats, cooled front seats, front and rear parking sensors, and 14-speaker Krell audio with crystal-clear sound.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56003" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The new hood has more character lines, and the new grille has a handsome diamond pattern. The grille and LED lighting resembles that on the MDX sport utility vehicle. In the rear, LED taillamps trace a ribbon of light around the corners. It’s the most dramatic thing about the styling. There’s also a rear diffuser in glossy black plastic. Liberal use of brightwork adds flash.</p>, <p>The styling is improved, but it’s banal, resembling the last-generation Honda Accord. You have to park a 2018 RLX beside a 2017 RLX to recognize a difference. Competitors like the Audi A7 hatchback and Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan flaunt extravagant curves to make the RLX forgettable.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56007" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Compared again to the Audi A7 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the wide cabin of the RLX falls short in the lavish department. Fit and finish are good, but the cabin lacks passion. The low dash is a design of twin arcs around the center console, but there’s no design theme apparent.</p>, <p>The front seats are more supportive for 2018, and they are cozy, with contrasting stitching; there’s a new shade we like for 2018 called Espresso. The front seats are heated and have 12-way power support. On the Sport Hybrid, the front seats are cooled.</p>, <p>In the front, there’s excellent kneeroom and headroom, while the passenger footwell is wide and flat.</p>, <p>The rear isn’t so good. Wide door openings make entry and exit easy, and the seat cushions are supportive and shaped well, but the sloped roofline limits rear headroom. Tall passengers graze the headliner, a problem uncommon to sedans this size.</p>, <p>There’s good storage space in the cabin, but the trunk is small, at 14.9 cubic feet. The Sport Hybrid has even less, 12 cubic feet, although that’s more than last year, thanks to a reshaped battery pack.</p>, <p>The dual-screen infotainment system is aged, if not ancient. With the two screens functioning differently, it’s neither fluid nor intuitive. The good news is there are a lot of buttons and switches, so it can be largely avoided. RLX models do not offer Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56006" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-rlx-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The V6 comes with a new 10-speed automatic. With 310 horsepower, the RLX accelerates with just a small amount of urgency.</p>, <p>As for handling, the front-wheel-drive RLX leans into corners casually. At low speeds, it uses rear-wheel steering, as sensors on the rear wheels turn them in the opposite direction of the front wheels.</p>, <p>It absorbs bumps without fuss. It’s not the kind of car that needs an adaptive suspension as found on some rivals.</p>, <p>The Sport Hybrid takes the 3.5-liter V6 and combines it with three electric motors, two 27-kw motors in the rear differential to drive each rear wheel, and the third for the front wheels, thus all-wheel drive. The powerplant makes a combined 377 horsepower and 341 pound-feet of torque. It responds quickly, and accelerates with the thrust of an electric car; the zoom feel endless. The electric motors seem to make the shifts of the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission smoother.</p>, <p>The power perpetually shifts between wheels, as determined by sensors, for optimum traction and grip, amounting to torque vectoring. We found the traction in rain with the all-wheel drive outstanding.</p>, <p>The steering in the 2018 RLX Sport Hybrid that we drove felt heavier than the 2017 RLX models with V6 engines we have driven. The light touch at higher speeds was gone. It remained light at low speeds, thanks to that rear-wheel steering, but got heavier and stayed that way on the highway, including in corners.</p>, <p>The well-tuned suspension on the hybrid is excellent at damping a wide range of bumps, again without being electronically or otherwise adaptive. The creamy ride comes on soft springs and absorbent tires.</p>, <p>The Acura RLX is a smooth and comfortable sedan for the daily commute. It doesn’t stand out in the class, however, with unexciting looks, a dated, uninteresting cabin, and a less-than-thrilling V6. Ride quality is great, handling is benign. The Sport Hybrid stands out for its mechanical ingenuity.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review; with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bentley-bentayga/
[<p>The Bentley Bentayga is the first SUV by that carmaker, sharing the structure and wheelbase of the Audi Q7, but with a slightly wider track. It looks all Bentley. Its cabin, excessive in leather and wood, matches the opulence of the Bentley Continental and approaches the ceremony of the Mulsanne.</p>, <p>It has no rivals, although Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini have SUVs in the works. Range Rover, Porsche Cayenne, and Audi Q7 are less expensive.</p>, <p>The Bentayga made its debut in 2016, and in 2017 an uber-extravagant model called the Mulliner was added; it doesn’t change much for 2018, adding only an appearance package with black wheels and more chrome, and another package with a third row. Standard seating is for four, with an uncomfortable hump for a fifth passenger. But you can get it without the hump.</p>, <p>The Bentayga is about power. Under its long hood lives a twin-turbo 12-cylinder engine, not a V12, but rather a W12, like two V6s attached at the hip rather than lined up in a train. It makes 600 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque, using all of it to accelerate from zero to sixty in 4.0 seconds, a stunning time considering the vehicle weighs a humongous 5380 pounds. It’s all-wheel drive, and uses a seamless 8-speed automatic transmission. Its air suspension keeps the ride expectedly smooth, while its active anti-roll bar system keep the cornering amazingly flat.</p>, <p>The starting price of about $200,000 is also humongous and also not surprising. If you think 200 grand is a lot, try 300 for the Mulliner. It takes 130 hours to assemble a Bentayga, six times longer than most cars.</p>, <p>Considering that it weighs more than a big pickup truck and is faster than all but a few sports cars, its EPA fuel mileage of 15 Combined miles per gallon doesn’t sound half bad.</p>, <p>Bentley says that it’s planning a plug-in hybrid version of the Bentayga.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55996" height="142" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-hybrid.jpg" width="200"/>Onyx, Activity, Signature, Black, and Mulliner. These models run the gamut from $195,000 to $298,000. Pick your level of opulence. You can get specific about it, with a choice of more than 100 colors, 15 shades of leather, 7 wood veneers, 10 wheel styles, more interior trims than we counted.</p>, <p>There’s good complement of the usual active safety features, including night vision.</p>, <p>The packages are City, Touring, Event, All-Terrain, Activity, Sunshine, and Blackline. Bentley calls them Specifications. City Specification adds pedestrian detection systems and parking assistants; Activity Specification, new for 2018, adds a small third row and a tow bar; Sunshine Specification adds double sun visors. Also new, Blackline adds 22-inch black wheels and chrome exterior trim.</p>, <p>Mulliner gets self-centering hubcaps, two-tone trim, a self-winding clock, welcome lamps, veneer-trimmed picnic tables, lambswool rugs, a bottle chiller, and two handcrafted crystal champagne glasses.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55998" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Bentayga is elegant and graceful, and looks at home in the family. Its long hood travels to the big windscreen up to a sweeping roofline that drops back down to a long deck and dramatic rear fenders draping the rear tires. The bulging and handsome hips remind us of the Bentley Continental.</p>, <p>The aluminum sides are stamped by a sophisticated process; the result is one of the biggest single pieces of aluminum in carmaking.</p>, <p>Superformed front fenders turn into a uniform front fascia. The honeycomb grille and big round headlamps are reserved and beautifully detailed. The cameras and sensors that guide the car are hidden.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55997" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cockpit, awash in opulence, feels appropriate for a trip to to Buckingham Palace. It’s driver-oriented, and stamped with Bentley touches such as the stout shift lever and piano-stop vent controls. The surfaces are plentifully detailed, in other words busy. The different woods, black trim and stitched leather all blend without restraint.</p>, <p>The front and rear seats (at least for two people) are good. The front legroom is the same as in the Audi Q7, while the rear seats provide two more inches of legroom. But that’s when the front seats are slid forward. Those 22-way adjustable seats can quickly erase rear legroom. Behind the rear seat there is 15.2 cubic feet of cargo space, with a space in the rear seatback for long things like skis.</p>, <p>A third row of seats is available for 2018. It’s similar to the third row in the Q7, which is for kids only.</p>, <p>Options include a quilted tailgate bench.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55995" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-bentayga-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 6.0-liter twin-turbo W12 engine makes 600 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque, mated to a smooth 8-speed automatic, with all-wheel drive. The 5379-pound SUV handles its lightning-quick acceleration of zero to sixty in four seconds astonishingly well. The standard air suspension keeps the tank flat in the corners. In fact, the chassis engineers had to tone the system down because it seemed to defy the laws of physics; in testing, they said it felt downright unnatural for such a big machine to corner like a go-kart.</p>, <p>The active anti-rollbar system responds in milliseconds, and the all-wheel-drive system adapts with ease to snow, ice, or wet grass at the fox hunt. You feel the car’s weight more under hard acceleration and braking than in the corners. Despite its giant 6.0 liters, the engine is compact, and that helps the cornering.</p>, <p>As for the acceleration, the Bentayga’s brilliant response and quickness come from its aggressive throttle mapping; engineers there didn’t compromise for little-old-lady drivers. If you floor it, you’ll get all 664 pound-feet of torque, every time. It will make the driver’s face light up and the passenger’s neck snap.</p>, <p>Brilliant engine, seamless 8-speed automatic, and absolutely astonishing cornering. It’s the ultimate SUV. But compare to the Range Rover, Cayenne, and Q7 before buying.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review; with staff reports from The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-tesla-model-x/
[<p>Introduced as a 2015 model, the Tesla Model X battery-powered luxury crossover vehicle is now in its fourth model year. Little has changed for the 2018 model year. The available Autopilot system now demands that drivers pay closer attention to driving.</p>, <p>Tesla does not use conventional trim levels. Three Model X versions are offered, with different battery capacities and operating ranges. Each is powered by dual electric motors (one for each axle), driving all four wheels. A lithium-ion battery pack sits beneath the cabin floor.</p>, <p>The 75D model contains a 75 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack, with a range of 237 miles and 0-60 mph acceleration in 4.9 seconds. The 100D version upgrades to a 100-kWh battery pack, promising a 295-mile range and 4.7-second acceleration to 60 mph. Topping the line, the considerably more costly P100D performance model also holds a 100-kWh battery pack, but gets a more powerful electric motor. Range is estimated at 289 miles, while acceleration to 60 mph is simply stunning, achieved in as little as 2.9 seconds.</p>, <p>Actual range varies according to conditions, but any of the three should be capable of traveling more than 200 miles before recharging. Partial recharging at a Supercharger station take 30 minutes, permitting about 170 more miles of driving. More than 8,000 Supercharger stations are currently available.</p>, <p>In 75D and 100D models, the two motors are each rated at 193 kilowatts (259 horsepower) The high-performance P100D gets a vastly more powerful rear motor, rated at 375 kilowatts (503 horsepower). The P version also features significant upgrades to its electronics systems.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is standard. Cabins may be set up for five-, six-, or seven-passenger seating.</p>, <p>Falcon Wing doors are undeniably the most prominent feature, installed instead of conventional rear doors. Some observers may admire their innovative design, while others are sure to brand them gimmicky.</p>, <p>Tesla’s Model X has earned the highest crash-test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with an overall five-star rating and five stars in each separate category. The Model X has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Tesla calls it the “safest SUV ever.”</p>, <p>A rearview camera and a dozen airbags are standard. Advanced safety features include active lane control, blind-spot monitoring, and automatic emergency braking. Tesla’s Autopilot system lets the car essentially drive itself, under certain conditions on well-marked roads.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55988" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-final.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Tesla Model X 75D ($79,500) comes with 14-way heated power front seats, five-passenger seating, a power liftgate, LED ambient lighting, dual-zone automatic climate control, 240-watt nine-speaker audio, wi-fi connectivity, and Bluetooth. Both the rear cargo area and the front trunk can be opened remotely. (Prices do not include $1,200 destination charge.)</p>, <p>100D AWD ($96,000) is similar, but with a higher-rated battery pack (100 kWh).</p>, <p>P100D AWD ($140,000) gets the powertrain with the quickest acceleration, courtesy of a far more powerful rear electric motor and electronics upgrades.</p>, <p>Adding a two-seat third row for seven-passenger capacity is available ($3,000), along with a six-seat version ($6,000). Autopilot is optional ($5,000).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55991" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Design is not the Model X’s high point, weighed against the company’s sleek and striking Model S sedan. Shunning the squarish, boxy profile of a typical large crossover SUV, the Model X has been shaped for efficiency, reducing its aerodynamic drag coefficient to a slippery 0.25.</p>, <p>Still, the Model X is readily recognizable as a Tesla, led by its flat, grille-free front end. Instead of a vertical tailgate, the crossover gets a steeply-angled hatch. Chrome door handles extend automatically as the driver approaches. When underway, they retract flush to the body.</p>, <p>Without doubt, Falcon Wing doors are the most notable exterior feature. Instead of conventional side-hinged back doors, large side panels pivot upward from the roof’s center. They take quite a while to open and don’t always wind up perfectly aligned. Potential passengers need to stand some distance away, too. Some owners have reported finicky operation of the sensors that prevent the heavy doors from closing on a person.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55989" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Less spacious than it appears from the outside, the Model X benefits from a light, airy cabin that feels quite tall. A huge 17-inch touchscreen dominates the front compartment.</p>, <p>Some adaptations had to be made, such as sunvisors that have to be unrolled from inside the pillars. Trim elements that include leather and suede surfaces, dark wood, and matte silver convey a premium ambience, appropriate for this Tesla’s lofty price.</p>, <p>Front seats are comfortable, with multiple adjustments and a driving position that’s higher than customary. A Model X can be fitted with either five, six, or seven seats. In three-row versions, the rear seat is truly suitable for two passengers. The third-row seat is available with either a three-person bench or two individual seats in the second row.</p>, <p>Cargo room is good considering the vehicle’s rounded shape, totaling 88 cubic feet for the five-passenger configuration.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55987" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-model-x-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Model X riders can look forward to a remarkably smooth ride, quiet and comfortable, complemented by excellent roadholding.</p>, <p>Tesla’s standard air suspension copes well with a variety of pavement surfaces. Massive 20-inch tires help provide an appealing balance between tenacious grip and quiet travel, permitting the Model X to remain predictably flat through corners and curves.</p>, <p>Because the Model X is a heavyweight, checking in at well over 2.5 tons, its heft can be noticeable as the electronic systems strive to maintain unmarred stability. Weight distribution at an even 50/50 (front/rear) helps with handling. Model X can tow as much as 5,000 pounds, though doing so shrinks operating range considerably.</p>, <p>Acceleration ranks as remarkable for a family crossover. Essentially, the Model X performs like a taller Model S sedan, with electric motors providing nearly-instantaneous torque.</p>, <p>Paying the price for the super-performance P100D quickens 0-60 mph acceleration to barely-believable times: as little as 2.9 seconds, when the mode selector is switched to aptly named Ludicrous position.</p>, <p>In addition to emitting no pollutants, the battery-powered Model X earns the top rating for energy efficiency. Depending on model, the Model X is EPA-rated at 85 to 93 MPGe (equivalent miles per gallon).</p>, <p>Driving at steady highway speed reduces stated range by 20 percent or more. Winter temperatures have a similar impact. Tesla’s navigation system automatically routes drivers through convenient Supercharger sites, which provide quick partial recharging.</p>, <p>For now, at least, Tesla’s costly but compelling Model X is the only long-range battery-powered family crossover SUV available. Apart from the arguably gimmicky Falcon Wing back doors, which could annoy, it provides quiet, quick, and pleasant motoring.

[<p>The Acura NSX is one of the most complex cars ever made, a masterful blending of electric motors, batteries, turbos, servos, clutches, gears, and last but not least, an internal combustion engine. The body structure is state of the art, aluminum and composite panels, with an available carbon-fiber roof. It was designed like a racecar, around aerodynamics, downforce and cooling.</p>, <p>Yet, it’s the easiest supercar we have ever driven. It is very easy to drive fast, smooth and precise in the NSX. It would be perfectly comfortable as a daily commuter.</p>, <p>NSX was all new for 2017, after being away for a generation (and that’s in people years).</p>, <p>The NSX can compete on engineering levels with other supercars like the McLaren P1 and Porsche 918 Spyder, though no in terms of performance. Its real-world rivals are more down-to-earth cars like the Ferrari 408GTB, Audi R8, Porsche 911 Turbo, or BMW i8. It can accelerate from zero to sixty in a mind-blowing three seconds flat, and hit a top speed of 191 miles per hour, yet it’s tame around town, smooth, quiet, tractable, easy.</p>, <p>The Acura NSX measures 176 inches long, with a wheelbase of 103.5 inches, shorter than that of a Honda Civic. The NSX sits low, at 47.8 inches in height, and wide, at 87.3 inches. It’s a heavy sports car, at 3803 pounds, despite its lightweight structure, because of the complex equipment that rides along and supplies the juice.</p>, <p>Its twin-turbocharged 75-degree 3.5-liter V6 engine makes 500 horsepower, mated to a 9-speed dual-clutch transmission. The engine uses both direct injection and port injection; the turbos provide 15.2 psi of boost, using electric wastegate control. A 47-horsepower electric motor can add power to the engine or be a generator to charge the lithium-ion battery. The battery is mounted vertically behind the driver, giving the chassis a front/rear weight ratio of 42/58 percent.</p>, <p>There’s another twin motor located front center, between the seats, and it can drive the car on its own at a low speed. It provides 36 horsepower to the front wheels while varying the power between them, which Acura calls Super Handling-All Wheel Drive. The setup helps with turn-in for high-speed corners.</p>, <p>Total output from all the motors and engine is 573 hp.</p>, <p>The V6 is mounted longitudinally in the car’s aluminum spaceframe, over the rear axle. The engine uses a dry sump oil system that prevents oil starvation from centrifugal force in the corners during hard driving on the track.</p>, <p>The suspension is aluminum double-wishbone with active adaptive magnetic-fluid dampers. The electric power steering is variable ratio. Front brakes are six-piston Brembo with 14.5-inch ventilated rotors and two-piece calipers, rears use four-piston monoblock calipers and 14-inch ventilated rotors. The standard tires are Continental Conti-Sport Contact 5P, 245/35R19s front and 305/30R20s rear. Pirelli tires are an option, as are soft Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for the track.</p>, <p>The Integrated Dynamics System offers four modes: Quiet, Sport, Sport Plus, Track. The driver can set the quickness of the steering, brakes (mechanical and regenerative), stability control, shock absorbers, engine, transmission, and SH-AWD. Quiet mode goes for fuel mileage and allows electric driving at slow speeds while restricting revs to 4000 rpm. It rates 21 miles per gallon, City or Highway, by the EPA.</p>, <p>The NSX is hand-built in the U.S. at Honda’s factory in Ohio.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55979" height="98" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-nsx-walk.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Acura NSX ($156,000)  comes standard with just about everything luxury, including LED ambient interior lighting and an infotainment system with seven-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth audio streaming, two USB ports, HD radio, Siri Eyes Free voice control, Apple Car Play, and Google Android Auto. But not satellite radio. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1800 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Other equipment includes a multi-angle rearview camera, hill-start assist, front and front side airbags, curtain side airbags with rollover sensors, anti-lock brakes, traction control, stability control, and a tire-pressure monitor. High-tech safety features such as adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warnings, or automatic emergency braking aren’t available.</p>, <p>The price can grow to $200,000 with options like carbon-ceramic brakes; carbon-fiber roof, engine cover and rear spoiler; or Alcantara headliner. A Technology Package adds a nine-speaker ELS audio system, navigation, AcuraLink telematics service, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55978" height="97" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-nsx-styling.jpg" width="200"/>The NSX is a sharp, clean wedge with an unfortunate extreme and cartoonish grille that destroys any classic supercar style. It can’t touch the Ferrari for class and immaculate shape. But maybe the grille is appropriate because it serves to announce that this car is nothing if not a huge, successful compromise. It shouts out of a very big mouth, “I’m the hottest and flashiest Acura ever made!”</p>, <p>The massive mesh air intakes at the corners are fine, in that they are powerfully functional; and the framed wing-like LED lights are thin and lovely. But that grille steals your attention while at the same time making you want to turn away, like scary clown lips.</p>, <p>From the side and three-quarter rear it looks fabulous. Especially from the rear, because it has gorgeous clean hips, broad and chiseled fenders that begin the wedge forward. And the side has sharp aerodynamic edges, with cool ducts all over the place.</p>, <p>Air flows over the low roof and down the backlight, guided into the engine bay and to the clutch cooler, through cooling ducts on the rear fenders; the air comes out through large ducts at the rear. Aerodynamic downforce is generated by a conservative spoiler, a diffuser, and telegraphic taillight slots.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55981" height="300" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-nsx-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Acura interior designers worked hard on cabin ergonomics, so much that Acura came up with a design name for it: human-centric. One example of this human-centrism (we would call it plain old “user friendly”) is that a very tall driver, as tall as six-foot-six, can fit in the car. His head doesn’t hit the roof and his legs fit under the steering wheel and onto the pedals. However, the standard four-way manual seat, with a fixed bottom cushion, isn’t as humanly centric as the optional power leather-and-suede seat with lumbar adjustment.</p>, <p>Somehow the designers missed making the shift lever either human-centric or user friendly. There are paddle shifters, which you’re pretty much forced to use because there’s no lever for the right hand. The transmission is otherwise controlled with pushbuttons, like those in other Acura products.</p>, <p>Another example of human-centrism is the basic arrangement of controls on the center console. Acura calls it Simple Sports Interface. But the 8.0-inch digital display isn’t exactly centered around the human, or even pointed toward him or her; the virtual gauges hang on an odd plane, tilted away from the driver. The screen has a big tach that displays in different colors, based on the driving mode.</p>, <p>The flat-topped and flat-bottomed steering wheel contains controls that function a second screen, for the audio and available navigation. Around that screen there are swaths of metallic trim that also outline the dashboard and the rest of the controls. So is a carbon-fiber trim kit that looks just like similar treatments in other luxury and performance cars. That is to say, relentlessly showy and somewhat inexpensive.</p>, <p>Metallic trim notwithstanding, the cabin is plush, with a lot of leather and Alcantara. Lightly treated leather is available.</p>, <p>With the width of the NSX, there’s good room for occupants, but not so much for luggage or cargo. The trunk is tiny, at 4.4 cubic feet. And while the forward visibility is excellent, with thin windshield pillars and a low dash, the rearward visibility is wretched, with thick rear pillars and the low seating position. The standard multi-angle rearview camera, and parking sensors, are all the driver has to back up. Look at it this way: you never have to turn your head.</p>, <p>The sounds inside the cabin are sweet, including sweet quiet, if that’s what you like, in Quiet mode. There’s also a tube carrying the exhaust into the cabin, if that’s what you like. The irony is that the natural exhaust, heard from the outside, is ordinary, un-supercar-like. It’s enhanced in the cabin. So you’re kind of fooled into thinking your car sounds cool, when it’s really boring to others.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55980" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-nsx-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-nsx-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-nsx-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Acura says that their engineers spent years working on algorithms that simulate the truest driving signals, to develop the car that synthesizes those signals. Digging deep into a computer to make reality feel real? It’s not real already? Certainly the original NSX was superbly and spectacularly real; but of course, it merely had an engine, gearbox, chassis suspension, and steering, all of which performed brilliantly.</p>, <p>We know, after driving the new NSX on the track, that the seat-of-the-pants experience feels real enough. So we’re not saying that this paradoxical creativity didn’t work. All we’re saying is it’s weird.</p>, <p>The handling is progressive, which is how the car can be both a tame grocery-getter and scorching supercar. It can be driven in traffic at 30 mph without being difficult, and it can be driven quickly without feeling loose, pushy, or twitchy. It’s seamless between the two places. On the track it likes to driven rhythmically, early turn-in and throttle lift, stable under braking while turning.</p>, <p>Of course, given that there are four modes, there are four driving behaviors.</p>, <p>In Quiet mode, the NSX runs on electric power as much as it can, under 4000 rpm. Sport, the default mode, quickens throttle and shift response, raises the revs, and begins the piping of engine sounds into the cabin.</p>, <p>In Sport Plus, the display around the tach changes from blue and grey to yellow and red, and the car offers up the full 474 foot-pounds of torque, more sound into the cabin, and heavier steering.</p>, <p>In Track mode, the sound pipes open wide, the air conditioning and audio system goes blank, and launch control is enabled. Track mode maintains the battery 60 percent of full charge, to keep the performance the same from lap to lap. The transmission holds the lower gears in corners, and only upshifts on the straights. It’s programmed so well that it’s hard to be quicker by using the paddles. We accept it, but we’re not sure we like it. It reduces the driver to a point-and-steer robot. Well, the driver is still allowed to gas and brake, but with stability control and anti-lock brakes, the car prevents him or her from going too far. Maybe a better word would be that it protects the driver.</p>, <p>The big Brembo brakes impressively combine mechanical and electric power, regenerated from the motors and regulated by the mode. And electric servo combines the motor braking with friction braking to provide predictable and steady braking. Sensors translate the speed and pressure of the driver’s foot to the resistance of the pedal, and it’s nearly perfect.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive system covers for unsmooth or over-aggressive driving, trading off some pinpoint precision. A misjudged turn-in point can induce some understeer, but the stability systems quickly catch it. If your rhythm is correct, the car will respond with precision. Lift, brake, steer smoothly, and the front motors cleanly blend torque to the outside wheel.</p>, <p>Coming out of a turn at speed, you roll on the throttle, unwind the steering wheel, and the NSX will race away from the apex feeling totally neutral. The front motors provide torque or limit spin, while the limited-slip rear differential keeps the rears planted. You can choose how sticky you want to get, with the tires; as in Formula 1, you have hard, medium, and soft, with Continental, Pirelli, or Michelin. Well, in F1 it’s soft, medium soft, and super soft, but who’s counting.</p>, <p>The NSX is spectacularly fast, brakes perfectly, and handles impeccably. But for us, we’d like our supercar to be more of a beast. While not being so ugly, the face, not the profile. We don’t love the artificial high-tech instrumentation, and soulless exhaust note.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report; with New Car Test Drive editor Mitch McCullough reporting from Monticello, New York; and TCC staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Alfa Romeo 4C can be seen as a fabulous value when compared to a Ferrari or Lamborghini. Like those exotics, it looks sensational, with performance obviously being the top priority. It’s made of carbon fiber and the cornering is phenomenal.</p>, <p>Ride comfort is rough, comparable to a Lotus Elise. It only seats two and only has cargo room for a couple of small bags. Cabin materials are a cut below, but the price is three or four cuts down. It’s a car for a serious sports car enthusiast willing to compromise comfort and convenience for racecar handling.</p>, <p>The engine is a 1.7-liter turbocharged four cylinder making 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. For ideal balance, engine is mid-mounted, so naturally it’s rear-wheel drive. The carbon-fiber structure means it’s super light for quick handling, and its tires offer fantastic grip. It can be driven off the showroom floor straight onto the race track. That said, its cramped seats, rigid ride, and heavy steering at slow speeds make it difficult to endure as a daily driver.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55971" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-4c-spider.jpg" width="200"/>The 4C comes as a coupe or Spider convertible with a removable soft top that can be stored in the tiny trunk.</p>, <p>The 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C has not changed much over 2017, just yellow stitching for the optional black leather seats, and available carbon-fiber vents in the front fascia.</p>, <p>The 4C gets a strong 24 City, 34 Highway, or 28 Combined miles per gallon, on Premium, say EPA estimates. It has dual front airbags, front side airbags, a driver’s knee airbag, and hill-start assist, while rear park assist is the only safety option. That means no active safety features are available.</p>, <p>The 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C comes with air conditioning, power windows and locks, automatic headlamps, cloth sport seats with four-way manual adjustment, leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel, 7.0-inch digital instrument cluster with telemetry and a G meter; also a USB port, auxiliary input jack, 12-volt power outlet. The wheels are staggered 17- and 18-inch alloys on summer performance tires. The standard audio system is a primitive Alpine AM/FM/CD radio with satellite and HD, but fortunately there’s a premium Alpine system available.</p>, <p>Options start with a Convenience group that adds cruise control, an alarm, and rear park assist. A Carbon Fiber Interior package adds carbon fiber for the interior vents, instrument panel bezel and surround, and shift bezel. A Leather Interior package adds a leather-wrapped instrument panel and door panels, plus black (with red or new yellow accent stitching) or red leather seats and a leather storage bag.</p>, <p>Performance options include a Track package, which adds a racing suspension with front and rear sway bars, stiffer shocks, a flat-bottom steering wheel with a micro fiber insert, a carbon-fiber rear spoiler, and carbon-fiber exterior mirrors. Also available are staggered 18- and 19-inch wheels, an Akrapovic exhaust, xenon headlamps, and brake calipers painted red, black, silver, or yellow.</p>, <p>The 4C is striking, with a low and racy stance showing off its exotic curves and scoops. Its lines flow beautifully away from the iconic triangular Alfa Romeo grille to the rear haunches that make it look ready to pounce.</p>, <p>Alfa Romeo says the design was inspired by the 33 Stradale racecar of the 1960s. When we looked it up, we were impressed with how Alfa hit the mark. Bravissimo!</p>, <p>The nose features big intakes and dark oblong headlamps, the sides have glass like cat’s eyes, and the tail has round lamps and a spoiler.</p>, <p>The coupe’s profile is smoother than the Spider convertible. It features a transparent engine cover like a Ferrari, while the Spider has a Targa bar, a lower rear deck, and a canvas top that can be removed or installed in a few minutes, and stashed in the trunk. The Spider offers a removable carbon fiber roof panel, and with it off, the Spider looks more like a Targa than a roadster. Which one? We can’t decide.</p>, <p>The cramped cabin has few creature comforts and scant storage, not even a glovebox. It’s difficult to climb into and out of. The plastics on the dash are door panels are hard, and the radio looks like it came from a discount store; it takes options to cure that. But the flat-bottomed steering wheel and the carbon-fiber accents are cool. The digital gauges change colors with the driving mode: red for Dynamic, gray for Natural and blue for All Weather. It’s called a DNA switch, get it?</p>, <p>That cramped cabin is a compromise for performance, as the carbon-fiber tub requires wide door sills that take up space. That and the low stance and slim seats are what make entry and exit challenging. The head room is actually decent inside, with enough room for a helmet. The seats are suitable for only the slim.</p>, <p>And with a mere 3.7 cubic feet of space in the trunk, it’s hard to call it a trunk.</p>, <p>You forget about all that inconvenience and discomfort when you get the 4C on a twisty road, preferably a smooth one. We think it offers more feedback to the driver than any other new car, with the Lotus Elise no longer in the picture. That manual steering that feels heavy at slow speeds turns totally responsive in quick corners, bringing the car’s agility home. It’s surgically precise, with just 2.7 turns lock to lock.</p>, <p>The braking distance is brilliant, from 60 miles per hour to full stop in less than 100 feet. The Brembo system is so capable that the 4C can be made to squirm under late-braking from high speed to a slow corner. The vented front discs are 12 inches in diameter with four-piston calipers, and the vented rears 11.5 inches with two-piston calipers. Not surprisingly, the pedal feel is very firm and there is little travel.</p>, <p>It’s all about balance and light weight. The 4C tips the scales at a mere 2465 pounds, which is 500 pounds lighter than the Porsche 718 Boxster, 830 pounds lighter than the Chevrolet Corvette, and 900 pounds lighter than the Jaguar F-Type.</p>, <p>The 1.7-liter turbocharged four (1750cc, to be exact) makes 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. It doesn’t use a muffler, which makes it raucous although not too loud for the street. There is some turbo lag, but the 4C can still squirt from zero to sixty in 4.1 seconds, but feels even faster because it’s so low. It sends power to the rear wheels through a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission that shifts in a lightning-quick 130 milliseconds. Still, a manual transmission would be fun in a car like this.</p>, <p>The suspension uses mostly aluminum components, with double wishbones in front and MacPherson struts in the rear. It’s quite stiff, with the standard staggered 17- and 18-inch wheels, and even stiffer with the Track package: more rigid dampers and anti-roll bars, with staggered 18- and 19- inch wheels. That package adds a Race mode that holds the transmission shifts for a longer time, makes downshifts even quicker, and turns off the stability control.</p>, <p>Thanks to the carbon-fiber tub, on the track the Spider feels as rigid as the coupe. The Spider has a carbon-fiber windshield frame to help with the rigidity, as well. It’s only 12 pounds heavier than the coupe, although we’re not sure where that comes from, since unlike other roadsters, the chassis is the same as the coupe. The Spider’s ride height is one-tenth of an inch lower than the coupe’s, and it’s roof height is one-tenth of an inch higher.</p>, <p>At Laguna Seca we found the 4C inspired sufficient confidence at speed that we took Turn 1 flat out on our second lap around. In most cars, it takes us a few laps to build up the courage for that.</p>, <p>We won’t say the 4C is only fun when you’re driving it hard on a twisty road. We’ll say it’s not comfortable. But it is SO comfortable on that twisty road, it might all be worth it. Take that silly “comfort” and “convenience” thing out of it, and the 4C is perfect: stunning racy Italian looks, beautiful small turbo engine, fabulous twin-clutch transmission, rigid carbon-fiber chassis, mid-engine balance, and most of all, maybe the quickest and most precise steering of any sports car on the road.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report; with New Car Test Drive editor Mitch McCullough reporting from Monterey, California.</p>]

[<p>The Jaguar XJ, the renowned British automaker’s flagship model, stands out among full-size luxury sedans for its sporty character and road manners, benefits partly attributable to lightweight aluminum construction.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year a new high-output V8-powered XJR575 takes the place of the XJR. Modifications to engine calibration have raised output from Jaguar’s supercharged 5.0-liter V8 from 550 to 575 horsepower. Torque output totals 517 pound-feet.</p>, <p>Other XJ versions get some aerodynamic tweaks outside, complemented by some styling touches within the cabin. Touch Pro infotainment, with 4G Wi-Fi, gets a new, larger (10-inch) central touchscreen. Rear-drive XJ models gain lane-keep assist and driver drowsiness monitoring, to complement their intelligent automatic. Jaguar’s All-Surface Progress Control system works like low-speed cruise control, to get the XJ moving on low-grip surfaces.</p>, <p>The new XJR575 boasts unique interior touches and aerodynamic exterior upgrades. Side sills, the rear spoiler, front bumper and lower air intakes feature gloss black surrounds. Twin louvers identify the hood, and 20-inch black wheels are joined by red brake calipers. Inside is diamond-quilted seat upholstery.</p>, <p>Each regular engine comes in a choice of two trim levels: V6-powered XJ R-Sport and XJL Portfolio, plus V8-powered XJ Supercharged and XJL Supercharged. The 3.0-liter V6 develops 340 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque, while the 5.0-liter V8 generates 470 horsepower and 424 pound-feet. Both engines mate with an 8-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is optional for V6 models.</p>, <p>Jaguar offers short- and long-wheelbase body styles. Short-wheelbase models consist of the V6-powered XJ R-Sport and V8-engine XJ Supercharged. Long-wheelbase models include the V6-powered XJL Portfolio, V8 XJL Supercharged, and new higher-output V8 XJR575.</p>, <p>Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested the Jaguar XJ. Only six airbags are installed in each model, but a number of active-safety features are available.</p>, <p>In addition to a rearview camera, standard safety technologies include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning with active lane control, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and front/rear parking sensors. Adaptive cruise control and a surround-view camera setup are optional rather than standard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55962" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-xj-2.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-xj-2.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-xj-2-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>XJ R-Sport ($75,400) is powered by the 3.0-liter V6, with rear-wheel drive. Standard equipment includes heated/ventilated leather front/rear seats, power front seats, a heated steering wheel, power tilt/telescoping steering column, dual-zone automatic climate control, pushbutton start, and panoramic sunroof. Also standard are adaptive dampers, a rear air suspension, and 19-inch alloy wheels. Meridian 825-watt 20-speaker audio comes with Bluetooth. (Prices do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>AWD XJ R-Sport ($78,300) adds all-wheel drive to the V6 sedan.</p>, <p>XJL Portfolio ($84,500) comes with the V6 engine and rear-drive, on a longer wheelbase.</p>, <p>AWD XJL Portfolio ($87,400) adds all-wheel drive to the long-wheelbase V6 sedan.</p>, <p>XJ Supercharged ($93,000) contains the 5.0-liter V8 with rear-drive, along with 14-way power massaging front seats, navigation, adaptive headlights, softer leather, four-zone climate control, an active rear differential, and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>XJL Supercharged ($96,300) has the 5.0-liter V8, on a long-wheelbase chassis.</p>, <p>XJR575 ($122,400) includes high-performance 5.0-liter V8 with rear-drive. Standard equipment includes a sport-tuned suspension, performance tires, red brake calipers, metal pedals, a suede headliner, gloss black trim, and rear spoiler.</p>, <p>Long-wheelbase models can get the Premium Rear Seat package with two individual seats.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55966" height="109" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-xj-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Like the invariably-stylish Jaguar sedans of past decades, the 2018 XJ presents a dashing silhouette, casting a striking presence on the road. Design cues are well-matched to the sedan’s aluminum body panels.</p>, <p>Big rhombus-shaped headlights help set off Jaguar’s signature wire-mesh grille, which exudes a commanding aura. Gloss black rear pillars help create the illusion of expansive glass stretching across the body. Fenders swell in concert with the low roofline, recalling certain flowing classic French designs.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55964" height="86" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-xj-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Abundantly equipped, inspired by luxury yachts, the richly appointed XJ is swathed in soft leather and chrome. Passenger room is good up front, but the sleekly sloping roofline takes a toll on back-seat space. Headroom is in short supply, though it’s a bit better in long-wheelbase models.</p>, <p>As expected, fit and finish rank as excellent. Supple leather and genuine wood veneers ensure top quality throughout. Still, the piano-black accents on the instrument panel aren’t as rich as the accompanying wood trim.</p>, <p>A long, arcing dashboard serves as a unifying element. Gauges and controls appear on a 12.3-inch LCD screen. A 10-inch touchscreen controls infotainment and climate, augmented by actual buttons. The spacious trunk holds 18.4 cubic feet of luggage.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55963" height="106" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-xj-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Every Jaguar XJ delivers a far sportier experience than is customary for the premium large-sedan class. Smooth and refined with a V6 powertrain, the British luxury sedan turns into a sophisticated fireball in new XJR575 form.</p>, <p>Because of the XJ’s lightweight chassis, the efficient V6 produces ample energy, not so far removed from V8 performance. Acceleration to 60 mph takes about 6 seconds with the V6, versus 4.9 seconds for V8 models.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s admirably responsive 8-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly and promptly. S mode holds each gear longer, when desired. JaguarDrive Control has Normal, Dynamic, and Winter settings that affect the throttle, transmission, steering, and ride quality.</p>, <p>As a rule, each XJ is quite composed. Reflexes are pure and predictable. Adaptive dampers work with the comparatively light body to present a more unified driving feel than typical competitors. Big ventilated disc brakes on each model yield good pedal feel.</p>, <p>Standard adjustable dampers and an adjustable rear air suspension smooth out most bumps. Although the ride is generally smooth, it starts to decline on high-performance models. Some drivers may consider the XJR575’s suspension too firm.</p>, <p>On dry pavement, Jaguar’s all-wheel-drive system sends 90 percent of power to the rear wheels, but a front/rear split up to 50/50 is possible.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s V6 engine is fairly fuel-efficient for the class, EPA-rated at 18/27 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined, with either the short or long wheelbase. All-wheel-drive drops the estimate to 17/26/20 mpg for the short-wheelbase model and 17/25/20 mpg for the long wheelbase sedan.</p>, <p>The supercharged V8 is EPA-rated at 15/23 mpg City/Highway, or 18 mpg Combined. No estimate is available yet for the new XJ575. Jaguar’s stop-start system works well, with barely a flutter.</p>, <p>Lavish furnishings and illustrious British heritage, help make the XJ a good value. Sportier-than-usual road behavior also compels, drawing enthusiastic drivers. Naturally, the XJ’s lush profile attracts yet another group. Because available features are less extravagant than those offered by competitors, prices don’t become astronomical.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-porsche-911/
[<p>There are well over a dozen models of Porsche 911, including all-wheel drive and cabriolet versions. Among them: Carrera, Carrera S, Carrera T, GTS, Turbo, Turbo S, GT3, and GT2 RS.</p>, <p>New for 2018, the Porsche 911 GT2 RS is said to be the fastest 911 ever for the road. There is also a GT3 version, and a Turbo S Exclusive option. The new GTS and Carrera T come stripped of comfort and convenience features to feel more like a wind-in-the-hair sports car. The Turbo S Exclusive has exclusive uber-power.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55952" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-911-carrera.jpg" width="200"/>The engine in the Carrera is a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged horizontally opposed six-cylinder making 370 horsepower. In the Carrera S, this engine is turbo-boosted to 420 horsepower, and in the Carrera GTS, 450 horsepower.</p>, <p>The 911 Turbo uses a 3.8-liter turbocharged flat-6 making 580 horsepower for breathtaking performance.</p>, <p>A standard 911 Carrera can accelerate from zero to sixty in a very quick 4.0 seconds, while the Carrera S does it three-tenths quicker. That’s with Porsche’s brilliant twin-clutch automatic manual transmission, called the PDK. Carrera 4 includes all-wheel drive, making for an outstanding high-speed sports commuter.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55951" height="111" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-911-cabrio.jpg" width="200"/>The Turbo and Turbo S are grand touring cars, able to blast from zero to sixty in less than three seconds, while being comfortable driving long distances.</p>, <p>The new Carrera GTS gets 450 horsepower from its turbocharged flat-six, with an active exhaust system and thin sound deadening, to give the flat-six some song. As sporty as it sounds, the Carrera GTS comes with a 7-speed manual gearbox.</p>, <p>The new Carrera T has the same idea: no rear seats and no radio (for more money). With 370 horsepower and the same manual transmission, it’s about light weight and agility.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55957" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-911-gt3rs.jpg" width="200"/>The GT3, GT3 RS, and GT2 RS are ready for the track, with their non-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six engines. At about $300,000, the GT2 RS is a steal, being as fast as million-dollar supercars. For about $200,000, the GT3 RS is the quintessential track day car, our favorite, along with the GT3.</p>, <p>The Carrera with manual transmission is rated by the EPA at 20/29/23 miles per gallon. The GTS with its more powerful engine gets the same 23 mpg Combined. The 911 Turbo and Turbo S models get 19/24/21 mpg. Without a turbo, the GT3 is thirstiest, at 16 miles per gallon.</p>, <p>The Porsche 911 Carrera ($91,100) is the base model, the traditional model, a coupe with rear-wheel drive. A convertible top is available for most variants, starting with the Carrera Cabriolet ($103,400). The 911 Targa 4 ($110,300) features the Targa top. Carrera 4 ($98,000) includes all-wheel drive. Upmarket is the 911 Turbo ($161,800). Sportiest is the Carrera GTS ($120,700). The hot track cars are the GT3 ($143,600), GT3 RS ($187,500), and GT2 RS ($293,200).</p>, <p>Standard features in the Carrera include a rearview camera, power seats, eight-speaker sound system, and Alcantara headliner.</p>, <p>Options go on forever, from heated seats to LED headlamps to leather-wrapped seatbelt buckles. If you want your key fob painted the same color as your car, you can get that goodie for $530. There’s an option that raises the front axle to keep the nose of your Porsche from scraping driveways, not a bad idea, if you can remember to use it ($3490). If you want the most for track days, there are carbon-ceramic brakes ($9210).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55953" height="102" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-911-rear.jpg" width="200"/>For 2017, the 911 got a couple tweaks in the styling, air intakes and taillamps, but otherwise it’s been the same for well, some might say 60 years. It’s been a beautiful evolution of the upside-down-bathtub shape. The Porsche can’t hold a candle to the sensuous shapes of the British Jaguar and Aston Martin, or Italian Maserati, but it’s the most iconic.</p>, <p>The instrument panel in the cabin of the Carrera is classic Porsche in the way it is dominated by the tachometer. Not so classic is the modernization of the instrumentation, by a 4.6-inch multi-function display, that is bright and informative. Stretching farther from classic, there’s a standard 6.5-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and navigation. Carbon-fiber and brushed aluminum can be swathed over the instrument panel for a price. Along with tons of other options.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55955" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-911-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Fit and finish are excellent.</p>, <p>The front seats are comfortable, supportive, and provide good legroom. The 911 is technically a 2+2, so there are rear seats, sort of, but there is zero legroom, so the space is best used for bags and parcels. We consider it a two-seater.</p>, <p>There is very little storage, with small door pockets and not much room in the center console bin. The trunk in front is surprisingly roomy, but still only suited for soft luggage like duffels.</p>, <p>It’s relatively quiet in the cabin, although the 3.8-liter engine makes more noise than the 3.0-liter.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55954" height="109" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-911-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The base twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter flat six that makes 370 horsepower also brings 331 pound-feet of torque, from 1700 rpm to 5500 rpm, an exceptional range. This flexibility makes it easy to drive around town. The Carrera S makes 420 hp and brings 368 lb-ft. There is no turbo lag, thanks to a system that keeps the turbos spinning with a small amount of pressure, no more than 2 psi.</p>, <p>The 580-horsepower Turbo S blasts away from a start so fast it’s scary. The steering is nicely weighted and natural, as the ratio varies with speed. It stays flat in the corners thanks to active anti-roll bars, as it reaches fantastically high lateral loads without breaking loose on its 20-inch Pirelli P Zero tires. Thank heavens for its good stability control.</p>, <p>The 911 offers excellent stopping ability, and the standard steel rotors provide a good feel. The optional carbon-ceramic brakes offer so much stopping power that the braking points for corners is deep beyond belief. The carbon-ceramic brakes reduce fade, also, so you can run consecutive laps without overheating them.</p>, <p>Another option that’s great on the track is the Sport Chrono package. For about $2000 it adds dynamic engine mounts, launch control in the PDK or rev-matching downshifts in the manual, special stability software, and driving modes that come from the 918 Spyder.</p>, <p>The Porsche 911 is a wonderful sports car. The base Carrera offers the best value. A Carrera 4 would make a luxurious high-speed commuter. A Turbo is the legendary Autobahn car. The GTS and Carrera T are the sportiest. Track day cars don’t get better than a GT3.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with Mitch McCullough reporting from New Jersey.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-volvo-s90/
[<p>The Volvo S90 was an all-new model for 2017, the first Volvo to be built by its new Chinese owner, Geely Holding. It was built in Sweden. But the 2018 S90 is built in China. Not only that, in only its second year, it has grown by several inches.</p>, <p>Another thing is at play: although the S90 is a global car, in China, people who own such cars have chauffeurs. And the extra length in the 2018 S90 all goes to rear seat legroom; with the addition of 4.5 inches, the S90 now has more legroom than all rivals, including its targets, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series. Other carmakers have available extended-wheelbase models, but the 2018 S90 comes standard with that extra length.</p>, <p>More news for 2018 includes the addition of a 400-horsepower plug-in hybrid model called the T8, which gets a completely redesigned back seat. Also, all-wheel drive is now available on the T5 model.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 2.0-liter four cylinder, offered three ways for North America. In the front-wheel-drive S90 T5, the turbocharged engine makes 250 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. The S90 T6 with all-wheel drive uses a supercharged and turbocharged version of that engine, making 316 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The S90 T8 plug-in hybrid uses a version of that engine combined with an electric powerplant, to make its total 400 horsepower.</p>, <p>Each S90 gets a first-rate Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission. An optional air suspension promises a calmer ride, along with improved handling. Even in S90 T6 guise, with the air suspension and firmer Dynamic setting, it feels softly sprung. The optional air suspension is essential for owners who intend to make use of the S90’s 4,600-pound towing rating.</p>, <p>The S90 offers world-leading active safety features. Standard large-animal detection can automatically reduce speed or brake to a halt, if a deer (or dog, coyote, cougar, elk, moose, bear or maybe even a python) is in the path. Road-edge detection depends only partially on the presence of a painted shoulder line. Front seats are designed to help curtail high vertical forces that might result in back injury if the S90 leaves the road.</p>, <p>Semi-autonomous driving features are standard. The Pilot Assist system blends active cruise control with forward collision warning and lane-keep assist. Enabled by flicking a switch, the system lets the driver remove hands from the steering wheel sporadically, for up to 15 seconds each time. Blind-spot monitoring and cross-traffic alert systems are optional.</p>, <p>The 2018 S90 also has the updated Sensus Connect Touchscreen interface, as well as Oncoming Lane Mitigation, BLIS with steering assist and updated City Safety.</p>, <p>The EPA has rated the all-wheel-drive T6 at 22 City, 31 Highway, and 25 Combined miles per gallon, on premium fuel. The front-drive T5 is rated at 23/34 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined. All models include engine stop-start technology.</p>, <p>About 35 percent of the S90 body weight is high-strength steel.</p>, <p>Both the S90 T5 and T6 come as Momentum or Inscription models. The T5 Momentum costs $48,100 plus a $995 destination fee. The T6 starts at $54,100 and the T8 Twin Engine Plug-In Electric Hybrid starts at $63,650, plus destination fees.</p>, <p>The Momentum comes with the 250-horsepower engine, leather upholstery, birch wood inlays, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power sunroof, LED headlights with corner illumination, keyless entry, rear park assist, rearview camera, power-folding rear headrests, Sensus Connect touchscreen, 8-inch instrument-cluster display, 10-speaker 330-watt audio, and satellite radio.</p>, <p>The T5 Inscription steps up to softer Nappa leather, four-zone climate control, a cooled glovebox, Apple CarPlay, USB media hub, leather dashboard panels, rear sunshades, walnut wood inlays, 12.3-inch display, 19-inch alloy wheels, and ventilated front seats with power side support and cushion extension.</p>, <p>The T6 Momentum gets the 316-horsepower, turbocharged-and-supercharged version of the 2.0-liter engine. T6 Inscription is equipped similar to the T5 Inscription.</p>, <p>The T8 Twin Engine Plug-In Electric Hybrid gets a standard panoramic sunroof and its own back seat, presumably to accommodate the battery pack.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55946" height="106" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-s90-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The S90 is gracefully designed and distinctly Scandinavian. It’s said to be inspired by Volvo’s P1800 two-seat sports car of the 1960s. Resemblance to the latest XC90 is unmistakable, because it is deliberate.</p>, <p>Viewed in profile, the S90 suggests a rear-wheel-drive, swept-back sports sedan; but it has front-wheel drive (or all-wheel drive) instead. Front and rear ends are bluntly upright, led by a particularly bright grille. Front wheels are pushed well forward, suggesting an athletic nature. Up front, the hood is long and almost level. The roofline reaches smoothly back into the decklid. Add distinctive headlights and clean uncluttered surfaces, and the S90 is readily recognizable as a Volvo, even if its big grille-mounted badge isn’t visible.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55945" height="138" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-s90-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The interior design is Scandinavian and the ambiance welcoming. For 2018 there are new details throughout the cabin, complemented by electric rear and side shades. The available rear seat massage and wide center armrest provide comfort and style. There’s a sense of spaciousness, again mimicking the XC90 crossover.</p>, <p>The dashboard is clean and elegant, with subtle contours, with wood and metal panels. Textured dials, resembling Swedish crystal, adjust the vents. A twist of the Start knob fires up the engine, while Sensus Touch infotainment dispenses with knobs and buttons.</p>, <p>Speaking of cabin detail, Volvo brought orthopedists in on the design of the S90 seats, wonderfully supportive. The high window line gives the driver a feeling of upright-ness.</p>, <p>The rear seats are well-contoured and -cushioned, again excellent support, although headroom has its limits. And it’s not so easy to climb into and out of the back. The rear seatbacks fold forward, and there’s a pass-through to the trunk, which holds 17.7 cubic feet, including an underfloor compartment.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55944" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-s90-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-s90-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-s90-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The ride is plush, while being well controlled. Not much bobbing on bumpy roads. The cabin is especially quiet thanks to tight Volvo construction, and active noise cancellation.</p>, <p>The available air suspension should make the ride even better, by keeping the car more level, though we have not experienced it.</p>, <p>If you plan to tow with an S90, the towing capacity is 3,700 pounds for the T5 and 4,600 with a T6. It’s been a while since we’ve seen a sleek Volvo sedan towing a boat. Maybe in Maine. Europeans routinely use sedans as tow vehicles, though.</p>, <p>The S90 is closer to being a sports sedan than it is a tow truck. And even though comfort is the focus, the performance is satisfying in just about any driving conditions.</p>, <p>Acceleration to 60 mph takes 6.5 seconds in a T5, or 5.7 with a T6. A shift gate lets the driver change gears manually. Throttle response is quicker with the T6, courtesy of its supercharger.</p>, <p>Nicely weighted electric power steering helps ensure relaxed driving. An S90 can pull away from tight corners in a natural manner.</p>, <p>Three mode settings are available. Road feedback is minimal if Comfort mode is chosen, while Dynamic mode transmits a numb sensation. Individualization mode lets you specify the settings that please you most. The system can even program a preferred brake-boost level.</p>, <p>With its wide spread of gear ratios, the 8-speed automatic helps make the S90 feel quite perky at low speed. At highway speeds, it promises an efficiently relaxed experience.</p>, <p>The S90 T5 is the traditional Volvo sedan. The new T8 plug-in hybrid is the environmentally friendly choice. In the T6, we love the idea of an engine that’s both turbocharged and supercharged.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-5-series/
[<p>The BMW 5 Series has been re-engineered. The 530i and 540i got a new chassis for 2017 that was longer by 1.2 inches for more rear legroom, lighter by 120 pounds by using more aluminum, and stiffer for better handling by using more high-strength steel. For 2018, the upgrade of the line continues with two new models: the 530e iPerformance, a plug-in hybrid, and the all-wheel-drive M550i xDrive, approaching the performance of the vaunted M5.</p>, <p>The BMW 530i is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline four with direct injection, making 248 horsepower, while the 540i is powered by a 3.0-liter inline six with direct injection, making 335 hp. Direct injection, which sprays fuel mixed with oxygen into the combustion chambers for efficiency, came with the engines in 2017.</p>, <p>The four-cylinder in the 530i is refined and rarely feels pressed, capable of accelerating from zero to sixty in about six seconds, about the same as a Mercedes E-Class, Audi A6, or Volvo S90.</p>, <p>The turbo six in the 540i shoots it from zero to sixty in less than five seconds.</p>, <p>Thanks to the torque of its electric powertrain, the new 530e is as quick in a straight line as the 530i; but it’s 600 pounds heavier, weight that can be felt in the handling. It’s powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder that’s mated to a 9.2-kilowatt-hour battery and electric motor, making a combined 248 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque. We got some seat time in a 530e around Chicago, and found that it got about 16 miles of all-electric range. The transitions between electric and gas power are seamless.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55939" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540i-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540i-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540i-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>There’s one transmission for these models, an excellent eight-speed automatic.</p>, <p>BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive is available with all three models.</p>, <p>The new M550i xDrive is powered by a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 making 456 horsepower and 480 pound-feet of torque, and can accelerate from zero to sixty in less than four seconds.</p>, <p>The 5 Series models’ active safety systems, adaptive cruise control, active lane control, and self-steering, work well, but cost about five grand. It will steer itself down the highway for 30 seconds. It will also veer and correct itself, when the sensors misjudge something, a problem with most cars that steer themselves.</p>, <p>The 530i is EPA-rated at 24/34 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined, on Premium gasoline. 530i xDrive gets the same Combined mileage. The 540i is rated 20/30/24 mpg. Even the M550i xDrive is expected to get 19 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The 530e is rated at 29 mpg Combined, or 72 MPGe, using the range of a full battery, in electric mode. The battery can be recharged in under three hours using the 7.2-kw onboard charger.</p>, <p>The 530i and 530e plug-in hybrid are priced the same ($52,400), and with government incentives the hybrid would be less. The 540i is $57,500, and the M550i xDrive is $73,400. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.) xDrive raises the price by $2300.</p>, <p>Standard equipment in the 530i and 540i includes leatherette upholstery, automatic climate control, a 10.2-inch touchscreen, navigation, Bluetooth, 18-inch wheels with run-flat tires.</p>, <p>BMW’s options, now called tiers, drive the price up dramatically. A rearview camera is optional, part of a driver assistance package that includes a head-up display. Adaptive cruise control, active lane control, blind-spot monitors, pedestrian detection, and automatic emergency braking are optional. As are Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio, Apple CarPlay wireless, smart cold weather package with heated seats front and rear, surround-view camera, touchscreen key, and remote parking feature.</p>, <p>For 2017, the 5 Series got more aerodynamic, with a sharper nose and tapered sides. Bigger grille and headlamps, and two corner air intakes and a large center scoop. Behind the grille are shutters that open or close depending on the temperature of the engine coolant.</p>, <p>The profile resembles the 7 Series, with its own character lines, under the rear windows. It has LED taillamps and an aggressive bumper with two chrome exhaust tips.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55938" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cabin is quiet and refined, as one expects from a BMW, with high-quality materials including a sound-deadening headliner. The standard leatherette upholstery that BMW calls SensaTec is nice. The available multi-contour seats, with adjustable bolstering and long leg cushions, are tops for luxury midsize sedans.</p>, <p>Among the expensive leather choices, the softest is Nappa, available with a massage function. The leather colors and combinations can be extreme, while the contrast stitching, quilting, and piping can look busy. We liked the Night Blue, and the Mocha too, but the quilting steals all subtlety.</p>, <p>Good headroom and legroom in the rear, and the trunk capacity is a huge 18.7 cubic feet.</p>, <p>When it comes to high-tech electronics, BMW trails rivals like Mercedes and Volvo; which isn’t all bad because at least the 5 Series doesn’t present a wall of screens like the Mercedes E-Class. A 10.2-inch touchscreen sits on top of the dashboard, with its crisp integrated display dominating the instrumentation. Good app integration and easy transition between functions. There’s also an 8.0-inch LED instrument cluster.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55936" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540i-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540i-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-540i-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The engines feel good. With its strong 248 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, the 2.0-liter turbo four in the 530i doesn’t feel like a four-cylinder, nor does it accelerate like one. It’s smooth and always there.</p>, <p>He 3.0-liter inline six turbo is smoother and faster, with 335 horsepower and 335 pound-feet of torque. It does zero to sixty in 4.7 seconds, with all-wheel drive to get it off the line without wheelspin. The 540i used to come with a V8, but this inline six turbo with direct injection makes the V8 a dinosaur.</p>, <p>With such a good eight-speed automatic transmission, a manual transmission isn’t missed. It has paddle shifters, but we didn’t use them much because the transmission’s shift logic was spot-on. And we almost never say that.</p>, <p>The electric power steering is good although there’s a dead spot on center, in Comfort mode (the default mode). But generally the 5 Series corners flat, composed, and without drama, with its standard suspension. Available adaptive dampers turn the 5 Series into an athlete.</p>, <p>But the optional rear-wheel steering, which BMW calls Integral Active Steering, brings some drama. It counter-steers the rear wheels at low speeds to tighten turning, in parking lots for example, and that part makes life easy. But at high speeds, it quickens the turn-in to corners, which we found unnerving, like the rear end was skating through turns. The steering doesn’t feel linear or natural on curvy roads, leading the driver to have to make small mid-corner corrections. By the same token, it makes a sudden high-speed maneuver more stable. Think of dodging something that falls off a truck on the freeway.</p>, <p>Three drive modes offer simple adjustment: Normal, Comfort and Sport. Comfort isn’t too soft and Sport isn’t too firm; even with hard run-flat tires, the ride on rough pavement isn’t harsh. Sport adds some weight to the steering, which is especially felt with the optional and thick M Sport steering wheel. The optional M Sport brakes reduce stopping distances, but they’re very expensive, and a race track is the only place they might be needed.</p>, <p>As for the 530 iPerformance plug-in hybrid, the steering is slower because of the extra weight, which is felt in cornering and weight transfer. You can’t get rear-wheel steering in the 530e, so no worries about making it worse. But you can get adaptive dampers, which have a sport-plus setting that’s as firm as the suspension gets, but it still wasn’t jarring on most roads.</p>, <p>The 5 Series offers outstanding powertrains, with a turbocharged four-cylinder and turbocharged inline six that are fast, smooth and fuel-efficient for a midsize luxury car; and an eight-speed automatic that’s about perfect. The suspension might need the optional adaptive dampers to be there for the most aggressive cornering, but the standard suspension is still excellent. The problem is the base price, and the cost of options. As for the 530e plug-in hybrid, we’re not sold, even at the same price. Only 2 mpg more, for too many unknowns.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mazda-3/
[<p>The Mazda3 is an extremely popular front-wheel-drive compact hatchback and sedan, for good reasons. It has standout styling, superb driving dynamics, and terrific value.</p>, <p>Mazda3 got a bunch of improvements for the 2017 model year. For 2018, there are few changes. Automatic emergency braking becomes standard equipment on the 2018 Mazda3.</p>, <p>Mazda3 competes with the Volkswagen Golf, Honda Civic and Ford Focus, and we think it’s the most fun.</p>, <p>Called Smart City Brake, Mazda’s automatic emergency braking system can prevent a collision at speeds up to 12 miles per hour. There’s an optional system called Smart Brake that can stop the car at higher speeds. More available safety equipment for 2018 includes active lane control and automatic headlights.</p>, <p>The base engine that comes in the Mazda3 Sport model is a 2.0-liter four cylinder making 155 horsepower and 150 pound-feet of torque. Mazda3 Touring and Grand Touring models get a 2.5-liter making 184 horsepower and 185 pound-feet. The engines are mated to either a 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission that makes the most of the power.</p>, <p>Fuel mileage for both engines is outstanding, rated by the EPA at 28/37 miles per gallon City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined for the 2.0-liter engine with automatic, and, more impressively, about the same for the 2.5-liter. Both engines have high compression ratios, but don’t require premium gasoline like many other small cars with high-compression engines, Subaru to name one. That’s another impressive and important thing, often overlooked when it comes to value.</p>, <p>The Mazda3 was named Top Safety Pick Plus by the IIHS. All-wheel drive is not available on the Mazda3, or most compacts (Subaru being the main exception in the class).</p>, <p>The 2018 Mazda3 comes as sedan or hatchback in Sport ($17,845), Touring ($20,045), and Grand Touring ($22,545) models.</p>, <p>The Sport is well equipped with cloth upholstery, air conditioning, rearview camera, Bluetooth, keyless ignition, steering-wheel audio controls, internet radio, 7.0-inch infotainment touchscreen, and 16-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Touring and Grand Touring models get the more powerful engine and more features.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55931" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Mazda3 is distinctive and stylish with its cab-back design, including a long hood that makes it look more costly than it is. There’s also a raked windshield, sweeping roofline and high tail contributing to the sleek and athletic shape of the hatchback. The shoulder line rises and meets pointy taillamps on a rounded hatch. We love it in white.</p>, <p>This styling is a result of some re-touching in 2017 with a lowered front fascia, pushed-up grille, and trimmer foglamps and turn signals. At the rear, a cleaner bumper eliminated some cladding.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, the sedan looks more like a rear-wheel-drive car, than front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The hatch is especially stylish.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55929" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cabin materials are excellent, with the exception of a flimsy headliner and plastic door inserts. There are four seating materials: cloth, upgraded cloth, leatherette (vinyl), and leather. The perforated leather in the Grand Touring is luxury level.</p>, <p>The controls on the instrument panel are arranged symmetrically around the driver, with an available head-up display to complete the efficiency and driver focus. We like the electronic emergency brake. The throttle pedal is hinged at the bottom like the pedals of an organ (or a Mercedes-Benz).</p>, <p>The front seats are supportive and comfortable, among the best in the class, with lower cushions for longer legs. The seatbacks afford a natural sitting position and good lateral support. Legroom in the rear is slim, however, with only 35.8 inches.</p>, <p>There’s a lot of content for the price, especially on the touchscreen, but it would be nice if the infotainment were better.</p>, <p>The sedan offers 12.4 cubic feet of cargo space in its trunk.</p>, <p>That’s nothing compared to the hatchback’s 20.2 cubic feet behind the rear seat. The rear seat in the hatch folds down to create 47.1 cubic feet of cargo space, about the same as the Chevy Cruze hatchback, not far off from the cargo capacity of a small SUV.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55930" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mazda3-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The standard 2.0-liter engine is reasonably responsive, with a consistent and linear throttle pedal, but it has a high torque curve with a maximum of 150 pound-feet, so the power doesn’t come on strong until 4000 rpm, which makes it awkward and less responsive around town. The standard 6-speed manual transmission helps, but not without work.</p>, <p>The power in the 2.5-liter is more available at lower rpm, while the torque max is 185 pound-feet, a difference you can definitely feel over the 150. This engine never gets caught flat-footed. The fact that it gets nearly the same fuel mileage as the 2.0-liter makes the 2.5 a better call. And it’s so very smooth.</p>, <p>The manual transmission is standard, and it’s a good one, as it shifts neatly and precisely, with a clutch take-up that’s easy and clean. But with the 2.5-liter engine we prefer the 6-speed automatic that shifts with paddles, and with the decisiveness of a dual-clutch automatic-manual transmission.</p>, <p>The ride is a bit busier than most compact cars, and a bit harsh. We’ve found it’s smoother with the standard 16-inch wheels and tires.</p>, <p>The electric power steering, like other steer-by-wire systems, does not enhance dynamic driving due to its lack of feedback to driver, and the electro-hydraulic system in the previous generation was better in that regard. The electric system offers a strong sense of center at lower speeds and out of corners, but it doesn’t do well on oddly crowned roads, and it doesn’t track all that well at highway speeds, calling for frequent small adjustments to keep the car straight. (Some of that could be due to tires.)</p>, <p>These cars handle well and are enjoyable to drive in a spirited manner, probably.</p>, <p>Part of what makes them enjoyable to drive comes from the engine management system called G-Vectoring Control, which modulates torque to the front wheels based on steering input, to reduce body roll and improve directional stability. It also squeezes on the brakes to shift weight forward onto the front wheels to carve a tighter line around corners. It’s all magic, in that you can’t feel it happening, you only feel the result.</p>, <p>If you want to criticize the Mazda3, you might find a smallish rear seat, limited infotainment, and slightly bumpy ride. But the many significant positives overwhelm those flaws. Stylish looks in the hatchback that move it out of the realm of compact or economy car. Precise handling that comes from the invisible G-vectoring Control. Comfortable front seats and driver-focused instrument panel. Huge cargo space in the hatchback. Best safety rating. But most of all, awesome 2.5-liter engine with a top-notch 6-speed paddleshifting automatic transmission, and stunning fuel mileage.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mini-cooper/
[<p>There are a lot of different Mini Coopers. There’s a 2-door (which might be considered a 3-door hatchback), a 4-door (or seen as a 5-door), a convertible, and a 4-door Clubman with all-wheel drive and barn doors at the rear.</p>, <p>The 2-door is 150.4 inches long, the 4-door is 156.8 inches, and the Clubman is 168.3 inches, the latter about the size of a four-door Volkswagen Golf.</p>, <p>Excepting the Clubman, the Mini Cooper is smaller and less practical than many hatchbacks that cost a lot less. Last redesigned for 2014 (when it gained several hundred pounds), it’s built on the platform of the BMW X1.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55921" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-5.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-5.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-5-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>We like the Hardtop 2 Door the most; it’s the classic, and a delight to drive. The classic color is red with a white top. If you know who John Cooper was and are familiar with his Formula Juniors and Grand Prix racecars, you might appreciate a pair of distinctive Cooper stripes. Or maybe you’ll want a Union Jack on the lid.</p>, <p>Engines in the mix include the standard turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder making 124 horsepower; the Cooper S with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 189 horsepowe; and the John Cooper Works version of that engine making 228 horsepower. Each uses either a 6-speed manual (which we prefer) or automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Very little on the Mini Cooper has changed for 2018. It gets a standard rearview camera and some package reshuffling.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55923" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-convertible.jpg" width="200"/>With the 1.5-liter engine and 6-speed manual, the Mini Cooper gets an EPA-estimated 28/38 miles per gallon City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined. Cooper S is rated 23/32/26 mpg with the manual. The powerful John Cooper Works gets 23/31/26 mpg. The Convertible S gets the same, but with automatic is rated higher (better). All Mini Coopers require Premium gasoline. Your mileage may vary, however. During our test drives, we got about 25 miles per gallon in both the Mini Cooper and Cooper S, including a lot of spirited driving through canyon twisties. Out on the interstate, we got up to 40 mpg.</p>, <p>The Mini Cooper got the top safety rating from the insurance industry (IIHS) in 2016, with a Top Safety Pick+. However the federal government’s NHTSA doesn’t agree, giving the Mini only four stars overall.</p>, <p>The 2017 Mini Cooper Hardtop 2 Door ($20,950) comes with the 124-hp 1.5-liter engine; the Mini Cooper S Hardtop 2 Door ($24,400) gets the 189-hp 2.0-liter engine. The Mini Hardtop 4 Door ($21,950) is similarly equipped. Also available: the Mini Convertible ( $25,950) and the Mini Clubman ($24,100).</p>, <p>Standard equipment includes a 6.5-inch center screen, Bluetooth, 15-inch wheels (16-inch on Cooper S), faux leather, eight airbags, and the rearview camera in 2018. Options are grouped into packages. The sport package ($1750) features adjustable dampers that sharpen the ride.</p>, <p>Much customization is available and adds to the fun. Eight choices in upholstery, and trims with Mini Yours finishes, like Fiber Alloy or the Off-White that’s like porcelain.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55925" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>When the Mini Cooper was redesigned four years ago, it got bigger and longer, forward of the windshield, to meet new European crash-test standards for crush space. It grew 4.5 inches longer and 1.7 inches wider, a substantial difference, but being a mere 0.3 inches taller, it was barely noticeable. The result is charming and exceptional.</p>, <p>Traditional Mini design endures. Oval lights in the top corners of the front fenders, oblong grille in a chrome frame, upright windshield, almost-square taillamps, black pillars under a long roof, available in white. Mini says it’s the most popular option. Even more popular than the Union Jack.</p>, <p>The Convertible is handsome; with its rear flip-down tailgate it looks like a roadster.</p>, <p>The interior is less quirky than it used to be. Only the good quirks remain. The instruments are now where you expect them to be. A big tach with smaller speedo are mounted behind the steering wheel.</p>, <p>The interior design is fairly useful and meaningful. The big round center of the dash is exclusively a display screen, its size depending on trim. There are two rectangular air vents and two large round eyeball vents at the outer edges of the dash. There’s still a horizontal row of switches in the central lower dash, under three dials for climate control.</p>, <p>From the driver’s seat, the Mini is close to perfect. There’s head room for persons as much as 6 feet, 3 inches tall.</p>, <p>But there’s not so much room for rear passengers or cargo. Passengers sit deep, surrounded by quite a lot of black trim and upholstery.</p>, <p>With the rear seat up there’s 8.7 cubic feet of cargo space in the back, expanding to 38 cubic feet with the seat down. The Clubman raises it to 17.5 and 47.9 cubic feet.</p>, <p>The four-door Mini can shuttle four adults in a pinch, but only the Clubman is much of a people mover.</p>, <p>The Convertible is realistically a two-seater. Switchgear gremlins live in the Convertible; if it heats up in the direct sun, the roof won’t raise for shade until it cools down.</p>, <p>Visibility from the driver’s seat isn’t great. The roof pillars are thick, and the roof is 18 or 20 inches forward, in order to reach the upright windshield pillars. With the top down and folded in the Convertible, rear visibility is nearly non-existent.</p>, <p>There’s a nice amount of engine noise in the cabin. The Cooper S pipes it in. The three-cylinder has an uneven idle that gives it character. It sounds like a Freightliner at cold start.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55922" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-mini-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The standard engine in the Mini Cooper and Clubman is the turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder making 124 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque (169 lb-ft for a few seconds during overboost). It can accelerate from zero to sixty in 7.4 seconds, and hit 130 mph. A three-cylinder that will go 130 miles per hour sounds like fun.</p>, <p>The handling and braking are superlative. The base Mini Cooper is our favorite, because it has all of the good handling while the three-cylinder engine is so squirty, and it’s much cheaper than the Cooper S. The little engine’s maximum torque comes at just 1250 rpm, and it peaks out at 4000 so it’s not a high-revver. We think the 6-speed manual works best with the three-cylinder, but at least the automatic is programmed to use the torque (although in Eco mode it’s downright dead).</p>, <p>The Cooper S is wildly fun but expensive. Its 2.0-liter turbocharged engine scoots it from zero to sixty in 6.4 seconds, one second quicker than the Cooper. It makes 189 horsepower and 206 pound-feet of torque (221 lb-ft during overboost).</p>, <p>You can get either a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission. We think the manual is a must in the Mini Cooper, although the linkage doesn’t inspire confidence and the rev-matching is aggressive. In the Cooper S, the optional paddle shifters are a must, to make the automatic more usable and enjoyable.</p>, <p>The JCW edition balloons the horsepower to 228 hp and torque to 236 lb-ft of torque, which makes it challenging to handle.</p>, <p>Driving modes are Sport, Mid, or Green, with red, blue, or green rings around the center display screen reminding you what mode you’re in. Sport mode holds the transmission gears longer, and stiffens the steering if you have the package with the firmer adaptive dampers that help keep the ride smooth. The base suspension is pretty firm as it is, while not crashing over the worst bumps.</p>, <p>There are a lot of wheel size and tire combinations available. As a good compromise, we like the 17-inch wheels with all-season tires on either the Cooper or Cooper S. The steering is quick, with a 14.0:1 ratio, making it twitchy on a bumpy straight freeway, but you’ll love it in the twisties.</p>, <p>Despite being heavier by more than 250 pounds, the Convertible keeps up the eager responsiveness. In Sport mode with the top down, its engine song is intoxicating. The automatic does its best to keep the engine in its sweet spot, which is fairly low in the rev range.</p>, <p>Despite being longer than the base Mini Cooper by nearly 18 inches, the Clubman doesn’t feel stretched. It’s relatively easy to place all four wheels where you want them.</p>, <p>The Mini Cooper is responsive in all the right places. You can beat the cargo space but you can’t beat the fun, with safety. The base model with 1.5-liter three-cylinder and manual gearbox is the purest Mini, the best value for its good performance and classic heritage.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with driving impressions by The Car Connection staff.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-civic/
[<p>The Honda Civic, which has been zipping around on our streets for 45 years, was totally redesigned for the 2016 model year; the Civic sedan and then the coupe were made longer and wider, nearly as big as a Chrysler 200. The sleek hatchback followed for 2017, including a high-performance Civic Type R with a big wing. So for 2018 there are no changes.</p>, <p>In the upscale models, the compact Civic feels more like a premium car than an economy car. The sedan, especially, is refined and smooth-riding. It’s a calm car, not a sporty or especially quick one, with good handling and easy brakes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55913" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-hatch.jpg" width="200"/>The standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 158 horsepower, about the same as a Mazda3, but unfortunately it’s boring. It comes with either a 6-speed manual transmission that we really like, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that isn’t new, doesn’t have paddle shifters and is even more boring than the engine.</p>, <p>That mostly puts the job to the other engine, a 1.5-liter turbo making 174 horsepower. It’s a revelation, not only quicker and more responsive than the non-turbo 2.0, but with a better CVT. It gets nearly the same fuel mileage as the 2.0, which with the CVT is EPA-rated at 35 mpg Combined miles per gallon (only 31 mpg with the manual).</p>, <p>The sportier Civic Si really ups the power with 205 hp, and the Type R, with its 2.0-liter turbo brings 306 horsepower to the VTEC and VTC engine.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55917" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>With three body styles, two powertrains, and four main models, the combinations are bewildering.</p>, <p>Sedans come in LX, EX, EX-T, EX-L, and Touring models. Civic LX ($18,840) comes standard with 2.0-liter engine, manual transmission, rearview camera, electronic parking brake, Bluetooth, five-inch touchscreen, and 160-watt audio. Heated leather seats are available along with a more powerful sound system with HD satellite radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability.</p>, <p>Civic EX-L ($23,900) is available with the turbocharged 1.5-liter engine and CVT. Civic Touring ($26,700) gets the HondaSensing safety suite, navigation, LED headlamps and 450-watt audio. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55911" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-coupe.jpg" width="200"/>Coupes come in LX manual ($19,250), LX-P ($21,050), EX-T ($22,500), EX-L ($23,625), and Touring ($26,325). Civic Si Coupe ($23,900) uses the 1.5-liter engine with more turbocharger boost to make 205 horsepower, with a six-speed manual gearbox.</p>, <p>Hatchbacks come in LX ($19,700), Sport ($21,300), EX ($22,800), EX-L Navi ($25,300), and Sport Touring ($28,300).</p>, <p>Civic Type R hatchback ($33,900) features a 2.0-liter VTEC turbocharged engine.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55915" height="108" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-sedan-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The sedan looks big, not like an economy car at all, with a sleek and sweeping profile like the Honda Crosstour. The sheetmetal might be exciting to a fault, with its creases, slits and intakes. It flaunts its size and edginess by being low and wide, with flared wheels and a wedged tail with Acura-like taillamps.</p>, <p>The Hatchback is the same as the sedan, from the B pillars between the doors to the front of the hood. But it’s four inches shorter overall, so everything behind the pillars is distinctive, and downright swoopy for a so-called hatchback. The only thing hatchbacky about it is that the back is a convenient hatch.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55914" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cabin is tame and organized, a horizontal dash with a single screen, almost a Teutonic flow. The dash is low and the front seat raises, so forward visibility is excellent. The gauges are clean and crisp, except on the deluxe Touring model, which gets a digital display on an LCD screen with a 270-degree tachometer.</p>, <p>There’s a lot of room inside, enough for a six-footer in back with an inch of kneeroom to spare. There are many clever storage spots, and a big 15-cubic-foot trunk.</p>, <p>The Hatchback’s passengers won’t know it’s not a sedan, although the trim is a bit different. The cargo space is a very generous 25.7 cubic feet behind the second row, so that’s already way ahead of the sedan; and then when you drop the seat you get an awesome 46.2 cubic feet. Considering it’s four inches shorter than the sedan, that’s dazzling.</p>, <p>Honda is working its cargo features to young buyers, maybe those stepping up from a Fit who are spoiled by the cargo space created by the nearly flat-folding Magic Seats, including the front seats. The Hatchback also features an innovative sideways sliding cargo cover that can be stowed on either side. The Hatchback is nearly as quiet as the sedan and coupe with the cargo cover up, as it blocks noise from the open space in the back.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55912" height="110" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-hatch-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Compared to the three turbocharged engines, the standard 2.0-liter engine with its 158 horsepower is flat-out lame. It’s for buyers who only care that their car goes forward when they press the start button and step on the gas. With the Civic, there are a lot of them. But the car can be more.</p>, <p>The 1.5-liter turbo is much quicker, as the weight of the slim Civic is less than 3000 pounds, so the engine’s 174 horsepower can handle it. It’s a small turbo with an electrically driven wastegate. It sounds sweet at full throttle, though there is some turbo lag. The turbo engine has a Sport mode that helps things, as well as an Econ mode that gains fuel mileage but robs power. The turbo comes with a continuously variable transmission that’s smooth and quiet but not quick or exciting.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55910" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-civic-coupe-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Ride and handling is where the Civic excels. It’s precise, composed, and beautifully compliant. It doesn’t dance over bumps, it manages them. The suspension uses struts in the front with hydraulic bushings, and multi-links in the rear with a rigid subframe, with hydraulic bushings on EX-T models and above, as well as 17-inch wheels and tires. Same with the turbocharged Civics.</p>, <p>The Civic LX and EX ride on pedestrian 215/55HR16 tires that run out of grip and ability to cushion the ride on bad pavement, but still the ride’s not bad. Handling is predictable even when grip is not, as we observed on wet roads covered with leaves.</p>, <p>Because the steering column is thicker (for crash worthiness, which the Civic aces), the Civic uses a sophisticated steering system, a dual-pinion, variable-ratio setup like on the Buick Verano. There’s a motor in the steering rack that provides gradual and consistent steering boost.</p>, <p>The brakes are firm and fast to respond, with a short pedal stroke.</p>, <p>The Civic Si turns up the turbo boost to get 205 horsepower out of the busy engine. The suspension uses solid bushings to tighten it up, and the six-speed manual has a short throw and smooth clutch.</p>, <p>The new Type R hatch gets a 2.0-liter turbo that makes an eye-popping 306 horsepower. We haven’t had a chance to drive it yet, but we definitely look forward to it.</p>, <p>With four engines and three body styles, the Civic has many personalities. It can be a sedate car, a sedan with the 2.0-liter engine, and in fact the entry-level LX, which is reasonably well equipped, offers a whole lot of reliable and smooth car for the money. But for our own satisfaction, we need the 1.5-liter turbo; it’s much quicker and has a sharper CVT. Move up to the sleek hatchback as the 205-hp Si, or 306-hp Type R, and you’ll have a mean or meaner machine.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>Far different from the fetching little Fiat 500 hatchback coupe and sliding-roof convertible, the Fiat 500L is a tall compact wagon. Launched as a 2014 model, it’s sometimes considered a five-door hatchback, with a design and character all its own. A number of modifications and updates have taken place for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p>Front and rear fascias have been redesigned on the 2018 Fiat 500L, with updated wheels, bodyside moldings, and daytime running lights installed. A rearview camera is now standard.</p>, <p>Inside is a new digital instrument cluster. Fiat has rearranged the central console, fir 2018m along with revising the gearshift and parking brake levers. The steering wheel is new, including auxiliary controls, and ambient LEDs illuminate the cabin. An updated Uconnect 4 infotainment system with 7.0-inch touchscreen is newly standard. So are Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.</p>, <p>Fiat offers three 500L trim levels: base Pop, midlevel rugged-look Trekking, and high-end Lounge.</p>, <p>All use a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine, developing 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. All use a 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Manufactured in Serbia, the 500L boasts abundant interior room, augmented by tall-wagon practicality. Each wagon gets a proper group of standard features, including steering-wheel controls, cruise control, air conditioning, a sliding rear seat, and a tilting/telescopic steering column.</p>, <p>The most distinctive 500L is the Trekking edition, featuring design details that suggest rugged off-roading, even if actual beyond-pavement touring isn’t an option. Flared wheel wells wrap around 17-inch wheels, and the upholstery is accented in brown and black.</p>, <p>Except for the newly standard rearview camera, advanced electronic safety systems are absent, though rear parking sensors are optional. At least, outward visibility is outstanding through three big side windows.</p>, <p>The optional dual-pane sunroof can flood the cabin with brightness.</p>, <p>In testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 500L earned Good crashworthiness ratings, except for a Poor score in the tough small-overlap frontal crash test.</p>, <p>Plenty of options are available, including a contrasting-color roof, with many grouped into collections of common options at a discounted price.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55903" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-500l-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-500l-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-500l-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>500L Pop ($20,995) comes with a rearview camera, 16-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 4.7-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and six-speaker audio with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>500L Trekking ($23,325) adds rugged-look appearance details including special front/rear fascias and fender moldings, and a two-tone brown/black interior. Also standard are 17-inch wheels, leather-trimmed low-back seats, heated front seats, foglamps, ambient LED lighting, Beats premium audio, satellite radio, and Uconnect 4 with a 7.0-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>500L Lounge ($23,895) adds dual-zone automatic climate control, machined aluminum 17-inch wheels, power-foldaway mirrors, rear park assist, and driver’s power lumbar adjustment.</p>, <p>Unconventional may be the mildest way to describe the 500L, which bears no discernible resemblance to the cuddly little Fiat 500 hatchback. Mild front/rear restyling for 2018 updated the design somewhat, but the overall shape lacks cohesiveness.</p>, <p>Tall and awkward-lookingh, the 500L boasts plenty of glass for easy visibility. But this wagon’s unorthodox roofline and blunt front end don’t necessarily draw praise from all quarters. The Trekking adds several distinctive details, led by black lower sill and wheel-arch accent moldings.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55902" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-500l-interior.jpg" width="200"/>A tall roofline gives the 500L plenty of head clearance and shoulder space for four adults, but five will be less comfortable. Of course, the 500L boasts 42 percent more total interior volume than the tiny 500 hatchback, which barely manages four people.</p>, <p>While the 500L’s exterior may look startling, its cabin is ordinary. In addition to large physical knobs, the dashboard has gained a bigger (7.0-inch) touchscreen for 2018. Cupholders and the gearshift lever occupy different positions on the reworked console. Navigation, standard in upper trim levels, might be helpful, but it’s a primitive system.</p>, <p>Front seats are short on comfort, with hard seat cushions. The driving position is awkward. The steering wheel is relatively horizontal. Drivers might have trouble attaining a comfortable position, without impeding the ability to see the instruments. Outward visibility excels, due to the abundant glass area.</p>, <p>Second-row occupants sit higher off the floor than those up front. Legroom is abundant for most riders, and adequate for taller folks. Cushioning is firm, but the back seat reclines. It also slides forward and back, and can tumble forward.</p>, <p>Two roller suitcases fit into the cargo hold, whose volume totals 22.4 cubic feet. Folding the rear seatbacks expands space to 68 cubic feet. A floor panel can slide into upper side rails to provide a hidden compartment. Elsewhere in the cabin, storage space is limited.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55904" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-500l-side.jpg" width="200"/>Ride comfort is a benefit. On patchy, potholed urban streets, the 500L is nearly as smooth-riding as, say, a Kia Soul. Koni shock absorbers effectively dampen the harsher ride motions.</p>, <p>Fiat’s 500L also handles well, holding the road admirably. Even at highway speeds, it responds promptly and predictably to steering-wheel actions. Handling prowess might remind drivers of Fiat’s illustrious Italian heritage – but only slightly.</p>, <p>Performance is significantly less satisfying. A simple shortage of power overwhelms the Fiat 500L engine, despite its turbocharging and seemingly ample torque output. Not only is the wagon comparatively tall and heavy, its blunt front end is practically the opposite of aerodynamic. When accelerating to pass on the highway, entering a freeway, or coping with swift-moving traffic, the driver has to extract every morsel of power to get the job done.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is only average, at best. The 500L is EPA-rated at 22/30 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. In an era when the Honda Fit is estimated around 10 mpg higher, a 25-mpg Combined rating fails to impress.</p>, <p>The Fiat 500L offers a good value in terms of features. It’s a quirky car and doesn’t reach the bar set by comparable small wagons and hatchbacks. Some folks will adore it, but many may want to steer clear.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Toyota Prius was redesigned for 2016, and for 2017 it was upgraded with more standard equipment. For 2018 Prius models, there is little that’s new, except for a tablet-sized touchscreen in the top models.</p>, <p>Powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine mated to an electric motor, Prius remains the king of fuel mileage, at least among cars that aren’t plugged in overnight.</p>, <p>Prius gets an EPA-rated 50/54 mpg City/Highway, 52 mpg Combined. The Two Eco model gets even more, with 53/58/56 mpg. The plug-in Prius Prime can go 22 miles on all-electric power.</p>, <p>The electric motor and four-cylinder hybrid are a proven and reliable combination, and the current Prius is faster than pre-2016 models, drawing on a combined 121 horsepower.</p>, <p>There’s a choice of batteries among the models: The standard battery pack in the Prius One and Prius Two is a 1.2 kwh nickel-metal hydride, used reliably for generations of Prius models.</p>, <p>Higher-tech 0.75-kwh lithium-ion batteries are used on the rest of the models: Prius Three, Prius Four, up to Prius Plus, Premium and Advanced.</p>, <p>Lithium-ion batteries are about half the weight of nickel-hydride, and they charge up faster and more completely. The power output and durability of Li-ion and Ni-MH batteries is about the same, but Li-on is more expensive mostly because fewer batteries are made. Tesla uses lithium-ion, so does iPhone. If Li-ion has an Achilles heel, it’s breakdown in high temperatures. Don’t leave your cellphone in the sun or park your Tesla for long if you live in the Australian Outback. As for their impact on the environment, lithium-ion wins, except for one little thing; it turns water to hydrochloric acid, making disposal a critical matter.</p>, <p>The Prius is as safe as it is efficient, with a straight-A report card from the IIHS, earning the Top Safety Pick+ designation. Even the base model includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, and active lane control. It all comes in a package called Toyota Safety Sense-P.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55894" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-2.jpg" width="200"/>Prius One ($23,475) comes with LED headlamps and taillamps, 4.2-inch driver information display, cloth upholstery, 15-inch wheels, the Safety Sense-P suite of advanced safety equipment, keyless ignition, a rearview camera, and a 6.1-inch touchscreen. Built for fleet service, it lacks a split-folding rear seat and rear wiper. Prius One and Prius Two ($24,685) use Ni-MH batteries. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Prius Three ($26,735) comes with softer interior materials, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, wireless cellphone charging. Prius Three Touring ($28,115) adds synthetic leather seating surfaces instead of cloth.</p>, <p>The new 11.6-inch touchscreen is standard on Prius Four ($29,685), along with heated front seats, and power-adjustable driver’s seat. Prius Four Touring adds power passenger seats, blue contrast stitching, and automatic wipers are offered on the Prius Four Touring trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55897" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The redesign for 2016 transformed three-fourths of the Prius, sculpting the nose and sides, and making it longer, lower and wider. The black roof pillars made the roofline float. The new body gave the prosaic Prius swoop and sedan stature. The aerodynamic and still egg-shaped Prius now looks distinctive.</p>, <p>But the rear end got excessive in the details, with non-cohesive arcing lines at the outside edges of the taillamps; in that the c-shapes flow forward, widening the rear end and making it look higher. But maybe giving the Prius an uplifting butt was intentional. The bottom of the bumper is blacked out, which helps bring it down, but the rear clearance still looks high. Aerodynamics at work.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55896" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>If those curves on the hatch are non-cohesive, some of the cabin details are downright conflicting. The plastics, textured or glossy, are questionable, and the bins are clunky. But the shape of the dashboard wrap is stylish, the way it wraps to the doors makes the interior look clean and sophisticated; and we like the instrument display with upmarket color screen, and the way the console sweeps into the big standard touchscreen, even bigger at 11.6 inches on upper models.</p>, <p>The cabin feels sporty, like a compact or mid-sized hatchback. The available two-tone beige and gray upholstery looks adult, but the optional pearlescent-white center console scratches easily (there’s an optional $200 cover for it).</p>, <p>The front seats are reasonably well bolstered and comfortable. Higher models get eight-way power adjustment with lumbar support.</p>, <p>Most passengers will fit in the back, but the slope of the roofline squeezes headroom for tall people. The bolsters on the outboard rear seats push those occupants to the middle, further squeezing that third person in the rear. But there’s decent legroom, with 33.4 inches. The battery packs are neatly located under the seat. Both the nickel and more explosive lithium.</p>, <p>The rear seats split and fold. If the liftback hatch design limits headroom in the rear seat, it makes up for it by opening up big cargo space, more than 27 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55895" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-prius-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 1.8-liter internal combustion engine makes 95 horsepower, and the 53-kilowatt electric motor makes a total of 121 horsepower combined. It’s pokey. Despite its years of development, the Toyota engine is less refined than the Chevy Volt’s. It’s quieter than it used to be, but it still lets you know you’re in a Prius.</p>, <p>The good news is that the ride makes you forget you’re in a Prius.</p>, <p>The continuously variable transmission, or CVT, is pokey; deliberately so, because it’s programmed for efficiency not responsiveness. The object is fuel mileage.</p>, <p>The chassis got more rigid in 2016, but the steering still feels like a limp handshake. It can’t interest the driver.</p>, <p>The braking, both regenerative and friction, is fairly seamless and confident.</p>, <p>The Prius delivers what it promises. High fuel mileage, with stylish looks, comfort and civility, for a very affordable price. There’s nothing wrong with the nickel-hydride batteries in the Prius Two.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-fit/
[<p>The five-door Honda Fit, last redesigned for 2015, is an exceptional hatchback, for its performance, packaging, cargo/interior capacity, looks, and fuel efficiency.</p>, <p>Tall in height, short in length, the subcompact Fit is a benchmark of versatility and space efficiency. It’s roomier inside than many midsize sedans, with 39.3 inches of rear legroom.</p>, <p>Fit is unchanged for 2018, except for some upgrades to available safety equipment.</p>, <p>The Fit is powered by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine with direct injection, making 130 horsepower and 114 pound-feet of torque. A smooth 6-speed manual gearbox is standard, but a seven-step continuously variable transmission (CVT) with paddle shifters comes on most models.</p>, <p>With that transmission it gets 36 Combined miles per gallon, according to the EPA. (The manual transmission in the Fit LX and Fit EX gets 32 mpg.) It has excellent scores in the NHTSA and IIHS crash tests.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55885" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Honda Fit comes in three models. Fit LX ($16,190), available with CVT ($16,990), comes with air conditioning, keyless entry, cruise control, rearview camera. Fit EX adds 16-inch alloy wheels, pushbutton start, upgraded infotainment, and Honda’s LaneWatch view in the sideview mirror, which provides a wide rear view using a camera, and is available with manual ($18,160) or CVT ($18,960). Fit EX-L adds leather ($20,525); Fit EX-LN adds navigation ($21,520).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55887" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Honda Fit is five inches taller than the Honda Civic sedan, and has a long roofline with ample glass, so it looks more like a boxy wagon with a wedge-shaped nose, than a squat hatchback.</p>, <p>At 60 inches to the roof, it’s one of the tallest subcompacts on the market.</p>, <p>The Fit is not sleek like the Ford Fiesta, but it’s attractive and eye-catching (especially in white) in its angular way. The windshield is nearly as steep as the short nose. A sharp character crease low on the sides exaggerates the length. The rear end hints Volvo, with long vertical taillamps that drop from the liftgate to the bumper. A big chrome bar runs across the back, in contrast to the otherwise cohesive styling.</p>, <p>The look and feel of the interior may not be impressive, but the space and flexibility are unrivaled.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55886" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The rear seatback drops down and the rear seats flip up, to create relatively vast cargo space, from an event called Magic Seat, with four cargo/seating arrangements. A Refresh mode tilts the rear seatbacks like a lounge chair. The front passenger seat in Long mode also can fold flat, wonderful for sports equipment or construction materials. A whole bicycle or small kayak can fit in the cargo area, something that’s not possible with many crossovers. A small tree or living room lamp can stand behind the passenger seat.</p>, <p>The front seats are only adequate, with thin cushions that aren’t so magic. Long-legged drivers might not fit because the seat doesn’t slide back so far. The passenger footwell has an odd shape that cants the seating position.</p>, <p>The rear seat has great legroom and headroom, although the Magic Seat cushion is a bit thin. The tall door openings make entry and exit easy for a subcompact.</p>, <p>The interior materials are durable enough, but not at all luxurious. The carpeting and headliner don’t exude quality. The ambitious and busy dashboard feels haphazard, with many angles, shapes, bits and pieces. The small crossover Honda HR-V, based on the Fit, is simpler and more relaxing to the eye and brain.</p>, <p>The Fit is one of the quieter cars in its class, however there’s wind noise on the highway coming from around the large sideview mirrors. And there’s engine noise at full throttle, suggesting thin sound insulation.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55888" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-fit-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 1.5-liter engine is peaky, reaching its maximum torque of 115 pound-feet at 4600 rpm, while its sweet spot for zip is about 4000 rpm. That’s the far other end of some small-displacement turbocharged engines, that have their torque down low. Those engines are more relaxing to drive because they’re responsive even if you’re lazy with the throttle.</p>, <p>Redline for the engine is 6800 rpm, making the powerband challenging. Fortunately the paddle-shifting 7-speed CVT is a well-matched transmission that makes downshifting for torque quick and easy. The CVT has a sport mode that quickens throttle response, as well.</p>, <p>The CVT doesn’t feel like a big rubber band like so many others; it’s way better than the Nissan unit. Honda is trying to make their CVTs indistinguishable from a smooth automatic .</p>, <p>The CVT gets four more miles per gallon than the six-speed manual, 36 mpg vs 32 mpg, an indication of its efficiency.</p>, <p>Meanwhile the standard 6-speed manual transmission is precise and shifts sweet, about the best we’ve experienced in a subcompact. If you can find one, and if you want to pay 4 mpg for the fun you might have with the manual.</p>, <p>The brake pedal is precise and easy to modulate.</p>, <p>The current Honda Fit is fun to drive, but not as sporty as the first-generation version because it leans more in corners and dives more under braking. Its suspension (front struts, rear torsion beam) is designed for a solid and controlled ride, which it delivers despite its short wheelbase.</p>, <p>The engine is a bit peaky, but the 7-step CVT with paddle shifters deals with it. The Fit is in a class of its own among subcompact hatchbacks, a winner in style, interior room, versatility, reliability, ride, and fuel mileage.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-kia-rio/
[<p>Redesigned for 2018, the Kia Rio subcompact sedan and hatchback show numerous improvements over the outgoing model. All-new and beginning its fourth generation, the 2018 Rio is slightly lower and wider than before.</p>, <p>The 2018 Rio comes with a new 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that develops 130 horsepower and 119 pound-feet of torque, slightly less than previously, but improved drivability is promised. As before, Rio is front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Autonomous emergency braking is available. UVO3 infotainment has been upgraded with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability are available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55875" height="136" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-5door.jpg" width="200"/>The four-door sedans and five-door hatchbacks each come in LX, S, or EX trim level. Aside from selecting the desired trim and body color, buyers have little choice, since no options are offered.</p>, <p>Hatchbacks benefit most from the new look for 2018, but they’re handily outsold by sedans. The new sedan’s proportions appear less frumpy.</p>, <p>EX trim level comes not only with emergency braking, but all-disc brakes (instead of rear drums) and better-quality seats.</p>, <p>Otherwise, Kia hasn’t given its entry-level duo much in the way of up-to-date safety equipment. Despite the fact that rearview cameras will soon be mandatory, it’s standard only on S and EX models. Blind-spot monitoring isn’t offered at all, despite the Rio’s obtrusively thick rear pillars (especially on hatchbacks).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55874" height="135" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-rear-5door.jpg" width="200"/>Rio LX sedan ($13,900) and hatchback ($14,200) come with cloth seats, manual windows, air conditioning, satellite radio, steering-wheel audio controls, 15-inch steel wheels, and manual transmission. Also available is LX automatic sedan ($14,990) and hatchback ($15,290). (Prices are MSRP and do not include $895 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Rio S sedan ($16,100) and hatchback ($16,400) add a rearview camera, cruise control, 5.0-inch display, remote keyless entry, Bluetooth connectivity, power windows, and a split-folding rear seat. A 6-speed automatic transmission is standard. Rio EX sedan ($18,400) and hatchback ($18,700) upgrade to UVO3 infotainment with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, rear disc brakes, 15-inch alloy wheels, a 3.5-inch information screen, embossed cloth seat trim, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. Autonomous emergency braking is standard.</p>, <p>A Launch Edition package ($500) includes leather inserts in the seats.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55878" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-rear-sedan.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-rear-sedan.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-rear-sedan-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Conservative in styling, yet sleeker than its predecessor, the 2018 Kia Rio shows cleaner body lines than its rather dowdy predecessor, especially in hatchback form. Sheetmetal creases are sharper. Front ends are a little taller than before, wearing a more upright tiger nose grille.</p>, <p>Foglamps have moved outward, making the Rio look wider. Windshield pillars are more upright. Dimensions have increased, but only slightly.</p>, <p>On both body styles, designers opened up the lower front bumper, resulting in a more expressive face. Headlights sit higher, reaching further back into the front fenders. Wheels have been pushed out toward the corners, shrinking the previously-excessive overhangs. Hatchback rear ends, in particular, look the best, avoiding the sedan’s blanked-out rear quarter window.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55876" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Quiet and comfortable for adults, the Rio’s cabin is significantly improved. According to the EPA, the Rio again qualifies as a compact car, in terms of interior space. Cabin details also suggest a move upward in class.</p>, <p>Improved quietness results from greater use of adhesives in the chassis, according to Kia, helping to subdue road and tire sounds.</p>, <p>Front seats are comfortable and adequately (but thinly) padded. Only the driver’s seat adjusts up/down.</p>, <p>Back seats are surprisingly spacious as well as comfortable. Even taller adults can typically sit behind another adult without feeling too cramped. Two passengers fit best, but for shorter trips, three teenagers aren’t likely to complain about squeezing.</p>, <p>Sitting relatively low and more upright than before, the Rio dashboard contains a thoughtfully-considered central touchscreen. In EX models, the 7.0-inch touchscreen works with UVO3, the latest version of Kia’s slick-operating infotainment system. Prompt responses and natural swiping action mean UVO3 outperforms several competitors.</p>, <p>Cargo volume again totals 13.7 cubic feet in sedans. Hatchbacks offer 17.4 cubic feet with seatbacks upright (a gain of 2). Folding the seatback expands that space to 32.8 cubic feet. Hatchback openings have widened.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55873" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-rio-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Compared to the outgoing Rio, the 2018 versions are a lot more livable. Despite ranking as a budget-focused car, the latest Rio performs better, with greater response at lower speeds. Power might be comparatively modest, but it’s delivered in a more immediate manner.</p>, <p>Essentially, the Rio makes good use of its available energy, eagerly infusing a touch of spirit into road behavior. Even its sounds are pleasant ones.</p>, <p>Though adequate, Kia’s 6-speed automatic transmission can be indecisive. Still, it does an admirable job of keeping the small engine behaving with peak efficiency. A Sport button causes the transmission to hold each gear longer, which inevitably hurts fuel economy.</p>, <p>Also improved is ride quality, which is impressively composed, despite use of the same basic suspension as before – which earned subpar evaluation. Revised spring and damper settings have made the suspension more compliant, able to subdue more pavement roughness.</p>, <p>Steering feel also has improved. So has its accuracy, though these benefits are somewhat overshadowed by unusually light weight at the steering wheel. Whether all-disc (in EX) or with rear drums, brakes feel confident, though hard stops yield some nosedive.</p>, <p>Regardless of transmission, the 2018 Rio is relatively fuel efficient. Equipped with automatic, the Rio is EPA-rated at 28/37 mpg City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined. Manual-shift Rios reduce the City figure by just 1 mpg.</p>, <p>The Kia Rio comes modestly equipped in base trim, though fitted with a fine infotainment system. Step-up models add quite a few desirable features. The price starts climbing, however.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-yaris/
[<p>The Toyota Yaris lineup includes two unrelated subcompact cars: The Toyota Yaris 3-Door and 5-Door hatchbacks date back to 2007. The Yaris iA four-door sedan, on the other hand, began life as a the Scion iA sedan, a totally different product.</p>, <p>Yaris sedan and hatch models are in the same size class, however, so when Toyota folded the Scion brand in 2016, the Scion iA was relaunched as the Yaris iA.</p>, <p>For 2018, Yaris hatchbacks get a new grille, front fascia, and rear bumper. A black mesh grille with chrome surround goes on Yaris SE versions. Wider taillights are integrated into back doors. Base L models gain a tilt steering wheel with audio controls. Not many observers are likely to notice the changes to the hatch. Even fewer will notice changes to the sedan, because there aren’t any.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55868" height="143" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-yaris-ia.jpg" width="200"/>Designed and manufactured by Mazda, the Yaris iA has been sold in other parts of the world as the Mazda 2.</p>, <p>Yaris hatchbacks come in L, LE, and SE trim levels, with either three or five doors. The Yaris iA sedan comes in a single trim.</p>, <p>Both cars use 1.5-liter four-cylinder engines that develop 106 horsepower, but the two engines are unrelated. The hatchback engine is Toyota-built, while the sedan’s hails from Mazda. Hatchbacks can have a 5-speed manual gearbox or a 4-speed automatic (one of the few 4-speed automatics that remain available today, as most have more gears now). The iA sedan comes with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Toyota has taken the lead in standard safety features, even for its least-expensive models. The Yaris hatchback comes with a suite of advanced safety features, including lane-departure warning, automatic high beams, and automatic emergency braking. Because the iA’s safety equipment was developed by Mazda, lane-departure warning and automatic high beams are not included. Although the hatchback’s automatic braking system works at all speeds, the iA’s functions only at lower velocities.</p>, <p>Safety ratings are good for the sedan, but less so for hatchbacks. The iA sedan has earned top Good scores in crash-testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, awarded a Top Safety Pick designation. The hatchback is marred by a Marginal rating for the small-overlap frontal impact test.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the Yaris iA a five-star overall rating, including five stars in each separate test. The 2017 five-door hatchback rated only four stars overall, with a four-star frontal-impact score and five-star for side impact.</p>, <p>Toyota Yaris 3-Door L hatch comes with a 5-speed manual ($15,635) or 4-speed automatic transmission ($16,385), cloth seats, 15-inch steel wheels, tilt steering wheel, 6.1-inch touchscreen, daytime running lights, and 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $895 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55866" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-yaris-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-yaris-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-yaris-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Yaris 5-Door L ($16,760) comes only with automatic.</p>, <p>Yaris 3-Door LE ($17,285) and 5-Door LE ($17,660) come with 4-speed automatic, plus 15-inch alloy wheels, cruise control and keyless entry.</p>, <p>Yaris 5-Door SE ($18,260) includes 16-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, black mesh grille, leather-wrapped steering wheel, Scout navigation app, and all-disc brakes. Manual gearbox is standard, automatic is available ($19,060).</p>, <p>Yaris iA sedan or automatic comes with 6-speed manual ($15,950) or 6-speed automatic transmission ($17,050), 16-inch alloy wheels, rearview camera, remote keyless entry, pushbutton start, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, Bluetooth, and 7.0-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>Revisions to the hatchback body for 2018 may be comparatively minor, but every step helps in improving appearance. Several hatchback design details appear to be borrowed from Toyota’s Prius, including the pointed front bumper. Hatchback bodies are rather slab-sided, though the five-door comes across as more appealing.</p>, <p>Toyota hasn’t tried hard to conceal the iA sedan’s inception as a Mazda model. Overall, the iA conveys a tidy look, but with few distinguishing details. Except for the front end, little evidence of corporate Toyota influence can be seen.</p>, <p>Front occupants in either version of the Yaris won’t face a shortage of space for adult legs or heads. Not much difference is evident between body styles, except for wide frames and supportive cushions in the hatchback. Tall drivers might have a hard time achieving a comfortable position in the hatchback, because seats don’t adjust much.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, those two are the only passengers who can expect comfort. Although the hatchback’s wheelbase is comparable to that of Honda’s Fit, the latter provides 6 more inches of rear-seat legroom. Seats in the Yaris SE are a bit more sporty.</p>, <p>The Yaris iA is only slightly better in back-seat space, though a tad more ergonomic in design.</p>, <p>Split-folding rear seats fold forward to increase cargo space, but the hatchback’s load floor isn’t totally flat. With seatbacks upright, the hatchback provides 15.6 cubic feet of cargo volume (15.3 in the three-door). For its class, those are respectable figures. The iA sedan’s trunk holds 13.5 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Neither Yaris version is particularly quiet, though acoustic windows in upper trim levels can stifle some engine thrumming.</p>, <p>Cabins of each Yaris are rather plain and ordinary. Both include touchscreens (6.1 inches in hatchback, 7.0-inch for iA sedan). However, neither Yaris includes Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55865" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-yaris-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-yaris-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-yaris-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Appreciation for the Yaris depends on the body style, but both tend to be slow as well as loud. The Yaris iA sedan can be pleasant and even fun to drive.</p>, <p>The Yaris hatchbacks are harder to like. Continued use of a 4-speed automatic, in this era of 6- and 8-speed units, inevitably restricts performance. Undeniably, the hatchback serves as a best-forgotten reminder of the old econobox era, when frugality handily outranked performance.</p>, <p>Both versions deserve credit for keeping a manual transmission available, even though most buyers prefer automatics. With the Yaris iA sedan, the manual gearbox is almost a necessity, to extract every last bit of horsepower from the overmatched engine. The manual is even more essential for the Yaris hatchbacks, compared to the widely spaced gear ratios in its outmoded 4-speed automatic.</p>, <p>At least, the iA compensates for its shortage of power with precise, well-weighted steering and generally satisfying suspension. Ride comfort and handling qualities are reasonably good.</p>, <p>The Yaris hatchback has its merits, too. Relatively soft springs help keep it steady when rolling over bumps and traversing harsher pavement. Handling from the Yaris SE hatchback benefits a bit from a stiffer suspension, but it isn’t sporty.</p>, <p>Fuel economy, as expected, is a plus. With automatic, the Yaris iA sedan is EPA-rated at 32/40 mpg City/Highway, or 35 mpg Combined. Manual shift drops the estimate to 30/39/34 mpg. Hatchbacks are EPA-rated at 30/35 mpg City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined, with the 4-speed automatic. With 5-speed manual, the hatchback is just a tad thriftier, EPA-rated at 30/36/33 mpg.</p>, <p>Plenty of smaller cars are available to budget-stretching buyers, promising dependable transportation and reasonably well-equipped. The Yaris hatchback feels built with economy uppermost in mind, and is hard to recommend with either transmission. The Yaris iA sedan promises greater value, along with a higher level of driving delight.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-sonic/
[<p>The Chevrolet Sonic, which debuted for the 2012 model year, earned strong ratings in the subcompact-car category. Today, Sonic is behind the times. Only a handful of minor changes mark the model year for the 2018 Chevrolet Sonic.</p>, <p>Sonic comes in sedan and hatchback versions. Both ride the same wheelbase.</p>, <p>For 2018, the RS package adds black bowtie emblems. The Fun and Sun package for 2018 includes 17-inch alloy wheels, as well as the 1.4-liter turbo engine and a sunroof.</p>, <p>Sedans come in base LS, midlevel LT, and top Premier trim levels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55838" height="137" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-hatch.jpg" width="200"/>Hatchbacks are offered in LT and Premier guise.</p>, <p>Powertrains haven’t changed much over the Sonic’s lifetime. The base engine is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder, making 138 horsepower. The more powerful turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder is rated at 138 horsepower, also, but its torque output of 148 pound-feet is 23 more than the base engine delivers. Not only do turbocharged cars accelerate with greater spirit, they’re more fuel-efficient at lower engine speeds.</p>, <p>Only the 1.8-liter engine is available with base LS trim, which comes with wind-up windows and steel wheels. LT versions can have either engine.</p>, <p>Most Sonic buyers will choose the optional 6-speed automatic transmission, but a 5-speed manual gearbox is standard. Turbos get a 6-speed manual as standard.</p>, <p>Striving to keep pace with the competition, Chevrolet updated front-end styling and reworked the interior for the 2017 model year, while adding some active-safety features.</p>, <p>Crash-test ratings have been impressive. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration not only gave the 2018 Sonic five stars for overall safety, it earned five stars in every category except rollover prevention (a calculated figure), where it got four stars. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 2017 Sonic its top Good rating for each test performance. No rating was given for the small-overlap test on the passenger side. Latch child-safety seat anchors scored only Marginal for ease of use.</p>, <p>All Sonics come with 10 airbags and a rearview camera. Several active-safety features are optional rather than standard, but relatively affordable. A $495 Driver Confidence Package, available for LT and Premier versions, includes forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, and rear parking assist. That option group makes the Sonic competitive in the subcompact class, but behind several rival small cars.</p>, <p>Sonic LS 4-Door Sedan ($15,295) comes with the 1.8-liter engine, 5-speed manual transmission, rearview camera, steering-wheel controls, keyless entry, air conditioning, Bluetooth, a USB port, LED daytime running lights, 15-inch steel wheels, and OnStar connectivity. A 6-speed automatic transmission ($1,200) is optional. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $875 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Sonic LT 4-Door Sedan ($17,695) offer a choice of 1.4-liter turbo or 1.8-liter engine and matching manual shift, plus deluxe cloth seat trim, power windows and mirrors, cruise control, 15-inch alloy wheels, six-speaker audio, two USB ports, and chrome beltline moldings. Sonic LT 5-Door Hatchback ($17,795) is equipped similarly but with hatchback body. Automatic transmission ($700) is optional.</p>, <p>Sonic Premier Sedan ($19,795) and Hatchback ($19,795) come with the turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, adding heated power front seats, 17-inch alloy wheels, foglamps, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and enhanced digital instruments. Automatic ($700) is optional.</p>, <p>The RS Package includes a sport body kit.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55836" height="148" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-rear-hatch.jpg" width="200"/>Overall, the Sonic design has aged reasonably well, helped by a modernized front end for the 2017 model year, echoing appearance of recent Chevrolets. The two-element grille includes a large lower intake, with scoop-like openings for available foglamps. Projector-beam headlights are complemented by LED daytime running lights.</p>, <p>The five-door hatchback looks more settled than the sedan, though the blocky trunk is a bit large, lacking in elegance. Considering its seven-year history, the comparatively simple, basic shape of the hatchback isn’t obsolete.</p>, <p>Front seats are comfortable, but even two passengers in the rear can expect a tight experience. Taller adults are likely to be short on headroom, as well as leg space.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55839" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Early Sonics conveyed an econocar aura, but the current cabin is significantly more stylish. During recent years, quite a few subcompact cars have grown bigger, but Chevrolet hasn’t enlarged the Sonic.</p>, <p>Mounted at the center of the straightforward instrument panel is a large speedometer, matched by a slightly smaller tachometer. The infotainment touchscreen sits above big, intuitive rotary knobs that make climate adjustments.</p>, <p>Seat fabrics and abundant black plastic trim, among other interior elements, are appropriate for the subcompact segment. All told, the Sonic comes across as higher in quality than some Asian rivals. Each Sonic also is quiet on the road.</p>, <p>Cargo space is generous with either body style. Sedan trunks hold 14.9 cubic feet, with low liftover height. Hatchbacks promise 19 cubic-foot capacity with the rear seat up, growing to 42.7 cubic feet with the seat folded. A hidden bin is located below the cargo deck.</p>, <p>The hatchback’s load floor is a bit higher than in some competitors, but the Sonic’s relatively upright profile improves its ability to hold tall or long items. Rear seats in each body style flip forward.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55837" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-rear-sedan.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-rear-sedan.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sonic-rear-sedan-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Engine behavior varies considerably. The base engine feels weak, loud and harsh, in stark contrast to the smooth, sporty nature of the turbo four. Clearly, the turbo is a better choice, even offering more satisfying gas mileage.</p>, <p>Turbo-power Sonics are fun to drive, especially with the 6-speed manual gearbox. They handle nicely and feel admirably composed – as solid and sturdy as a bigger car. Chevrolet’s responsive electric power steering provides good feel and helpful weighting. Unlike some rivals, too, the ride is well-controlled rather than coarse and overly active.</p>, <p>Top fuel-economy ratings stem from the 1.4-liter turbo with the 6-speed manual gearbox, EPA-rated at 28/37 mpg City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined. An automatic transmission drops that rating to 27/35 mpg City/Highway, or 30 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>With a 5-speed manual gearbox, the 1.8-liter engine is EPA-rated at 26/35 mpg City/Highway, or 29 mpg Combined. The 6-speed automatic reduces that estimate to 25/34/28 mpg. Fuel-economy estimates are identical for the hatchback and sedan.</p>, <p>Despite its age, the Sonic remains a good choice in the subcompact category, ranking above the pack in design and fuel economy, as well as in safety. Even the modestly equipped Sonic LS isn’t grimly austere. Not many new subcompacts have been emerging lately, but the Sonic is likely to carry on for a while yet. It’s even more affordable than in the past, because of incentives available on such less-popular small cars.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-smart-fortwo/
[<p>For the 2018 model year, every Smart fortwo model runs on electricity alone. In that battery-only respect, the minicar emulates Tesla, but at the other end of the price and size spectrum.</p>, <p>Gasoline-powered Smart two-seaters were previously available, but sagging sales prompted Mercedes-Benz, its parent company, to abandon that powertrain and turn strictly to battery power. So, all 2018 Smart fortwo models are electric cars.</p>, <p>Coupe and a soft-top Cabrio versions are available in the newly simplified lineup. A 10th Anniversary package is offered.</p>, <p>Three trim levels are offered: Pure, Passion, and Prime.</p>, <p>A 60-kilowatt, 80-horsepower electric motor powers the Smart fortwo. Developing 118 pound-feet of torque, a significant increase over last year, it drives the rear wheels via a single-speed transmission. Rated 17.6 kilowatt-hours, the lithium-ion battery pack sits beneath the passenger compartment.</p>, <p>With the onboard 7.2-kW charger, a full charge takes 3 hours. Although the Smart Company claims a range of 70 to 80 miles before recharging is needed, the EPA estimate is lower than 60 miles.</p>, <p>Redesigned for the 2016 model year, the fortwo retains its status as the easiest U.S.-market car to park on crowded streets. With electric drive, the Smart car becomes what it should have been all along: quirky, with limitations, but smooth, quiet, and eager to zip around town.</p>, <p>On the downside, few active-safety features are available, and up-to-date crash-test data has not yet been revealed. While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the 2017 gasoline version four stars overall, that federal agency specifically avoided the electric model. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2017 Smart car only two ratings: both Good, for side-impact and moderate-overlap frontal crash tests.</p>, <p>Smart cars are built with an extremely stiff safety cell. Eight airbags and a rearview camera are standard. Crosswind Assist can brake and steer the car automatically, to counteract gusty conditions. Newer electronic safety systems, such as automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warning, are not available.</p>, <p>Built in France, Smart models are eligible for a federal income-tax credit up to $7,500, a $2,500 rebate in California, and various other state, local, and corporate incentives. Still, the fortwo ranks as basic compared to electric cars that cost only slightly more.</p>, <p>Smart fortwo Pure Coupe ($23,900) comes with automatic climate control, power windows, cruise control, LED running lights, Bluetooth streaming, and 15-inch steel wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Passion Coupe ($25,390) gets a stylish two-tone interior, plus a leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated power mirrors, and a retractable cargo cover.</p>, <p>Passion Cabrio ($28,100) features a fabric roof.</p>, <p>Prime Coupe ($26,740) and Cabrio ($29,100) upgrade with silver-colored trim, accent stitching on black leather seat upholstery, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Also standard are a panoramic sunroof, LED lighting, foglamps, heated seats, and rain sensing.</p>, <p>A 10th Anniversary Edition package for Passion or Prime Coupes includes Sapphire Blue Metallic paint, plus BRABUS floor mats, shift knob, and 16-inch grey wheels.</p>, <p>Despite its minuscule 8.8-foot length, the fortwo exudes a degree of road presence when viewed from the front. Comparatively tall and slab-sided, the Smart car leads off with a snub nose and retains what some might call a cheeky demeanor.</p>, <p>The Tridion safety cell, which outlines the body structure, is available in contrasting colors. A small, fixed glass pane sits at the rear of each door, while door handles fit into a beltline bulge.</p>, <p>Cabrio convertibles come with a power-operated, roll-back fabric roof. Currently, the fortwo Cabrio is the only soft-top electric car sold in the U.S. Removing the door-top beams strengthens the open-air sensation a bit, though the roll bar remains in place.</p>, <p>Two Smart occupants can expect comfortable seating, though luggage space is limited. Seat cushions may be a tad short for longer-legged occupants, but headroom should satisfy even those who top 6 feet. Seating positions are high and upright.</p>, <p>As its name indicates, the fortwo, lacking a back seat, cannot accept a third passenger of any size.</p>, <p>Though basic and simple, the cabin is essentially modern, not nearly as utilitarian in tone as early Smart cars. A small gauge cluster contains the speedometer around its circumference. The tachometer sits within a dashboard-top pod. A central display contains knobs and dials, along with a small video screen.</p>, <p>Above the rear-mounted electric motor, a cargo bay holds 9.2 cubic feet. That’s more than a Mini Cooper. A retractable cargo cover can be removed and stowed ahead of the rather high load floor.</p>, <p>Door inserts and the dashboard are covered by coarse-grained fabric. Interior trim includes hard plastic components. Outward visibility is good, but nfotainment and smartphone integration are weak spots.</p>, <p>Ease of parking, as demonstrated in TV commercials, is the Smart car’s most compelling feature, apart from its thrifty and smooth electric drive system. A tight turning circle (22.8 feet) makes for startlingly nimble urban behavior. No other car can whip into tiny parking spots with such ease, or make U-turns, where permitted, in such narrow spaces. Maneuverability and agility are hard to beat.</p>, <p>Front fender wells are deeper than those in pre-2016 models, allowing sharper wheel angles. Overall width is 4 inches greater than in the past, too. A low-mounted battery pack makes the center of gravity appropriately low. Even at highway speeds, the 2018 Smart car feels confident and secure. With either 15- or 16-inch tires, the fortwo grips the pavement well.</p>, <p>A substantial torque increase in the electric motor for 2018 makes highway driving more feasible, though the Smart car still functions best as a capable urban contender. Highway acceleration is still on the sluggish side. Charging time is reasonably short (3 hours or less); but naturally, regular access to a charging station is mandatory.</p>, <p>Despite its short wheelbase, the Smart fortwo promises decent ride comfort, with a suspension that absorbs most pavement imperfections. On most surfaces, the ride is surprisingly smooth and quiet.</p>, <p>As for operating cost, the battery-powered Smart fortwo Coupe is EPA-rated at 124/94 MPGe (equivalent miles per gallon) City/Highway, or 108 MPGe Combined. The Cabrio rating drops to 112/91/102 MPGe. Range is EPA-rated at 58 miles (57 for the Cabrio), though the company claims 70-80 miles.</p>, <p>Parking ease and urban agility might make the Smart car tempting. So might the smoothness and efficiency of its electric drive. Assembly quality is good, and plenty of options are available. Otherwise, it’s essentially basic transportation, with no back seat and a quirk or two to contend with.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-focus/
[<p>The Ford Focus is an extroverted compact car that handles well and can go uptown. It comes as a four-door sedan or five-door hatchback, in a number of powertrains and trims that broaden the appeal, ranging from economy car to luxury car to muscle car. There’s even a Focus Electric model that gets 105 MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent).</p>, <p>The 2018 Focus is in its eighth year of this generation.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with direct injection and variable valve timing, making 160 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque. Those stats don’t sound big but there’s plenty of pep. The transmission is either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed dual-clutch automatic that has issues. It gets 31 miles per gallon combined.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55826" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-focus-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>There’s also a turbocharged three-cylinder with the tiny displacement of 1.0 liters, making 123 horsepower, a lot less than the 2.0 liter, but with the same torque. It’s less quick but gets 34 mpg with its 6-speed manual transmission (one more gear than the 2.0 liter because it needs it, to keep the revs up). With the available 6-speed automatic it gets 2 less mpg, which is only 1 mpg more than the 2.0-liter engine with the manual. Any advantage to the three-cylinder engine fades in the Focus, although that’s not so in the smaller and lighter Ford Fiesta.</p>, <p>As for high performance, the Focus ST hatchback is at the top of the heap of high-performance compacts, with its 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 252 horsepower and 6-speed manual gearbox. It accelerates to 60 miles per hour in just 6.3 seconds, on its way to a top speed of 155 mph. It has been roundly and deservedly praised as a winner and great performance value.</p>, <p>Then there is the breathtaking Focus RS hatchback with its 2.3-liter turbo making 350 horsepower. To handle that power in the curves, it uses torque-vectoring all-wheel drive with driving modes including Track and Drift.</p>, <p>The NHTSA gives the Focus five stars in its crash tests. The IIHS gives it the top Good scores for most of its tests, but only Acceptable in the difficult small-overlap test.</p>, <p>The 2017 Ford Focus S ($17,860) is reasonably well equipped, with power windows/locks/mirrors, air conditioning, Bluetooth, AM/FM/CD, adjustable steering wheel with controls, and rearview camera. The torque-vectoring system also comes standard on the front-wheel drive. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>It’s a big jump up to the Focus SE hatchback ($20,445), which adds larger 16-inch steel wheels, cruise control, fog lamps, and Ford’s MyKey system. Options include leather, a power driver seat, rear disc brakes, rear parking sensors, moonroof, navigation, heated seats, satellite radio, and Sony audio. There’s also an available Sport package with a touring suspension, 17-inch black gloss aluminum wheels, H-rated tires, and paddleshifters for twin-clutch transmission.</p>, <p>Focus SEL hatchback ($21,975) gets 17-inch wheels, rear disc brakes, a moonroof, ambient lighting, rear parking sensors, and the Sync 3 infotainment system.</p>, <p>The Focus Titanium ($24,175 sedan, 24,375 hatch) gets dual-zone climate control, leather, Sony audio, HD and satellite radio, sport suspension, sport seats, and summer performance tires on sport wheels. Options include automatic parking assistance (parks itself, using cameras).</p>, <p>The high-performance Focus ST ($25,075), in addition to its impressive speed upgrades, gets styling kits and 18- or 19-inch wheels. Options include navigation, Recaro seats, and a carbon-fiber accent package.</p>, <p>With the leap in power of the Focus RS, there is a leap in price ($41,120).</p>, <p>Available safety equipment on higher models includes blind-spot monitors and lane-keeping assists. There are no available forward-collision or automatic-braking systems.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55825" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-focus-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Focus looks way better as a five-door hatchback than as a sedan. Even after eight years (although it was restyled for 2015), it’s on the far edge of swoop. Its creases and curves complement the wide-mouth grille. The rising window line adds drama, and the huge taillamps nicely frame the corners.</p>, <p>Focus ST and Focus RS are restrained, even with a lower stance, bigger wheels and lower bodywork. However there’s nothing restrained about the basket of logos stuck to the sheetmetal.</p>, <p>The Focus cabin was overstyled when it was new, and now that it’s eight years old it feels dated (thanks to Honda Civic’s reinvention of compact car interiors). The standard info screen is just 4.2 inches. The vertical vents and pleasant sculpting are complex and original, but the design makes the front feel cramped. And there’s a lot of plastic, although the seats and door trim are nicely tailored, especially the satin chrome in the top model Titanium.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55828" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-focus-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-focus-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-focus-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The front seats are fairly supportive, even in the S and SE models. The plusher Titanium seats offer good thigh and back support, and a bit more bolstering. The expensive optional Recaro seats in the ST and RS are very snug, and don’t work for tall people.</p>, <p>The back seat is skimpy, with slim headroom and legroom. And with small door openings, ingress and egress is awkward. The hatchback is better than the sedan. The release to fold the rear seat can’t be reached through the hatch, and the headrests have to be removed to get the seatbacks all the way down.</p>, <p>The optional Sync 3 infotainment system is slicker and much improved over the previous unpopular MyFord Touch system. Sync 3 has a fully capacitive screen with pinching and swiping capability, a streamlined menu structure, smart-charging USB ports, and AppLink capability for on-screen operation of various smartphone apps. But Sync 3 also has issues. Response to the buttons is slow, and we had trouble switching between day and night modes on the touchscreen.</p>, <p>Forward visibility is good for a compact car, but rearward visibility not so good. However a rearview camera is standard, so the problem is hugely alleviated.</p>, <p>The Focus isn’t notably silent in the cabin, but neither is it noisy. Typical for a compact, coarse road surfaces transmit some noise.</p>, <p>The Focus handling is up there with the Mazda 3 and Volkswagen Golf; in fact they’re probably the three best handling compact cars. It’s agile, with electric steering that is crisp and nicely weighted, although it doesn’t offer much road feel.</p>, <p>The ride is impressive, with a sophisticated suspension that’s quite firm but not harsh over bumps and doesn’t gnash your teeth over big ones.</p>, <p>The base 2.0-liter engine with 160 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque has adequate acceleration, and the 6-speed dual clutch does a good job of keeping the revs up when you need them, but it doesn’t shift smoothly at low speeds. The shift quality of Ford’s PowerShift 6-speed dual-clutch automatic manual transmission is a letdown. So you’re left with a 5-speed manual.</p>, <p>We haven’t driven the 1.0-liter in the Focus, although we have in the lighter Fiesta. It makes 123 horsepower and an overachieving 148 pound-feet of torque at just 1400 rpm, to provide get-up-and-go from stoplights. It’s mated to either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The S and SE models use drum brakes in the rear, while most rivals have four-wheel discs.</p>, <p>The ST, with its 240-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter engine and 6-speed manual gearbox, is very well engineered and integrated, with sharp and smooth driving dynamics that rival the Mazdaspeed3 or Subaru WRX STI. It uses a quick, variable-ratio steering rack, a suspension lowered by four-tenths of an inch, and rear dampers with widened mounting points. On a fun-to-drive scale of 1 to 10, it’s a solid 9.</p>, <p>The Focus RS is highly focused, with its 350 horsepower, extreme for a car this size. It has all the right mechanical and electronic structure behind that engine, including full-time all-wheel drive with dynamic torque vectoring, a beefy 6-speed gearbox, big brakes, tuned exhaust and suspension modes including Track and Drift. As an everyday driver, the ride is stiff and unyielding, it turns radically quick, and the torque steer is a handful to manage when you get on the gas. As a track car, it’s a dream.</p>, <p>The Ford Focus hatchback still looks good after all these years, but the interior is dated. The Focus delivers agile handling and sharp steering, though the automatic transmission isn’t always smooth and the Sync 3 infotainment system isn’t always easy. The three-cylinder engine doesn’t quite carry the Focus’s weight, and isn’t so great with fuel mileage. The Focus ST is the champ in the competitive pocket-rocket field, enough to prove Ford’s engineering capability and carry the image of the whole line.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-fiesta/
[<p>The Ford Fiesta is a tiny car with a tiny engine, but nimble handling makes it fun to drive while its dimensions make it easy to park. Fiesta comes in sedan and hatchback versions. Three engines are available, ranging from frugal to fun.</p>, <p>We prefer the hatch.</p>, <p>The standard engine is a 1.6-liter four cylinder making 120 horsepower that isn’t quick but feels peppy enough with the 5-speed manual transmission, if you work at keeping the revs up. The Fiesta only weighs 2600 pounds so that helps. It gets an EPA-rated 31 miles per gallon Combined city and highway with the five-speed. There’s also an available 6-speed dual-clutch automatic manual.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55819" height="165" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-fiesta-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>The newest engine is Ford’s tiny 1.0-liter three cylinder, turbocharged to make 123 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. You still have to keep the revs up, with the five-speed manual gearbox, but the little three-cylinder likes it. Before the engine was put in the Fiesta, it was successful in Europe, where fuel mileage matters a lot because of high taxes on gasoline. The EPA rates it 36 mpg Combined; we got 41.9 miles per gallon on a 350-mile road trip that was two-thirds highway and one-third city.</p>, <p>The turbocharged Fiesta ST is indeed a fiesta when underway, with a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine making 197 horsepower and 214 impressive pound-feet of torque, in overboost mode. It only comes with a 6-speed manual transmission, along with tighter steering, suspension and brakes, with summer tires. A Fiesta ST can easily take on the Mini Cooper S, Hyundai Veloster Turbo, and Volkswagen GTI, three hot hatches. The little hotrod ST gets 29 Combined mpg.</p>, <p>Crash test scores are good with NHTSA and IIHS.</p>, <p>2018 may be the last model year for Fiesta.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Fiesta comes in S, SE, Titanium, and ST models.</p>, <p>The S sedan and hatchback are basic, with rollup windows and 15-inch steel wheels with hubcaps, but they do have air conditioning, Bluetooth, a 6-speaker sound system, adjustable steering wheel, and a rearview camera. A 5-speed manual transmission is standard, and the three-cylinder engine is optional.</p>, <p>The Fiesta SE hatch gets better fabric upholstery, plus power windows, cruise control, keyless ignition, ambient lighting and theft alarm.</p>, <p>Titanium adds leather, heated seats, automatic climate control, heated side mirrors, a Sony audio system, and Sync 3 infotainment system. It uses Ford’s PowerShift 6-speed twin-clutch automatic manual.</p>, <p>Fiesta ST features performance upgrades to the engine, suspension, steering and brakes, plus sport seats, black interior trim, aluminum pedals, black headlamp rims, tall spoiler, special bodywork, and 17-inch alloy wheels. Recaro seats are an option.</p>, <p>The Fiesta five-door hatchback has a crisp profile, with a wedge shape and arched roofline. The headlamps sweep back into the fenders, while a wide mouth with low fascia makes it look almost mean, for a subcompact.</p>, <p>The proportions aren’t the same with the sedan. It does not look crisp. Its long body and short greenhouse make it look tall and narrow from every angle.</p>, <p>The ST brings it all together, emphasizing the confident lines with an aggressive air dam and black mesh grille, along with a low stance on chunky wheels, and cross-patterned rear diffuser with twin exhaust tips.</p>, <p>The cabin hasn’t changed much over the eight years of this generation, and it shows. A lot of plastic, infotainment screen not integrated. Other subcompacts have found interior room in new designs, but the Fiesta still feels cramped and busy inside, with too many switches and knobs on the dash.</p>, <p>The soft-touch materials on the dash and doors, around the plastic, are fine. The Sync 3 system, with its 6.5-inch touchscreen, is a feature you might expect on a more expensive car. The cupholders are well placed, and there are plenty of small storage bins. The cabin is also fairly quiet for a subcompact, with a sound blanket under the hood to dampen the coarse-sounding engine, and a laminated windshield.</p>, <p>The ST goes the other way, with piped-in intake noise. In that car, we like it.</p>, <p>The driving position is excellent. The S model seats are flat and unsupportive, though we can’t think of any subcompact with good seats in their base model. The SE seats have better fabric and contours, but they still feel like bar stools. If you want to talk seats, jump to the optional Recaro seats on the ST, which are great, though, of course, they are costly.</p>, <p>In back, legroom and headroom are very tight; three adults don’t fit. And the 60/40 rear seats don’t fold flat.</p>, <p>There’s 26 cubic feet of cargo space. The Honda Fit has twice that.</p>, <p>The sedan has a good-sized trunk, with 12.8 cubic feet.</p>, <p>With the base engine and fine 5-speed gearbox, it takes some work to be happy with the performance; you have to keep the revs up because there isn’t a lot of torque. And its acceleration isn’t exactly quick, from zero to sixty in 10 seconds. Consolation is 36 highway miles per gallon.</p>, <p>Though updated, we found the 6-speed twin-clutch PowerShift transmission doesn’t downshift promptly or upshift smoothly in the lower gears. We preferred the manual gearbox.</p>, <p>The Fiesta is nimble and responsive. The electric power steering is just right, in its weight and feedback. Not unlike the original Mazda Miata, its steering and suspension make it feel hotter than it really is.</p>, <p>It’s secure on a smooth highway, but with a short wheelbase, the Fiesta tends to hop over rough pavement. And the nose dives under hard braking.</p>, <p>The three-cylinder turbo seems worth the $1000, considering it brings more torque and five more miles per gallon. The exhaust note has the howl of a three-cylinder engine. You have to shift a lot to run with the fast guys, but it’s fun.</p>, <p>Upping the fun ante is the ST, with its 197 turbocharged horsepower, 214 pound-feet of torque at a way low 1400 rpm, and 6-speed gearbox. Now lower and stiffen the suspension, quicken the steering ratio, and bolt on bigger brakes. Not done; there is electronic torque vectoring to minimize torque steer and rotate the front-wheel-drive car around corners. It’s a little gem.</p>, <p>The 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engine offers excellent value in a spirited high-mileage five-door hatchback. The ST offers fantastic value in a pocket rocket. But if you avoid the 6-speed twin-clutch automatic, you’re left with a standard shift. The interior is cramped, no matter what.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-c-max/
[<p>The Ford C-Max, introduced for the 2013 model year and now in its sixth season, comes in Hybrid and Energi plug-in hybrid forms. There is no regular gas-engine variant.</p>, <p>The tall, compact hatchback gave Ford a contender against the popular, fuel efficient Toyota Prius. It is now a dated product. Except for two new colors, nothing has changed for the 2018 model year. A rearview camera became standard equipment for 2017.</p>, <p>The Hybrid version uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine that works with a two-motor hybrid system, to generate 195 combined horsepower. In moderate low-speed driving, the 1.4-kWh lithium-ion battery lets the Hybrid travel about one mile on battery power alone.</p>, <p>The Energi version is a plug-in hybrid with a larger 7.6-kWh battery that provides an EPA-estimated electric-only range of about 20 miles, reaching as high as 62 mph. Several other plug-in hybrid models on the market have longer battery-only ranges.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55815" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-cmax-2.jpg" width="200"/>Both will keep going as long as gasoline is in the tank.</p>, <p>Spacious and comfortable, the C-Max Hybrid lags a bit in fuel-economy estimates when compared to its hybrid-powertrain rivals. Each version has front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>SE and Titanium trim levels are available in both Hybrid and Energi versions.</p>, <p>Bulging a bit here and there, the hatchback body sits atop a foundation adapted from the Ford Focus hatchback. C-Max is considerably taller than Focus, on the order of a small minivan. Small tall cars have been popular in Europe, where the C-Max originated, but it never caught on in the U.S.</p>, <p>Crash-test ratings have been just passable. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2018 C-Max four stars (out of five) overall, with four stars for the frontal crash and for roof strength, but five stars for side-impact protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2017 C-Max its top rating: Good in all tests except the difficult small-offset frontal crash, which yielded a second-best Acceptable score for the driver (no rating for the passenger).</p>, <p>Blind-spot monitoring is standard, but Ford offers no advanced safety features for the C-Max.</p>, <p>Ford C-Max Hybrid SE ($24,120) comes with keyless entry, Sync, cloth seating, a power driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, six-speaker audio, rearview camera, lighted glovebox, and back-seat heater vents. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $875 destination charge.) Titanium ($27,175) includes machined aluminum 17-inch wheels, Sync 3, pushbutton start, rain-sensing wipers, ambient lighting, leather-trimmed power-adjustable front seats with lumbar support, nine-speaker Sony audio, foglamps, and a reverse-sensing proximity-warning system.</p>, <p>C-Max Energi SE ($27,120) is equipped similar to Hybrid SE, but with plug-in hybrid powertrain and is available in Titanium ($30,129) trim.</p>, <p>Options include a foot-operated hands-free power tailgate, heated mirrors with turn indicators, Sync 3, navigation, and a Parking Technology package that can steer the C-Max into a parking space.</p>, <p>A thick and bulgy basic shape gives the tall-bodied C-Max an ungainly demeanor. Detail work amplifies the chunky, bottom-heavy effect, which leads some critics to brand the C-Max as dumpy.</p>, <p>Up front in the stubby nose, a traditional trapezoidal-shaped grille reinforces brand identity and kinship to other Ford vehicles. Relatively small wheels fit within big wheel arches, accented by creases. If anything, those wheels make the bodyside angles and accents, as well as the windows, look even more curious. At the rear is a comparatively vertical tailgate.</p>, <p>Spacious and flexible, the C-Max cabin seats four adults in comfort and feels like near-premium quality.</p>, <p>For a compact car, the tall body surrounds impressive cabin space. As measured by the federal government, interior volume falls just short of midsize classification. Not only is the cabin appealing, it’s quiet when rolling down the road. Plentiful sound insulation and active noise cancellation quash engine and road noises.</p>, <p>Luggage space at the rear is substantially less expansive, largely due to the position of the hybrid powertrain’s battery. Space is even more minimal in the Energi edition. Cargo volume of the C-Max Hybrid is 25 cubic feet with the rear seatback upright, or 52 cubic feet with the seat folded. In the Energi plug-in, volumes total 19.2 and 42.8 cubic feet, respectively. The rear seat folds and lowers by moving one lever.</p>, <p>In both versions, the cargo floor is notably higher than the tailgate opening. With the back seat folded, using the multi-level floor can be a challenge.</p>, <p>Elevated C-Max height makes it easy to enter and exit. Soft-touch materials complement appealing seat fabrics, conveying a traditional, high-quality effect. Moderate brightwork sets off the stylish dashboard.</p>, <p>Front seats are comfortable and suitably-bolstered. Leg space is abundant in both front and rear, but back seat bottoms are low. Standard upholstery is recycled synthetic cloth, but leather is available for upper-trim models.</p>, <p>Instruments and controls enhance the impression of premium quality. User-configurable screens can display preferred information. Sync 3 voice-control and infotainment with an 8.0-inch touchscreen is standard in Titanium trim, optional for SE.</p>, <p>Smooth and quiet on the road, the C-Max drives easily, delivering a well-composed and refined ride. Still, C-Max lacks the supple, tight feeling of the Focus hatchback that serves as its foundation.</p>, <p>Passengers will feel the suspension firmness on some flawed pavement surfaces. Precise steering provides good feel, making it easier to position the C-Max in its lane.</p>, <p>Although the C-Max is pleasant to drive, it’s relatively heavy, which translates to rather slow acceleration. Swift enough when starting off, acceleration weakens at higher speeds. Many hybrid rivals, even with less-powerful engines, deliver stronger performance.</p>, <p>Unlike some hybrids, the C-Max does an admirable job of blending regenerative and friction braking. An “L” mode raises the level of regenerative braking.</p>, <p>Fuel economy trails that of some hybrid competitors. The 2018 C-Max is EPA-rated at 42/38 mpg City/Highway, or 40 mpg Combined. That’s far below estimates for the current Prius. The C-Max Energi is EPA-rated at 39 mpg Combined. Eco displays can help drivers maximize fuel economy.</p>, <p>C-Max models are well-equipped, promising good value, especially when discounts are available to boost sales. Though beaten by various rivals, C-Max remains among the most fuel-efficient cars offered by Ford. It’s a dated product, however.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by the Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-gt-r/
[<p>The 2018 Nissan GT-R offers value in the world of supercars: You can now buy a GT-R for less than 100 grand. To be exact, $99,990. (That’s MSRP and doesn’t include the destination charge, but who’s counting?)</p>, <p>The 2018 GT-R Pure comes without the 11-speaker Bose sound system, Active Noise Cancellation and Active Sound Enhancement, and titanium exhaust system. You’ll still be getting Godzilla, as the GT-R is called. Maybe more so. Godzilla with noise cancellation? We don’t think so. The real Godzilla is Pure. Bring on the noise.</p>, <p>For 2018, Apple CarPlay is added to the NissanConnect infotainment system, and there’s a new interior package, black replacing white: in with Kuro Night, out with Ivory.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55806" height="144" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-track.jpg" width="200"/>The GT-R was revised for 2017, with 20 more horsepower, as if it needed it, along with refinement to the styling and cabin.</p>, <p>With its twin-turbo 3.8-liter V6 making 565 horsepower and 467 pound-feet of torque, the GT-R is one of the world’s fastest sports cars, with a time from zero to sixty in 2.7 seconds. Rivals that fear Godzilla include the Porsche 911 Turbo and various models from Mercedes-AMG and BMW M.</p>, <p>However, the Corvette Z06, another rival, is the real bargain in this group, a monster killer. Chevrolet will sell you 650 horsepower for just $80,000, wrapped in a package that’s more distinctively aggressive than the GT-R. But then you wouldn’t have a GT-R, you’d be just another guy with a Corvette.</p>, <p>The GT-R gets amazing grip from its advanced all-wheel-drive system, biased to the rear but able to send 50 percent of the torque to the front wheels. The ride is relatively smooth, thanks partly to special Bilstein DampTronic dampers. It uses a fast dual-clutch transmission. There are several driving modes, including R for Race. The electronic stability control has several levels, from conservative in the wet to full off, for the track.</p>, <p>Like the Porsche 911, the GT-R technically seats four people, although the two in the rear must be tiny to fit. If you need to seat four, there is the Maserati GranTurismo.</p>, <p>There are four models: GT-R Pure ($99,990), GT-R Premium ($110,490),  GT-R Track ($128,490), and GT-R Nismo ($175,490).</p>, <p>The new Pure isn’t bare bones. It comes with full power features, heated front seats, leather upholstery, navigation, Bluetooth audio streaming, and performance run-flat tires. The Premium adds the Bose audio, active noise cancellation, and titanium exhaust.</p>, <p>The Nismo has carbon-fiber trim and Recaro seats, and more horsepower: 600.</p>, <p>The Track is what it sounds like: legal for the street but set up for the track.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55808" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The GT-R only looks like a supercar at second or third glance. You can tell it’s special, but it doesn’t say Lamborghini. With its jagged and bulky luxury coupe outline, it could be mistaken for a kit car, with boisterous fender flares, deeply scooped air intakes, and a comically large rear wing. It all looks like anime armor, definitely including the roofline’s tomahawk slice that chops into the rear end.</p>, <p>Cars like the Porsche, Mercedes, and Ferrari or Lamborghini are unmistakable. The GT-R is overlookable. It looks best in dark graphite, a color that comes off subtle on the GT-R. A large Nissan V-Motion mesh grille has a matte finish. A chin spoiler and bumper add downforce, while the hood has pronounced character lines. The 20-inch wheels are a 15-spoke design.</p>, <p>The beltline is raised and rocker panels are bulged a bit for aerodynamics. The rear end has functional vents next to the quad exhaust outlets and under the bumper that provides good airflow at high speed. Nissan says the GT-R’s 0.26 coefficient of drag helps keep it stable at high speed.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55807" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cabin is refined to the level of an Infiniti. The instrument panel on the horizontal dashboard is wrapped in Nappa leather, with 11 buttons (until 2017 there was a bewildering 27 buttons). The center touchscreen is 8.0 inches, and there is a Display Command control for NissanConnect on the center console. In 2017 the paddle shifters were moved to the steering wheel from the steering column, so they can be used in the turns.</p>, <p>The seats have good comfort and support. There’s good room in front, while the rear seat is fine for two kids, limited for adults more by lack of headroom than legroom. There’s good trunk space. A rearview camera is standard, and necessary, as the thick rear pillars block the rearward visibility.</p>, <p>In 2017 the cabin was made much quieter, with more sound deadening material, an acoustic glass windshield, and the noise cancellation system that’s now only on the Premium model. Wind noise is present, but not too intrusive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55810" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-gtr-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>You can still hear the high-strung engine in the Premium, thanks to subtle rumble of the titanium exhaust. The twin turbos create a jet-like whine mixed with a low howl. The GT-R doesn’t have the refined scream of a Ferrari 458 Italia, or the deep burble of a Shelby GT500. It’s between these and quieter.</p>, <p>Speaking of jet-like, the GT-R is quicker than some supercars costing twice as much. Its top speed is 196 miles per hour. It’s so fast that the driving experience can feel like a video game, except bad things happen when you crash.</p>, <p>It’s a brilliant road car as well as an awesome track-day car. The firm ride can be programmed to be fairly forgiving, in Comfort mode, making it a nice highway cruiser.</p>, <p>The steering is relatively light at low speeds, quick but without the need to make small corrections at highway speeds. The paddle-shifting is sharp and crisp. The all-wheel drive varies torque from 100 percent to the rear to 50/50, depending on tire slip, steering angle, lateral acceleration, yaw rate, road surface, speed.</p>, <p>The GT-R has adjustable suspension, transmission, and stability-control settings to make it work as a commuter car. But in R for Race mode, it’s a life-changing experience. You push the GT-R into long corners at triple-digit speeds, and feel almost relaxed as it handles the curve without effort. When it’s time to slow down for a hairpin, the big Brembo brakes, six pistons in front and four in rear, do the job.</p>, <p>The traction control is easy to use. Set all three to Race, depress the brake pedal, floor the accelerator, and the engine hovers at 4500 rpm. Release the brake and the car launches with a slight squeal of the tires. Power is distributed to the tires with the best grip.</p>, <p>Pushed to its handling limits on a racetrack, the GT-R tends to understeer, a trait we noticed at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. With the throttle down, the rear can slide into power oversteer but it’s controllable. Cornering grip is outstanding.</p>, <p>The huge brakes feel firm as they slow the car at a mesmerizing rate, and we did not experience fade during repeated hard use.</p>, <p>In bang for the buck, only the Corvette ZO6 beats the GT-R. But we define bang narrowly, as in performance-only. The GT-R looks powerful, but the styling is not bang-inducing.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-370z/
[<p>The Nissan 370Z sports car is a 47-year-old icon that has re-invented itself a few times over the years, some times better than others. Given the pace its competitors move, it might be due for another such re-invention, but for 2018 brings just a couple of new touches: headlamps, wheels, and rear bumper.</p>, <p>For 2018, a 370Z Heritage Edition comes with yellow accents inside, and a choice of yellow or black outside. It’s a low-cost package, only as a base Coupe, without a touchscreen, rearview camera, or active noise cancellation.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55800" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-370z-convertible.jpg" width="200"/>The 370Z Roadster is probably the best top-down performer at its price point.</p>, <p>What the 370Z offers is uncommonly pure performance that’s affordable. It’s true to the spirit of the original 240Z. Its engine is mounted ahead of the driver but rearward to sharpen balance and handling via weight distribution.</p>, <p>Its rear-wheel drive is a kick in the pants. There’s a tight and fun 6-speed manual gearbox, or paddleshifting 7-speed automatic, both transmissions with rev-matched downshift blipping (except in the base coupe).</p>, <p>The engine is a strong V6 with its own deep heritage. This version is 3.7 liters and makes 332 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque. There’s also a higher-performance NISMO coupe version that makes 350 horsepower.</p>, <p>With the 7-speed automatic, the 370Z gets an EPA-estimated 21 miles per gallon Combined city and highway.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan 370Z Coupe ($29,990) comes standard with 6-speed manual gearbox, 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55799" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-370z-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Heritage Edition ($30,780) comes in black or yellow with yellow-accented interior.</p>, <p>Sport ($37,070) includes viscous limited-slip rear differential, sport brakes, 19-inch wheels, SynchroRev Match, Bose audio. Sport Tech gets navigation and rearview camera. Touring gets leather</p>, <p>370Z Roadster ($41,820) features power convertible top, and comes in Touring and Touring Sport versions.</p>, <p>NISMO ($45,690) features 350-hp engine and NISMO-tuned suspension.</p>, <p>Safety features include front and side airbags, anti-lock brakes and traction control, but not much else. There are also active head restraints and pre-tension seatbelts.</p>, <p>The coupe looks a bit dated but still racy. It’s for driving, not looking at. The Heritage Edition with stripes looks like it’s ready for a day at the race track. It looks muscular but not overstated, and, now, classic.</p>, <p>The roadster looks muscular with the power top down, while still looking sleek and sporty with the top up. The coupe, roadster and Nismo share lines. The Nismo has different trim, but it’s not like many sports cars, where the high-performance model gets wings and flares.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55801" height="170" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-370z-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The cabin is simple, functional, and pleasing, designed to be purposeful. The materials are premium, one step shy of luxury. The leathers, upholstery and switches feel durable and supple. But you won’t confuse the cabin for a Mercedes SL.</p>, <p>The four-way power seats are low and snug, with decent padding that’s comfortable for many body types. Still, the fairly stiff ride will get you. The seats are heated and cooled on upper models.</p>, <p>The power convertible top is quick to use, but it lets wind noise into the cabin when it’s up, and takes up trunk space (as they all do) when it’s down. It’s the nature of a soft top.</p>, <p>The standard wide tires are loud in the cabin. So is the engine, even with the noise-canceling system that’s standard on all models except base. Some engines we want to hear at full song, but the aging V6 in the 370Z is less mellifluous than it used to be.</p>, <p>Forward visibility is good but rearward three-quarters not so good, on account of thick pillars in the coupe and roadster. That worrisome blind spot, looking over your shoulder when pulling onto the highway at an angle, can’t be helped. However a rearview camera is standard on all models except base.</p>, <p>The 370Z offers excellent driving dynamics and mostly excellent but still very firm ride. It’s nimble as well as powerful, well done. However it has a slightly dull steering feel and there’s not much communication between road and wheel. It’s still rewarding and engaging to drive hard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55798" height="147" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-370z-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The 332-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 isn’t as refined as some rivals and doesn’t sound sweet at full song, but there are exhaust systems to improve that. It’s Nissan’s well-worn VQ engine series, more reliable than the previous 3.5-liter but also more mechanical sounding.</p>, <p>Both transmissions are slick and respectable. We like the 6-speed manual for its short, stiff throws between gears. It’s almost heroic. Rev-matching downshifting eliminates heel-and-toe, and unlike heel-and-toe gets the throttle blip right every time. The paddleshifting automatic also does the blip, and with an automatic it’s all good because it doesn’t take away anything, from the driver.</p>, <p>The NISMO is a fabulous turn-key track day car. One proof of the 370Z’s impeccable dynamics and engineering is how easily it takes to the track, and will run hard laps all day long, without being affected by understeer, oversteer, or fading brakes.</p>, <p>If you want your sports car to feel like one, you can’t miss with the 370Z. We vote for the great 6-speed manual transmission and the convertible, to keep it pure. The 3.7-liter is strong, with solid racing heritage; and an aftermarket exhaust system can make it sound sweet. The profile doesn’t turn heads, but if you know why you bought the car, you won’t care.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-frontier/
[<p>The Nissan Frontier compact pickup has been marketed since 2004 with few changes along the way. Little is new for the 2018 model year, except that the Frontier S base trim level adds air conditioning, cruise control, Bluetooth, and a rearview camera to its standard-equipment list. A new Midnight Edition option package for SV Crew Cab models spruces up the body with black wheels and trim.</p>, <p>Frontier pickups come in five trim levels: base S, SV, Desert Runner, SL, and PRO-4X. Either an overburdened 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or a robust 4.0-liter V6 may be installed, but the V6 is a lot more popular. The four-cylinder makes 152 horsepower and 171 pound-feet of torque, while the V6 whips up 261 horsepower and 281 pound-feet.</p>, <p>Offered only in King Cab configuration, the four-cylinder engine can mate with a 5-speed manual gearbox or a more costly 5-speed automatic transmission. With V6 power, the manual choice is a 6-speed. Rear-drive is standard, with four-wheel drive an extra-cost alternative.</p>, <p>Extended-cab (called King Cab) Frontiers have a 73.3-inch cargo bed, rear-hinged half doors that open after the front doors, and jump seats in back. Crew Cab models get four conventional doors, a regular rear bench, and either a short (59.5-inch) bed or the longer (73.3-inch) version.</p>, <p>Two models focus on off-road capability. Equipped with rear-wheel-drive, the Desert Runner has a raised suspension with Bilstein shock absorbers and oversize all-terrain tires. The four-wheel-drive PRO-4X includes a transfer case and electric locking rear differential.</p>, <p>Modern active-safety features, such as automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring, are absent from any Frontier. Crash-testing of the 2018 Frontier by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety resulted in mixed ratings. Both body configurations scored Marginal on the small-overlap frontal-crash test for the driver’s side, but moderate-overlap and side-impact scores were Good. Head restraints were deemed Acceptable, but headlights Poor.</p>, <p>Testing the 2018 Crew Cab model, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave a disturbing three-star rating (out of five) for the frontal crash-test. No side-impact testing has been performed. Rollover resistance (a calculated figure) is only three-star for rear-drive models, but four stars with four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Frontier S King Cab ($18,990) comes with manual or automatic ($22,660), extended-cab body, four-cylinder engine, rear-wheel drive, rear jump seats, manual windows and locks, air conditioning, rearview camera, Bluetooth, and 15-inch steel wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $975 destination charge.) Frontier SV King Cab ($23,460) comes with manual or automatic ($24,510), four-cylinder engine, power windows, locks, and mirrors, plus tinted windows and 16-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Frontier SV King Cab V6 automatic ($25,220) includes the V6 engine and 5-speed automatic. Frontier SV King Cab 4×4 automatic ($28,110) gets the V6 and four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Crew Cab versions are available with four conventional doors and rear bench, plus V6 engine in Frontier S Crew Cab manual ($24,550), S Crew Cab 4×4 Automatic ($29,900), SV Crew Cab Automatic ($26,350), SV Crew Cab 4×4 manual ($32,380) and automatic ($29,540). Frontier SV Crew Cab Long Bed automatic ($28,960) gets a long cargo bed and V6 as does the SV Crew Cab Long Bed 4×4 automatic ($29,960). Frontier SL Crew Cab automatic ($33,560) has V6, power front seats, leather upholstery, heated seats, navigation, and 5.8-inch touchscreen audio with navigation. Also available: SL Crew Cab 4×4 automatic ($36,400); SL Crew Cab Long Bed 4×4 automatic ($36,800).</p>, <p>Desert Runner King Cab automatic ($25,900) includes the V6, rear-wheel drive, raised suspension, Bilstein shocks, and 16-inch tires. Desert Runner Crew Cab Automatic ($27,330) is similar to Desert Runner King Cab but with four conventional doors, V6, and rear-drive.</p>, <p>PRO-4X King Cab 4×4 Automatic ($33,030) comes with V6 engine, four-wheel drive, transfer case, and locking rear differential. PRO-4X Crew Cab 4×4 is available with manual ($32,740) or automatic ($33,790) with four conventional doors, V6 engine, and four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>While hardly beautiful, the Frontier feels familiar, with chunky looks that have aged reasonably well. Lower-level trims are loaded with chrome. Wheel flares help give the Frontier a suitably masculine tone. The bumper curves inward for best approach angles.</p>, <p>PRO-4X and Desert Runner versions cut back on chrome. A roof rack can enhance utility, but looks like an afterthought and increases wind noise. The new Midnight Edition package for SV adds black exterior accents and black 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55793" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-frontier-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Blocky in form, if functional, the Frontier’s dashboard comes across as seriously dated, with awkward angles and strange ergonomics. Dominated by plastic, the interior conveys a sense of cheapness. Graining of trim materials is inconsistent.</p>, <p>Though the control layout seems simple, its appearance isn’t compelling. Audio controls sit high. Even the optional Rockford Fosgate stereo system gets a relatively small (5.8-inch) touchscreen. Infotainment components are behind the times, with small displays and lack of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.</p>, <p>Front seats rank around average. In S/SV trim, they’re thickly padded but lack full adjustment. Upper versions add a height-adjustable driver’s seat. Fine for urban duty, the seats feel short on support for longer journeys, though visibility is good.</p>, <p>Humans aren’t likely to appreciate being sent to the shrunken rear jump seats in King Cab models. Crew Cabs not only have four proper doors, but sufficient space for four adults (five if necessary). Backrests are defiantly upright, with skimpy padding.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55794" height="148" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-frontier-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Don’t expect refinement in a Frontier, which performs eagerly but grumbles along the way. Even the strong V6 engine is unpolished, growling while accelerating and vibrating at idle speed, though it delivers brisk acceleration. The four-cylinder is loud and may easily be overwhelmed by this pickup’s two-ton weight.</p>, <p>Manual gearboxes work well despite long throws of the shift lever. Clutch feel is satisfying for a pickup. Nissan’s 5-speed automatic transmission produces firm, wholly predictable shifts and seldom is stymied by searching for the next gear. While it can be difficult to maintain momentum in an automatic-equipped Frontier, the V6 engine provides impressive passing power.</p>, <p>Even by pickup-truck standards, the ride tends to be rocky and busy, yielding considerable body motion. The relatively short wheelbase translates to an often-choppy ride.</p>, <p>No Frontier copes well with being pushed hard on curvy roads, though body lean is well-controlled. While firm steering feel and nimble handling are most welcome, constant corrections are often needed during highway driving.</p>, <p>Ground clearance close to nine inches helps make the Frontier a competent off-pavement explorer. PRO-4X models are especially capable off-road.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is relatively poor. The four-cylinder, manual-shift model with rear-wheel-drive is EPA-rated at 19/23 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined – comparable to some full-size V8 pickups. Automatic drops those estimates to 17/22/19 mpg.</p>, <p>With V6 power, rear-drive, and 6-speed manual, the Frontier is EPA-rated at 16/22 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. Automatic raises the highway figure to 23 mpg. Four-wheel-drive manual is EPA-rated at 16/21 mpg City/Highway, or 18 mpg Combined. Automatic manages only 15/21/17 mpg.</p>, <p>The Nissan Frontier is a dated product that has fallen behind other models. It competes largely on price and the deal. Engines and cabins are unrefined. Base-model equipment is sparse, infotainment systems fall short, and safety features are lacking. It offers value as a simple, basic truck.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M.

[<p>Nissan Armada, redesigned for 2017, is a full-size, family-focused three-row SUV that offers plenty of interior space. Upper models are near-luxury SUVs.</p>, <p>A new top-end Platinum Reserve trim level joins the eight-passenger flagship SUV’s lineup for the 2018 model year. Otherwise, changes are modest. NissanConnect services are newly standard, along with an 8-inch touchscreen, HD radio, and SiriusXM Travel Link. 2018 Armada Platinum Reserve trim includes an intelligent rearview mirror that displays a video view of the road behind.</p>, <p>Four trim levels are offered: SV, SL, Platinum, and new Platinum Reserve. Each is powered by a 5.6-liter V8 that generates 390 horsepower and 394 pound-feet of torque, driving a 7-speed automatic transmission. Offered with either rear- or four-wheel drive, Armadas feature standard separate body/frame construction.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55784" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-final.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-final.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-final-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>When properly equipped, an Armada is rated to tow up to 8,500 pounds.</p>, <p>A spacious interior promises comfort that suggests a luxury brand, with an upscale feel both inside and out. Every Armada is well-equipped, but SV trim stands out for high value, priced well below such rivals as the Chevrolet Tahoe and Ford Expedition.</p>, <p>High-tech safety features as automatic emergency braking are either standard or optional for all but the SV trim level. Armada Platinum comes with blind-spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, and active lane control, all optional on Armada SL.</p>, <p>A rearview camera comes standard, but new Platinum Reserve trim includes a camera at the rear that can send live video to an LCD display built into the outside mirror. This real-time rearview mirror presents an unimpeded view, eliminating visual obstructions caused by roof pillars, headrests, or passenger heads. On all Armadas, six airbags include curtain-type units that extend to the third row.</p>, <p>An optional Driver Package for SV trim includes foglamps, a power-folding third row, and power liftgate. The SL Premium Package brings a power moonroof, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitoring. Nissan’s infotainment system features a large screen, but its basic design is outmoded.</p>, <p>Armada SV ($46,090) has rear-wheel drive and includes eight-passenger seating, a rearview camera, power front seats, cloth upholstery, LED headlights, front/rear parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, an 8.0-inch screen with navigation, and 18-inch wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,295 destination charge.) Armada SV 4×4 ($48,990) includes all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Armada SL ($50,850) adds leather upholstery, foglamps, a surround-view monitor, power liftgate, power-folding third-row seats, driver-seat memory, 20-inch wheels, and a power-adjustable steering column. Armada SL 4×4 ($53,750) comes with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Armada Platinum ($59,190) and Platinum 4×4 ($62,090) include Premium Package equipment plus active lane control, a video-based rearview mirror, and cooled front seats. Second-row captain’s chairs are optional, for seven-passenger capacity.</p>, <p>Platinum Reserve ($62,190) and Platinum Reserve 4×4 ($65,090) feature special dark chrome exterior trim and 20-inch wheels, two-tone leather-appointed seats, and premium woodtone trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55788" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Few people would call the big, bulbous Armada pretty. More often, they’d be likely to take notice of its inevitably voluptuous, but awkward, exterior shape. Essentially, Nissan’s Armada looks much like the related Infiniti QX80, but decorated by a little less chrome and equipped with contrasting-color fender flares.</p>, <p>Rather than simply dive into the traditional two-box SUV profile, Nissan went for curves. To some eyes, they may have gone too far in that direction. At the rear, clear taillights and a protruding back bumper help differentiate the Armada from the related Infiniti QX80.</p>, <p>Just about as curvaceous within the cabin as outside, the Armada promises abundant space in both the first and second rows. Front seats are abundantly padded for long-distance comfort, offering a broad range of adjustments.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55786" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The third row isn’t quite so welcoming, thus best for youngsters. Though fairly spacious once there, reaching the third row is somewhat challenging.</p>, <p>Eight-passenger seating is standard, with a three-position bench in the second row. Individual captain’s chairs are available for Platinum versions, reducing passenger capacity to seven.</p>, <p>Even in the base SV edition, with its cloth upholstery, the interior is sufficiently upscale and attractive. Wood trim is simulated, but convincing, complementing soft-touch surfaces.</p>, <p>New Platinum Reserve trim substitutes two-tone leather that’s almost tacky in nature, though the darker chrome on the body is an improvement. All told, the new version comes across as more gaudy than suave.</p>, <p>Although the curved dashboard seems to steal some passenger space, front occupants can expect ample stretch-out room. Numerous controls could be confusing at first.</p>, <p>Cargo space excels, with 16.5 cubic feet behind the third row. Folding that row expands volume close to 50 cubic feet. With two rows folded, an Armada can hold 95.4 cubic feet of luggage and cargo.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55785" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-armada-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Approaching 6,000 pounds, especially with four-wheel drive, the Armada is indisputably a heavyweight. Though it copes well enough through curvy stretches, and the body leans during quick corners, an Armada never feels unsafe.</p>, <p>Next to carlike crossover models, handling can only be called cumbersome and sluggish. Although the leather-wrapped steering wheel feels good, Armadas, not surprisingly, are short on road feel.</p>, <p>Ride comfort exceeds expectations for a massive body-on-frame vehicle, thanks to its fully independent coil-spring suspension. The SV base model with 18-inch tires yields the most satisfying luxury-level ride. Upper trim levels with 20-inch tires ride a tad firmer, but the difference isn’t bothersome.</p>, <p>Nissan’s big, strong V8 yields energetic acceleration, augmented by confident towing prowess, but an Armada inevitably guzzles gasoline. Considering its weight, acceleration to 60 mph in less than seven seconds is mighty quick. Smooth-running at idle speed, the V8 emits a subdued growl as it gets rolling.</p>, <p>Four-wheel drive is optional for all versions, permitting off-road treks. Naturally, the excessive dimensions of Nissan’s flagship make it usable mainly on wide trails.</p>, <p>It takes some fuel to power an Armada. Rear-wheel-drive models are EPA-rated at only 14/19 mpg City/Highway, or 16 mpg Combined. Four-wheel drive sinks those estimates to 13/18/15 mpg. At least, it runs on Regular-grade gasoline.</p>, <p>Providing fairly good value despite hefty prices, the Armada comes across as a luxury SUV. Not only will it hold a large family in comfort, it can tow a camper or boat with ease. Demerits include an unbridled appetite for fuel and a largely unrewarding driving experience.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-maxima/
[<p>The Nissan Maxima sedan boasts a daring design, a strong V6 engine, taut driving feel, and comfortable cabin.</p>, <p>Fully redesigned for the 2016 model year, Maxima hasn’t changed much for 2018. In addition to wearing a fresh black-accented V-Motion grille, the 2018 Maxima adds Android Auto to its Apple CarPlay-enabled infotainment system.</p>, <p>Nissan offers five ascending Maxima trim levels: S, SV, SL, SR, and Platinum. Each holds the same front-wheel-drive powertrain. A 3.5-liter V6, developing 300 horsepower and 261 pound-feet of torque, mates with Nissan’s continuously variable transmission (CVT). Even though the CVT contains no actual gears, D-Step shift logic can simulate gearchanges.</p>, <p>Maxima is full-size in outside dimensions but feels closer to midsize inside. Sportier than large four-doors, it isn’t as space-efficient. Even Nissan’s smaller, midsize Altima is roomier. Beneath its swoopy bodywork, the Maxima shares some vehicular architecture with the Altima. In the Maxima, outboard passengers can enjoy deep, thickly padded bucket seats, but fall a bit short on expected space.</p>, <p>The Maxima is more enjoyable to drive than many full-size four-door sedans, and it has a sportier character.</p>, <p>An optional Midnight Edition package gives the SR sedan blacked-out trim, plus surround-view cameras and driver-alert warning.</p>, <p>In addition to being available with a broad range of safety technology, Maximas have earned laudable crash-test scores. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2018 Maxima a rating of five stars overall, as well as for both frontal and side impacts. The calculated rollover score also was five-star.</p>, <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the Maxima a Top Safety Pick, but only with the LED headlights fitted to SR and Platinum trim levels. Halogen headlights on other versions are rated Poor. All crash-test scores rated Good, with Superior frontal crash prevention.</p>, <p>All Maximas have a rearview camera, as well as forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking. Standard on higher trim levels are blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>Nissan Maxima S ($33,270) comes with power front seats, cloth upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, a rearview camera, remote start, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and 18-inch wheels. Infotainment includes an 8.0-inch screen with navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $885 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Maxima SV ($35,270) features leather-appointed seat upholstery, heated front seats, a driver-seat thigh extension, and front/rear parking sensors. Maxima SL ($37,690) adds a panoramic moonroof, active noise cancellation, 11-speaker Bose audio, LED interior lighting, blind-spot warning, adaptive cruise control, and extra USB ports.</p>, <p>Maxima Platinum ($40,940) comes with quilted leather seat inserts, a surround-view camera system, power rear sunshade, height-adjustable passenger seat, ventilated front seats and LED headlights.</p>, <p>Maxima SR ($38,530) has a sport-tuned suspension and 19-inch wheels, but lacks the panoramic moonroof. Premium leather seats with Alcantara inserts, LED headlights, and ventilated front seats are standard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55779" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-maxima-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Styling might not please everyone. More than most, though, Nissan’s Maxima stands out from the big-sedan pack. Daring and dramatic, if not wholly cohesive, the biggest Nissan four-door lacks the cleanly finished look of a Chevrolet Impala, but resembles no other full-size sedan. No design elements are shared with the mechanically-related Nissan Altima.</p>, <p>The freshly-revised grille does present a cleaner appearance. Viewed from the front, the roof appears to float above the vehicle, helped by black pillars. A fine chrome line runs just below the windows, striving to conceal the Maxima’s girth. On the whole, the Maxima favors voluptuous curves over a svelte tone. SR sedans flaunt more prominent sporty touches, including a rear spoiler.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55777" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-maxima-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Top models are luxurious.Front occupants can savor comfortably supportive seats and a lavish aura.</p>, <p>The Maxima seats four and is even better for two. It has a low roofline that makes the rear bench feel tight. Taller riders may find the roofline impedes entry and exit. The two outboard rear passengers drop into wide, bucket-like seats. A center position is provided, but it’s not intended to be used often and it’s not comfortable. Rear passengers in the Nissan Altima have more space.</p>, <p>Fitted with an 8.0-inch infotainment screen, the dashboard cants assertively toward the driver. The tall center console constricts knee space more than in most large sedans.</p>, <p>Interior materials rank above average in cloth-upholstered base models, becoming nearly decadent in top-dog Platinum trim. Soft-touch materials abound, complemented by classy upholstery stitching. Even the metallic and simulated-wood trim panels look stylishly contemporary.</p>, <p>Trunk volume is a moderate 14.3 cubic feet, versus 15.4 for the Altima.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55780" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-maxima-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Despite having 300 horsepower beneath its hood, a Maxima isn’t likely to deliver many driving thrills to enthusiasts. The V6/CVT combination doesn’t constitute the most refined powertrain, either.</p>, <p>For most drivers, though, the Maxima accelerates with suitable swiftness, while emitting more gruffness than expected. Pushing harder than usual on the gas pedal may be needed when accelerating, but the specially-tuned transmission yields a more spirited experience than most CVTs can deliver. Sport mode helps, and when D-Step logic is selected, the preset ratios arrive in a delectably smooth sequence.</p>, <p>Helped by surprisingly high-effort steering, a Maxima feels markedly more nimble than typical rivals like Toyota’s Avalon. Certainly, its sense of sportiness transcends that of most big sedans. Even when breezing along curvy roads, Nissan’s top sedan feels composed and confident. Wandering on straightaways seldom occurs, courtesy of great on-center tracking capability.</p>, <p>Moderate torque steer might be felt, but only when accelerating hard. Electric power steering delivers almost no feedback to the driver, but the thick-rimmed, flat-bottom steering wheel is an unexpected delight.</p>, <p>Still, ride comfort is this sedan’s main attraction. With standard 18-inch wheels, smoothness approaches luxury level. Even in SR trim with 19-inch tires and stiffer shock absorbers, the ride doesn’t become excessively firm.</p>, <p>Engine noise is reasonably muffled, but other sounds entering the cabin seem inappropriate for a car in this price league.</p>, <p>Thriftier than many full-size sedans, the Maxima is EPA-rated at 21/30 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. Premium gasoline is needed.</p>, <p>Regardless of trim levels, the Maxima delivers an upscale feel. In both layout and materials quality, but not in back-seat space, Nissan’s full-size sedan ranks above the midsize Altima. As far as design goes, not many large four-doors can be called daring or dramatic. Altogether, Maxima promises good value for its price.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M.

[<p>The Nissan Altima rides smoothly while offering frugal fuel economy. Nissan’s midsize family sedan was last redesigned as a 2013 model. Though handsomely sculpted for its fifth generation, the sedan looks more conventional today than it did five seasons ago.</p>, <p>Safety technology for the 2018 Nissan Altima includes automatic emergency braking and forward-collision warning. The Altima 3.5 SL gains adaptive cruise control and upgraded NissanConnect with navigation, plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>A new Midnight Edition package for the Altima 2.5 SR features blacked-out body accents and 18-inch wheels. Navigation and heated front seats are included.</p>, <p>Five versions of the 2018 Altima are available: 2.5 S, 2.5 SR, 2.5 SV, 2.5 SL, and 3.5 SL. The 2.5 prefix indicates a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that develops 179 horsepower. Only the 3.5 SL holds a V6: a 3.5-liter engine that generates 270 horsepower and 251 pound-feet of torque. Every Altima comes with Nissan’s continuously variable transmission (CVT) and has front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>During its history, the Altima grew from a compact car to a sporty midsize family sedan. At the same time, its performance potential shrunk somewhat. Nowadays, the Altima is a plush-riding, sensibly roomy four-door with a pair of powertrains that don’t stand apart from the midsize pack.</p>, <p>Handling talents don’t stand out from the competition, ride being emphasized. Yet, the Altima ranks among the top-selling family sedans on today’s market. Of course, crossover models, including Nissan’s own Rogue, sell even better.</p>, <p>Interior space is a strong point in the five-passenger Altima, which promises comfortable seating and appropriate cabin trim. Today’s Altima is quieter than some of its predecessors, too. Except for the four-cylinder SR sedan, which boasts some sportier styling touches, appearance differences between trim levels are slight.</p>, <p>Nissan’s Altima ranks near the top in family-sedan safety, thanks to newly standard safety technology and excellent crash-test scores. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rates the 2018 Altima at five stars overall, as well as for frontal and side-impact crashes. Rollover resistance is calculated at four stars.</p>, <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has awarded Altima a Top Safety Pick designation, with Good crash-test scores (including the small-overlap crash) and Superior frontal crash prevention.</p>, <p>Every Altima now has forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, along with a rearview camera. Blind-spot monitoring is optional. Adaptive cruise control is standard on SL sedans, but otherwise unavailable.</p>, <p>Altima 2.5 S ($23,260) has a four-cylinder engine, CVT, power windows and locks, power mirrors; steering-wheel audio controls, rearview camera, 5.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth with audio streaming, keyless entry, and 16-inch wheels. Altima 2.5 SV ($25,910) gets alloy wheels, a power driver’s seat, blind-spot monitoring, and remote start. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $885 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Altima 2.5 SL ($29,110) adds leather upholstery, a power passenger seat, Bose speakers, adaptive cruise control, navigation, and 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Altima 2.5 SR ($24,320) comes with sport suspension tuning, a power driver seat, extra styling details, and 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Altima 3.5 SL ($33,630) substitutes a 3.5-liter V6 engine.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55773" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-altima-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Inevitably, a design that was initially seen as daring begins to fade into the background. When the newly redesigned Altima first appeared as a 2013 model, it struck quite a handsome figure. Today, Nissan’s midsize entrant almost starts to look bland.</p>, <p>While still attractive, the 2018 Altima simply blends more readily into its category, rather than clawing for visual attention. Front fenders remain shapely, flanking a relatively wide V-shaped grille, above a low bumper. Comparisons with the recently redesigned Maxima, which shares running gear, place Nissan’s midsize model at a disadvantage.</p>, <p>At least, the sportier-looking SR edition incorporates a bit of flash, in the form of distinctive wheels and smoked headlight covers.</p>, <p>With its subdued trim and traditional layout, the Altima’s cabin looks as if it wouldn’t be out of place in a mid-1990s model. Designers exercised restraint, keeping the interior conventional while competitors turned adventurous.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55771" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-altima-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-altima-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-altima-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Not that the Altima cabin is the most spartan of the lot, though little evidence of the Nissan brand stands out. Dashboard panels are well-shaped and nicely textured, symmetric in appearance, with soft metallic trim framing major control groups.</p>, <p>Display screens are on the small side, and the dashboard tends to intrude on knee space. Base models look inexpensive, though fit/finish is satisfying.</p>, <p>Four adults can ride in comfort, but a fifth might feel constricted on a longer journey. Thick seat cushions are more comfortable than in a Ford Fusion. In the back seat, tall passengers might note that the roofline cuts slightly into headroom. Space beneath the front seats isn’t quite sufficient for rear riders’ feet, though knee room is average on the cozy back bench.</p>, <p>Trunk space is on par for the class, at 15.4 cubic feet, but hinges are exposed.</p>, <p>Nothing about the Altima aims toward enthusiast. This sedan is strictly mainstream.</p>, <p>Nissan’s continuously variable transmission (CVT) has long been recognized as one of the better examples. Abundantly reworked not long ago, it improved dramatically, now operating with admirable smoothness, almost like a regular 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>A series of pre-programmed ratios in the gearless belt/pulley transmission extracts ample vitality from the four-cylinder engine. Droning at midrange engine speeds, typical of earlier CVTs, is substantially reduced.</p>, <p>Though wholly sufficient, the four-cylinder engine ranks no higher than adequate in acceleration, but strikingly high in fuel economy. Most 2018 Altimas with the 2.5-liter engine are EPA-rated at 27/38 mpg City/Highway, or 31 mpg Combined. With its bigger tires, the SR sedan is rated 1 mpg less in each category.</p>, <p>Nissan is among the dwindling group of automakers to continue offering a V6 alternative rather than a turbo four. For performance, at a higher cost, the 3.5-liter V6 is clearly the way to go, though it’s a bit gruff at lower engine speeds and loud when approaching the tachometer’s redline. The V6 Altima is EPA-rated at 22/32 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Handling isn’t quite as briskly confident as in previous Altimas – predictable, but lagging in steering responses. Relaxed-rate springs and Sachs shock absorbers contribute to a plush ride. SR editions get stiffer anti-sway bars and distinct shock tuning, for greater firmness without a punishing ride.</p>, <p>Brakes provide good pedal feel, but noise and vibration control could be better.</p>, <p>Despite a few issues and a design that no longer clamors for attention, the well-equipped Altima is still a respectable, value-laden four-door. Four-cylinder gas mileage and impressive safety add to its appeal. Even though it’s not truly sporty, the SR sedan, fitted with few options, is a tempting choice.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-sentra/
[<p>The Nissan Sentra compact sedan is admirably roomy for four and gets good fuel efficiency. Conservatively upright in profile and traditional in style, the 2018 Sentra is largely unchanged over last year.</p>, <p>Automatic emergency braking is available for the 2018 model year; only models with manual shift, and the NISMO editions, do without the new system.</p>, <p>A rearview camera and 5.0-inch display screen, with Bluetooth streaming audio, come standard on all 2018 models. 2018 Sentra SV sedans get 16-inch alloy wheels and dual-zone automatic temperature control. Adaptive cruise control is standard on 2018 Sentra SR 1.8L and SL trim levels. 2018 Sentra SL sedans include a moonroof and Bose audio. A new Midnight Edition package is available for S and SR trim levels, featuring blacked-out body accents and 17-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55764" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sentra-2.jpg" width="200"/>Last redesigned for 2013, the Sentra was mildly facelifted three years later.</p>, <p>Six trim levels are offered: S, SV, SR, SL, SR Turbo, and NISMO. Most 2018 Sentras get a 1.8-liter four-cylinder, rated at 124 horsepower and 125 pound-feet of torque. A 6-speed manual gearbox is standard on the S model, but others come only with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that contains no gears but behaves like an automatic. With manual shift, the base engine produces 130 horsepower.</p>, <p>In SR Turbo and NISMO models, a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, borrowed from Nissan’s Juke, makes 188 horsepower and 177 pound-feet. A 6-speed manual gearbox is standard for the SR Turbo, but its optional CVT includes stepped, simulated gears.</p>, <p>Newly standard automatic emergency braking on most models helps elevate the Sentra against such rivals as the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, but safety scores could be better. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Sentra Good crash-test ratings, but the small-overlap test for the passenger side was not rated. Headlights are deemed Poor, though the 2017 Sentra was named a Top Safety Pick.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the regular-engine 2018 Sentra a four-star score overall, and for frontal impact. Non-turbo models earned a five-star rating for side impact.</p>, <p>Blind-spot monitoring is available on SR versions, and standard on the SL.</p>, <p>Sentra S ($16,990) has the 1.8-liter engine, cloth upholstery, a 5.0-inch display, Bluetooth, four-speaker audio, automatic headlights, a rearview camera, and 16-inch wheels with covers. It’s available with the CVT ($18,140). (Prices are MSRP and do not include $885 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Sentra SV ($18,960) gets the CVT, plus a leather-wrapped steering wheel, upgraded cloth upholstery, six-speaker audio, keyless ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, and 16-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Sentra SR ($20,370) adds sport cloth seats, LED headlights, foglamps, adaptive cruise control, sporty interior accents, and 17-inch wheels. It comes with the 1.8-liter engine and CVT.</p>, <p>Sentra SL ($23,440) has the CVT, along with leather upholstery, a moonroof, Bose audio, 5.8-inch touchscreen, Nissan telematics, blind-spot monitoring, and unique 17-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Sentra SR Turbo substitutes a more powerful 1.6-turbocharged engine and comes with CVT ($22,490).</p>, <p>NISMO ($25,790) comes with a turbocharged engine, 18-inch wheels, sporty details inside and outside, and deeper front bucket seats. It’s available with manual or CVT.</p>, <p>Compared to other Nissan models, the compact Sentra looks welcoming. Next to competitors from other automakers, it’s less appealing. With its relatively tall, almost boxy profile, the Sentra lags behind modern rivals from the likes of Honda and Mazda.</p>, <p>Sentra sheetmetal shows a clear kinship to the bigger Altima, include rather deep creases and a body line that stretches from nose to tail. Turbocharged Sentras feature a number of visual extras, including LED daytime running lights, side sills, and a spoiler.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55767" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sentra-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Not unlike its body, the Sentra’s interior comes across as upright and utilitarian, built on a budget-focused foundation. What Nissan’s compact offers, beyond its competitors, is greater cabin space, especially in the back.</p>, <p>Front-seat occupants sit higher than is typical in the compact category, which is a bonus for outward visibility. The tall roofline provides good headroom in front and rear, even with a moonroof. Leather upholstery isn’t the best choice in upper trim levels, because the material is thin.</p>, <p>Rear-seat passengers get 37.4 inches of legroom and a generous 50.9 inches of hip space. Both figures beat those of most rivals. Wide-opening rear doors make it easy to enter and exit. Either two adults or three teenagers can feel comfortable, stretching out a bit in back.</p>, <p>The gently-curved dashboard flows across the front compartment in a two-tier layout. Tapering at the sides makes maximum use of the available space.</p>, <p>The sizable trunk holds 15.1 cubic feet of luggage. Loading is eased by a wide opening.</p>, <p>Sentras are quiet at highway cruising speeds, thanks largely to acoustic glass. When accelerating strongly, however, some unwanted noise oozes into the cabin.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55765" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sentra-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sentra-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sentra-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Sentras handle better than some might expect. The 1.8-liter models with the base suspension have relatively stiff springs, ensuring more controlled body motions. In SR Turbo and NISMO editions, springs are stiffer yet, while remapped steering promises a greater sense of heft.</p>, <p>Whether it has base 16-inch tires or upgraded 17-inch rubber, a Sentra rides fairly softly, without excessive body roll. Rear drum brakes on S and SV versions feel confident, but permit perceptible nosedive.</p>, <p>While undeniably competent in daily commuter-style driving, performance of regular-engine Sentras is on the leisurely side. Even in SR Turbo and NISMO form, the Sentra appears to embrace comfort over vigorous acceleration. They’re more gratifying than non-turbo models, to be sure; but the performance boost isn’t dramatic, considering the difference in horsepower.</p>, <p>Base Sentras come with a 6-speed manual gearbox, which feels too loose to make it fun to manipulate. Nissan’s CVT is more satisfying, though highway passing and steep climbs in mountainous terrain may demand some planning and patience.</p>, <p>Non-turbo Sentras score well in fuel economy, though some competitors are even more thrifty. With the 1.8-liter engine and CVT, the 2018 Altima is EPA-rated at 29/37 mpg City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined. Manual shift drops those figures by 2 mpg in each category.</p>, <p>Sentra SR Turbos with CVT are EPA-rated at 27/33 mpg City/Highway, or 29 mpg Combined. Turbos with manual lose 1 mpg on each estimate. NISMO models are rated 25/30/27 mpg with CVT; but the highway figure rises by 1 mpg with a 6-speed manual gearbox. Turbos require premium gasoline.</p>, <p>All told, the compact Sentra performs as promised. Roomy and quiet, it’s a relatively affordable choice. Average in capability, it’s the type of car driven by millions each day. Best values are the lower-cost versions. Even the base Sentra is comparatively well-equipped for its price.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-versa/
[<p>The Nissan Versa offers affordable, basic transportation in sedan and Versa Note five-door hatchback body styles. Surprisingly spacious in the back seat, especially in Versa Note hatchback form, the subcompact Versa received a modest freshening for 2015.</p>, <p>Little has changed for the 2018 model year, including the Versa’s price structure. Versa sedans gain standard adjustable front headrests, map lights, and variable wipers. A Special Edition package, added during 2017, is the sole option.</p>, <p>Sedans come in S, S Plus, and SV trim levels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55758" height="167" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-versa-note.jpg" width="200"/>Versa Note hatchbacks are offered in S, SV, and SR guise. In SR trim, the Versa Note hatchback now includes pushbutton start, an immobilizer, and Easy Fill Tire Alert.</p>, <p>Each version contains a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 109 horsepower. We found that performance is not swift.</p>, <p>Versa S sedans come with 5-speed manual gearbox or continuously variable transmission (CVT). One of the lowest-priced cars on the market, the Versa S sedan also ranks among the most modestly equipped.</p>, <p>S Plus trim replaces the manual gearbox with Nissan’s CVT, which improves gas mileage considerably. The SV sedan adds such features as power windows/locks and a split-folding rear seat. An SV Special Edition package adds popular items, such as a 5.0-inch touchscreen, rearview camera, and alloy wheels.</p>, <p>All Versa Note hatchbacks get the CVT. Versa SR, the sportier top model, adds enhanced body details, a spoiler, and suede-like seat upholstery.</p>, <p>Neither federal regulators nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has put a Versa sedan or Note hatchback through a complete testing procedure. The IIHS gave the 2018 sedan Good scores in most tests, except for the small-overlap crash. That one earned a Poor rating for the driver, and no score for the front passenger. The Versa Note was tested only for moderate overlap, earning a Good rating.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2017 sedan a four-star score for frontal crash protection, but the 2018 hatchback suffered a rare (and worrisome) three-star score in the frontal crash. No ratings were given overall or for side-impact.</p>, <p>Advanced safety equipment is not available. A rearview camera is available on upper trim levels.</p>, <p>The Nissan Versa S sedan ($12,110) comes with a manual transmission, manual windows and door locks, four-speaker CD audio, Bluetooth hands-free phone, and 15-inch steel wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $885 destination charge.) Versa S Plus sedan ($14,250) substitutes a CVT for the manual gearbox, adding cruise control and a rear spoiler.</p>, <p>Versa SV sedan ($15,840) adds upgraded fabric upholstery, a split-folding rear seat, power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, and a lighted USB port. A Special Edition package ($500) for the SV sedan includes a 5.0-inch touchscreen, rearview camera, foglamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, chrome front-end accents, and 15-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Versa Note S hatchback ($15,480) is equipped similar to S Plus sedan, with CVT. Versa Note SV hatchback ($16,380) is comparable to SV sedan, but also includes rearview camera and 5.0-inch display, plus Divide-N-Hide adjustable floor.</p>, <p>Versa Note SR hatchback ($17,980) gets sporty exterior and interior enhancements, including foglamps, a rear spoiler, suede-like seats, 16-inch alloy wheels, body-color side sills, and mirror-integrated turn-signal indicator.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55759" height="149" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-versa-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Unlike some models that come in twin body styles, the Versa looks impressively well-proportioned as a hatchback, but less appealing and more humdrum in sedan form. In fact, the two versions share no sheetmetal.</p>, <p>Either way, the Versa has fallen behind the times in design, compared to more stylish rivals it its price category. Other subcompacts have evolved, while the Versa essentially stood still.</p>, <p>Body components are familiar from other Nissan models, including the grille, large headlights, and bumpers. Most versions ride on 15-inch wheels, which look too small for the sizable wheelwells.</p>, <p>Inside, the two body styles are more closely aligned, falling short on styling. Except for its center stack, the dual-cockpit layout is hardly adventurous or enticing. Broad stretches of hard black plastic weaken its appeal even further.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55760" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-versa-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-versa-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-versa-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Most adults will be satisfied up front, though not entirely comfortable over long distances. Leg space is bountiful out back. Rear-seat riders get 37 inches of legroom in the sedan, or 38.3 inches in the Note hatchback. Six-foot passengers can actually ride behind other six-footers without cramping.</p>, <p>Sedan trunk space is sizable for the subcompact class, at 14.9 cubic feet. The Versa Note boasts even greater space. With rear seatbacks upright, its hatch provides a hefty 18.8 cubic feet, expanding to 38.3 with the seatbacks folded. The available Divide-N-Hide adjustable floor holds small items underneath.</p>, <p>Base-model upholstery is indeed basic. Upgraded fabric in SV-trimmed Versas raises the quality level. Switches and buttons tend to feel hollow, even unsubstantial, failing to inspire confidence.</p>, <p>The sedan is quiet. Little road noise can be heard. And, thanks to more sound-deadening material, the hatchback is even quieter than the sedan.</p>, <p>Versas deliver a satisfying ride, though no better than expected. Handling is predictable but nicely composed, not as good as the Honda. A tight turning radius blends with comfortably weighted steering, to make each body style easily maneuverable around town.</p>, <p>The low-powered engine and continuously variable transmission often feel overwhelmed when striving to bring the Versa up to highway speed. Reaching 60 mph takes more than 11 seconds, sluggish performance. Passing on the highway can be challenging for the overburdened engine.</p>, <p>The base-model sedan’s standard 5-speed manual transmission doesn’t yield much improvement. Even worse, it extracts a substantial penalty in fuel economy.</p>, <p>Most Versa models are comparatively frugal in the subcompact category, at least with the CVT, though the engine must work hard to keep pace with traffic. With the CVT, the 2018 Versa is EPA-rated at 31/39 mpg City/Highway, or 34 mpg Combined. The manual-shift sedan is EPA-rated at a less-tempting 27/36/30 mpg. Bigger sedans, like Nissan’s own four-cylinder Altima, offer nearly comparable highway fuel economy while providing more interior room.</p>, <p>Affordable pricing is the foremost attraction, along with impressive back-seat space. The sedan is among the least-costly new cars, though Nissan’s CVT is a better choice than the S sedan’s manual gearbox. Most buyers are likely to consider the Versa Note more comfortable and versatile, though also more costly. Several good small cars are available, including the Chevrolet Sonic and Honda Fit, but the aging Versa is more about being affordable than being good.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-leaf/
[<p>The Nissan Leaf, a five-door compact hatchback, has been redesigned and re-engineered for 2018. The 2018 Leaf features a new body, new interior, more safety features, and a lower price. More important, it boasts a new battery pack providing increased range and quicker acceleration. The world’s best-selling electric car is a whole lot better for 2018.</p>, <p>Its range is estimated at 150 miles, increased by a giant leap of 43 miles over the previous version.</p>, <p>That’s still nowhere near the 234-mile range of the Chevrolet Bolt EV, but the Bolt costs $7000 more than the Leaf. Other electric rivals include Ford Focus, Hyundai Ioniq, and Volkswagen e-Golf, with ranges of 114 to 125 miles. But those three are only sold in some parts of the U.S., while the Leaf and Bolt are available everywhere. The Leaf is built in Tennessee.</p>, <p>The EPA rates the 2018 Leaf in MPGe, or miles per gallon equivalent. It gets 124 MPGe city, 101 MPGe Highway, and 112 MPGe Combined.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55751" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-leaf-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-leaf-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-leaf-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2018 Nissan Leaf S ($29,990) comes with heated seats front and rear, heated steering wheel, Bluetooth, rearview camera, dark nylon upholstery, 16-inch steel wheels and plastic wheel covers, and a 5.0-inch touchscreen. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Leaf SV ($32,490) adds a 7.0-inch touchscreen with navigation, power mirrors, and 16-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Leaf SL ($36,200) gets leather seats, 17-inch alloy wheels, and automatic headlamps. Options include a seven-speaker Bose audio system and surround-view cameras.</p>, <p>Inconspicuous, the 2018 Leaf looks like any other five-door compact hatchback. It looks like other Nissans. You have to spot the trap door on the nose for the electric plug to realize what it is.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55753" height="160" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-leaf-interior.jpg" width="200"/>One strong feature of the Leaf that it has the interior space of a midsize car in its compact exterior package. It will seat four comfortably, and five without much effort, thanks to careful mounting of the battery pack deep under the rear seat.</p>, <p>Inside, the only thing that gives away its electric being is the drive selector, shaped like a mushroom. The Leaf starts with a button and goes into gear with a mouse. But then it gets electric, and comes to life. The digital displays are dazzling. A screen in the center of the dash displays range, maps, energy use, nearby recharging points, and more.</p>, <p>Since an electric car has no engine to drown out the road noise, a well-isolated cabin is critical. A special detail in the Leaf is its exclusive silent windshield wipers; engineers tried using the wipers from a luxury Infiniti, but they were too loud.</p>, <p>Entirely calm and quiet, the Leaf can accelerate more quickly than an economy car with an engine. There’s less drama, but also less excitement. At least less visceral excitement. Being rapidly whooshed can be exciting too.</p>, <p>It silently accelerates from zero to sixty in less than 10 seconds, and can go 90 mph, although not for 150 miles. That’s easily quick enough to keep up with traffic. It’s easy to drive, although boring.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55752" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-leaf-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The new lithium-ion battery pack and electric motor bring a huge boost in power and acceleration, with in increase in horsepower from 107 to 147, and an increase in torque from 187 pound-feet to 236 pound-feet. The Leaf had good acceleration before, and now it’s even stronger. It’s especially improved between 40 and 70 mph, important because that’s the passing speed on two-lane highways.</p>, <p>At speeds above about 50 mph, the steering gets heavier, as if the car were pushing into headwind, which is exactly what’s happening with wind drag, so the range drops like a stone.</p>, <p>The accelerator pedal demands a lot of pressure to get all the way down. It’s a deliberate design, to discourage the driver from using up precious energy and range.</p>, <p>Eco mode cuts power by 10 percent to increase the range, but it often feels like more. When you floor it, it snaps out of Eco and gives what you ask, all the juice it’s got.</p>, <p>A plug-in electric heater keeps the battery warm overnight in winter.</p>, <p>One thing that will be a joy to city drivers, which is most of them because an electric car is a city car, is the tiny turning circle of 17 feet. Easy to make a U-turn to snag that parking space on the opposite side of the street, like they do all the time in San Francisco.</p>, <p>The regenerative braking is tuned to feel like an automatic transmission. There’s a B mode, which increases the regeneration to feel like engine braking. B mode theoretically brings you more range, because it keeps the battery charge higher and longer; but it requires more concentration from the driver, so allow for that aggressive braking.</p>, <p>The deep-mounted battery pack lowers the center of gravity, so the balance is good, and there’s no body roll during cornering, but neither is there much feedback or feel in the steering. Hard cornering isn’t what the Leaf is all about anyhow, nor is that something Leaf owners are likely to engage in, on their way home from the library. However, it is a tall car on small wheels, so it’s sensitive to side winds.</p>, <p>Overall, the Leaf’s handling and roadholding are adequate, but hardly engaging; driven aggressively, it’s disappointing, with numb steering and little feedback. The driver feels removed. But on the upside, the turning circle is a shockingly small 17 feet.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Leaf is a winner. A major improvement over the previous model, it’s faster, has more range, and it costs less. It even looks like a regular car.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLC comes in a choice of distinctive bodies: conventional SUV and Coupe. Like many vehicles adopting the latter designation, that low-roofed body style isn’t really a coupe, but it’s designed to render a sportier look.</p>, <p>Four distinct powertrain possibilities are offered: four-cylinder GLC 300, AMG GLC 43 with V6, and V8-powered AMG GLC 63, plus a more potent S version of the latter.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55742" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-glc-coupe.jpg" width="200"/>The V8-powered Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 editions debuted during the 2018 model year. AMG models get a newly optional performance exhaust, as well as a Track Pace App.</p>, <p>The GLC 300 comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with direct injection that makes 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque, driving a 9-speed automatic transmission. It comes with either rear- or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Mercedes-AMG models come standard with all-wheel drive. All three AMG versions use the same transmission. In the AMG GLC 43, a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 develops 362 horsepower and 384 pound-feet of torque. Because peak torque arrives at low speed (2000 rpm), 0-60 mph acceleration takes just 4.8 seconds.</p>, <p>A 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, generating 469 horsepower and 479 pound-feet, powers the AMG GLC 63, shrinking 0-60 time near 4 seconds. In GLC 63 S form, the V8 whips up 503 horsepower and 516 pound-feet. The S version comes only in Coupe guise; other models are offered in both body styles. Every GLC 63 has a limited-slip rear differential, but the S model’s is electronically controlled.</p>, <p>All GLCs come with a rearview camera and forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking. A safety group includes adaptive cruise control, active lane control, and automatic LED headlights. A head-up display, blind-spot monitoring, rear-seat airbags, surround-view cameras, and Active Parking Assist are available. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named GLC a Top Safety Pick Plus, with Good crash-test ratings all around (including small overlap).</p>, <p>GLC 300 SUV ($40,050) has rear-drive, a four-cylinder engine, synthetic leather upholstery, power driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, 18-inch wheels, wood trim, and a 7.0-inch infotainment display. Leather and navigation are options. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>4MATIC all-wheel drive adds $2,000.</p>, <p>GLC 300 Coupe ($46,600) has a lower roofline and comes standard with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>AMG GLC 43 SUV ($56,250) and AMG GLC 43 Coupe ($60,400) get V6 power and all-wheel drive, along with synthetic leather/suede upholstery and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>AMG GLC 63 SUV ($69,900) and AMG GLC 63 Coupe ($73,150) boast a 4.0-liter, 469-horsepower V8 engine and all-wheel drive. AMG GLC 63 S Coupe ($80,750) features a 503-horsepower version of the V8 engine.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55744" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-glc-walk-cpe.jpg" width="200"/>Subtle sheetmetal curves and a long roofline help give the GLC its sensuous character. Although the Coupe is pleasing to the eye, its steeply sloped rear roof shrinks cargo space. As a result, the conventional crossover SUV version is the practical choice, but not by much.</p>, <p>From the front, both bodies look almost identical, echoing the appearance of the larger GLE. More softly shaped, yet voluptuous, the GLC suggests greater charm. AMG models get specific, more assertive front/rear bumper designs.</p>, <p>Upscale throughout, the GLC cabin suggests fine furniture, exuding tranquil sensibility. Upholstered in synthetic or genuine leather, depending on model, the GLC SUV is spacious all around for five passengers. Cargo volume behind the rear seat totals 20.5 cubic feet, but shrinks appreciably in the GLC Coupe, with its low roofline.</p>, <p>Matte-finished metallic trim and a choice of lush woods add to the premium look of the stunning interior, which relies upon flowing, flamboyant shapes.</p>, <p>Positioned well, facing a low windshield, the driver gets a commanding view. Nicely sculpted seats are carlike in nature. Base-model seats lack large bolsters, but include extendable thigh support. AMG models boast firmer, grippier sport seats, but omit wood trim. AMG seats straddle the line between comfort and confinement.</p>, <p>Back seats don’t differ much between SUV and Coupe models. Head clearance shrinks slightly in the Coupe, but it’s acceptable.</p>, <p>Seat contours aren’t friendly to a third passenger, but shoulder space may not be an obstacle. Most adults should slip inside easily enough, without head-ducking.</p>, <p>Coarse engine sounds manage to enter the cabin, though they’re more stimulating in the AMG GLC 43. Wind noise is more noticeable, too.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55745" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-glc-suv-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-glc-suv-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-glc-suv-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Pleasant overall, the GLC 300 delivers a smoothly supple ride. Even without the available air suspension, it subdues some impressively-sized bumps and holes. Add that air suspension and it glides over pavement obstacles with finesse, and without floatiness. With either suspension, the GLC 300 handles with precision and confident control.</p>, <p>Expect strong performance even from the four-cylinder engine. Acceleration to 60 mph takes about 6.5 seconds, delivered with quiet refinement. The stop/start system is effective, but restarts the engine with notable vibration.</p>, <p>As reworked by the AMG group, the GLC turns into a true performance vehicle, despite its SUV designation. AMG air suspensions are calibrated to yield a pillow-soft ride, at least in Comfort mode. Shifts from the 9-speed automatic are quicker, and the all-wheel-drive system sends more power to the back wheels. As the V6 springs to life, the sport exhaust actually crackles and pops, not unlike early muscle cars.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55746" height="137" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-glc63-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Steering feels more lively in AMG editions, complemented by effective body control. In Sport mode, the GLC 43 can corner briskly while remaining impressively flat.</p>, <p>Although the 9-speed automatic is well-tuned, lurching can occur during low-end gearchanges. Still, shifts are largely unobtrusive. With all-wheel drive, slightly more power reaches the rear wheels when starting off, smoothing acceleration.</p>, <p>Fuel economy ranks around average for the class. With rear-drive, the GLC 300 is EPA-rated at 22/28 mpg City/Highway, or 24 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers the City estimate to 21 mpg. The AMG GLC 43 is EPA-rated at 18/24 mpg City/Highway, or /20 mpg Combined. No estimates are available for the AMG GLC 63.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz GLC is among the best of the brands five SUVs. It comes amply equipped even in base form but is priced higher than competitors, such as Volvo’s XC60, and can become costly with options.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mercedes-benz-sl-class/
[<p>The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class is not so much sports car as it is small luxury roadster. It’s elegant and powerful, while being gentle and nimble. Open-air rivals might be the iconic Porsche 911 Cabriolet and legendary Chevrolet Corvette, while other marketplace competitors would include the gorgeous Jaguar F-Type, and awesome Aston Martin DB9.</p>, <p>Now in the seventh year of its generation, the SL-Class was freshened and upgraded for 2017 with a more svelte body and new 9-speed transmission. It’s unchanged for 2018, except a rearview camera is now standard on the lowest model, the SL450.</p>, <p>The entry-level model is the SL450 with its twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6, making 362 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>Next comes the SL550, sporting a twin-turbo 4.7-liter V8 with 449 hp and 516 lb-ft.</p>, <p>The SL65 flaunts a massive 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 that delivers a racecar-like 621 hp and unbelievable 738 lb-ft of torque. Finally, there is the Mercedes-AMG SL63, which backs things down a bit, but not much, to a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V8 making 577 hp and 664 lb-ft of torque; it uses a 7-speed automatic.</p>, <p>The SL-Class hasn’t been crash-tested by the government or insurance industry, but it’s safe to say that it’s exceptional among performance cars, as it receives so many of the active safety systems found in the S-Class flagship sedan. Collision Prevention Assist Plus is standard, with active brake assist. Also active headlamps, LED daytime running lights, and Attention Assist, which monitors the driver for drowsiness and displays a coffee-cup icon on the dash when it’s time for a caffeine break.</p>, <p>The 2018 SL-Class hasn’t been rated by the EPA, but the SL450 with the twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 should get about 23 miles per gallon. Mileage goes down as power goes up in the other models.</p>, <p>The SL450 ($88,200) uses a twin-turbo V6, the SL550 ($112,300) a twin-turbo V8, the SL65 ($222.000) a twin-turbo V12, and the AMG SL63 ($152,800) a hotrod twin-turbo V8.</p>, <p>The SL-Class comes standard with front airbags, side airbags that extend to protect the head and thorax, knee airbags, and pop-up roll bars that activate in a rollover. Options include parking sensors and park assist, which uses sensors and electric power steering to angle the SL into a spot while the driver maintains control over the brake.</p>, <p>An available Driver Assistance package adds adaptive cruise control with steering assist, an Active Brake Assist system with cross-traffic functionality, blind-spot monitors, active lane control, and Pre-Safe Brake, which will brake at up to 40 percent power, while sounding an alert, if traffic is stopped ahead. With the latter feature, the moment the driver touches the brake pedal 100 percent of braking power is delivered.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55737" height="92" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sl-walk.jpg" width="200"/>New sheetmetal for 2017 made the SL-Class more emphatic and expressive. The front end features a long hood with twin bulges, and a grille that’s more vertical, inspired by the gullwing 300SL W194 that won the 1952 La Carrera Panamericana (after a vulture with a 45-inch wingspan smashed through the windshield and knocked the navigator unconscious). Big round LED headlamps with LED running lights finish off the look.</p>, <p>There’s an A-wing design in the front that also hints of the old car, leading to a body-colored splitter. Big air dams and sculpted body panels make the SL look athletic and chiseled. It’s like a brawny sports sedan face on a graceful touring coupe body. From the side it’s not the best-looking Mercedes, but from other angles it commands a presence.</p>, <p>The hardtop roofline and teardrop taillamps seem out of balance with the front end, so as a result it looks best with the top down.</p>, <p>The cockpit is precise, like a business jet, with round airplane-like vents and lavish details. The leather is stitched in two rows, and there’s enough metallic trim to embarrass an Audi. The steering wheel has a flat bottom, and the shifter is just a tiny knob on the console. What a car this would be with a manual transmission.</p>, <p>The dash is less flowing and more compartmentalized than the Mercedes C-Class and S-Class sedans. Four chrome-tipped vents anchor the dash that includes a big glowing touchscreen, optional analog clock, and more trim in dark polished wood, aluminum, or carbon fiber. The controls are grouped logically but not all identified with clear icons. The center console is wide, flaring out to hold two big cupholders.</p>, <p>The COMAND infotainment system has Apple CarPlay smartphone integration. Fancy sound options include a Harman Kardon or Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system.</p>, <p>The hardtop can go up or down when the car is moving 25 miles an hour or less. The roof panels are automatically stored in a place that doesn’t use much trunk space, good thing because it’s already pretty small. It only holds a couple of carry-on bags with the top up.</p>, <p>The seats are wide and deeply scooped, but with 12 adjustments they’re supportive for all sizes, including long legs thanks to a bottom cushion extender. They can be heated, cooled or massaged, and warm air can be blown on your neck from the Airscarf. Behind the seats, there’s enough room for a briefcase, but behind each seat is a deep bin with a lid. Climbing in and out, with the top up, requires some bending, but not as much as with a sports car.</p>, <p>Under the hardtop, it’s as quiet as a coupe. With the top down and windows up, the effective air deflector makes it possible to have a conversation at 70 mph without shouting.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55738" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sl-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sl-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-sl-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>It’s a fast lineup. The fact that the 362-horsepower twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 (with 369 pound-foot of torque) is the slowest engine, mostly indicates the other engines are overkill. The twin-turbo V6 is enough power, period. Actually the SL450 feels nearly as quick as the SL550 with its twin-turbo V8. Not only that, it sounds more strident, if less throaty.</p>, <p>You have to want the basic nature of a V8 to prefer the SL550. The V8 power characteristic maybe best fits the touring character of the SL. The SL550 lopes along in a refined manner. However we observed some uncouth behavior at low speeds and easy throttle, which we blame on the 9-speed transmission, or more precisely, the transmission/engine combination.</p>, <p>We think the AMG SL63 hits a sweeter spot of high performance, and it handles the best, although the heavier SL65 is the fastest at 186 miles per hour, and zero to sixty in four seconds flat. Although we haven’t driven the V12 SL65 yet.</p>, <p>As for handling, the SL-Class feels secure as a vault as it rolls down the road. There are five Dynamic Select modes (Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus, and Individual). Sport mode isn’t particularly firm, but it handles sweepers with grace. The electric power steering isn’t engaging like a sports car, but it’s stable on center and gets quicker off center.</p>, <p>The standard suspension is excellent. Available Active Body Control moves the suspension into another realm.</p>, <p>ABC is a full active suspension system, controlled by hydraulics and capable of adjusting its parameters in milliseconds. It helps erase lift during hard acceleration, nosedive during hard braking, and body roll during hard cornering. It includes a Curve Tilting function that helps the car lean into corners up to 2.65 degrees, as a motorcycle rider would, to reduce lateral Gs within the car.</p>, <p>The SL-Class offers four distinct models to choose from, built around four engines, bringing four personalities. We think the most modest among them, the SL450 with its twin-turbo V6 making more than enough horsepower, is the most appropriate in keeping with the overall character of the car. Beware the new 9-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with driving impressions by The Car Connection.</p>, <p> </p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan has been substantially revised for 2018.</p>, <p>The flagship of the marque, the S-Class is the benchmark for all luxury sedans. It’s one of the most lavish and classy displays anywhere of wealth and exclusivity, with graceful and athletic styling, effortless power, an exceptional ride, plush interior, and sweeping standard and optional equipment.</p>, <p>The 2018 S-Class, the fifth year of its generation, raises that mark by some 6500 new parts, including one new V6 and two new V8 engines, along with the returning V12.</p>, <p>For 2018, only the sedans will be updated, among them the S450, and two Maybach uber-luxury models.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz S450 uses a new 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6, while the S560 takes a new 463-horsepower twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55731" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-amg.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-amg.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-amg-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The AMG S63 high-performance model makes an awesome 603 horsepower with its new turbo-boosted V8. The V12 in the S65 is a twin-turbo 6.0-liter makes even more horsepower: 621 hp with 738 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>A 9-speed automatic transmission comes in the V6 and V8s, while the V12 takes a 7-speed automatic, and the S63 uses a wet starter clutch instead of a torque converter. The S63 also gets a new 4MATIC+ all-wheel-drive system that can transfer 100 percent of the power from rear to front wheels.</p>, <p>For 2018, the available Magic Ride Control suspension is improved with the ability to lean the car to the inside in corners, by as much as 2.65 degrees. This is designed to reduce centrifugal forces on the passengers and quicken handling. Changes in the cabin include higher resolution infotainment screens, and programs for the climate control system.</p>, <p>Autonomous driving features have been increased for 2018, as well. Intelligent Drive has improved cameras and radar sensors, and uses more GPS data. The system already can steer and brake for the driver, and now it changes lanes after the driver puts the turn signal on. We don’t really like the idea of taking the decision regarding the moment of lane-changing out of the driver’s hands. The system also slows down for tight turns and intersections, freeing the driver from thinking, another thing we don’t see being good.</p>, <p>Standard safety equipment includes front, front side, rear side and curtain airbags; inflatable rear seat belts; adaptive brake lights; and adaptive head restraints. Optional safety equipment includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control with following and steering ability, approaching autonomous driving functions in limited environments, blind-spot monitors, a surround-view camera system, and night vision with obstacle and pedestrian detection.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55732" height="109" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-maybach.jpg" width="200"/>You can get into a Mercedes-Benz S-Class for a mere $89,900 for the rear-wheel-drive S450 with a V6, or you can pay $229,500 for the AMG S65 V12, also known as Master of the Universe.</p>, <p>In between are the S560 V8 for $99,900, and the AMG S63 for $147,500. The 4MATIC all-wheel drive system is $3000 more in the S450 and S560, and comes standard on the AMG S63.</p>, <p>Optional equipment includes things like a 24-speaker surround sound system, warm-stone massaging seats, perfume scents released into the cabin, entertainment and fridge in the rear, and two executive rear seating packages that include airline-like tables and a right-side footrest.</p>, <p>The Maybach models go off into Rolls-Royce territory, with the technology and features wrapped into a limo-like body that’s eight inches longer. The S560 Maybach 4MATIC is $168,600, while the S650 Maybach V12 with rear-wheel drive is $198,700.</p>, <p>Few of those 6500 changes are to the exterior. There’s a new grille and bumpers, and new LED headlamps that project a wide display and provide autonomous functioning. The AMG models have a low wing-like front fascia with big air intakes, and a rear diffuser with four exhaust tips.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55730" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cabin reeks of splendor. It boasts beautiful craftsmanship that’s impressive to the eye, with fit and finish that few cars can equal.</p>, <p>For 2018, the two 12.3-inch screens, one for gauges and one for infotainment, are combined into one big screen, with higher resolution. A new system called Energizing Comfort can be set for five separate 10-minute programs to soothe the driver. The programs combine climate control, seat heating or cooling, seat massage, music, ambient lighting, and fragrance diffusion. Sounds perfect for a relaxing nap behind the wheel, while autonomous driving takes you to your destination.</p>, <p>The horizontal dash has two tiers and is glamorous in quilted leather with silver trim. The materials have high contrast, and there are a lot of shiny accents over the basic wood or leather trim, with carbon-fiber accents on the AMG models.</p>, <p>The front seats are superb, somewhere between supportive and plush, with big cushions and a lot of adjustment, although the ergonomics are occasionally fiddly. The rear seats are also wide and comfortable, at least the outside seats.</p>, <p>The COMAND connectivity system is upgraded for 2018. It comes with five years of service and includes Facebook, Pandora, voice-to-text email and text messages, a mobile app, non-streaming apps, web services, roadside connection, and diagnostics data.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55729" height="108" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-s-walk.jpg" width="200"/>The S-Class sedan ride is impeccable, while the brakes get the heavy car stopped true and without drama. It’s not athletic. It is too big and heavy to handle like a sports sedan. The steering lacks feedback.</p>, <p>Air suspension with adaptive dampers is standard, while the available Magic Ride Control uses hydraulic springs. Its glassy ride comes via a camera that views the road ahead and sets the suspension for the upcoming surface. In Comfort mode, it truly feels magic.</p>, <p>The new S560’s twin-turbo V8 is 4.0 liters, smaller than the previous S550 with 4.7 liters, but it makes 14 more horsepower. Its 463 hp is as much as anyone needs.</p>, <p>The AMG S65 with a V12 making 621 horsepower is rear-wheel drive. Don’t let the horsepower fool you; it’s not as quick as the AMG S63 V8. The V12 has other virtues. And it’s mated to a seven-speed automatic, not a nine-speed. The Maybach S650 V12 makes less horsepower.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class is truly the ultimate sedan. Powerful, luxurious, taut ride and handling, built like a tank. The S560 with the 463-hp V8 seems the appropriate model to us.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz E400 sedan, coupe, wagon and cabriolet are all new, bigger, better looking, and more efficient than the previous versions. They follow the Mercedes-Benz E300 sedan, which was all new for 2017. Longer, lower and wider, these E-Class models are loaded with technology, including semi-autonomous driving features.</p>, <p>2018 E-Class rivals include the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS, Jaguar XF, Cadillac CTS, Tesla Model S, and even the S-Class.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55724" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-e300-sedan.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-e300-sedan.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-e300-sedan-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>In its lineup of four body styles, the E-Class uses turbocharged engines of four, six and eight cylinders; rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, and high-performance AMG models. The cars’ performance characteristics can be changed and tuned to the drivers’ liking with drive modes, adaptive suspensions and tunable steering. This review will be kind of generic, since a hundred iterations of E-Class could be described.</p>, <p>Base engine in the E300 is a turbo four making 241 horsepower. The E400 takes a twin-turbo V6 making 329 horsepower, with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The E-Class sedan runs the board in crash testing with the NHTSA, five stars in every test. The IIHS gives it Top Safety Pick Plus.</p>, <p>Every E-Class has forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, LED headlamps, and a sound alert that makes a noise at you when the car thinks you’re not paying attention to the road. In a crash, the seat bolsters tighten. A rearview camera comes standard on 2018 E-Class models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55719" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-e-wagon.jpg" width="200"/>The optional self-driving system is called Drive Pilot, and costs more than $10,000. It can change lanes automatically when the lane is clear and the driver signals for two seconds. It can follow, accelerate, and stop behind other cars in traffic at speed as high as 130 mph. It can follow lanes at speeds up to 81 mph even when the lanes aren’t well marked. The system can squeeze the brakes when oncoming traffic veers into your lane, and it can add force to the steering when the driver makes an evasive maneuver.</p>, <p>The rear-wheel drive E300 sedan gets 22 miles per gallon City, 30 Highway, 25 Combined.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive E400 4MATIC sedan gets 20/27/23 mpg; the coupe and cabriolet get 22 mpg Combined, and the wagon and AMG E43 sedan get 21 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The powerful E63 sedan or wagon with a V8 engine gets 15/22/18 mpg.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55722" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-e400-coupe.jpg" width="200"/>With so many versions, the price ranges from an entry level for the E300 sedan of less than $54,000, to the AMG E63 S wagon for twice that. Both before any options, which can add greatly to the bottom line.</p>, <p>The E300 only comes with the turbo four. The E400 only comes with the turbo six and all-wheel drive with air suspension, in the sedan and wagon. The E400 Coupe and Cabriolet are rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The E43 sedan gets a more powerful twin-turbo V6, while the E63 sedan and wagon use a twin-turbo V8 and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Standard equipment on the E300 includes synthetic leather upholstery, Bluetooth with audio streaming, two USB ports, Apple CarPlay, power front seats, power windows/locks/mirrors, automatic climate control, remote start, navigation, ambient lighting, and rearview camera.</p>, <p>Options include real leather, wireless phone charging, Burmester audio, massaging seats, automatic park assist, rear-seatbelt and rear-side airbags, and a safety bundle that includes Drive Pilot and a surround-view camera system. An air suspension and all-wheel drive also are available.</p>, <p>More options include a head-up display, and active headlamps. The E300 can also be optioned with big 18-inch AMG wheels, sport suspension, a panoramic roof, 19- or 20-inch wheels, heated and cooled front seats, adaptive headlights, satellite radio, and a set of 12.3-inch digital displays that replace conventional gauges.</p>, <p>Standard equipment in the E400 coupe includes keyless ignition, leather upholstery, memory front seats, a panoramic roof, and a rearview camera. Cabriolets add standard rear-seat side airbags and a power folding cloth top, as well as warm-air vents at neck level. Major options on both include an air suspension, and a head-up display. Wagons have a split-fold rear seat, fold-away third-row seats, and a power tailgate.</p>, <p>E43 sedans have 19-inch wheels, AMG exterior trim, a sport steering wheel, a stitched dash, and AMG gauges. Mobile apps that record track performance, a panoramic roof, and carbon-fiber trim are among the options.</p>, <p>E63 sedans and wagons get Nappa leather, heated and cooled front seats, and a power trunk closer (on sedans). The E63 offers carbon-ceramic brakes and a sport exhaust system.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55725" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-e53-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Like the latest S-Class and C-Class, the E-Class sedan is balanced and handsome, with a long hood and short trunk. It looks more relaxed than the more compact C-Class. A deep line at the shoulders tapers under a carefully draped roofline, to the LED taillamps with a charming pattern Mercedes-Benz calls Stardust.</p>, <p>Now a tradition, Luxury models get a tri-star badge mounted on the hood, while Sport models get it in the less flashy grille.</p>, <p>The beautiful coupe and cabriolet are a bit lower than the sedan, and look even lower with frameless windows. But there’s small awkward pillar that divides the rear side window into 2/3 and 1/3.</p>, <p>AMG models are still lower, with bigger wheels and darker trim.</p>, <p>The E-Class cabin speaks in a rhythm of textures, wood and metallic weaves led by stitched and vividly colored leather rising and falling from the door panels to the center console. It glows under 64 shades of ambient lighting from ivory to purple, studded by circular air vents.</p>, <p>The dash can be dominated by twin high-rez 12.3-inch display screens that replace the gauges and controls, although most E300s will come with one screen and a handsome set of dials and climate switches underneath. In place of a shift lever, there’s a touch-sensitive control puck for the COMAND infotainment interface. It’s a futzy knob.</p>, <p>The COMAND infotainment system remains balky (although for 2018 Android Auto and Apple CarPlay appear). For example, too much is required to enter a destination in the navigation system, whose points of interest are too slim.</p>, <p>The E300 is receptive to fingertip control, namely in the steering wheel that has touch surfaces for swipe-and-tap operation. Intended or not.</p>, <p>Front seats have lots of lumbar support, and available massage. Bolstering in the AMG models is thick. The heated steering wheel also heats the armrests and center console. Rear seat has a middle armrest, cupholders, and available laptop holder.</p>, <p>There’s a choice of Burmester sound systems that use structural parts of the body as passive speakers with carved metal grilles. The system for $6000 has 23 speakers and crystal-clear 3D sound.</p>, <p>Luxury features include a cabin fragrance dispenser for a few hundred dollars, and the 64-color ambient lighting. Imagine purple lighting with white leather, and see Miami Vice. But with classier colors and leather, the E-Class can make a BMW look dowdy. Even a Jaguar.</p>, <p>There is good space in the rear of the sedan, where the seatback folds in three sections. The boost in cargo space is necessary because the sedan’s trunk is small, at 13.1 cubic feet.</p>, <p>The rear seat in the Coupe and Cabriolet offer seven inches less legroom than the sedan and wagon. However a six-footer will have enough legroom and headroom to fit.</p>, <p>A pair of rear-facing third-row seats is standard in the wagon. They fold into the cargo floor, to make a strong 35 cubic feet of space behind the second row.</p>, <p>Because the four-cylinder engine occasionally makes brusque noises that can sound cheap, the cabin could use more sound deadening.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55721" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-e400-driving.jpg" width="200"/>We have driven the E-Class from the San Francisco Bay area to winding roads in Portugal, and have experienced everything from docile to frenetic, from four-cylinder to twin-turbo V8.</p>, <p>But even with the docile powertrain it’s fairly quick, able to accelerate from zero to sixty in 6.2 seconds (on the way to 130 mph). Its 273 pound-feet of torque comes on down low at 1300 rpm, giving good early acceleration. Its paddle-shifting 9-speed transmission helps keep it in the perfect spot of the powerband. Too bad the four-cylinder sounds gruff.</p>, <p>Two suspensions are available for the E300. There is a firm multi-link suspension with adaptive dampers in either base or sport (firmer) tune, or an air suspension with adaptive dampers. In addition to that, the wheel sizes range from 17 to 20 inches, mounted with different tires.</p>, <p>The 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system splits power front to rear at 45:55.</p>, <p>The air suspension (called Air Body Control) and driving modes give the E-Class breathtaking versatility. It can cruise with lots of suspension travel, slow and smooth shifts and light-touch steering in Comfort mode, or approach AMG levels of heft and stiffness when set in Sport Plus mode. The modes are Comfort, Economy, Sport and Sport Plus. Comfort offers languid steering and shifting, and lengthy suspension travel. We often preferred Sport mode, which brings the best compromise of a good ride and quickness from the throttle, steering and transmission.</p>, <p>The air suspension system uses springs with two chambers per front strut and two chambers per rear strut; the chambers inflate and deflate at lightning speed based on sensor readings from the road. It lowers the ride height on the freeway for better aerodynamics and fuel mileage, and can raise it when more ground clearance is needed.</p>, <p>The E400 makes few compromises. Its 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 makes 329 horsepower and 354 pound-feet of torque at 1600 rpm, powering it from zero to sixty in 5.5 seconds in the rear-wheel-drive Coupe; in the all-wheel-drive sedan, with better traction from the standing start, it does that sprint in 5.2 seconds.</p>, <p>All that torque at such a low engine speed makes the E400 feel even quicker. Unlike the four-cylinder, it feels smooth and refined. Its 9-speed automatic transmission does quick and smooth shifts.</p>, <p>The Coupe and Convertible have a distinctive driving feel, slightly lower than the sedan. The air suspension and adaptive dampers are available, and they transform the ride and handling. In Comfort mode it’s stable and poised for daily driving, while it begs for Sport mode on winding roads.</p>, <p>The E43 sedan boosts that V6 to 396 horsepower and 384 pound-feet of torque, mated to a stronger 9-speed that shifts like a racecar’s. It does zero to sixty in 4.5 seconds, and 155 miles per hour. The all-wheel drive stretches the front/rear bias to 39/61.</p>, <p>In Sport Plus, the throttle is lightning quick. The transmission will hold a gear through tight curves, or manual mode can be used. Individual mode allows the driver to soften the steering that can feel unsettled in Sport Plus. The ride is very firm but comfortable enough.</p>, <p>The AMG E 63 S, sedan or wagon, uses twin-turbocharged, 4.0-liter V8 making 603 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of torque. Try 3.3 seconds from zero to 60, and 180 mph top speed, without drama.</p>, <p>The all-wheel drive can go 0/100 front/rear, meaning you can take the wagon on the track and throw the tail around, drift it in the corners, then go 180 mph on the long straight.</p>, <p>The E 63 S will nail the corner apex with its taut suspension, four links in front and a multi-link rear with more bracing and stabilizer bars, thick tubes. The front brake rotors are 16 inches, with available carbon-ceramic for the track. Pirelli P Zero tires are mounted on 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>It’s at home on the Nurburgring or American streets, with the air suspension and adaptive dampers that were developed on the S-Class. When you realize that the AMG models weigh more than two tons and are 190 inches long, it’s a reminder how far the E-Class has come.</p>, <p>The new E400 with its smooth engine, may be the best E-Class. The E43 is a high-performance sedan, while the AMG E63 is pure excess, in a good way.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz C-Class comes in four-door sedan, two-door coupe, and two-door Cabriolet versions. They current generation began when the sedan was launched for the 2015 model year, followed by the coupe for 2016 and Cabriolet for 2017. It still looks stunning in all three versions.</p>, <p>For 2018, C300 and C300 4MATIC sedans get a new 9-speed automatic transmission to replace the 7-speed transmission. This makes 2018 Mercedes-Benz C300 models a bit quicker, reducing the zero-to-sixty time from 6.0 to 5.8 seconds.</p>, <p>There are a number of powertrains, identified by the names for the C-Class: C300, C350e, AMG C43, AMG C63, and AMG C63 S. The five powertrains all use turbocharged engines with four, six or eight cylinders. The transmissions have seven or nine speeds, with rear-wheel drive or 4MATIC all-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55714" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-c-class-cabrio.jpg" width="200"/>C300 models use a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 241 horsepower, mated to the new 9-speed, with rear- or all-wheel drive in the 4MATIC.</p>, <p>The C350e plug-in hybrid uses a turbo four and battery pack, making a total of 275 horsepower.</p>, <p>The AMG C43 uses a turbo V6 making 362 horsepower, with the 9-speed that was new in this model last year. It shoots from zero to sixty in less than five seconds, and has sports exhaust and adaptive sports suspension. It rides the middle lane between the mild-mannered C300 and hot-rod AMG C63 that uses a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8, making 469 horsepower. Then there’s the AMG C63 S that makes 503 horsepower and blasts to 60 mph in less than four seconds, with a top speed of 180 mph. It competes with the Cadillac ATS-V and BMW M3.</p>, <p>The C300 sedan gets an EPA-rated 24/34 mpg City/Highway, 28 mpg Combined. With all-wheel drive it gets one less mile per gallon, while the coupe and convertible get two less. Over a 90-mile run in the C300 sedan, a mix of freeway, suburbia and country two-lanes, we got more than 30 mpg. The high-performance C43 AMG gets 20/28/23 mpg. The powerful V8 in the C63 sucks gas, with a score of 17/23/19 mpg.</p>, <p>The C-Class earned five stars from NHTSA, with four stars in frontal crash and rollover.</p>, <p>Advanced safety technology includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors, driver attention alert, and a semi-autonomous traffic assistant that follows the car ahead at up to 37 mph. There’s also an advanced brake assist system that detects pedestrians and parked cars, and automatically brakes, at up to 45 mph. The lane-keeping system applies the brakes on one side of the car to stop what the sensors think is unintentional drifting–but in our experience most of the time it’s not. Active parking assistance, surround-view cameras, and traffic sign assistance (which warns of speed limits, no-entry signs, and other information) are also among the available high-tech safety equipment.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55711" height="105" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-c300-coupe.jpg" width="200"/>2018 C-Class models come in three body styles: C300 Sedan ($40,250); C300 Coupe ($43,200), and C300 Cabriolet ($51,200) come standard with vinyl upholstery, cruise control, keyless ignition, rearview camera, COMAND interface with capacitive touchpad and a 7.0-inch display. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>The 4MATIC versions include all-wheel drive, among them the C300 4MATIC sedan ($42,250), C300 4MATIC Coupe ($45,200), C300 4MATIC Cabriolet ($53,200).</p>, <p>The C350e Plug-in Hybrid Sedan ($47,900) uses a hybrid gas-electric powertrain.</p>, <p>Options include leather, navigation, power passenger seat, LED headlamps, fragrance dispenser, panoramic sunroof, head-up display, hands-free trunk closer, a Sport Package with AMG bodywork; AMG Performance sport seats; AMG wheels; sports suspension.</p>, <p>AMG versions come in sedan, coupe and cabriolet versions and feature high-performance engines, among them the AMG C43 Sedan ($53,400), AMG C63 Sedan ($66,100), and AMG C63 S Sedan ($73,700).</p>, <p>Safety equipment includes a rearview camera, pelvis airbags in front, a new window airbag, side airbags in the rear, and driver knee airbag.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55713" height="111" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-c43-walk.jpg" width="200"/>The lines of the C-Class sedan are graceful, and the coupe is a knockout. The lines are also deceiving, as the sedan looks bigger than it is, easily mistaken for the flagship S-Class, despite a profile that’s all its own.</p>, <p>It’s 184.5 inches long, on a wheelbase of 111.8 inches, and 71.3 inches wide. The Cabriolet (convertible) is also gorgeous.</p>, <p>The C-Class grille is upright and the headlamps are intricate, with LED brows, or optional all-LED. Big flared air intakes. Flared front fenders with sleek creases on the hood. The rear has soft, rounded lines, pleasant.</p>, <p>AMG models are all hotted up, with a more aggressive nose, spoiler on the deck, black trim glitz, and red seatbelts.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55716" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-c400-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The C-Class cabin strives for S-Class quality, noticeable in the executive luxury door panels, inlaid. Some woods look better than others: The open-pore black ash is stunning. The wide centerstack flows like a waterfall, in wither wood, aluminum, or carbon fiber. The lines wrap around the cabin.</p>, <p>The power front seats are spacious and have an excellent shape, with extendable bolsters for thighs, and good back support.</p>, <p>The rear seat and its entry are compromised by the low roofline. Comfort for six-footers will be adequate on long drives, although lacking in knee room. The rear seat easily flops flat for longer cargo.</p>, <p>A 7.0-inch screen is standard, with an 8.4-inch screen available and standard on some models. The COMAND interface with its new capacitive touchpad controller needs patience and understanding. After a full day it still confounded us. It looks like a round smartphone mounted at an angle, and brings Bluetooth, AM/FM/XM, and USB together, using voice commands and touch control. The system is a haptic mess. Scrolling isn’t as smooth as a phone, and its menu management makes BMW’s iDrive feel streamlined, and Audi’s MMI feel especially effective.</p>, <p>The AMG C43 has grippy suede sport seats with more bolstering. They’re extremely comfortable, looking at the gauges through the three-spoke flat-bottom Nappa leather steering wheel. The seatbelts don’t have to be red; black and silver are available too. You can order it with no badging except for the Benz emblem.</p>, <p>The sleek roofline takes up some trunk space, with just 12.6 cubic feet in the sedan, 10.0 in the coupe, or 8.8 with the convertible.</p>, <p>The C300 offers sharp handling, and the four-cylinder turbo feels wonderful, whizzing to 60 mph in 6.0 seconds, according to Mercedes. Turbo boost is almost instantly available, and it’s strong throughout its full range. Power is rated at 241 hp and 273 foot-pounds of torque.</p>, <p>The C350e adds a 60kW electric motor for a massive increase in torque to 443 foot-pounds, allowing it to accelerate as quickly as the C300.</p>, <p>The potent AMG C43 uses a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 making 362 horsepower and 382 pound-feet of torque. It’s strong and willing in any gear or at any rpm, able to accelerate to 60 in 4.9 seconds. The exhaust note is muted and pleasant, joined in the cabin by induction sounds to provide that familiar AMG whuffle.</p>, <p>A snarling 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 powers the C63. It makes 469 horsepower and 479 kick-in-the-butt pound-feet of torque. It’s not as mental as the masterpiece motor in the Cadillac ATS-V, or as clinical and tactical as the BMW M3 and M4, but it’s the envy of every other enthusiast. It comes only with tire-smoking rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The engine in the S version of the C63 is tuned to make 503 hp and 516 lb-ft. If we called the C63 motor mental, then this one is mentally insane.</p>, <p>AMG versions use a different steering geometry for sharper cornering, bigger brakes, adjustable dampers to better control the ride, and torque vectoring at the rear. The standard all-wheel-drive system provides 31/69 front/rear bias. The transmission has five modes, including manual, rev-matching, and sport exhaust. With the 18-inch staggered wheels (19-inch available), the AMGs not only handle more crisply than the regular models, but also better than the competition from BMW.</p>, <p>Every C-Class has graceful and striking looks, with quality interior trim, sharp handling and a wide range of powertrains. The standard 2.0 turbo in the C300 is smooth and powerful, and it gets better (and more expensive) from there.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-jaguar-e-pace/
[<p>Jaguar launched a brand-new compact performance crossover model for the 2018 model year, joining the larger F-Pace. Simply gorgeous in design, the new Jaguar E-Pace hits the jackpot in technology, offering true torque vectoring to strengthen its handling potential.</p>, <p>Beneath its bonnet, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine comes in a choice of two tuning levels: The base version produces 246 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque, with 296 hp and 295 pound-feet for the optional variant. Both team with a 9-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>For the first time, a Jaguar engine is mounted transversely, rather than longitudinally.</p>, <p>Standard-engine models come in base, S, and SE trim levels. R-Dynamic versions, offered in S, SE, and HSE trim, get the upgraded 296-horsepower engine. For the 2018 season, Jaguar also offers a First Edition model, based upon the R-Dynamic SE.</p>, <p>R-Dynamic models feature a unique front bumper, deeper air intakes, foglamps, stainless steel pedals, and body-color sills. An R-Dynamic option for S and SE trim adds the more potent powertrain, sporty exterior touches, and shift paddles.</p>, <p>Two distinct all-wheel-drive systems are available. For the higher-powered engine, an Active Driveline system, borrowed from the Range Rover Evoque, transfers power both front-to-back and side-to-side. The result is power-based torque vectoring, in contrast to brake-based system from other automakers. In addition to tightening control in corners, the system can lock the rear wheels, yielding road behavior that seems impossible for a crossover that’s front-wheel biased.</p>, <p>Though dimensions are similar to a BMW X1 or Mercedes-Benz GLA, the E-Pace is about three inches wider, and that’s noticeable to the driver. In terms of driving characteristics, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio might be considered a competitor.</p>, <p>Jaguar aims to defy the expectation that compact crossovers are on the dull side, promising a vehicle that can be fun to drive as well as attractive. Starting below $40,000, the E-Pace includes a 10-inch infotainment touchscreen, though Apple CarPlay is unavailable.</p>, <p>A rearview camera is standard. Advanced safety systems include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and driver-condition monitoring. Jaguar also offers a surround-view camera system. A forward-mounted camera can help see around obstructions at intersections.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55702" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-3.jpg" width="200"/>The Jaguar E-Pace ($38,600) comes standard with the 246-horsepower engine, all-wheel drive, 17-inch wheels, cloth upholstery, pushbutton start, a rearview camera, LED headlights, heated mirrors, dual-zone climate control, front/rear parking assist, and a 10-inch touchscreen. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>E-Pace S ($41,500) includes power-adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, power-folding mirrors, 18-inch wheels, navigation, blind-spot assist, and parking information. E-Pace SE ($44,300) comes with 19-inch wheels, a power tailgate, Meridian audio, and mirror memory. First Edition ($53,550) gets the 246-hp engine, 20-inch diamond-turned split-spoke wheels, soft-grain ebony Windsor leather with contrast stitching, head-up display, and gesture-activated tailgate.</p>, <p>E-Pace R-Dynamic S ($47,250) upgrades to the 296-horsepower engine, equipped similar to regular S trim but with upgraded all-wheel-drive system. Sport seats have larger bolsters. It’s also available in R-Dynamic SE ($50,050) and R-Dynamic HSE ($53,100), the latter with 20-inch wheels, perforated leather, Meridian audio, and a gesture-activated tailgate.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55700" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Penned by youthful Jaguar designers, the sultry, sharply sculpted E-Pace aims at a comparable audience.</p>, <p>Comparatively tall for the compact class, the E-Pace looks lower than its measurements suggest, courtesy of sculpted lower-bodyside lines. The hood seems longer, too. Flared arches top each wheel. Slinky headlights seem out of place, but stylists have skillfully adapted the familiar Jaguar nose.</p>, <p>Long overhangs are softened by such details as simulated ducts and carefully considered bends. Because the roofline doesn’t drop dramatically, interior space isn’t compromised.</p>, <p>Inspiration for the efficiently laid-out cabin hails from Jaguar’s F-Type sports car as well as the larger F-Pace crossover. Quality of materials, however, falls short of Jaguar’s usual level.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55697" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Climate controls operate quietly and confidently, but hard-grained plastic doesn’t match the E-Pace’s price. R-Dynamic models get a stitched dashboard that looks good, but doesn’t feel sufficiently supple. Some combinations of leather upholstery are excessively dramatic.</p>, <p>Passengers can expect surprising spaciousness, promising comfort on long treks. Because front-seat occupants are closer than usual to the front wheels, their arches protrude into footwells. A high seating position provides good visibility over the deceptively short hood.</p>, <p>Rear-seat riders get more than 35 inches of legroom, which feels even longer. A wide back seat accommodates three, at least for shorter trips.</p>, <p>Cargo space is sizable. With rear seatbacks up, volume totals 24.2 cubic feet. Folding the seats expands space beyond 52 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55699" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-epace-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Planting itself solidly on the pavement, the E-Pace feels confident, without requiring much correction. In Normal drive mode, the electric power steering is light, yielding a sense of disconnection from the front wheels. Dynamic mode adds weight to the steering wheel, without increasing road feel.</p>, <p>With 20-inch wheels, the ride is quiet and comparatively calm. Variable dampers on upper trim levels can firm up suspension in Dynamic mode, but it’s far from stiff.</p>, <p>Although E-Pace engines function well, some low-speed hesitation in the 296-horsepower version is likely caused by an indecisive 9-speed transmission. Overly eager to upshift, especially in Normal mode, the transmission is prone to lagging and hesitation. Acceleration is acceptably brisk, though not quite swift, even with the R-Dynamic engine. Still, acceleration to 60 mph with the upgraded engine is achieved in less than six seconds. Dynamic mode moderates some of the transmission’s indecision.</p>, <p>Engines sound gruff and unrefined, almost to an obnoxious level. Fortunately, little of that sound makes it into the cabin.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s all-wheel-drive systems, derived from Range Rover/Land Rover, rank with the best from luxury automakers. The base system normally operates at a 50/50-split, front-to-rear, but can transfer nearly total power to either end to maintain traction.

[<p>The Korean manufacturer Kia has been good at imitating BMW, and they do it again with the Kia Stinger, an all new model. It’s a rear-wheel-drive compact/midsize vehicle that Kia considers a grand touring car to challenge the BMW 3 Series.</p>, <p>Technically it might be a hatchback, because the back opens like a hatch, but it’s more of a fastback sedan, with a long hood and continental styling. Its performance is serious and its price low. It’s powerful, practical, upscale, and fun to drive.</p>, <p>With a wheelbase of 114.4 inches and length of 190.2 inches, it’s a bit bigger than the 3 Series, or the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Lexus IS or Audi A5 Sportback, all of which might be considered rivals. It’s more the size of a Lexus GS sedan.</p>, <p>The base engine is 2.0-liter turbocharged four cylinder making a good 255 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. There’s also GT model with a 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 making an attention-grabbing 365 horsepower and 376 pound-feet. Both engines are mated to a Kia-built 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters. All-wheel drive is available.</p>, <p>The Stinger with its 2.0-liter engine and rear-wheel drive gets an EPA-rated 22 mpg City, 29 Highway, 25 Combined. The V6 is rated 19/25/21 mpg.</p>, <p>Standard safety features include seven airbags. The top model, GT2, comes standard with all safety features that are optional on the other models: forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, rear cross-traffic alerts, blind-spot monitors, automatic high beams, driver attention alerts, lane-departure warnings, active lane control, and dynamic headlights that point into turns.</p>, <p>Kia Stinger comes in five models. Stinger and Stinger Premium use the four cylinder engine, while GT models use the V6. All-wheel drive is available on all models for an extra $2200.</p>, <p>Stinger ($31,900) comes standard with leather upholstery, 12-way power driver’s seat with four-way power lumbar adjustment, 8-way power front passenger seat, heated front seats, tilt/telescoping heated and leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, auto-dimming rearview mirror, 60/40 split-folding rear seat, automatic headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, 7.0-inch touchscreen, AM/FM/HD satellite radio, six speakers, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, Bluetooth, and Uvo eServices Telematics, which is a smartphone app that offers maintenance alerts, parking minders, roadside assistance, and individual points of interest; and hill-start assist, front and rear park assist, and rearview camera. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Premium ($37,100) adds LED headlights and rear turn signals, sunroof, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, 7.0-inch digital instrument panel display, electronic parking brake, memory for the driver’s seat, steering wheel, and outside mirrors; 8.0-inch version of Uvo with navigation, and a 720-watt, 15-speaker Harman Kardon sound system with Clari-Fi that digitally expands compressed music and QuantumLogic Surround Sound.</p>, <p>Stinger GT ($38,350) is equipped like the base Stinger, adding among other things, aluminum pedals and scuff plates, a flat-bottom steering wheel, a nine-speaker audio system, and 19-inch wheels. GT 1 ($43,250) adds performance gauges in the instrument cluster, 8.0-inch version of Uvo with navigation, and the 15-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.</p>, <p>GT2 ($49,200) comes with a limited-slip rear differential (RWD only), forward collision warnings with all the safety features, plus a head-up display, a smart opening rear hatch, auto-dimming outside mirrors, Nappa leather, ventilated front seats, and 16-way power front seats with four-way air-cell lumbar support, two way width-adjusting side bolsters, and seat extensions.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55682" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-stinger-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Stinger is far from retro, although Kia designers were inspired by fastbacks from the 1970s, for example, they say, the Maserati Ghibli. It’s quite bold, with a long chiseled hood, sloping hatchback profile, and athletic haunches with short overhangs front and rear.</p>, <p>But what’s really impressive are the functional aerodynamic bits: wheel curtains with working vents, gills behind the front wheels to reduce turbulence, a belly pan with rear diffuser to smooth airflow under the chassis, and a ducktail rear spoiler. It all works. The coefficient of drag is a slippery 0.30.</p>, <p>That’s a lot of design detail, especially for the price.</p>, <p>The Stinger’s cabin follows along the lines of two of Kia’s near-luxury models, the Cadenza and K900. The quality of the materials is high: standard leather, including a thick leather-wrapped steering wheel, and big gauges ringed in metal. There are soft-touch surfaces everywhere, although some lower-cost plastics survive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55680" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-stinger-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-stinger-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-stinger-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The dashboard is black and wing-shaped, with contrasting metal trim. The infotainment system is like a tablet on the top of the dash, possibly copied from German cars, and below that screen there are three round climate control gauges. There’s also a color screen that speaks to the Stinger’s sporty mission, programmable to display performance data, such as G-forces and lap times.</p>, <p>The front seats are comfortable and supportive, with driver’s seat highly power adjustable including lumbar. The GT2 gets 16-way adjustment, plus heating and ventilation. And there’s enough legroom in the rear for a six-footer.</p>, <p>The hatchback fastback roofline reduces rear headroom, but affords considerably more cargo area than a sedan’s trunk, a vast 23.3 cubic feet. And with the rear seats folded down, the space increases to 40.9 cubic feet, as much as a small SUV.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55681" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-stinger-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is a fine engine that makes a decent 255 horsepower, but it can’t run with the turbo fours from BMW, Audi, Mercedes or Chevrolet.</p>, <p>The twin-turbocharged 3.3-liter V-6 is another story, offering responsive and smooth thrust with a refined howl. It can accelerate from zero to sixty in 4.7 seconds and hit a top speed of 167 mph. On the street, in Sport mode, the 8-speed automatic transmission delivers shifts that are quick and smooth, although not as sharp as a good dual-clutch, or even the best automatics.</p>, <p>Four drive modes adjust transmission response, as well as throttle response, suspension damping, stability control, and traction with all-wheel drive. They’re Sport, Smart (which learns your behavior), Eco, and Custom, which is configurable.</p>, <p>It’s no accident that this is the best handling Kia ever built, neutral and predictable. Kia hired the chief engineer from the BMW M series, who went straight to the Nurburgring for chassis development. He had a rigid body to work with, being 55 percent high-strength steel (Hyundai-Kia is also a steel company). The front MacPherson struts have an aluminum brace between them, while the rear subframe is stiffened around the five-link independent suspension.</p>, <p>The steering is direct, the cornering is stable, and the ride is smooth, even with the dampers in Sport mode. However the agility doesn’t match European standards.</p>, <p>In everyday driving with traffic, the Stinger mostly strikes us as easy: easy to drive, nice ride quality, easy to live with.</p>, <p>The GT features four-piston Brembo front brakes, adaptive dampers, and rack-mounted electric power steering with variable ratios. Kia boasts that the GT is at home on the track, but we found it to be hampered there. It’s a bit too heavy, the dampers aren’t firm enough, and the tires aren’t wide or grippy enough, causing the stability control to be intrusive. On the track there’s too much body roll at turn-in, making transitions awkward, and the transmission can get confused, even using the paddles.</p>, <p>The GT’s four-piston front rotors are a huge 13.8 inches and the two-piston rears are 13.4-inches, so they’ll never fade on the street. The 19-inch Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, 225/40s up front and 255/35s out back, shouldn’t give up there, either.</p>, <p>The rear-wheel-drive GT2 has a mechanical limited-slip rear differential, while all-wheel-drive versions get a torque vectoring system that brakes the inside wheels in a turn, to rotate the car. If we had driven the GT2 on the track, instead of the GT, our impressions might very well be different.</p>, <p>The Kia Stinger makes an impressive debut, with much to offer. The price for a full-tilt GT2 runs to 50 thou, but the base Stinger for $32k is equipped so well that it’s a terrific value. We can live with 255 horsepower in the four-cylinder, especially with the excellent 8-speed automatic and paddle shifters.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-acura-ilx/
[<p>The 2018 Acura ILX is a sporty front-wheel-drive compact sedan launched as a 2013 model and substantially revised for the 2016 model year. The ILX competes with the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA 250.</p>, <p>A new ILX Special Edition model is available for 2018 that affordably adds 18-inch alloy wheels, rear spoiler, and a body kit.</p>, <p>The ILX is a simple car, with one powertrain and just three models available. However, its simplicity makes it no less sporty, with a sharp 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and paddle-shifting twin-clutch 8-speed automatic transmission. It makes 201 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>Meanwhile the cabin is sweet, with contoured surfaces and instruments that are easy to read.</p>, <p>The ILX gets good fuel mileage, rated by the EPA at 25 City, 35 Highway, and 29 Combined miles per gallon, a bit more than the A3 and a bit less than the CLA 250. That’s on Premium gasoline. It’s recommended but not required; power and mileage go down when using Regular octane.</p>, <p>The NHTSA gives it five stars for crash safety, and the IIHS gives it top scores including in the small overlap frontal impact test, which very few cars ace. Acura’s available advanced safety systems were rated Superior, to give it a Top Safety Pick+ rating.</p>, <p>2018 Acura ILX ($28,100) standard equipment includes power moonroof, power driver’s seat, a multi-view rearview camera, and Bluetooth. The Premium adds leather, power passenger seat, dual-screen infotainment, satellite radio, blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>ILX also comes in Premium ($30,100), Technology Plus ($33,100), and the new Special Edition ($28,900).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55675" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ilx-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The ILX is clearly Acura, without being distinctive. It can’t be called edgy despite some sharp edges, down low at the bottom of the front fascia, and the rockers along the side below the doors. Its front bumper is V-shaped, following the V of the grille, and looks like a pointed chin; it’s a dated look that most of the rest of the Acura line has left behind.</p>, <p>The flat black plastic surrounding the round foglamps is dull and awkward. The 18-inch 10-spoke wheels are uniquely ugly, kind of like 10 legs with big feet on them, and look like they should be moving (not like they are moving) when they are standing still. They look better moving and blurred.</p>, <p>The instrument panel is basic and not so sporty, with a spare look to the plastic and vents; but it’s easy to read. The interior materials are fine, improved in 2016 along with the upgraded dual-screen infotainment system. The fit and finish is very good, but it would be nice if the materials showed more color and originality.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55676" height="160" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ilx-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Things are laid out neatly, comfortably, ergonomically and intuitively. It’s easy to operate the controls without taking your eyes off the road. Except, unfortunately, for the infotainment system.</p>, <p>Overall the cabin is quiet and refined, with fairly thick glass and standard active noise cancellation system that absorbs small but annoying sounds from the powertrain or road. It uses the sound system’s speakers, a cabin microphone, and a sophisticated processing algorithm.</p>, <p>The front seats are supportive and very adjustable for the driver. But Acura seems to be missing an opportunity here, because although there is a bit more headroom than most compact cars, there could be more if the seat adjusted lower, as appears possible.</p>, <p>In the rear, the ILX earns praise for providing enough leg room and knee room for six-footers.</p>, <p>The overall interior space is impressive, with plenty of room for small personal items. Unlike in the frustrating Audi A3, there are well-planned bins and cubbies everywhere. The 12.4-cubic-foot trunk can hold two large suitcases, or a large cooler, or even a wheelchair. The split rear seatbacks can be flipped forward for access to the trunk with extended space.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55677" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ilx-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The direct-injection 2.4-liter engine, making 201 horsepower, delivers strong and satisfying performance. It’s the same engine as in the next biggest Acura model, the TLX. Acceleration is smooth and linear, and we had no problems merging into fast traffic or passing on two-lane roads.</p>, <p>The 8-speed, dual-clutch transmission is the perfect companion, superbly responsive. It uses a torque converter for low-speed smoothness, while it shifts very quickly with the paddles yet not jerky, when driving the ILX aggressively, including rev-matched downshifts in Sport mode. In Sport, the ILX holds gears longer and downshifts perfectly when decelerating, providing some extra oomph.</p>, <p>The ride is pleasant, tuned more for comfort than cornering. It’s nose-heavy, which makes it a better choice for cruising and commuting rather than tackling demanding roads. The ILX has a weight distribution of a whopping 63/37 front/rear, compared with the near-50/50 balance of the BMW 2 Series or the 58/42 split of the Audi A3.</p>, <p>The ILX is reasonably quiet, with mild road noise on bumpier roads. Active noise cancellation picks up engine and road sounds from a microphone and pipes in noise-combating frequencies through the car’s speakers.</p>, <p>The A-Spec performance package with 18-inch wheels that are 7.5 inches wide, with very low-profile tires, improves handling. However, the low-profile tires make the ride harsh on bumpy roads. We got a lot of seat time in an A-Spec, and don’t believe the harder cornering allowed by these wheels and tires is worth the compromise in comfort.</p>, <p>The Acura ILX can be an enjoyable car, but limited in its appeal. The price is right, if you don’t expect anything special. The styling is common; the engine is quick enough but not thrilling; and the cabin is quiet, refined and functional, sweet for those things, but still mundane. The one exceptional feature is the superb 8-speed dual-clutch transmission.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>Fully redesigned for the 2018 model year, in accord with the more luxurious Lincoln Navigator, Ford’s biggest SUV gets a fresh look and aluminum-intensive construction. Blending the appearance of Ford’s crossovers, SUVs and pickup trucks, the 2018 Ford Expedition could be considered as essentially an F-150 pickup that happens to have three rows of seats.</p>, <p>We’ve found the all-new 2018 Expedition to be smooth and sophisticated both in ride quality and power delivery, with comfortable accommodations. It’s a good choice as a vehicle that can tow trailers and haul passengers, enjoyable for long trips.</p>, <p>The 2018 Expedition offers three trim levels: XLT, Limited, and Platinum, built on either a short or long wheelbase. Dubbed Max, the long-wheelbase versions measure an additional 9.1 inches, between front and rear axles.</p>, <p>Familiar to Ford fans, the latest rendition of the popular EcoBoost twin-turbocharged, 3.5-liter V6 generates 375 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque. In Platinum trim, the V6 reaches 400 hp and 480 pound-feet.</p>, <p>A new 10-speed automatic transmission was developed in a joint venture between Ford and General Motors. Rear-drive is standard, but each version can be fitted with four-wheel drive. Stop/Start technology is standard, as it is on most vehicles now, to improve EPA scores.</p>, <p>As always, the Expedition is one mammoth vehicle, boasting a cavernous cabin. Sharp steering and a fully independent suspension help make it feel smaller on the road. The improvement is especially noticeable when parking. Towing capacity of up to 9,300 pounds rivals that of some full-size pickup trucks.</p>, <p>An abundance of standard and optional equipment makes the Expedition’s price range broad.</p>, <p>Quite a few active-safety features are available, from blind-spot monitoring to full-speed automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Most safety items are optional, offered in groups, though some are standard in upper trim levels.</p>, <p>More than one hefty-priced package might be needed to equip an Expedition with adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, and lane-departure warning.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55665" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-2.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-2.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-2-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Expedition XLT ($51,695) and Expedition XLT Max ($54,385) come with rear-wheel drive, tip/slide second-row seats, power-folding third-row seating with recline, power driver’s seat, 18-inch wheels, heated power mirrors, cloth upholstery, Sync infotainment, pushbutton start, and rearview camera. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,195 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Four-wheel drive is included with the XLT 4×4 ($54,705) and XLT Max 4×4 ($57,390).</p>, <p>Expedition Limited ($62,585) and Max ($65,270 Max) have 20-inch alloy wheels, power running boards, and Sync with wi-fi hotspot. Limited 4×4 ($65,705) and Max ($68,400) have four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Platinum ($72,710), Platinum 4×4 ($75,855), Platinum Max ($75,400), and Platinum Max 4×4 ($78,545) get a 400-hp version of the V6 engine, 22-inch wheels, a panoramic roof, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55667" height="103" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-profile.jpg" width="200"/>Completely redesigned, the 2018 Expedition handily surpasses its predecessor, based upon exterior details and a substantially modified cabin. Although essentials of the chiseled-look F-150 are evident, they’re counterbalanced by the agreeable grace of Ford’s passenger-carrying crossovers.</p>, <p>Basically slab-sided, the overall design seems charmingly old-fashioned, yet freshly new. A dead-straight beltline complements the expansive greenhouse, helping to impart a sense of openness to the cabin. Headlights that suggest C-clamps look smoother. Taillights are LEDs, shaped like those on the Explorer.</p>, <p>Spacious, comfortable seats in all three rows, augmented by abundant cargo space, give the Expedition’s cabin high marks. Attractive materials and admirable build quality amplify its appeal.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55669" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Lovely upholstery stitching helps make the top Platinum edition especially worthy of praise. Still, its genuine wood accents and beautifully-stitched leather seem more appropriate for the defiantly luxurious Lincoln Navigator.</p>, <p>Fit and finish of the dashboard score highly, though it hasn’t changed appreciably. The center console holds a rotary-dial gearshift. Sync 3 infotainment beats Ford’s earlier systems.</p>, <p>Expansive front seats are enticingly padded. Second-row seats are nearly as comfortable and slide fore/aft. They can also tip forward to ease third-row access, without removing a child’s car seat. Tall doors make it easy to enter, too. Captain’s chairs (standard with Platinum trim) provide greater support as well as even easier third-row access.</p>, <p>As expected, extended-length Max bodies offer the most third-row legroom, but adults can find comfort in either version.</p>, <p>With all seatbacks upright, cargo volume totals 36 cubic feet in extended-length models, but only 20.9 for the regular version. Folding the third-row seatbacks reduces space to 79.6 or 63.6 cubic feet, respectively. Second and third rows fold down to create a fully flat load floor.</p>, <p>Driver visibility excels ahead, aft, and to the sides. A power-stowing function is available for the third row. So is a motion-activated liftgate.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55668" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-expedition-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2018 Expedition delivers a smooth ride and satisfying agility. It’s quite enjoyable to drive. It accelerates with a welcome degree of haste considering its mass.</p>, <p>Ford’s independent suspension helps ensure a favorable balance of ride and handling. So do the available continuously controlled dampers. As a result, handling is as precise as any vehicle of Expedition size and weight (roughly 5,500 pounds) can manage.</p>, <p>Winding roads induce a considerable amount of roll, dive, and squat. Even so, the Expedition responds predictably: highly controlled and inspiring confidence.</p>, <p>Electric power steering is weighted well, throughout the steering-wheel’s rotation. Reacting quickly enough, the steering feels natural, sometimes behaving as if a smaller vehicle is being piloted.</p>, <p>Shifting with a welcome degree of slickness, the new 10-speed automatic transmission helps the V6 engine stick close to the most efficient portion of its rev range. Gearchanges are so quick and subtle, they may not even be noticed. Upshifts and downshifts arrive frequently but smoothly, without hesitation.</p>, <p>Ford’s impressive twin-turbo V6 impresses mightily, never feeling short of power or suggesting any sense of struggling.</p>, <p>Four-wheel-drive models can be fitted with an FX4 off-road package, including a new Terrain Management System. Its drive selector adds Sand and Mud/Rut modes, along with Grass/Gravel/Snow.</p>, <p>Fuel economy has improved, but not by much. The rear-drive Expedition is EPA-rated at 17/24 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined (17/23/19 mpg for Expedition Max). Standard models with four-wheel drive are EPA-rated at 17/22 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined; the Max reduces each figure by 1 mpg.</p>, <p>To many observers, the 2018 Expedition qualifies as the new standard for full-size SUVs, hard to beat in functionality. An Expedition delivers all the expected features, along with some that surprise. Prices can rise swiftly by moving up the trim-level scale and adding options. For greater luxury, Lincoln has a comparable Navigator waiting for attention.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-lincoln-navigator/
[<p>The Lincoln Navigator received a total redesign for the 2018 model year. The 2018 Navigator is bigger and heavier than before, more powerful, and way more luxurious. The new Navigator is unapologetically big, brash, and loaded with luxury features. Glamour has returned.</p>, <p>As with the closely related, all-new Ford Expedition, the 2018 Lincoln Navigator is available in two lengths. The standard version rides on a 122.5-inch wheelbase and measures 210 inches long. The extended-length Navigator L sits on a 131.6-inch wheelbase and is 221.9 inches long.</p>, <p>Long-body Navigators come in Select, Reserve, and Black Label trim. Rear-wheel drive is standard on Premiere and Select editions. All-wheel drive is standard on upper trim levels, and an option at the lower end.</p>, <p>Lincoln’s 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine whips up 450 horsepower and 510 pound-feet of torque, teamed with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The related Ford Expedition’s V6 develops no more than 400 hp. The 6,000-pound SUV can reach 60 mph in less than 6 seconds.</p>, <p>Bountiful glass area gives the Navigator better outward visibility than GM’s full-size SUVs. Parking can be a tad challenging, because of the perpendicular front end.</p>, <p>Upper trim levels can be fitted with plenty of safety technology, but mainly in option groups. A safety package for Reserve trim includes forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, lane-departure warning, active parking assist, and a head-up display. Such safety features are standard on Black Label models. All Navigators get a rearview camera. Surround-view cameras are available for all except the Premiere.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln Navigator Premiere ($72,055) comes with rear-wheel drive, automatic climate control, 20-inch wheels, a digital instrument display, navigation with real-time traffic, 4G LTE data services, a power tailgate, leather seat upholstery, heated front and second-row seats, 10-inch touchscreen, Sync 3, and 14-speaker audio. A second-row bench seat can be substituted for captain’s chairs. (Prices are MSRP do not include $1,195 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Premiere 4×4 ($74,710) has all-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55659" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-navigator-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Navigator Select ($76,055) model gets 22-inch wheels, cooled front seats, surround-view cameras, illuminated power running boards, a heated steering wheel, and wireless smartphone charging pad. Select comes in Navigator L ($80,750), 4×4 ($78,710), and 4×4 L ($83,405) versions.</p>, <p>Navigator Reserve 4×4 ($81,205) and Navigator L Reserve ($84,405) have all-wheel drive, 22-inch wheels, a panoramic roof, second-row console, and heated/ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>Black Label 4×4 ($93,705) includes distinctive 21-spoke 22-inch wheels, CD player, 20-speaker audio, trailer tow package, and Technology safety pack. Three interior themes are offered: Chalet (snowy white), woodsy Destination, or vintage-blue/white Yacht Club. Black Label is available in the extended L ($96,905) version, also.</p>, <p>While sharing its basic profile with the Ford Expedition, Lincoln’s exuberant SUV differs sharply in body styling. A tall front end conveys a sense of drama, far beyond the previous model. Hints of current Land Rovers can be seen in the no-pillar bodysides.</p>, <p>Large headlights sit alongside an inset mesh grille. Upper models get LEDs. Body creases and corners recall Lincolns from the company’s past. Large taillamps stretch across the rear, while swirled-design wheels impart their own dramatic aura. So do the long chromed fender vents.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55642" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Spacious and lavish, the Navigator cabin approaches the spectacular. Glossy wood panels and a flurry of chrome trim attract the eye, while high-resolution display screens emphasize the practical.</p>, <p>Seating seven (eight with a second-row bench), the Navigator promises luxurious comfort and an isolating experience. Thick sound-damping materials help keep the cabin quietly tranquil.</p>, <p>Separating the wide, wide horizontal dashboard is a console that looks almost like furniture. High-definition displays dazzle the senses. A 12-inch screen with an excellent interface substitutes for conventional gauges. The infotainment system is less intrusive than those in many luxury vehicles. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity are standard.</p>, <p>Immense doors open wide for easy entry/exit. Power running boards also help.</p>, <p>Even the base model’s front seats are softly supportive, with just-right flexibility. Optional 30-way power seats provide exceptional comfort, with lower back and shoulder adjustments.</p>, <p>Second-row captain’s chairs should please larger passengers. Lower-end models can substitute a three-person bench that slides to ease third-row access. Six-foot-tall riders can fit into the third-row seats, enjoying a fair amount of legroom, though head space could be slightly limited.</p>, <p>With all seatbacks upright, cargo volume totals 19.3 cubic feet in the regular model, or 34.3 in the extended-length L version. Folding down second and third rows expands space to 103.3 or 120.2 cubic feet, respectively. A power-folding third-row seat and power tailgate are standard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55657" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-navigator-final.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-navigator-final.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-navigator-final-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Though gargantuan in dimensions, the Navigator defies some typical big-SUV expectations. For instance, developers sought road behavior approaching that of a mature sedan.</p>, <p>Ride/handling qualities reach well past GM’s biggest SUVs, imparting a lighter feel. In the fully independent suspension, adaptive dampers can subdue most harsh road surfaces, despite the 22-inch wheels on most models.</p>, <p>Size isn’t as much of an obstacle as expected. Adaptive electronic steering delivers some light driver feedback, while coping with massive wheels and a turning circle that exceeds 40 feet. Lincoln has modified Ford’s terrain-management system to improve traction control.</p>, <p>Emitting a throbbing sensation, Lincoln’s version of the corporate twin-turbo V6 is more powerful than the Expedition’s, unleashing a bounty of low-end torque. Downshifts from the 10-speed automatic occur frequently, but are seldom bothersome. Paddle shifters and a tow/haul mode can be used.</p>, <p>Gas mileage has shrunk, despite the updated powertrain. The standard-wheelbase rear-drive Navigator is EPA-rated at 16/23 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. The longer-body Navigator L alters that estimate to 16/22/18 mpg. With all-wheel drive, the Navigator is EPA-rated at 16/21/18 mpg.</p>, <p>The all-new Lincoln Navigator delivers supreme comfort and overall quality. Sumptuous interior materials and finishes fill the vast cabin. There is plentiful space for passengers, even more so in the longer Navigator L versions. Driving the new-generation Navigator feels like a special occasion, a trait that’s been absent from recent versions.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M.

[<p>The Porsche Macan crossover is the best-selling Porsche. It’s based on the Audi Q5, but it’s longer, wider, and lower, so it’s roomier. It looks like the Porsche Cayenne, but it’s six inches shorter on a wheelbase that’s 3.5 inches smaller. It technically seats five but realistically only four adults, as that center rear passenger must be very small, and even then won’t be happy.</p>, <p>The entry-level Macan uses a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 252 horsepower and a strong 273 pound-feet of torque. It can accelerate from zero to sixty in 6.1 seconds and reach 142 miles per hour.</p>, <p>The Macan S uses a 3.0-liter V6 making 340 horsepower; it can hit sixty in 5.0 seconds and reach 156 mph. The Macan GTS was new for 2017; it’s a high-performance version that takes the V6 and raises the horsepower to 360. It will do zero to sixty in 4.8 seconds and reach 159 miles per hour. Last but not least is the Macan Turbo, with 3.6 liters and a zero-to-sixty time of 4.4 seconds, top speed 164.</p>, <p>Every model is all-wheel drive with a bias toward the rear, and uses Porsche’s race-bred 7-speed dual-clutch automatic manual transmission.</p>, <p>The only new feature for 2018 is an embedded SIM card.</p>, <p>Fuel mileage for the base model is an EPA-estimated 20 miles per gallon City, 25 Highway and 22 Combined, which is low for a 2.0-liter four. In the Macan S and Macan Turbo it goes down to 17 miles per gallon City, 23 Highway, and 19 Combined, about the same as the Audi SQ5.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55638" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-final.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-final.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-final-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2018 Macan ($47,800) comes with leather and Alcantara seat upholstery, eight-way power seats, bi-xenon headlamps, 11-speaker sound system, power liftgate, Porsche Communication Management system, twin stainless exhaust tips, and a rearview camera. Things like adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitors are optional. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Macan S ($55,400) with its V6 engine can be distinguished by its four round exhaust tips.</p>, <p>Macan GTS ($67,800) gets gloss black window trim, a matte finish on the lower body, and satin black 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Macan Turbo ($79,200) has four square exhaust tips. One of its standard features is the ability to mate with Porsche Car Connect, a mobile app that enables remote unlocking, vehicle location tracking, and other data. So if your Porsche gets stolen and hidden in a freighter bound for Africa, Scotland Yard can track it for you.</p>, <p>There’s a lot of expensive available equipment and features for each model. For example, there’s a 16-speaker, 1000-watt Burmester sound system. And there’s a Performance Package for the Turbo that jumps the price to $87,700.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55639" height="151" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-walk.jpg" width="200"/>The Macan is smaller than the Cayenne crossover, and we think it’s even better looking. The roof has a more athletic slope, and the sculpting is smoother. The front air intakes scale down nicely, and the hood drapes over the front corners to make the big 19-inch wheels look clean. The tail is also tidy, with LED taillamps snug against the wraparound gate.</p>, <p>The Macan barrages you with switches, buttons, knobs, and rockers, more than two dozen of them on the center console, split by the shift lever. But if you imagine you’re a fighter jet pilot, it’s cool. And the alternative could be incomprehensible screens.</p>, <p>The console divides the driver from the passenger and reaches the dash just beneath a bright LCD touchscreen, with a high-resolution screen in the instrument cluster serving as a redundant display.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55642" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The trim depends on the model, from simple black and gray on the base, to piano black, to aluminum or carbon fiber or dark walnut. Porsche’s custom list can wear you out with decisions to make, with almost anything available to be painted, stitched, or trimmed to your liking.</p>, <p>The optional front seats are exceptionally supportive, as they should be with 18 ways to support you. Thick lumbar and side bolstering, with cooling as well as heating.</p>, <p>The Macan can’t match the Cayenne in rear headroom and kneeroom. The bottom cushion is low and short, so the rear passengers’ knees might hit the front seatbacks; and the sunroof drops the headliner down on the heads of those passengers. The bench folds 40/20/40, so that skinny middle can fold down and into an armrest, which helps.</p>, <p>With the rear seat up, there’s 17.7 cubic feet of space, as big as a sedan’s trunk; and with it folded, the cargo space hits 53 cubic feet. There’s storage below the cargo floor, as well. There’s a power liftgate, and to further aid loading things, get the available air suspension that lowers the car two inches.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55641" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-macan-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The impressive 273 pound-feet of torque in the 2.0-liter engine comes on at 1600 rpm and lasts until 4500 rpm. And zero to sixty in 6.1 seconds is good, maybe not Porsche great, but okay.</p>, <p>The Macan S gets 339 pound-feet of torque from its 3.0-liter V6. For this model, and the others, there’s an available Sport Chrono package that brings quicker throttle response and transmission shifts, not that the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission dithers.</p>, <p>The Macan GTS raises the horsepower of the S from 340 to 360. As for the Turbo, the larger 3.6-liter engine brings 400 horsepower and a massive 406 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>The base Macan handles beautifully, responsive and brisk into corners, and powering out of them with a touch of torque to the outside rear wheel. But if beautiful handling isn’t enough, and you have the money, you can upgrade with three-mode adaptive shocks, a torque-vectoring system to tighten the cornering lines, with an electronically locking rear axle differential that evens the power on the road. And adding the Sport Chrono package makes it still sharper.</p>, <p>The standard 19-inch wheels carry wide tires, 235/55 front and 255/50 rear, but you can size up to 21, or down to lightweight 18-inch wheels at no cost. We like that latter idea, believing that 18-inch wheels are big enough for a compact crossover, especially considering they weigh less, which quickens the suspension response.</p>, <p>The Macan Turbo brings scalding acceleration, effortless grip, and impeccable balance, while popping off a lot wastegate noise and a deep-throated exhaust note. It’s impossible to get it flustered. Paddle down and crank out of a corner, and it shuffles torque to the outside wheel after a moment of mild understeer.</p>, <p>The brakes are massive 14.2-inch rotors with six-piston calipers, same as the GTS and a half-inch larger in diameter than the other models.</p>, <p>That air suspension with adaptive shocks isn’t just for lowering the car to make loading heavy things easier; it also raises the ground clearance from 7.5 to 9.08 inches. So it’s pretty much necessary if you take the Macan off road, where, almost amazingly, it’s comfortable. All Macans have an off-road mode that reprograms shifting patterns and torque distribution at speeds up to 50 mph. And with 7.8 inches of ground clearance and hill-descent control, the Macan S will follow a Land Rover Range Rover Evoque into and back out of the nearest bog.</p>, <p>The air suspension also lowers the car by 0.59 inches for better aerodynamics and fuel mileage at freeway speeds.</p>, <p>The Porsche Macan really has no peers. You don’t have to go beyond the entry-level Macan, with its torquey 2.0-liter turbo four, quick 7-speed twin-clutch, and all-wheel drive. Add great looks, beautiful handling, and offroad ability. The other models with their bigger V6 engines do have a peer: the bigger Porsche Cayenne.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report; with staff impressions.</p>]

[<p>The Range Rover Sport is smaller and more nimble than the full-size Range Rover. The Range Rover Sport offers a third-row seat, but it’s tight back there. Think of it as a 5+2, not a seven seater.</p>, <p>The 2018 Range Rover Sport benefits from a new interior and is distinguished from the previous model with revised styling in front and updated electronics including new twin 10-inch touchscreens that control every function. The top one does infotainment, Bluetooth and navigation; the bottom one does audio, climate, and driving modes.</p>, <p>The Sport was redesigned for 2014 with a new riveted-and-bonded aluminum chassis, rigid and light, which transformed its handling to nimble, in a class of its own.</p>, <p>Land Rover calls the new two-screen system Touch Pro Duo. It’s unique, and the display is impressive, big, flashy. The function is slick, and simple after it’s learned.</p>, <p>The Range Rover Sport SE and Range Rover Sport HSE use a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 that develops 340 horsepower. The supercharged 5.0-liter V8 comes in two power levels. The standard 518-horsepower V8 powers Range Rover Sport Supercharged and Autobiography. The Range Rover Sport SVR unfurls 575 horsepower and 501 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>All models work with an admirable 8-speed automatic transmission that can include paddle shifters. Even the V6 promises a snarly sound and 0-60 mph acceleration in 6.9 seconds. That 60-mph sprint takes a mere 5 seconds with a V8.</p>, <p>The turbodiesel option uses a 3.0-liter V6 diesel that produces a muscular 443 pound-feet of torque. Acceleration is comparable to the gasoline V6, though not as responsive, and diesel owners can expect pleasantly quiet operation.</p>, <p>The V6 is rated by the EPA at 17 mpg City, 23 Highway, 19 Combined. The EPA rates the V6 turbodiesel at 22/28/24 mpg. The supercharged V8 is rated at 14/19/16 mpg no matter whether it’s 518 or 575 horsepower.</p>, <p>Safety features on all models include automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, rearview camera, surround-view camera (not standard on SE or HSE), parking sensors, parking assist, and automatic high-beam headlights. An optional Driver Assistance Package adds blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and traffic sign recognition that can display the current speed limit. Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have crash-tested the Range Rover Sport.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55632" height="147" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rrsport-final.jpg" width="200"/>Range Rover Sport comes standard with the 3.0-liter V6 engine.</p>, <p>Range Rover Sport SE ($66,750) comes with leather upholstery, power adjustable heated front seats, an eight-speaker audio system, USB and Bluetooth connectivity, dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, 19-inch wheels, and keyless ignition. SE Td6 ($68,750) substitutes the diesel powertrain.</p>, <p>HSE ($72,350) adds 20-inch wheels, a panoramic sunroof, upgraded leather seats, more adjustability for the front seats, blind spot monitors, an 11-speaker audio system, parking sensors, and LED headlights. HSE Td6 ($74,350) gets the diesel.</p>, <p>HSE Dynamic ($82,150) gets and additional 20 horsepower, along with 21-inch wheels, red brake calipers, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 22-way adjustable heated and cooled front seats, a 19-speaker premium audio system, and black exterior accents.</p>, <p>Range Rover Sport Supercharged ($82,050) features the 518-hp V8.</p>, <p>Autobiography Dynamic ($96,650) comes with the 518-hp supercharged V8 and soft-closing doors, three-zone climate control, a heated steering wheel, and 21-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Range Rover Sport SVR ($113,600) brings a massive 575 horsepower and breathtaking 0-60 time of 4.3 seconds. It comes with a sport-tuned air suspension, surround-view camera system, sport seats, exterior SVR accents, and better brakes. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55630" height="154" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rrsport-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Range Rover Sport’s tall, clean body lines and a wide stance convey a purposeful aura; it’s 2.2 inches lower than the Range Rover. Some of its design details come from the lines of the curvaceous Evoque. It has a sloped roof, stubby front end with nicely integrated headlights, smooth surfaces, and blacked-out roof pillars.</p>, <p>Hood and fender vents suggest the Sport’s capabilities. Roof pillars are blacked-out, wheel areas are prominent, and the rear end is short.</p>, <p>The SVR flaunts a more aggressive stance with its bigger wheels and tires.</p>, <p>The two big touchscreens with the Touch Pro Duo system are canted toward the driver. Lo and behold there are dials, two of them that control different functions for the menu selected. There is also a volume knob.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55631" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rrsport-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The top screen does infotainment, while the bottom screen handles the terrain management system. Chassis/drivetrain/engine modes are sport, comfort and eco; and off-road modes are snow, sand, mud, and rock or crawling. Each mode appears as an icon on the screen with its own beautiful tableau that allows deeper configuration, into the optional air suspension.</p>, <p>Both rows of seats are comfortable, and the cargo area is large: 27.7 cubic feet behind the second row, and 62.2 cubic feet with it folded. Optional third row is cramped as expected.</p>, <p>The fit and finish is excellent and the fittings top-notch. High-quality materials abound, whether leather, wood, metal, or plastic. If it looks like wood, it is wood. If it looks like metal, it’s metal. They all look great and feel good. Even the cargo area is attractively finished.</p>, <p>In front it feels just like the Range Rover, with a big view of the road, but the Sport’s seats are a bit more cockpit-like. The second row isn’t wide, so two passengers are more comfortable than three there. The outboard seats are sculpted and supportive. There’s a good 37 inches of legroom.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55633" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rrsport-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rrsport-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rrsport-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The supercharged 3.0-liter V6 is quick and responsive. It comes with 340 horsepower in SE and HSE, and 380 hp in HSE Dynamic. In the SE it will accelerate from zero to sixty in 6.9 seconds.</p>, <p>The turbodiesel V6 is only a hair slower, gets five more miles per gallon, and brings bulging torque of 440 pound-feet. And it’s quiet. Range Rover Sports (except SVR) are rated to tow up to 7,716 pounds, and the turbodiesel is the engine for the job.</p>, <p>The supercharged V8 makes the Sport flat fast. With 518 horsepower and 461 pound-feet of torque, it can accelerate from zero to sixty in less than five seconds, and with 575 hp in the SVR it knocks that down to 4.3 seconds. The SVR is loud and brash, sounding ready for the track. On the road it’s fully composed in curves, and turns long hours driving into comfortable excursions.</p>, <p>As for off-road prowess, the Sport can cross creeks that are up to 33.5 inches deep, scamper over rocks, then blaze through sand or mud. Ground clearance of 9.3 inches, coupled with wheel travel greater than 10 inches, ensures rough-terrain readiness.</p>, <p>Terrain Response 2, standard with V8 power and optional for the V6, provides seven modes for almost any surface (including Automatic), working transparently to deliver the greatest amount of traction. Rather than merely capable, the Range Rover Sport is among the easiest vehicles to drive under tough conditions.</p>, <p>The Range Rover Sport can do it all, really really well. It’s a hauler, sports car, off-road vehicle, and luxury liner. You can’t find compromises, except maybe it doesn’t look much like a Miata. There are other similar-size SUVs you could buy that will work, but the Range Rover Sport has no real rivals. If you want it all, the Sport is it.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection.

[<p>We’ve driven this generation of Range Rover in a Moroccan gale, over the Spanish steppes, and in miserable Atlanta traffic. Its composure has never lagged: always calm, cool, and collected.</p>, <p>For 2018, the sixth year for this design, Range Rover finally gives in and goes along. Two big touchscreens with flashy technology replace most of the hard buttons, switches and knobs.</p>, <p>Other 2018 changes include revised LED headlamps, more adjustment for front seats with optional massage function, and redesigned rear seats with exceptional comfort for outboard passengers, with long-wheelbase versions adding 7.3 inches of legroom, making the Range Rover feel like an SUV limo.</p>, <p>The Range Rover rides like a tall sedan, while being renowned for its offroad capability, with up to 12 inches of ground clearance and Land Rover’s effortless Terrain Response system, using four modes with sensors dictating traction. Meanwhile it can tow 7700 pounds of horses or boats, even racecars.</p>, <p>The entry-level Range Rover has a short wheelbase. The lineup moves steeply to opulence, with HSE, Supercharged, Autobiography, and SV Autobiography Dynamic models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55623" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rangerover-2.jpg" width="200"/>Every Range Rover is all-wheel drive, and uses a sharp paddle-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission built by ZF. Several engines are available. An all-aluminum supercharged V6 comes standard, making 380 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque. It’s EPA rating is 17 mpg City, 23 Highway, or 19 Combined.</p>, <p>Then there’s a 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel, making 254 horsepower and a bulging 440 foot-pounds of torque. It’s the best choice for towing. It gets an EPA-estimated 24 miles per gallon Combined, with a range of more than 600 miles, and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in a quick 7.4 seconds.</p>, <p>A supercharged 5.0-liter V8 making 510 or 557 horsepower comes on Range Rover Supercharged models. Both the 510-hp version and 557-hp get 14/19/16 mpg.</p>, <p>As with many luxury vehicles, federal and insurance industry crash-testing hasn’t been done on the expensive Range Rover. However the unique aircraft-like structure, bonded and riveted aluminum, is exceptionally stiff, and the safety equipment both standard and optional is bountiful. Every 2018 Range Rover comes with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warnings, parking sensors, and a rearview camera. Adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitors are fitted to HSE and higher trim levels.</p>, <p>The Range Rover V6 Supercharged short wheelbase ($87,350) is the entry model, available with the Td6 turbodiesel ($89,350). Standard equipment includes two 10.0-inch touchscreens for infotainment and vehicle controls, leather seats, and a 380-watt Meridian audio system. Also a two-hour off-road lesson from a Land Rover driving school instructors, and every instructor we’ve encountered has been great. Take that lesson, you’ll be very glad you did and it’s a waste of money if you don’t.</p>, <p>Range Rover HSE trim ($6700) upgrades with bigger wheels, softer leather, heated rear seats, panoramic moonroof, surround-view camera. 2018 packages include rear entertainment, head-up display, and active lane control.</p>, <p>The Range Rover Supercharged V8 ($104,850) is available with the short or long wheelbase ($4000 more). The Autobiography model has a heap of features ($141,995) and is available with the long wheelbase ($148,295). Also available are the SV Autobiography Dynamic ($177,200), with the long wheelbase ($207,900).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55620" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rangerover-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rangerover-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rangerover-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The short wheelbase Range Rover looks (and is) more balanced than the long wheelbase. Its profile lends itself smoothly to the box that it is, and looks more classic Range Rover, a box with curves and wraparound headlamps. It’s clean. You’d never mistake it for a Cadillac Escalade.</p>, <p>The long wheelbase brings more aero to the front, with a windshield very slightly swept back, behind new thin LED headlamps. Thanks to slim black pillars, the roof appears to float. The tail is ever so slightly swept up, with a split tailgate.</p>, <p>The cabin is beautiful. Leather and glossy wood on the lower models, softer leather on HSE trim, and semi-aniline leather everywhere on Autobiography. The front seats are tall and the glass low, so you feel like the king of the road, sitting above them all in luxury and isolation. The air suspension can be set at a step-in height.</p>, <p>The new 10-inch touchscreens handle everything; the only buttons that remain are for windows and hazard lights. Fortunately, there are steering-wheel thumb controls for some functions, namely audio. It takes a while to learn the touchscreen system, which responds quickly to taps and swipes. The top screen handles infotainment including audio, Bluetooth for phones, and navigation (convenient pinch and scroll); while the bottom screen is configurable for climate and vehicle functions such as driving modes. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Google maps are not available, however.</p>, <p>The front seats are hugely adjustable, with available massage. The rear seats are reshaped for 2018, with standard power backrest adjustment and optional heating, cooling, and massage. In the standard wheelbase Range Rover, the legroom is relatively tight; the long wheelbase adds relief, with 7.3 more inches.</p>, <p>An Executive Seating package for Autobiography models gives rear seats that recline 40 degrees, eight-way adjustable headrests, and a smartphone app that enables passengers to adjust their seats and rear climate control. However, that package cuts about 25 percent out of the cargo space.</p>, <p>There is no third row. The cargo area is thickly carpeted, but not so big with the standard wheelbase. There’s 31.8 cubic feet behind the rear seat (24.5 cubic feet with Executive Seating). With the long wheelbase, behind the front seats, with the rear folded, there is 75.6 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55622" height="300" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-rangerover-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The standard supercharged 3.0-liter V6 will push the Range Rover to sixty miles per hour in 7.1 seconds, with a slight supercharger whine and lots of low-end thrust with 332 foot-pounds of torque. The aluminum chassis and suspension parts, as well as sandwiched composite body panels, brings the weight down to 4700 pounds. The riveted and bonded construction brings aircraft-like rigidity and strength.</p>, <p>The turbodiesel V6 is only 0.3 seconds slower from 0-60, and gets five more miles per gallon. In the diesel, you can drive from New York to Los Angeles and only stop for fuel three times. It begins pulling like a train at 1750 rpm and tops out at 3500 rpm, the engine so under-stressed it could take naps. An awesome 443 foot-pounds of torque. It makes a bit of diesel noise when you hammer it, but it’s soundly insulated and otherwise totally quiet inside.</p>, <p>The third engine option is the supercharged 5.0-liter V8. If you want to take on your friend’s Cadillac XR with its supercharged 6.2-liter Chevy V8, this is your steed. It makes 510 beefy horsepower and hits 60 in just 5.1 seconds. It comes standard with Dynamic Response, with active anti-roll bars to control lean and firm up the cornering. And it still gets 16 miles per gallon Combined, just three less than the V6.</p>, <p>The SV Autobiography brings 550 horsepower, with sport-tuned chassis that makes the most of the Range Rover’s air suspension.</p>, <p>The Range Rover was designed to handle like a Bentley Flying Spur or Mercedes-Benz S-Class. It almost corners with the confidence of a sports car The steering is precise and quick, more direct and accurate than most luxury sedans. Advanced suspension with adaptive dampers and air springs, front control arms and rear multi links, variable-ratio electric power steering, help it feel smooth and languid, even without the tautness of Dynamic Response. Remarkably, the LWB model with seven inches more wheelbase, feels as responsive to us as the regular wheelbase.</p>, <p>The four-wheel drive is full time, with a 50/50 split. It’s the highest technology among all luxury SUVs, using the Terrain Response system. Low range will go to a fast 37 mph, enabling the Rover to climb monstrous grades. There’s more than 10 inches of wheel travel in front, and more than 12 inches in rear. With a ground clearance rising by 2 inches to 12.2 inches, it can drive through 35 inches of water. We see lots of Range Rovers in Australia, where floodways often flow 35 inches of water across the outback highways.</p>, <p>Terrain Response uses sensors to set the traction control, stability control, steering, suspension, and locking differential. The modes are General, Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud/Ruts, Sand, and Rock Crawl (with Heavy Duty package). You can leave it in General and forget it. The anti-roll bars can be disabled during offroad maneuvers like crossing over boulders, or other times when the demand for wheel articulation is extreme.</p>, <p>If you want your garage to be the home of the best British SUV made, buy the Range Rover with the V6 turbodiesel engine. We miss the classic instrument panel.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by The Car Connection. Words by Sam Moses.</p>]

[<p>This is the fourth year of the third generation of the Audi A3, which along with its similar-sized sibling the A4, is Audi’s bread-and-butter car. With Volkswagen Golf roots, the A3 comes as a four-door sedan, five-door hatchback, cabriolet, plug-in hybrid hatchback, and a powerful, well-balanced and relatively affordable S3.</p>, <p>The A3 saw significant changes for the 2017 model year, including a new 2.0-liter turbo engine with direct injection, LED daytime running lamps and a new MMI infotainment system, so for 2018 there are only minor equipment changes.</p>, <p>The engine in the A3 makes 220 horsepower, mated to an excellent paddle-shifting six-speed dual-clutch automatic manual transmission.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard, with Quattro all-wheel drive available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54695" height="136" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a3-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>The sporty S3 makes 296 horsepower, and competes with the BMW M3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA 45 AMG. The tidy A3 Cabriolet’s only real rival is the Buick Cascada, which is slightly bigger and slightly less refined.</p>, <p>The plug-in hybrid, called the A3 e-tron Sportback, is an upscale rival to the Chevrolet Volt, although the Volt has a real-world electric range. The e-tron is good for just 25 all-electric miles, but as a hybrid using fuel it has a range of 500 miles.</p>, <p>The 204-horsepower e-tron uses a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine mated to an electric motor powered by an 8.8 kwh lithium-ion battery pack that can be recharged in four hours, using a Bosch home charger that’s standard equipment. It weighs 500 pounds more than the sedan, but the engine/motor makes 258 pound-feet of torque, to keep it sprightly. It gets 34 combined miles per gallon, or an EPA-rated 83 MPGe, using the full electric range.</p>, <p>The A3 sedan with all-wheel drive gets 24 city, 31 highway, 27 combined miles per gallon; the Cabriolet gets 2 less mpg.</p>, <p>The NHTSA gives the A3 five stars in crash testing, while the IIHS gives its highest rating, Top Safety Pick+.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54696" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a3-cabrio.jpg" width="200"/>Standard equipment in the front-wheel-drive Premium for $32,150 including destination, includes dual-zone climate control, xenon headlamps, panoramic sunroof, leather seats, 12-way power front seats, satellite radio, Bluetooth, rearview camera, and automatic emergency braking. Heated front seats are $500. Apple CarPlay/Android Auto is $900.</p>, <p>The Premium Plus ($35,400) adds an S-Line body kit, keyless ignition with passive entry, heated front seats, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity, front and rear parking sensors, split-folding rear seats. A $3000 Technology Package that adds the Audi Connect telematics system, the MMI infotainment system with Audi Virtual Cockpit, and blind-spot monitors,. A $1,050 LED Lighting Package adds LED headlights/taillights. A 14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system is $950.</p>, <p>A3 Prestige at $41,100 includes the technology package and sound system, plus ambient interior lighting and adaptive cruise control with stop/go ability.</p>, <p>All three models have a $900 Sport Package that adds a sport suspension, sport seats, Audi Drive Select modes, and a flat-bottomed steering wheel with paddle shifters. Rear side airbags are $350.</p>, <p>Quattro all-wheel drive is $2700 to $3000 more. The Cabriolet is $6400 more, with standard leather.</p>, <p>The e-tron adds about $7500 each model of A3, but then there’s available $4502 in federal incentives to possibly subtract.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54692" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a3-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a3-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a3-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The grille and front fascia are fairly aggressive, and the LED daytime running lights look cool, even cooler with the optional LED headlamps.</p>, <p>The A3’s trim size and clean lines make it look classy, especially compared to rivals. It’s an inspiring design. The Cabriolet is even a bit smaller, at just 175 inches, and the power cloth top with glass window is cohesive with the package.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54697" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a3-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The attractively conservative cabin features a chunky steering wheel and simple horizontal dashboard with distinctive round vents. The 7.0-inch MMI infotainment screen rises atop the dash, with controls on the center console, including a touchpad that recognizes handwriting, but hasn’t caught on. An available high-rez LCD screen replaces the conventional gauges and can be set up with Google satellite view or images of analog gauges.</p>, <p>The materials are nice, including leather standard or sport seats. But both seats have short cushions, and legroom is tight for tall drivers. It’s cramped for adults in the rear. But Audi has gotten the most out of the A3’s small size, when it comes to interior room.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54693" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a3-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The VW/Audi 2.0-liter turbocharged engine is a winner, flexible and refined, either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The paddle-shifting 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission shift sharply, although you might hear a clunk at low speed.</p>, <p>Because the chassis (from the VW Golf) is rigid, the A3 gets away with a fairly soft suspension without ruining the handling. The electric power steering is light but direct. Road noise is high.</p>, <p>The suspension in the Sport Package can be stiff over expansion strips, but the seats have more bolstering to comfortable ride it out.</p>, <p>The heavier Cabriolet is a bit less zippy, and there’s some slight shake over bad roads, but it’s still nicely composed.</p>, <p>The battery pack in the Sportback e-tron is mounted low, which helps bring down the center of gravity thus improving the handling, to go with its quickness. An EV mode selects electric power for slow speed.</p>, <p>The size and shape is great, but the lack of rear legroom limits things, so the hatch is the only way to go. It’s hard to fault the powertrain, except maybe for the occasional clunk in the otherwise brilliant six-speed dual clutch automatic. You’ll never lack power from the 2.0-liter turbo engine. The Sportback e-tron hybrid doesn’t make much sense at 34 miles per gallon, which isn’t that much more than the A3 with a real engine.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with driving impressions by The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-subaru-crosstrek/
[<p>Redesigned for 2018, Subaru Crosstrek is the second generation of the diminutive crossover five-passenger hatch. With its superb all-wheel-drive system, a raised suspension, and Subaru’s rally experience, the Crosstrek is a good car for gravel roads, primitive two-tracks and nasty weather.</p>, <p>Based on the Subaru Impreza, the 2018 Crosstrek improves on the first-generation model, while retaining the basic formula of a rugged compact five-door wagon.</p>, <p>In fact, the 2018 Crosstrek boasts a new platform, slightly longer wheelbase, and raised suspension. Refinement has improved, and creature comforts are more appealing. Maximum cargo capacity has grown a bit, helped by a slightly wider hatch opening. More sound-deadening material has been added, helping to ease the Crosstrek toward the mainstream small-crossover/wagon category.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55605" height="111" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-models.jpg" width="200"/>At a glance, the reworked Crosstrek doesn’t look much different, however. And our first impression is of an old-fashioned car, with a traditional key, traditional handbrake lever, and a traditional clutch pedal to go with a traditional manual gearbox. The suspension feels soft, with lots of travel. It leans in corners, the nose dives under braking, the rear squats under acceleration. We like it and would choose it for wicked conditions or unpaved roads.</p>, <p>Three trim levels are offered: base 2.0i, Premium, and top-of-the-line Limited. Though the Crosstrek shares its basic structure and many body panels with the Impreza, it rides higher, with a ground clearance of 8.7 inches.</p>, <p>Subaru’s direct-injected 2.0-liter, horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine has gained 4 horsepower, now rated at 152. The flat-4 layout of the engine results in a lower center of gravity and a lower hoodline than is possible with a conventional, upright inline-4.</p>, <p>Most Crosstreks use a continuously variable transmission (CVT), now available in base trim. Crosstrek 2.0 and Crosstrek Premium models offer a 6-speed manual gearbox (previously 5-speed).</p>, <p>New Active Torque Vectoring helps control understeer when cornering.</p>, <p>CVT-equipped models include driver-selectable X-Mode for improved control on slippery surfaces.</p>, <p>A new multimedia system has gained Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capabilities.</p>, <p>In addition to a solid foundation, the Crosstrek may be equipped with Subaru’s EyeSight suite of advanced safety features. Optional for Premium and Limited trim levels with the CVT, the EyeSight group uses a forward-facing camera and includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, and individual tire-pressure monitoring. Limited models include blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Newly-available steering-responsive headlights can illuminate curves ahead.</p>, <p>Crash-testing of the 2018 Crosstrek by IIHS resulted in Good ratings for driver’s small overlap, moderate overlap, and side-impact testing.</p>, <p>Crosstrek 2.0i ($21,795) comes with manual gearbox or CVT ($22,795), plus 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, rearview camera, roof rails, and a 6.5-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $915 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Crosstrek Premium offers manual ($22,595) or CVT ($23,595) and adds heated front seats and mirrors, sound-insulated front windows and windshield, automatic headlights, and leather-wrapped steering wheel. More options are available, including the EyeSight safety suite and a moonroof.</p>, <p>Crosstrek Limited ($26,295) comes only with CVT and includes leather upholstery, Harman Kardon premium audio, pushbutton start, automatic climate control, power driver’s seat, an 8-inch display, steering-responsive LED headlights, and 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55606" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Although the rugged stance and profile of the Crosstrek haven’t changed much, its beltline is slightly higher. More black cladding covers the prominent wheel arches, as well as rocker panels and roof rails.</p>, <p>Most revisions are noticeable up front, with more hawklike headlights reaching into the fenders. Below Subaru’s signature hexagonal grille, the lower bumper contains more black plastic. Front pillars reach farther forward than before, improving visibility.</p>, <p>Subaru has integrated taillight assemblies into the hatch, widening the separation by some four inches. A concealed exhaust outlet accurately implies that Crosstreks don’t focus on performance.</p>, <p>Quiet and ergonomically improved, compared to its predecessor, the 2018 Crosstrek cabin ranks average for the small-crossover class. The interior cannot be called stylish or stimulating or upscale. It’s functional.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55609" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Horizontally laid-out, the dashboard reaches down toward the central console. Notable touches include contrast stitching and aluminum accents, offsetting the relatively dark interior.</p>, <p>Comfort isn’t really the Crosstrek’s principal mission, either, but in conjunction with greater refinement, it’s improved dramatically in the second generation. Front seats promise comfort for occupants of various body types.</p>, <p>Rear passengers can expect an extra inch of legroom, compared to the prior Crosstrek. Expanding body width by nearly an inch should help ease shoulder space, too.</p>, <p>Cargo capacity has grown to 55.3 cubic feet with the seats folded down (an increase of 3.4 cubic feet). With the rear seatbacks upright, it has shrunk slightly, to 20.8 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55608" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-crosstrek-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Despite its new form, the Crosstrek’s overall purpose hasn’t changed a bit. Subaru carries on with its familiar flat-four engine, capable transmissions, and proficient standard all-wheel drive system, all tucked into a five-door hatchback body.</p>, <p>Performance is sluggish. Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph takes something like 11 seconds, putting Crosstrek near the bottom of any performance chart. The engine feels low on energy. Highway passing can be a challenge, requiring patience and pre-planning, likely more so at higher altitudes. Throttle response is relatively quick, suggesting strong takeoffs, but actual acceleration is not.</p>, <p>Picking a manual transmission over the CVT doesn’t make an appreciable difference. Constant shifting of the 6-speed manual is needed, to keep the Crosstrek moving adequately. Clutch-pedal travel is long and shifting manually is not sporty in this car.</p>, <p>The CVT seems better at extracting the most from the 2.0-liter engine. Premium and Limited CVTs incorporate a 7-ratio manual mode, with simulated gears selected by paddle shifters.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive helps make the Crosstrek impressively sure-footed, augmented when cornering by the brake-based torque-vectoring system. Ground clearance of 8.7 inches makes the Crosstrek’s off-road prowess possible, as does hill-descent control with the CVT.</p>, <p>Ride quality has improved dramatically over the first-generation Crosstrek, helped by softer springs and damping. There is head-toss in corners, however.</p>, <p>Steering is quicker than it used to be. A dead spot in the center of the steering-wheel range likely helps highway stability, but some drivers might be annoyed by the need to make numerous minor corrections to stay on course.</p>, <p>Crosstrek is moderately fuel-efficient, notable given its all-wheel drive. With CVT, the Crosstrek is EPA-rated at 27/33 mpg City/Highway, or 29 mpg Combined. Manual shift drops the estimate to only 23/29 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Subaru has moved well ahead in available technology and passenger comfort, to rival the class-leaders. The base Crosstrek may offer the best value, but even a fully equipped model is priced sensibly. Not everyone needs the higher ground clearance, go-anywhere capability, but the rugged-look Crosstrek comes across as a step above ordinary small crossovers. This is a basic car for buyers who are looking for utility and value in a vehicle that can handle rugged roads.</p>, <p>James M. Flammang contributed to this report; New Car Test Drive editor Mitch McCullough reported from New Jersey, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV, built on a truck chassis, ready to tow heavy trailers, haul large amounts of cargo and/or small busloads of people. And it can withstand the abuse of rough, unpaved roads on a regular basis, something car-based crossovers cannot endure.</p>, <p>Except for addition of tire-fill alert to the tire-pressure monitor, standard Yukon and Yukon XL models have not changed significantly for 2018.</p>, <p>Close kin to the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and Cadillac Escalade, Yukon is a big, wholly traditional SUV, though thoroughly modernized. Equipped with a muscular V8, the Yukon unreels sufficient power to perform energetically on the highway, or tow a trailer with ease.</p>, <p>For 2018, Yukon Denali, the top GMC trim level, adopts a sophisticated 10-speed automatic transmission. Denali appearance has been revised for 2018, but the differences are modest.</p>, <p>Yukon XL is 20.5 inches longer overall than Yukon, on a wheelbase that’s 14 inches longer. Yukon XL offers much more third-row legroom than does the Yukon, making Yukon XL better for large numbers of passengers. The added length of the wheelbase, 116 inches for Yukon, 130 inches for Yukon XL, makes the XL a more stable platform for trailer towing. Yukon is the same length as the Chevy Tahoe, while the Yukon XL is the same length as the Suburban.</p>, <p>Unlike car-based crossover SUVs, Yukons are built using a separate body and frame and a solid rear axle. While crossovers can transport passengers more efficiently, the Yukon models are more capable of pulling trailers.</p>, <p>A Yukon can be equipped to tow as much as 8,500 pounds.</p>, <p>GMC Yukon and Yukon XL come in SLE, SLT, and Denali trim levels, with rear-drive or four-wheel drive. Yukon Denali versions are almost as luxurious as Cadillac Escalade, which echoes the Yukon’s construction. Chevrolet has no Denali equivalent.</p>, <p>In Yukon SLE and SLT, a 5.3-liter V8 develops 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque, driving a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Only the Yukon Denali gets GMC’s 6.2-liter V8, sending 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet to the new 10-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Like its Chevrolet counterparts, Yukon is the last SUV to offer the option of a three-place front bench seat, replacing the standard front buckets. The second row is less spacious. In a standard-wheelbase Yukon, the third row is surprisingly tight, but a Yukon XL third row is friendlier to adults, with 10 inches of additional legroom.</p>, <p>Yukons with front buckets include a special airbag meant to keep occupants apart during a collision. Several forms of collision-avoidance technology are available, including adaptive cruise control and automatic braking, as well as blind-spot monitoring and lane-departure warning. Low-speed automatic braking is optional for Yukon SLE, but standard on SLT and Denali. Full-speed emergency braking and adaptive cruise control are SLT/Denali options.</p>, <p>Crash-testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the standard-length 2018 Yukon four stars overall, but five stars in frontal and side impacts, and three stars for rollover protection (a calculated figure). That’s no surprise for a top-heavy SUV. The Yukon XL earned only a four-star score for frontal impact.</p>, <p>Yukon XL adds $3,000 to price of any Yukon model.</p>, <p>Yukon SLE ($49,080) comes with the 5.3-liter V8, rear-wheel drive, cloth upholstery, front bucket or bench seats, three-row seating, automatic three-zone climate control, 18-inch wheels. Four-wheel drive is available ($52,080). Yukon XL costs $3,000 more. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,295 destination charge.) An Enhanced Driver Alert package adds automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and active lane control.</p>, <p>Yukon SLT ($57,130), available with four-wheel drive ($60,130), adds perforated leather upholstery, heated front and second-row seats, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, pushbutton start, and power-folding seats.</p>, <p>Yukon Denali ($66,165), available with four-wheel drive ($69,165) includes the 6.2-liter V8 and 10-speed automatic, along with 20-inch alloy wheels and a magnetically controlled suspension. A new Ultimate Package adds power-retractable side steps, 22-inch wheels, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55597" height="135" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-yukon-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Still unabashedly boxy-shaped like its predecessors, the Yukon boasts chiseled styling, highlighted by cleanly conservative body lines. Cutting down on curves, GMC manages to give the Yukon a sense of flair, without making it seem trucklike.</p>, <p>SLE and SLT trim levels differ little visually. Swept-back headlights complement the boxy grille. Large LED taillights dominate the simple, squared-off rear end.</p>, <p>Every Yukon conveys a look that suggests a comparatively high-end vehicle. For better or worse, the GMC Denali is ladled with an abundance of chrome.</p>, <p>Yukon cabins are handsome and luxurious. Regular-length Yukons aren’t as spacious as might be expected.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55594" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-yukonxl-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Deliciously curvaceous and carlike, the symmetrical dashboard looks like it might belong inside a luxury-level sedan. An 8.0-inch touchscreen sits high, above logically laid-out controls that convey a hint of truckiness. Easy and quick to use, the infotainment system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.</p>, <p>SLT and Denali editions feature impressively-grained leather upholstery. Soft-touch materials abound, even in SLE trim.</p>, <p>All seats are comfortable. While the second row gives two passengers some elbow room, it’s wide enough to accept a third rider, at least for shorter trips. In standard-wheelbase Yukons, the third row is best for youngsters. In contrast, the XL provides ample stretch-out space as well as 39.3 cubic feet of cargo room. With its third row upright, cargo volume is only 15.3 cubic feet in the regular-size Yukon.</p>, <p>Relatively high liftover can make cargo-loading a bit of a chore. Folding second- and third- row seatbacks expand cargo space to almost 95 cubic feet in the standard Yukon, versus 121 cubic feet in XL models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55598" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-yukon-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Both engines promise strong performance, even when towing. Acceleration is well beyond adequate with the standard 5.3-liter V8, while the Denali’s 6.2-liter V8 delivers remarkably eye-opening response to the gas pedal. Considering that a Denali weighs about 5,500 pounds, that’s quite an achievement.</p>, <p>SLE and SLT versions provide the most comfortable ride, due in part to their high-sidewall tires. Even with its bigger wheels, the Denali also satisfies in ride comfort.</p>, <p>The Yukon’s weight is most noticeable on curvy roads, especially in Denali trim. Fortunately, steering is direct and accurate, and the body doesn’t lean too much when cornering. Magnetically-controlled shock absorbers in the Denali help counteract the effect of its bigger wheels. Smaller bumps are absorbed effectively, for a luxurious feel, but the suspension firms up when needed.</p>, <p>Sound emanating from the standard V8 is muted and refined. Both engines can run on half their cylinders in light-load usage, to help reduce fuel consumption.</p>, <p>No Yukon functions as a serious off-road vehicle, but optional four-wheel drive includes a low range that helps maintain traction on unpaved roads and trails.</p>, <p>For such sizable SUVs, fuel economy is reasonably good with the 5.3-liter engine, if more troubling with the Denali. Rear-wheel-drive regular Yukons are EPA-rated at 16/23 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. Four-wheel drive lowers those figures to 16/22/18 mpg.</p>, <p>With rear-drive, the Yukon Denali’s 6.2-liter V8 is EPA-rated at 14/23 mpg City/Highway, or 17 mpg Combined. Four-wheel-drive, short-wheelbase Denalis are EPA-rated 14/22 mpg City/Highway, or 17 mpg Combined; but 14/21/16 mpg for the Yukon XL Denali.</p>, <p>Denalis are the top sellers, despite their startling prices. Every Yukon is well-equipped, while the Denali approaches luxury grade. For most families, a crossover might make more sense; but many drivers still favor the feel of a big, rear-drive, traditional SUV.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection.

[<p>The Chevy Suburban can tow a heavy trailer, transport large numbers of people, haul a mountain of cargo, or stand up to rugged terrain.</p>, <p>If you’re transporting passengers on paved roads and aren’t towing trailers, a crossover SUV or minivan is a more efficient choice. Crossovers are lighter and get better fuel economy, but they don’t offer the Suburban’s capabilities.</p>, <p>Built on a truck chassis, with its body attached to a separate frame, and riding on a truck suspension, the Suburban can withstand repeated travel over rugged terrain and rough roads and it can haul large or heavy cargoes.</p>, <p>Suburban offers fuel economy that nearly matches that of the Chevy Tahoe, and the Suburban’s added length improves stability while towing and increases cargo capacity and passenger roominess.</p>, <p>Rally Sport Truck, or RST, is a new appearance package for 2018 with black trim and 22-inch alloy wheels available for LT and Premier models. The 2018 Suburban otherwise carries over unchanged.</p>, <p>With a nameplate dating to 1935, the Chevrolet Suburban began its 11th generation as a 2015 model with fresh styling and a refined cabin.</p>, <p>Its direct-injected 5.3-liter V8 EcoTec3 with aluminum block and heads was all new for 2015. It makes 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque. 2018 Suburbans come with a smooth six-speed automatic, but that may soon be updated with a transmission with more gears, to increase fuel mileage.</p>, <p>The Chevrolet Suburban’s only rival is the all-new Ford Expedition EL, a smooth, refined vehicle with a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that makes 365 horsepower, 420 pound-feet of torque, for a 9200-pound towing capacity. Brisk acceleration performance enables it to merge smoothly into fast traffic.</p>, <p>The Suburban is rated to tow up to 8300 pounds with rear-wheel drive. Larger engines and 2500-series versions are not available. If you want that, check out a Silverado 2500 Crew Cab.</p>, <p>Handling is impressive for a nearly three-ton vehicle, that is 224 inches long on 103-inch wheelbase. And the ride is smooth if firm, which contributes a lot to family happiness. So does the quiet cabin.</p>, <p>The Suburban gets an EPA-rated 15 City, 23 Highway miles per gallon with rear-wheel drive, a bit less with four-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55588" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-suburban-2.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-suburban-2.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-suburban-2-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Suburban comes in LS ($50,150), LT ($55,280) and Premier ($64,380) models, all with 5.3-liter V8 engine, rear-wheel drive, six-speed automatic transmission, and fold-flat second- and third-row seats. All-wheel drive is more ($3000).</p>, <p>Suburban LS comes with cloth upholstery, front bucket seats with 10-way power-adjustable driver and two-way passenger seats, tri-zone climate controls, AM/FM/CD audio, satellite radio, remote vehicle starting, rear view camera, rear park assist, manually adjustable second- and third-row seats. A front bench seat is available for three-passenger front seating.</p>, <p>Suburban LT upgrades with leather trim for first- and second-row seats, heated power front seats with memory feature, Bose premium audio, MyLink infotainment system, power liftgate with programmable height, lane departure warning, forward collision alert.</p>, <p>Suburban Premier adds heated and cooled front seats, fog lamps, HID headlamps, LED daytime running lamps, heated power side mirrors, power tilt/telescope steering column with memory, heated leather steering wheel, keyless entry, pushbutton start, power folding second- and third-row seatbacks, power adjustable pedals, 110-volt power outlet, 20-inch aluminum alloy wheels, blind spot warning, lane change assist, rear cross traffic alert.</p>, <p>Options include navigation, power-folding second- and third-row seats, power liftgate, cargo management system, Blu-Ray DVD entertainment system, and as many as six USB ports and six power outlets.</p>, <p>Safety features on all models include a safety alert seat that vibrates if the system determines the driver is at risk of colliding with another vehicle. A rear vision camera comes standard that shows the area immediately behind the vehicle on the audio screen, very helpful for hooking up a trailer. All Suburbans come standard with seven air bags, anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, trailer sway control, traction control. Bucket-seat models include a front center air bag that deploys from the inboard side of the driver’s seat and inflates between driver and front passenger for added protection in a side-impact crash. Also available: side blind-zone alert, lane-change alert, rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, crash-imminent braking.</p>, <p>The Chevy Suburban is unmistakable, a big two-box SUV, the traditional ‘Burb. Yet the angular aesthetics are aerodynamic. And there is some distinction, in a character line that runs the length of the body just below the greenhouse.</p>, <p>It looks better on its optional huge wheels, 20- and 22-inchers, than the standard ones, which are 18 inches. It’s all about proportion. The 18-inch wheels with taller sidewalls on the tires should offer a softer, quieter ride, however.</p>, <p>The upscale cabin of the Suburban is beautifully quiet. You can only hear the engine when you floor it, and then it’s a pleasant baritone that sounds almost distant.</p>, <p>The curved console counterpoints the angular exterior, but it doesn’t feel like a contrast because it’s so removed (as in distant) from the outside. The Yukon offers a nice head-up display that’s not available for the Suburban.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55587" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-suburban-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-suburban-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-suburban-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>It’s hard to find fault with the standard cloth upholstery. Leather is available, but it’s not as rich as the that in the GMC Yukon Denali. GMC goes deeper into luxury with the Denali.</p>, <p>Seating is flexible, with an optional front bench seat making it a nine-passenger, or optional captain’s chairs in the second row, making it seven. The standard second row and third row fold flat manually, and with power optionally. Despite all that length, 224 inches, adult legroom for the third row is still limited. Choosing the seating configuration is one of the most important considerations when choosing a Suburban. Keep in mind that captain’s chairs with a center console breaks up cargo space when the seats are folded down.</p>, <p>Throughout the cabin there’s useful space for small things, a bunch of cupholders, and a center console that can hold a tablet or notebook computer.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55586" height="111" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-suburban-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Chevrolet chassis engineers did a great job on the suspension tuning; handling is impressively quick for a three-ton bus.</p>, <p>For the 2015 redesign, they worked on increasing roll stiffness, so the Suburban leans less in corners. A vehicle this shape wants to lean, as mass will always have its say in the dynamic equation, but engineers found the right spring rates and antiroll bar thickness to limit body roll (lean) and enable rapid transitions. It helps that the weight distribution is close to 50/50.</p>, <p>The electric assist power rack and pinion steering is numb and relatively slow at 3.4 turns lock to lock. But even so, the Suburban is agile by big SUV standards, which gives the driver a better chance of staying out of trouble.</p>, <p>The ride is on the firm side, with spring rates needed to handle big loads, but they still keep away all but the sharpest bumps.</p>, <p>Braking is another strong suit. The brake pedal feel is firm, it’s easy to modulate pedal pressure, and the Suburban stops straight and true. We can’t testify to fade resistance, other than to say we failed to provoke any fade with a few hard stops. That might be different towing a load, but that’s what trailer brakes are for.</p>, <p>Smooth, exceptionally quiet, comfortable, capable, and powerful, the latest Suburban remains the big cahuna of family haulers. It makes the most sense as a tow vehicle. As a truck, it will stand up better to rough use than will a crossover SUV.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Chevy Tahoe is a comfortable workhorse that can tow heavy trailers, transport up to nine passengers, haul large or heavy cargo, routinely traverse rugged terrain, or smoothly gobble up miles and miles of Interstate highway.</p>, <p>Tahoe comes standard with a 5.3-liter V8 and a choice of rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, in five-, seven-, or eight-passenger configurations.</p>, <p>For 2018, Tahoe offers a new version of the base model that omits the third row of seats while offering desirable upgrades. The 2018 Tahoe RST Package (Rally Sport Truck) is a five-passenger model that includes a magnetic suspension, along with the option of 6.2-liter V8 or the 5.3-liter. Brawny 16.1-inch Brembo brakes also are available.</p>, <p>Last redesigned for 2015, the 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe lineup is otherwise largely unchanged.</p>, <p>Most models come with GM’s EcoTec3 5.3-liter V8 that develops 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque, mating with a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The Tahoe RST may be opted with a 6.2-liter V8 and 10-speed automatic transmission. The optional 6.2-liter V8 cranks out 420-horsepower and 460 pound-feet.</p>, <p>Unlike crossovers, Tahoes have a separate body atop a ladder-type chassis. A suitably equipped Tahoe is rated to tow as much as 8,400 pounds. Curb weight totals at least 5,600 pounds. Tahoe offers more ground clearance and its rugged construction and suspension enables it to endure routine pounding over rugged terrain that would wear out a crossover in a relatively short period of time.</p>, <p>EPA fuel economy for a 5.3-liter Tahoe 2WD is 16/23 mpg City/Highway, 15/22 mpg with four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Suburban offers nearly the same fuel economy, with increased stability for towing and greater cargo capacity, but Tahoe is easier to park and takes up less space in the driveway. Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL take the basic Tahoe/Yukon package and stretch it by about 10 inches for greater room.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2017 Tahoe four stars overall, but five stars for both frontal and side impacts. Resistance to rollovers earned just three stars, which isn’t shocking for vehicles with a high center of gravity.</p>, <p>Several advanced collision-avoidance features are standard on Tahoe LT and Premier models, and optional for LS. They include automatic emergency braking, active lane control, and automatic high-beams. In addition to audible alerts, the driver feels a buzz from the seat when a warning is issued. Adaptive cruise control is a Premier option.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55580" height="151" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-tahoe-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe LS ($47,450) comes with rear-wheel drive and the 5.3-liter V8. Standard features include rearview camera, 18-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, and wi-fi hotspot functionalist. A new Custom option omits the third row and substitutes 17-inch wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,295 destination charge.</p>, <p>Four-wheel drive is available for each trim level ($3,000).</p>, <p>Tahoe LT ($52,580) upgrades with leather seating surfaces, heated front seats with memory, Bose premium audio, a power liftgate, forward collision alert, and lane-keep assist.</p>, <p>Tahoe Premier ($62,130) comes with heated/ventilated front seats, HID headlights, navigation, 20-inch wheels, and magnetic dampers.</p>, <p>RST includes 22-inch wheels, special trim, and the option of a 6.2-liter V8, Borla exhaust and Brembo front brakes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55579" height="156" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-tahoe-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Tahoe is a full-size SUV, shorter than the Suburban. Crisp, clean body lines give Tahoe a timeless look. It’s an attractive vehicle.</p>, <p>In profile, it’s a basic two-box vehicle with squared-off lines. Details make the difference between today’s Tahoe and its predecessors. Up front, a chrome-laden grille, flanked by unusual partially split headlights, conveys an expressive appearance. Less detailing is evident at the rear.</p>, <p>The new RST model cuts back on chrome, in favor of black and body-colored trim.</p>, <p>Comfortable and carlike, the Tahoe cabin offers plenty of space for people and cargo, augmented by an appropriately upscale aura. Even the base LS model benefits from soft-touch materials, as well as stitched door panels and dashboard.</p>, <p>Swoopy in appearance, the dashboard is sensibly organized. Most controls are mounted high and are easy to reach and operate.</p>, <p>Front bucket seats offer supreme comfort, even for day-long drives. On special order as a fleet model, a front bench can substitute for the twin buckets.</p>, <p>Second-row seats aren’t quite so comfortable. Outboard riders can expect ample space and good support. The middle position of the 40/60-split bench is tight, but acceptable for short jaunts.</p>, <p>Optional twin captain’s chairs make it easier for passengers to reach the third row, which is more spacious than expected. Agile adults should have no trouble getting there, after using a lever or button to fold down the second row.</p>, <p>Choosing seating configurations is one of the most important decisions when ordering a Tahoe to ensure it best fits your needs. Captain’s chairs offer more comfort, for example, but the center console between them eliminates the large, flat cargo floor and prevents having a solid barrier of seat backs when transporting a dog or cargo. Bench seats, conversely, are more difficult to pass through when moving rearward.</p>, <p>Cargo capacity excels, totaling an impressive 52 cubic feet with second-row seatbacks upright. With all seatbacks raised, cargo volume sinks to 15.3 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55582" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-tahoe-towing.jpg" width="200"/>Tahoe drivers can expect to experience a traditional truck feel, but this sizable heavyweight doesn’t seem as antiquated as its traditional specifications might suggest: The Tahoe is a stable and supremely comfortable highway cruiser and it rides quite nicely on rougher roads.</p>, <p>Capabilities for towing beat crossover models. Properly equipped, Tahoes can tow up to 8,600 pounds. Tow/haul mode limits the transmission’s tendency to downshift too soon.</p>, <p>Measured against crossovers, cars that look like SUVs, Tahoe handling is best described as ponderous, though steering feels more precise than in the past. Ride quality scores better, because soft coil-spring suspensions cope effectively with large bumps. The smooth ride refutes the Tahoe’s pickup-truck heritage. Models with 17- or 18-inch wheels ride best, demonstrating good body control and a soft overall feel.</p>, <p>Not only is the Tahoe’s 5.3-liter V8 smoothly powerful, it sounds strong and rich, mating neatly with the 6-speed automatic. In low-load conditions, the V8 can run using only half of its cylinders, to improve highway fuel economy.</p>, <p>Tahoe handles rugged terrain well, especially in terms of durability. It can handle routine travel on gravel roads and two tracks. For more challenging terrain, its size can become a challenge, however. Optional four-wheel drive can be upgraded with a two-speed transfer case, useful for mud and steep grades.</p>, <p>Tahoe RST offers a tauter suspension, bigger Brembo brakes, and more potent V8, giving it a tuner feel. Over lumpy terrain, GM’s Magnetic Ride Control improves ride quality while tightening handling.</p>, <p>For such a large vehicle, fuel economy isn’t bad. With rear-wheel drive, the 2018 Tahoe is EPA-rated at 16/23 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. Four-wheel drive drops the estimate to 16/22/18 mpg. The newly optional 6.2-liter V8 guzzles Premium-grade gasoline. With rear-wheel drive, the Tahoe RST is EPA-rated at 14/23 mpg City/Highway, or 17 mpg Combined. Four-wheel drive reduces the RST estimate to 14/22/17 mpg.</p>, <p>The Chevrolet Tahoe is highly capable at towing and hauling and travel over rugged roads. Tahoe models are equipped well and are comfortable for long trips.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M.

[<p>All new for 2018, Lexus LS has been totally redesigned. The new Lexus LS 500 is related to the recently launched LC coupe. Stressing unabashed luxury, the all-new Lexus LS echoes the model that first challenged German automakers with a top-level luxury car from a Japanese marque.</p>, <p>Lexus fills its top sedan with opulent details, such as crystal trim, while edging into fresh design territory. Rather than near-silence, LS buyers can opt for simulated engine sounds. A new 10-speed automatic transmission goes into the gas-engine LS 500, while the LS 500h hybrid gets an ingenious CVT/4-speed transmission.</p>, <p>Built upon a stretched version of the LC coupe platform, the LS 500 is slightly longer than its predecessor, more tapered, with broader glass area. Fractionally lower, it promises improved weight distribution. It is not intended to be as sporty as the LC, focusing instead on luxury.</p>, <p>A short-wheelbase model is no longer part of the LS picture. Also gone is the previous V8 engine, thrust aside by a new twin turbocharged V6.</p>, <p>Three versions are available: LS 500 with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive; LS 500 F Sport; and LS 500h hybrid.</p>, <p>The new 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 generates 416 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque, working with the new 10-speed.</p>, <p>The LS 500h hybrid mates a 3.5-liter V6 mates with two electric motors, for total combined output of 354 horsepower. A uniquely developed 4-speed transmission blends with a continuously variable unit. One electric motor propels the sedan at low speeds. A second motor adds power at higher speeds. Paddle shifters are included, and the 4-speed/CVT provides 10 forward speeds.</p>, <p>Located beneath the back seat, the 44-kWh lithium-ion battery pack generates 1.1 kilowatt-hours of power. The LS 500h can operate on battery power, but for no more than a couple of miles. Acceleration to 60 mph takes just 5.1 seconds with rear-drive.</p>, <p>Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested the LS sedan.</p>, <p>A group of valuable safety features is standard, including forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure alert, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams. The driver can set lane- and speed-control, then remove hands from the steering wheel for 5 seconds.</p>, <p>An optional Advanced Safety package adds pedestrian detection with active steering and front cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus LS 500 ($75,000) comes with rear-wheel drive, leather upholstery, navigation, 12-speaker audio with Bluetooth streaming, active noise cancellation, and 19-inch wheels. It comes with the twin-turbocharged V6 engine and 10-speed automatic. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>LS 500 AWD ($79,215) adds all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>LS 500h ($79,510) is similar to LS 500, but with hybrid powertrain. It’s also available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive ($82,730).</p>, <p>LS 500 F Sport ($81,000) gets distinctive exterior trim, special 20-inch wheels, firmly padded 28-way power seats, suede headliner, and aluminum pedals. A movable gauge reveals additional performance data. It comes with the twin-turbo V6 and rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive ($84,220)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55575" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ls500-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ls500-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ls500-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Boldly compelling styling of the 2018 LS 500 makes a clean break from the staid past. Lexus has borrowed some luscious design cues from its new LC 500 coupe, sailing past customary boundaries in the process.</p>, <p>While the coupe is suggestive of Aston Martin flair, the LS sedan conveys a more elegant character, topped by a long, tapered roofline. Teardrop-shaped side windows sit behind the rear doors.</p>, <p>Z-shaped headlights flank a huge hourglass-shaped grille, similar to other Lexus models. Each LS version gets a different grille texture, featuring hundreds of gleaming facets. LED taillights mark the tall rear end.</p>, <p>Extravagance is a byword for the asymmetric LS cabin, from ambient lighting to dark hardwoods and aluminum trim, even cut glass and quilted fabrics. Door panels feature curved stitching, complemented by free-floating door handles and armrests.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55572" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ls500-interior.jpg" width="200"/>An air suspension can ease entry/exit, raising the car more than an inch. Heated/cooled front seats can move 28 ways, and provide massage functions. In the F Sport, heavily sculptured seats might be snug for wider physiques.</p>, <p>Even in standard form, rear-seat space is abundant for three riders. An optional Executive package, targeting the chauffeur-driven market, provides even greater stretch-out space for two occupants. Extras include four-zone climate control, 22-way heated/cooled rear seats, and a right-side seat with a raised ottoman, backrest recline, and easy-access mode.</p>, <p>A touchpad controls audio and climate functions on the low-sitting, slightly off-balance dashboard, with its narrow cluster of gauges. All LS sedans come with a 12.3-inch display screen, but the infotainment system is among the clumsiest. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are unavailable.</p>, <p>Trunk space is good, measuring 17 cubic feet for the LS 500 and 15.2 cubic feet for the hybrid. Plenty of rear glass and a low beltline help provide good visibility.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55573" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-ls500-2.jpg" width="200"/>Ride control is especially good in the F Sport’s continuously adaptive setup, permitting little body lean when cornering. Run-flat tires on the F Sport results in a rumbling ride and bounding over some bumps. Through long undulations, in contrast, the air springs yield pleasurable softness. The steering lacks precision as well as feel and weightiness. However, road manners are excellent, overall, with the adaptive setup.</p>, <p>Rear-wheel steering on the F Sport reduces the turning circle, easing maneuverability. The driver can select Eco, Normal, Comfort, Custom, Sport, or Sport+ mode. When in Sport or Sport+ mode, amplified engine sounds are pumped into the cabin.</p>, <p>Acceleration to 60 mph in an LS 500 takes just 4.6 seconds. Lexus claims the 10-speed transmission shifts as promptly as a dual-clutch unit.</p>, <p>The hybrid performs nearly as well as the gas-engine model and handling differences between the LS 500 and LS 500h are barely discernible. The amplified engine noise is more bothersome in the LS 500h, however.</p>, <p>Because LS sedans are heavyweights, gas mileage inevitably suffers, but the hybrid should be quite thrifty. The EPA has not yet issued fuel-economy estimates. Lexus predicts the rear-drive LS 500h hybrid will earn about 28 mpg in combined city and highway driving. For the standard LS 500, Lexus predicts 23 mpg combined.</p>, <p>With its more opulent cabin and greater interior space, the latest LS transcends its predecessors. In addition to outstanding fit and finish, the LS 500 line promises fine seat comfort front and rear, plenty of storage space, lots of luxury, and a sizable helping of current technology.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection.

[<p>Introduced for the 2017 model year, the full-size GLS SUV served as a successor to Mercedes-Benz’s GL-Class model. Apart from a new front end, the still-boxy GLS differed little from its GL predecessor.</p>, <p>Unchanged for 2018 except for an additional 19-inch wheel choice, the GLS carries on its traditional, old-school approach to SUV design. Rather than attempt to conceal its squarish profile, the GLS appears to relish its role as a delightfully charming three-row people-carrier.</p>, <p>A new trim level will be available in summer 2018: The Grand Edition will offer high-end leather interiors and unique 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Mercedes-Benz offers three models: GLS 450 with a V6, GLS 550 with V8 power, and high-performance Mercedes-AMG GLS 63, packing a 577-horsepower twin-turbo V8 that issues 561 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is standard on all three.</p>, <p>In the GLS 450, the twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 develops 362 horsepower, driving a 9-speed automatic transmission that’s ready to deliver brisk acceleration. The same 9-speed transmission serves the GLS 550, whose 4.7-liter V8 generates 449 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55565" height="148" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-gls-amg.jpg" width="200"/> To handle all the power of the 5.5-liter V8 in the AMG GLS 63, a tough 7-speed automatic is installed. Not many GLS buyers are likely to opt for the AMG variant, with its 4.5-second 0-60 mph acceleration time, but it’s still a welcome addition to the lineup.</p>, <p>No one is likely to be surprised by the GLS’s impressive all-weather capability, or its overall cargo-hauling talents. Compensation for crosswinds is programmed into the GLS. The driver-attention monitor displays a coffee cup as a warning, when sensors determine that the driver may be getting drowsy.</p>, <p>In addition to all the panache that’s provided by Mercedes-Benz’s big luxury SUV, the GLS boasts plenty of available safety technology. Forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking is standard, along with a rearview camera. Safety options include blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control with steering assist, active lane control, and traffic-sign-based speed warnings.</p>, <p>Safety ratings are absent, because neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested the GLS.</p>, <p>Even though the GLS doesn’t promise off-pavement prowess to rival Range Rover models, it can be fitted with such features as navigation, high-end audio, premium leather upholstery and wood trim, and an Off-Road package. On the infotainment front, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS 450 ($69,550) comes with V6 engine, 4MATIC all-wheel drive, automatic climate control, power driver’s seat, power tailgate, remote start, cruise control, COMAND infotainment interface with 8.4-inch display screen, and synthetic leather upholstery. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>GLS 550 ($94,950) substitutes a 4.7-liter, 449-horsepower V8 for the V6 engine, adding 21-inch wheels.</p>, <p>AMG GLS 63 ($125,300), the hottest performance, boasts a 577-horsepower V8, along with specific body components and wheels.</p>, <p>Options for the GLS 450 include surround-view cameras, Bang &amp; Olufsen audio, cooled front seats, heated power second-row seats, and a panoramic sunroof. An Off-Road package adds a reduction gear and locking center differential.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55568" height="105" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-gls-profile.jpg" width="200"/>While other SUVs feature curves and flowing surfaces, the GLS leans toward right angles. In profile, it has the look of a wagon, but it’s less noticeable at any other angle.</p>, <p>Up front, large LED headlights flank a huge Mercedes-Benz logo, tucked within a wide grille. Farther rearward, the squared-off GLS body is largely the same as that of its GL-Class predecessor.</p>, <p>Depending upon the model, body details very. The GLS 550 wears flared wheel wells, above 21-inch rubber. The AMG GLS 63 gets a distinctive body kit.</p>, <p>As many as seven adult passengers can ride in a GLS without feeling cramped. In every direction, space is abundant. Seating is flexible and trim ranks as opulent. Today’s interior has a warmer feel than earlier models, with large wood panels and a big display screen atop the dashboard’s center.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55567" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-gls-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Up front, seats are nicely bolstered and heated, power-adjustable in multiple directions. Options include seat cooling, adjustable bolsters, and four-mode massaging.</p>, <p>Large door openings ease entry into the second row, where seats can be heated and powered. Three persons can occupy the middle row, though two would be more content. Second-row seats fold and slide out of the way, using either a handle or power button. Six-foot passengers can find comfort in the third row, once they reach that position.</p>, <p>Behind the third row, cargo volume totals a modest 16 cubic feet. Folding that bench raises cargo space to 49.4 cubic feet. Second-row seats can also be folded down, for a total of 93.8 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Large round digital gauges are separated by an information panel. A digital display for COMAND infotainment sits on the dashboard, but the system is cumbersome and confusing.</p>, <p>Generally quiet and composed, the GLS permits little wind noise, despite its tall profile and large mirrors.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55564" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-gls-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-gls-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-gls-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>At a glance, the uninitiated observer might dismiss the immense GLS as one more oversize SUV. Instead, it warrants consideration for its powertrain selection, ride quality, and off-road capability.</p>, <p>All three versions handle well, though the experience might feel a bit strange initially, due to the GLS’s long, tall body and 8.5-inch ground clearance. Behaving with sport-wagon finesse, the GLS feels like a smaller vehicle, giving the driver a sense of being fully in charge. With standard wheels, the steering feels just about right: neither loose nor light. With variable-ratio steering, response differs at low speeds.</p>, <p>Qualifying as an unabashed heavyweight, the GLS delivers a poised ride, typically buttery-smooth, as the air suspension subdues nearly all rough spots on the pavement. Optional low-profile tires could make the ride a tad jiggly.</p>, <p>Adaptive anti-sway bars struggle to cope with shifting terrain – a challenge with any tall, heavy vehicle. If installed, the optional Active Curve system presses down on anti-sway bars to counterbalance body lean.</p>, <p>Acceleration ranges from strong to scalding, depending on model, though turbo lag may be noticed. The 9-speed transmission might feel excessively “busy” when entering a freeway ramp or conquering a steep, sharp corner. Selectable drive modes tailor traction systems as needed, while manipulating the steering, drivetrain, and adaptive suspension.</p>, <p>Gas mileage wins little praise. The base GLS 450 is EPA-rated at 17/22 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. GLS 550 fuel economy falls to 14/19/16 mpg. The Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 is EPA-rated at a dismal 13/18 mpg City/Highway, or 15 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz GLS competes against Range Rovers, Lexus LX, and Cadillac Escalade, so compelling features and premium-level details are the rule. The GLS checks all the boxes. It is equipped well, hauls passengers and cargo luxuriously, and offers excellent capability in all types of weather.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M.

[<p>Plus-sized inside and out, the Lexus LX 570 possesses all the characteristics of a traditional SUV. Built with a separate body and frame, it’s about as spacious as the Toyota Land Cruiser that provides its foundation. But Lexus goes the luxury route and the LX 570 comes loaded with leather and wood.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year, Lexus’s Enform Safety Connect and Service Connect are complimentary for 10 years (previously one year). Otherwise, apart from one new body color, nothing has changed.</p>, <p>Joyfully old-fashioned yet modern, the lavishly equipped LX boasts first-class finishes. Like its close cousin, the Toyota Land Cruiser, it promises big V8 power, but cumbersome handling. In effect, Lexus started with the practical-minded Land Cruiser, layering on leather upholstery and wood trim, behind a huge chrome-laden grille. At the finish line is a luxury truck.</p>, <p>Toyota’s 5.7-liter V8 develops 383 horsepower and 403 pound-feet of torque, sending its power to an 8-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel drive. Acceleration to 60 mph is accomplished in a brisk 7.3 seconds. Abysmal fuel economy is the price to be paid, estimated at 15 mpg in Combined city/highway driving.</p>, <p>A 5-inch addition to the nose makes the LX longer than its Toyota counterpart. Even so, the LX is nearly as masterful off-road as a Land Cruiser. An electro-hydraulic height-adjustment system can raise or lower the vehicle 2 inches. Five-mode traction control can select optimum operation on various road surfaces, from loose dirt to mud to snow and ice.</p>, <p>In its crash-testing program, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the LX a four-star rating for frontal impact. No ratings have been issued for overall crash protection, or for side-impact testing. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested the LX 570.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, Lexus made a bundle of advanced safety technology standard. The safety group includes forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic high beams. Ten airbags and a rearview camera are standard. A front-end camera gives a 180-degree view of obstacles ahead.</p>, <p>Lexus’s Enform system with Bluetooth connectivity is standard. A telematics system provides emergency notification services.</p>, <p>The Lexus LX 570 ($89,980) comes with the 5.7-liter V8, 8-speed automatic transmission, four-wheel drive, 20-inch wheels, LED headlights, 14-way power driver’s seat, 12-way front passenger seat, power-folding third-row seat, pushbutton start, moonroof, 9-speaker audio, and navigation with a 12.3-inch screen. Technology features include automatic parking assistance and a selection of hardware and software to enhance off-road capabilities on any terrain. (Prices are MSRP and do not include the $1,195 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Options include DVD rear entertainment, 19-speaker Mark Levinson audio, 21-inch wheels, and a head-up display.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55558" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-lx570-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Lexus clearly sought to make its version of the traditional SUV look different from Toyota’s Land Cruiser, despite the nearly-identical underpinnings. The foremost difference is up front, at the lengthened nose. As on other current Lexus models, the oversized, insolent hourglass-shaped spindle grille is a feature than cannot be overlooked.</p>, <p>Few observers are likely to call the front end beautiful. Some find it annoying, though it undeniably gives the LX a distinguishing character. Like it or hate it, the tall grille dominates the front end and establishes a pattern for overall visual cues.</p>, <p>Viewed from the side or rear, the LX has a pleasant, imposing shape with squarish corners and large integrated taillights. The split tailgate has an upper hatch, above a fold-down section that can be used as a temporary bench seat at outdoor events.</p>, <p>Lavishly appointed, the stunning cabin retains the look and near-silence of a library. Luscious leather and open-pore wood, in profuse quantity, enhance the subdued and subtle aura of elegance. Lovely fit-and-finish helps separate the plush LX from the more prosaic Land Cruiser.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55560" height="193" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-lx570-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Climbing into the LX isn’t so easy. Because this SUV is intended to tackle tall obstacles, quite an upward step is needed.</p>, <p>Five adults get plenty of space. The driver faces a high, commanding view of the road. Generously-proportioned seats feel supportive and soft.</p>, <p>Seats are less sculpted in the second row, Fitted with 40/20/40-split seatbacks, they slide 3.5 inches fore/aft, to apportion space between passengers and cargo.</p>, <p>While the front two rows promise nearly ideal comfort, the unappealing third-row seat is short on space. Far-back riders must be small or young. Even then, it’s tiny and cramped.</p>, <p>A foldaway mechanism raises and rotates the third-row seats toward the bodysides, opening up a cargo space that’s quite narrow. Seats cannot be removed, and the cargo floor is rather high.</p>, <p>Cargo volume totals only 9.1 cubic feet behind the rear seat, growing to 24.8 cubic feet if those seatbacks are folded down. A split tailgate includes a powered upper door.</p>, <p>The dashboard is loaded with buttons and knobs. Many of them control the off-roading technology. Because they’re so numerous, the control layout conveys a rather haphazard look.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55557" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-lx570-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-lx570-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-lx570-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Like its Land Cruiser sibling, the luxurious LX excels off-road, with substantial wheel travel and plenty of ground clearance. Still, the LX brand of off-roading has more in common with crossover SUVs than with hard-duty workhorses, such as Jeeps.</p>, <p>A group of console-mounted switches is used only occasionally, but they give the LX impressive capabilities on roads of all kinds. Weighing three tons, the LX cannot slip between rough-country obstacles as readily as a narrower SUV, such as Lexus’ own GX.</p>, <p>Ride comfort is another area where the LX stands tall. Suffering only slight loss in off-road ability, compared to the Land Cruiser, the Lexus version beats Toyota’s on paved surfaces. Its weight can be a benefit in coping with potholes, allowing the suspension to absorb surface flaws.</p>, <p>Even though a relatively low front bumper limits approach angles, the LX maintains traction admirably on various terrains. The four-wheel-drive system splits power 40/60 (front/rear), via a locking differential. Crawl-control lets the LX ease through mushy pathways. Traction control hinders opposing wheels to shrink the turning radius, improving maneuverability on narrow trails. Body lean, as expected, is inevitable when cornering.</p>, <p>As for acceleration, the big V8 provides exceptional thrust for such a heavyweight. An LX can pass comfortably on the highway, without using all the available power.</p>, <p>The Lexus LX ranks among the least fuel-efficient vehicles on the market, EPA-rated at a gas-guzzling 13/18 mpg City/Highway, or 15 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Big V8 power is terrific for towing and promises reserve vigor for serious off-roading, but expansive dimensions inevitably impede maneuverability. While the cabin is pleasantly plush and amply equipped, the Lexus LX doesn’t match the opulence or true luxury of a Range Rover.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-land-cruiser/
[<p>For six decades, the Land Cruiser has served as Toyota’s traditional, full-size SUV. Supremely capable off-road, powered by a big V8, the SUV is built on a truck foundation, with a separate body.</p>, <p>Following a substantial freshening for 2016, the Land Cruiser is little-changed for the 2018 model year. The rear-seat entertainment system, formerly standard, is now an option. Outside mirrors now fold inward as the vehicle is locked.</p>, <p>Undeniably reflecting the past, but brought up to date with technology, today’s Land Cruiser clearly cannot match most rivals in on-pavement motoring. Off-road, on the other hand, it’s ready to demonstrate a passel of capabilities. Even on the highway, this SUV is a lot better than its off-roading reputation might suggest.</p>, <p>Clearly, the Land Cruiser is not a vehicle for everyone. Or for more than a handful. Its hugely admirable reputation for durability was established long ago, through successful ventures in some of the most remote, war-ravaged regions of the world.</p>, <p>Nothing else on sale today looks like Toyota’s cruiser, apart from its Lexus LX cousin. Even when operating in the most rugged conditions, its commendable record for reliability remains intact.</p>, <p>Toyota offers just one version of the Land Cruiser. A long-proven 5.7-liter V8 generates 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of torque, working with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Every Land Cruiser has full-time four-wheel drive, with a locking center differential and a two-speed transfer case that permits Low-range operation.</p>, <p>Land Cruisers are packed with gadgetry that comes into play far beyond the pavement’s end. Multiple-mode traction control is standard. Crawl control functions like cruise control, but for off-road adventures.</p>, <p>Beneath its muscle-bound body, a traditional ladder-style chassis contains an independent front suspension and a solid rear axle, fitted with coil springs. Although the big V8 produces impressive thrust, despite pushing a 5,800-pound vehicle, fuel economy is abominable.</p>, <p>Up to eight passengers can expect pampered comfort and luxury, though some plastic pieces demonstrate the Land Cruiser’s work-truck foundation. Lexus’s version, the LX, has a more posh interior, plus some design and suspension differences, but is otherwise largely identical.</p>, <p>No U.S. safety agency has crash-tested the Land Cruiser. Several modern safety features are standard, including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure alert, and automatic high beams. Front/rear parking sensors are standard, and a multi-terrain camera provides selectable views.</p>, <p>Land Cruiser ($83,665) comes with four-wheel drive, eight-passenger seating, four-zone automatic climate control, semi-aniline perforated leather seat trim, heated/ventilated power front seats, a cooler box, pushbutton start, 14-speaker JBL audio, a 9.0-inch infotainment touchscreen, LED headlights, and 18-inch wheels. A rear-seat entertainment system with DVD player and dual 11.6-inch screens is optional. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,295 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55551" height="138" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-landcruiser-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Kinship to the past is evident from a few styling cues, helping the bulbous but good-looking SUV stand out in its category. Starting with the nearly-classic 1991 model, the Land Cruiser’s sizable shape has retained its kinship with tradition.</p>, <p>Up front, chrome ribbons highlight the LED headlights. Despite 9.0-inch ground clearance, removable side steps make the Land Cruiser appear lower than expected. Chrome is amply applied to the rear as well, yet the overall look is conservative and reasonably tasteful.</p>, <p>Ready to cope with its array of off-road technology, the upright, symmetrical dashboard is packed with large buttons and knobs. Yet, most controls are built into the infotainment screen. At the center console, controls for the transfer case and traction system sit alongside a conventional gearshift lever.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55553" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-landcruiser-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-landcruiser-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-landcruiser-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>At a glance, the Land Cruiser almost resembles a luxury sedan. Space is bountiful, though not every passenger enjoys equivalent accommodations. Front seats are wide and well-padded, helping to provide excellent views. Row two isn’t far behind in comfort, with space for three average-size adults.</p>, <p>Three seatbelts await in the third row, but youngsters are the most likely occupants. The truck-based third-row configuration precludes foldaway seatbacks. Instead, two removable seat halves can fold upward when not in use.</p>, <p>Semi-aniline leather upholstery feels tempting, but hard plastic trim seems out of place in such a costly vehicle.</p>, <p>Cargo volume totals a sizable 16.1 cubic feet behind the third row, expanding to 43 cubic feet when those seats are folded away. Removing third-row seats and folding second-row seatbacks boosts space close to 82 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55550" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-landcruiser-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-landcruiser-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-landcruiser-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Indisputably, the Land Cruiser’s solid rear axle and separate, reinforced chassis reach back to a long-ago time. Yes, Toyota’s big SUV feels solid all-around.</p>, <p>Ride comfort could easily be described as silken smooth and comfortably composed, helped by soft 18-inch tires. A huge amount of rear-wheel articulation is good news for off-roaders, but can translate to occasions of head-tossing during on-pavement stretches.</p>, <p>Toyota’s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System allows oversize anti-sway bars to disconnect automatically at low speeds, when additional wheel travel is helpful. Relatively soft springs and sizable tires let the SUV cope handily with bumps.</p>, <p>Land Cruisers can roll through winding roads and twisty trails with commendably minimal body lean. Vehicle size and weight conspire with light steering to make handling ponderous, which is hardly a surprise.</p>, <p>Off-road trekkers can expect sterling levels of tenacity. Far beyond the pavement is where the Land Cruiser shines brightest. By pushing a button, Crawl Control uses the traction control and ABS to keep the SUV moving slowly though any terrain. Another knob selects specific traction-control settings.</p>, <p>One switch tightens the turning radius by braking an inside wheel, allowing the vehicle to pivot. For extreme conditions, the limited-slip differential can be locked. Even when dashing through sand dunes, the Land Cruiser feels nimble and eager.</p>, <p>When off-road, the foremost obstacle might be the Land Cruiser’s width: almost 78 inches. Obviously, some narrow trails could prove problematical.</p>, <p>Despite its weight, a Land Cruiser accelerates briskly. Transmission shifts are prompt and smooth, though an occasional moment of gear-change confusion can occur. Helped by its separate ladder frame, this SUV can tow up to 8,100 pounds</p>, <p>Land Cruisers are among the least-efficient vehicles available, EPA-rated at 13/18 mpg City/Highway, or 15 mpg Combined. Regular fuel is sufficient.</p>, <p>In addition to excellent ride quality and strong V8 power, the Land Cruiser stands apart for its off-road capabilities and assemblage of appropriate electronic gadgetry. Few vehicles of any sort come with such a distinct personal and noble heritage. Steering may be ponderous and gas mileage hideous, but a Land Cruiser is bountifully equipped for both off-road and on-pavement pleasures.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-gmc-acadia/
[<p>Redesigned as a 2017 model, the GMC Acadia is a midsize crossover SUV available in five-, six-, or seven-passenger configurations. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive is optional.</p>, <p>This second-generation Acadia replaced a much larger crossover with the same name. The current model is roughly six inches shorter and three inches narrower than the 2007-2016 Acadia. The current Acadia is 700 pounds lighter than the first-generation model and it gets much better fuel economy. It also costs less.</p>, <p>Only minor changes have been made for 2018: Seating configurations have been expanded for the All Terrain package. The top Denali edition gains a heated steering wheel. An audible tire fill alert is standard on 2018 Acadia models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55545" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-acadia-denali.jpg" width="200"/>GMC offers seven trim levels: SL, SLE, SLT, and top-end Denali. SLE and SLT versions are split into two versions each: -1 and -2, with different content and pricing. An All Terrain package is available for SLE and SLT models. Denali is distinguished by its flashy grille and other trim.</p>, <p>The standard engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 193 horsepower and 188 pound-feet of torque. Available on all but the base SL and step-up SLE is a 3.6-liter V6 that develops 310 horsepower and 271 pound-feet.</p>, <p>Both engines mate with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional on all except SL trim.</p>, <p>The four-cylinder engine feels strained with a full load of passengers and gear, but the V6 is strong and quiet.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive aims more at snow-covered roads than off-pavement four-wheeling, even when using the off-road mode that’s part of the All-Terrain option.</p>, <p>Eight airbags and a rearview camera are standard. Advanced safety technology is available, if costly, but only for upper models. Such features as automatic emergency braking and active lane control are standard only on SLT-2 and Denali editions. Lane-change alert, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert are available for SLE-2 and standard on SLT-1 models.</p>, <p>A standard rear-seat detection system alerts you, before driving off, if you’ve opened the rear door. It’s meant to remind drivers that a child or pet might be in the back seat.</p>, <p>Acadia scored well in crash-testing. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2018 Acadia five stars overall, and for frontal and side impacts. Only for rollover protection did Acadia get a four-star rating, which is typical of taller vehicles. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the 2017 Acadia Good in each category tested, other than headlights, which were declared Poor. Only the Denali’s high-intensity-discharge headers were deemed Marginal. With an appropriate option group, the Acadia ranked Superior for frontal crash prevention.</p>, <p>Acadia SL ($29,000) has the four-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive. Standard equipment includes seven-passenger seating, 17-inch alloy wheels, three-zone automatic climate control, six-speaker audio, a rearview camera. The 7.0-inch infotainment system works with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55541" height="146" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-acadia-2.jpg" width="200"/>Acadia SLE-1 ($32,560) is available with all-wheel drive ($34,560) and adds satellite radio, LED daytime running lights, carpeted floor mats, and a compact spare tire. SLE-2 ($35,180) adds an eight-way power driver’s seat, heated front seats, programmable power liftgate, 18-inch wheels, foglamps, and six-passenger seating. The All Terrain package combines appearance upgrades, including a body-color grille surround, with an off-road mode for the all-wheel-drive system. The All Terrain deletes the third row of seats.</p>, <p>Acadia SLT-1 ($38,460) upgrades to perforated leather upholstery, power front seats, Bose audio, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>Acadia SLT-2 ($41,860) comes with the V6 and is available with all-wheel drive ($43,860) and includes heated rear seats, front/rear parking sensors, and 20-inch wheels. A safety group combines low-speed automatic emergency braking, forward collision alert, automatic headlights, lane-keep assist, and lane-change alert. Warnings are both audible and felt through the driver’s seat.</p>, <p>Acadia Denali V6 ($45,020), available with all-wheel drive ($47,020) has unique appearance details, a hands-free power liftgate, bright roof rails, 8-inch information screen with navigation, and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55539" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-acadia-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Simplicity lends the Acadia its attractive appearance, with a design that doesn’t rely on curves to draw attention. Clean body lines and a masculine tone set the stage. Prior-generation Acadia owners should note that the current model is considerably smaller.</p>, <p>Despite the Acadia’s car-based platform, squared-off wheel openings convey a somewhat truck-like look. Large taillights on most versions are separated by a sizable chrome element.</p>, <p>Adding the All Terrain package cuts back on chrome, focusing on distinctive wheels and dark trim. Denali builds up the brightwork.</p>, <p>Largely comfortable, the Acadia cabin is clean-looking and sufficiently pleasant, if a bit bland. Though quality is evident and soft-touch materials abound, the symmetrical layout seems a bit past its prime.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55546" height="88" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-acadia-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Standard seating for seven includes a three-place bench in row two, plus two in the third row. Most trim levels can get optional twin captain’s chairs, reducing seating to six.</p>, <p>Surprisingly narrow, the Acadia cabin can feel a little cramped when filled with passengers. Front occupants can expect good views, while residing on comfortable seats. Row two is easy to access. Outboard seats are roomy, but the center position falls short on comfort. Youngsters are the best prospects for riding in the third row, which may be folded flat.</p>, <p>With the third row upright, cargo volume totals a modest 12.8 cubic feet. Peak capacity is 79 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55540" height="135" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-acadia-3.jpg" width="200"/>The Acadia drives well and feels pleasantly polished, with a comfortable, composed ride and responsive handling.</p>, <p>Steering is nicely weighted. V6 models feel a trifle nose-heavy, but handling doesn’t suffer.</p>, <p>The four-wheel independent suspension readily absorbs patchy pavement. The 20-inch wheels optional on SLT (standard on Denali) can yield a stiffer ride.</p>, <p>Performance is modest with the four-cylinder engine. The strong V6 is an appealing choice, mating well with GMC’s 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>All Terrain models look rugged, but ride comfort matches the regular Acadia. Off-pavement, it benefits from slightly revised traction-control mode.</p>, <p>An Acadia isn’t the most fuel-efficient crossover in its class. Four-cylinder models with front-drive are thriftiest, EPA-rated at 21/26 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. Adding all-wheel drive lowers the estimate just slightly, to 21/25/23 mpg.</p>, <p>The V6 guzzles a bit more, EPA-rated at 18/25 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive is rated at 17/25/20 mpg. Neither engine requires premium gasoline. Four-cylinder Acadias include a Stop/Start system.</p>, <p>Riding and handling nicely, with a comfortable cabin, the Acadia is a sensible family crossover. Strong performance emanates from the available V6, but the four-cylinder trails in terms of energy. Demerits include a narrow cabin, tight third row (if installed), and limited safety technology for lower trim levels. Numerous options mean GMC has an Acadia to meet nearly any requirements.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Lincoln MKC luxury compact crossover SUV shares its foundation and much of its structure with the long-lived Ford Escape. In appearance, the two models differ. Lincoln introduced its MKC as a 2015 model.</p>, <p>Little has changed for the 2018 model year. Premiere, Select, Reserve, and Black Label trim levels are offered. Even the base model is well-equipped. With its brightly shining interior, in particular, the MKC delivers on the level of luxury promised by the Lincoln brand.</p>, <p>Lincoln offers a choice of two powertrains. Base engine is a 2.0-liter twin-turbocharged four-cylinder that develops 240 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque. Pushbuttons make selections on the standard 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is estimated at up to 23 mpg in Combined city/highway driving.</p>, <p>The 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine generates 285 horsepower and 305 pound-feet, sufficient to permit acceleration to 60 mph in less than seven seconds, a quick performance. This engine is an option for all MKC trim levels except Premiere, but is not offered for the Ford Escape.</p>, <p>Each MKC version is offered with front-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. The 285-horsepower, 2.3-liter engine comes only with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Available Stop/Start technology can shut off the 2.0-liter engine at stoplights, to help save fuel. An adaptive suspension with continuously controlled dampers is available for upper trim levels. With either engine, an MKC is rated to tow 3,000 pounds.</p>, <p>In its crash-testing program, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the MKC only a four-star overall rating. The MKC earned a five-star score for the side-impact test, but four stars for frontal impact and rollover resistance (a calculated figure). The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has put the MKC through only part of its crash-test program, giving it a Good rating for side-impact and moderate overlap testing.</p>, <p>A rearview camera is standard. Blind-spot monitoring is included or available with upper trim levels. An optional Technology Package includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and parking assist.</p>, <p>A reworked MKC is scheduled for release in summer 2018 as a 2019 model, with revised styling and a pre-collision safety system.</p>, <p>Lincoln MKC Premiere ($33,355), the base model, comes with the 2.0-liter engine and includes heated power front seats, leatherette upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, pushbutton start, a rearview camera, 18-inch alloy wheels, power liftgate, and nine-speaker audio. Infotainment features an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Sync 3. Premiere AWD ($35,765) has all-wheel drive rather than front-drive. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $925 destination charge.)</p>, <p>MKC Select ($36,110) and Select AWD ($38,520) upgrade with perforated leather seat surfaces and ambient lighting, as well as greater option availability, including blind-spot monitoring.</p>, <p>MKC Reserve ($39,985) and Reserve AWD ($42,395) include a dual-pane sunroof, navigation, heated/ventilated front seats, wood interior accents, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>MKC Black Label ($45,975) and Black Label AWD ($48,380) come with 19-inch wheels, upgraded leather seating surfaces, and an Alcantara headliner.</p>, <p>Even though it’s based on the Ford Escape, Lincoln’s compact crossover shares few appearance elements with its less-costly cousin.</p>, <p>Developed as a pleasing blend of relatively soft lines and sharp creases, the MKC exterior ranks slightly above average. The split wing grille should be familiar from all Lincoln SUVs. Some similarities to Ford’s Escape can be discerned in the MKC profile. Lincoln’s bulbous back end is not among them.</p>, <p>More impressive inside than its starting price might suggest, the MKC provides a luxury-car experience. The MKC cabin feels bigger than it is, numerically.</p>, <p>Front occupants get a taste of elegant simplicity. High-quality materials run the gamut from merely nice to nearly decadent, accented by wood.</p>, <p>Base-model seats wear synthetic leather and cloth upholstery. Black Label versions escalate to Venetian leather and an Alcantara headliner. Bridge of Weir leather goes into Reserve trim.</p>, <p>Front-seat occupants can expect a quiet, refined experience, on seats that are both spacious and supple. Side bolstering is limited, but its lack is notable only during intense drives.</p>, <p>Back-seat passengers are less fortunate, facing a cramped bench. Adults may be short on legroom as well as head clearance. At 36.8 inches, rear legroom is impeded by sizable front seats. Outboard seating positions are adequately sculpted, but cushioning is limited. The available dual-pane sunroof cuts into headroom, too.</p>, <p>Split-folding rear seats expand the cargo area from 25.2 cubic feet with seatbacks upright, to 53.1 cubic feet when they’re folded.</p>, <p>Sync 3 infotainment is satisfying, compared to prior systems. Active noise cancellation keeps unwanted sounds under control.</p>, <p>Each engine provides stimulating responses. While the base engine provides appropriate power for an MKC, the 285-horsepower upgrade ratchets up performance to a level that almost seems out of character for a compact crossover SUV.</p>, <p>Available only with all-wheel drive, the 2.3-liter powertrain would be the logical choice for steep-terrain journeys, imparting an extra layer of confidence. Although the automatic transmission delivers engine power effectively, its pushbutton-type gear selector never seems fully intuitive. Other MKC controls, fortunately, are easier to operate.</p>, <p>Competent, composed road manners are no surprise from Lincoln. Ride and handling compare favorably to others in its category, including rivals from German automakers.</p>, <p>Available continuously controlled dampers can provide several levels of stiffness. Sport setting may feel somewhat firm, but the MKC clings tenaciously to the pavement, with minimal body lean through curves.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, mode selections aren’t so intuitive, demanding use of the pushbutton shifter or steering-wheel control. Sport mode requires one push of the S button. A second push yields semi-manual mode. A semi-buried series of menus must be used to customize suspension operation. Still, the adjustable suspension beats the base setup at smoothing out rough spots.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is reasonable for a luxury crossover, though reaching EPA estimates in real-world driving is a challenge. With front-wheel drive, the 2.0-liter base model is EPA-rated at 21/28 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers the estimate significantly, to 19/25/21 mpg (22 mpg Combined with Stop/Start system operating). An MKC with the 2.3-liter engine is EPA-rated slightly lower at 18/25 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Lincoln’s MKC offers plenty of amenities, though the brand’s cachet doesn’t match that of some European and Asian manufacturers. Good standard equipment is offset by less-than-ideal safety ratings. Styling is less daring than that of Lincoln sedans, but elegance awaits inside. All told, the MKC represents good value, though an abundantly fitted Black Label edition can top $50,000.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-kia-sportage/
[<p>The Kia Sportage compact crossover exudes a sporty character, led by its distinctive design but augmented by sharp handling and a turbocharger option.</p>, <p>Redesigned for the 2017 model year, the Sportage sees only minor revisions for 2018. Vital safety technology, including autonomous emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring, is more broadly available on 2018 Sportage models.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Sportage comes in three trim levels: LX, EX, and SX Turbo.</p>, <p>Each is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Biased toward the front wheels, the all-wheel-drive system is fully automatic, needing no input from the driver. Like most crossovers in its category, the Sportage promises no off-roading credentials.</p>, <p>Sportage LX and EX versions hold a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, rated to deliver 181 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of torque. In the SX Turbo, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder produces 240 horsepower (237 hp with all-wheel drive) and 260 pound-feet. Either way, a 6-speed automatic is the sole transmission.</p>, <p>Kia has a long tradition of offering well-equipped vehicles for the price, and the Sportage carries on that standard.</p>, <p>A rearview camera is standard. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alerts are standard on Sportage EX and SX Turbo. Technology Packages with modern safety features, including autonomous emergency braking and lane-departure warnings, are available for LX and EX trim levels, standard on Sportage SX Turbo.</p>, <p>Ratings of Good for each crash-test performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety resulted in designation of the 2018 Kia Sportage as a Top Safety Pick when fitted with emergency braking.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has rated the Sportage at five stars overall and for the side-impact crash, but just four stars for frontal collision and rollover crash protection (the latter a calculated figure, not based on testing).</p>, <p>Sportage LX ($23,600) has front-wheel drive and the 2.4-liter engine. Standard equipment includes a rearview camera, cloth upholstery, basic 5.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, six-speaker audio, Bluetooth, 17-inch alloy wheels, power windows and locks, and air conditioning. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $990 destination charge.)</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is optional ($1,500) on all models.</p>, <p>Sportage EX ($26,400) adds 18-inch alloy wheels, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, 7.0-inch touchscreen, foglamps, and heated power-folding mirrors. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity is included.</p>, <p>Sportage SX Turbo ($32,900) substitutes the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, adding a sport-tuned suspension. Standard features include autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, parking sensors, paddle shifters, 19-inch wheels, panoramic sunroof, and power tailgate.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55530" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-sportage-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-sportage-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-sportage-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>More than most compact crossovers, the Sportage relies on a swoopy design and a sporty nature. Some consider its bold styling excessive. A relatively long wheelbase and short overhangs gives it a feisty appearance.</p>, <p>The front ends are slightly different on all-wheel-drive models, which have greater ground clearance.</p>, <p>SX Turbos flaunt the most dressed-up look, helped by 19-inch alloy wheels. Slim taillights are tied together by a refined chromes strip. A red panel connects LX and EX rear lamps.</p>, <p>Within the classy, reasonably roomy Sportage cabin, soft-touch plastics mix with helpful ergonomics, resulting in a sense of high quality, even in basic LX models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55531" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-sportage-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-sportage-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-sportage-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Fabric upholstery in base LX trim is appropriate, if not noteworthy. EX and SX Turbo trim levels move up to leather. Soft-feel surfaces appear on both the dashboard and front doors.</p>, <p>Front seats provide good support. Headroom and knee clearance are satisfying up front and in the outboard rear seats. Out back, a third passenger shouldn’t feel too squeezed, at least for short trips.</p>, <p>Cargo space totals almost 31 cubic feet behind the second row, expanding to 60.1 cubic feet with seatbacks folded. Low liftover height eases luggage loading.</p>, <p>On the cleanly laid-out, driver-oriented dashboard, controls sit within easy reach. Split into upper and lower halves, the dashboard is slightly canted, helping the driver focus on gauges.</p>, <p>Three infotainment screens are available. Clear, high-resolution 7.0- and 8.0-inch touchscreens don’t wash out on sunny days. Kia’s UVO infotainment operates better than most, and is easy to navigate.</p>, <p>Outward visibility is impeded by thick roof pillars and a high beltline.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55529" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-sportage-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Ride comfort and handling prowess are Sportage strong points. LX editions with 17-inch tires yield the softest ride, but the EX is only a tad stiffer. SX Turbos ride on firmer springs, with different dampers. Steering is set up slightly differently, too, giving the SX a distinctive character.</p>, <p>Handling confidently and predictably, unlike some competitors, the Sportage shows minimal sloppiness. By compact crossover standards, at least, the Sportage feels sure-footed through curves and corners. Steering offers a little more heft than is customary. LX and EX models feel well-planted, without being overly firm.</p>, <p>The Sportage is impressively quiet, thanks to extensive sound-deadening and acoustic glass.</p>, <p>With either engine, performance ranks above average. The basic 2.4-liter engine performs adequately, but cannot be called inspiring. Acceleration is more stirring with the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, in the SX Turbo.</p>, <p>Kia’s all-wheel-drive system reacts swiftly on slippery surfaces, to improve grip by the rear tires. A special front bumper that provides slightly more ground clearance goes on AWD models, to help on snow-covered pavement.</p>, <p>The quiet base engine sends only a subdued growl into the cabin. Especially with all-wheel drive, fuel economy trails class-leading rivals. An LX with front-wheel drive is EPA-rated at 23/30 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops that estimate to an unimpressive 21/25/22 mpg. Slightly larger wheels cut EX figures to 22/29/25 mpg with front-wheel drive, or 21/25/23 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>SX Turbos consume the most, EPA-rated at 21/26 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined, with front-wheel drive; and only 20/23/21 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Kia Sportage is a competent crossover that stands out mostly for styling and value. It has a modestly sporty nature. The cabin feels like refined quality, and front seats promise long-trek comfort. Especially in SX Turbo form, the Sportage performs with a touch of gusto. Kia’s warranty is another plus.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-x6/
[<p>The BMW X6 illustrates the emergence and evolution of luxury crossover models over the past decade. Launched as an early 2009 model, it stood well apart from the usual squared-off, conventional-looking bodies with its coupe-like profile. Dubbed a Sports Activity Coupe despite its four doors, the hatchback X6 established the trend for tall, stylish vehicles topped with a sleek, sharply sloped roofline.</p>, <p>X6 was redesigned for the 2015 model year.</p>, <p>Little has changed for 2018, except for modest simplification of the options list. 2018 BMW X6 option packages (Premium, M Sport, Executive) are configured more like trim levels with the same designation. Trapezoidal tailpipes are standard on 35i models.</p>, <p>Two turbocharged engines remain available in regular X6 models. A 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder makes 300 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque. Stepping up a notch is a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8, which develops 445 horsepower and 480 pound-feet. Both engines mate with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard with the six-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard with the V8, and optional for the six.</p>, <p>Topping the lineup is the performance-packed X6 M, packing a hopped-up version of the V8 that generates 567 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. That’s enough to yield 4.0-second acceleration time to 60 mph.</p>, <p>With fine driving dynamics the rule, even the base six-cylinder X6 provides a polished driving experience, mixed with pleasure. Plenty of enticing options are available, but they add considerably to the X6’s price – especially when full option packages need to be purchased.</p>, <p>Largely because of low sales volume, the X6 has not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The closely related X5 has earned good crash-test scores, led by a five-star rating from the federal agency, but they don’t necessarily demonstrate that an X6 would fare equally well, despite similar structure.</p>, <p>Like its X5 cousin, the X6 can be fitted with a broad range of safety and collision-avoidance technology. A rearview camera is standard, but most other safety features are extra-cost options. They include automatic emergency braking, forward-collision warning, adaptive headlights, night vision with pedestrian and animal detection, a head-up display, and surround-view camera, as well as a Parking Assistant.</p>, <p>Unlike the X5, the X6 isn’t offered in hybrid or diesel variants.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55521" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x6-final.jpg" width="200"/>X6 sDrive35i ($62,700) has rear-wheel drive with the six-cylinder engine, leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, heated power front seats, and navigation with 10.2-inch screen. X6 xDrive35i ($65,000) has all-wheel drive. Premium Package adds keyless ignition, satellite radio, and wireless charging. The M Sport package provides a firmer suspension and heavier-bolstered seats. An Executive Package adds full LED headlights, soft-close doors, air conditioned seats, and Harman Kardon audio. CarPlay costs additional. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>X6 xDrive50i ($77,450) substitutes the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine.</p>, <p>X6 M ($104,100) features a 567-horsepower V8 engine, along with an adaptive sport suspension, 21-inch wheels, all-wheel drive, and 16-speaker Harman Kardon audio.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55519" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x6-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Few vehicles draw such contrasting visual impressions as the BMW X6. Not everyone falls for the lushly sloped-roof profile; but for those who do, it’s a truly distinctive-looking vehicle, even after a decade on the market. Somehow, BMW designers made this eye-catching, still-daring crossover look somewhat pudgy, but also slinky.</p>, <p>BMW established the basic pattern, which has since been adopted by several premium manufacturers. BMW also offers a smaller version: the fashionable X4, derived from the company’s compact, conventionally-looking X3.</p>, <p>Differences between the X5 and X6 are negligible when viewed from the front. Below the beltline, too, the X6 looks almost like a traditional crossover. Higher up, the difference becomes dramatic.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55520" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x6-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x6-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x6-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Classy as well as tastefully refined, the X6 cabin promises a comfortable ride for as many as five occupants, provided the back-seaters aren’t too tall. Only a glance at the profile is needed to realize that rear headroom has to be restricted.</p>, <p>Front passengers can expect comfortable seats with multiple adjustments, promising a fine view ahead. In back, not only is headroom constricted, but entry/exit isn’t so easy.</p>, <p>The cargo hold also has problems. Tall items might not fit, due to the sloping back windows. Cargo volume totals almost 27 cubic feet, but BMW’s traditional-looking X5 crossover holds about 9 more. Considering usable space rather than numerical volume, the difference is even greater.</p>, <p>Every X6 feels solidly, carefully assembled. BMW offers a broad choice of interior trim, including several types of wood and aluminum. Leather upholstery comes in several grades. Each version is fitted with abundant standard equipment.</p>, <p>Ride quality is firm, and the X6 suspension controls body motions well. The electronic steering doesn’t give the driver the road feel that BMWs of the past transmitted.</p>, <p>Each engine, including the base model’s six-cylinder, is strong and willing, promising stimulating performance. Admirably smooth, the 3.0-liter delivers sufficient thrust to satisfy most drivers.</p>, <p>Still, the twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 in the xDrive50i sends the pleasure quotient up a notch, helped by the prompt-shifting 8-speed transmission. Acceleration to 60 mph takes place in a brisk 4.7 seconds. Because the fashionable X6 tends to make a statement rather than merely provide lavish transportation, a V8 seems more appropriate for its mission, though gas mileage sinks significantly.</p>, <p>The X6 M delivers thunderous vigor when wanted, with its 567-horsepower V8 always waiting patiently for opportunities to leap into action. With its heftier anti-sway bars and special air suspension, the X6 M handles nearly as well as many lower-riding sports sedans.</p>, <p>Ranking as the most popular model, the six-cylinder xDrive35i is EPA-rated at 18/24 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined. The rear-wheel-drive sDrive35i does a hair better, at 18/25/21 mpg. Despite its bountiful power, the X6M isn’t as thirsty as might be expected. Hardly frugal, though, it’s EPA-rated at 14/19 mpg City/Highway, or 16 mpg Combined. In all models, a stop/start system can shut the engine off at traffic lights.</p>, <p>The BMW X6 is satisfying to drive but may might not deliver quite as much motoring fun as its lush body suggests. Utility is somewhat limited by the design, but the cabin exudes a clearly upscale aura. No X6 falls short on either features or visual flair, amplified by a trio of strong engines. Inexpensive they are not, and adding options boosts the price into formidable territory.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-x5/
[<p>The BMW X5 midsize crossover SUV is able to seat seven and features the taut driving dynamics that symbolize the brand. The X5 was last redesigned for the 2014 model year. Little has changed for 2018.</p>, <p>Most 2018 BMW X5 models get a sport-tuned version of the 8-speed automatic transmission. Option groups have been altered, essentially serving as separate trim levels. Most individual options are available with the Premium package.</p>, <p>The X5 presents a broad choice of powertrains. Two turbocharged gasoline engines are offered in regular X5 models: a 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder, and a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8. The six-cylinder makes 300 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque, escalating to 445 horsepower and 480 pound-feet from the V8.</p>, <p>A 3.0-liter turbodiesel six goes into the X5 xDrive35d, developing 255 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque. All-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>BMW also offers a plug-in hybrid, which combines a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine with an electric motor and 9.2-kWh lithium-ion battery pack. Combined output totals 308 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>All X5s use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the base gas-engine model, but upper trim levels come with all-wheel drive. AWD is optional for the base version.</p>, <p>For all-out performance, the X5 M unleashes a 567-horsepower version of the 4.4-liter V8, producing 553 pound-feet of torque. Sport seats, strengthened steering, and a track-tuned suspension are standard.</p>, <p>Plenty of advanced safety technology is available, but most items are costly options. All X5s now contain a rearview camera. Surround-view cameras and a head-up display are optional. Automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control also are available.</p>, <p>An optional Parking Assistant can position the X5 in a parallel or perpendicular parking spot. Traffic Jam Assistant strives to keep the crossover in its lane, safely behind the vehicle ahead.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the X5 five stars overall, and five each for its frontal and side-impact crash. Testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety yielded a Good score in its moderate-overlap frontal and side-impact tests. Automatic emergency braking earned a Superior rating.</p>, <p>X5 sDrive35i ($56,950) includes the six-cylinder engine, rear-wheel drive, leatherette upholstery, 14-way heated power front seats, adaptive headlights, power tailgate, panoramic moonroof, and nine-speaker audio. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.) X5 xDrive35i ($59,250) includes all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>X5 xDrive35d ($60,750) has a twin-turbo diesel six-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>X5 xDrive40e iPerformance ($63,500) has a hybrid powertrain with 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive, and adaptive suspension.</p>, <p>X5 xDrive50i ($73,800) gets the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 with all-wheel drive, leather seat upholstery, 20-way power front seats, pushbutton start, and Harman Kardon audio.</p>, <p>X5 M ($100,700) includes the 567-horsepower V8, M-level suspension, larger brakes, and distinctive styling elements.</p>, <p>An optional M Sport package features unique styling touches and a firmer suspension.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55512" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Undeniably upscale, the X5 might fall short in automotive personality, due to relatively bland styling. Any appearance deficits tend to be offset by the X5’s refined and spacious cabin, as well as its powertrain and handling capabilities.</p>, <p>Conspicuous up front is BMW’s twin kidney grille. Subtle creases highlight the bodysides. The two-piece, power-operated tailgate can serve as a temporary seat when parked for an outdoor event. Although it may hamper loading of larger items, it also prevents cargo from falling out when the rear hatch is opened.</p>, <p>BMW’s conservative design principles apply to the X5’s cabin as well as its body. Not only is the interior warmly appealing, it provides abundant space for five adult occupants.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55513" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Cargo space is plentiful, totaling 23 cubic feet with rear seatbacks up, expanding to 66 cubic feet when they’re folded. The optional third-row seat is best suited for youngsters.</p>, <p>Controls are arranged in a straightforward layout, easy to reach. The driver faces a hefty, triple-spoke steering wheel.</p>, <p>Front seats provide ample support. Multi-contoured seats are the most inviting. Second-row seats promise satisfying space as well as an excellent view, due to the X5’s low beltline.</p>, <p>Infotainment centers on a 10.2-inch touchscreen and BMW’s newest, excellent version of iDrive, using a touchpad and control knob. Apple CarPlay is available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55514" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x5-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Depending on model, driving an X5 can be surprisingly pleasurable, augmented by a softly comfortable ride: BMW offers several suspension possibilities. Softest-riding is the base model, which could wallow when cornering at higher speed.</p>, <p>Despite weighing about 4,700 pounds, the base X5 can accelerate to 60 mph in a bit more than six seconds. Not only is the six-cylinder gas engine smooth, its strong power delivery begins as soon as the gas pedal is touched. As expected, the quiet V8 version is notably quicker.</p>, <p>Diesel X5s might be in short supply, but the xDrive35d is powerful and refined, as well as fuel-efficient. A larger price premium ($4,250) applies to the xDrive40e hybrid. When fully charged, it can go 14 miles on electric power alone. In automatic mode, the gas engine usually remains off at speeds below 45 mph.</p>, <p>For substantially greater stability when cornering, plus confidence on curvy roads, an adaptive suspension is optional. An M Sport package firms up the suspension and enhances control further yet.</p>, <p>Naturally, 567-horsepower X5 M is the choice for full-bore performance, coupling race-track potential with capability for daily driving. Brakes are heartier, and the suspension firmer yet.</p>, <p>An X5 might look ready for off-road treks, but that’s not its main mission. All-wheel drive (xDrive) works nicely on snow-covered roads and milder journeys past the pavement.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is about as expected. The 2017 X5 xDrive35i was EPA-rated at 18/24 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined. With rear-wheel drive, the sDrive35i edges up to 18/25/21 mpg. The diesel xDrive35d earns an impressive 23/29/25 mpg estimate.</p>, <p>The hybrid xDrive40e has been EPA-rated at 24 mpg combined, but 56 MPGe (equivalent), based on the amount of energy required to supply the electricity.</p>, <p>The xDrive50i’s V8 guzzles, EPA-rated at 15/21 mpg City/Highway, or 17 mpg Combined. Even thirstier is the X5 M, rated at just 14/19/16 mpg. Each X5 has stop/start, which can shut off the engine at stoplights. Early BMW start/stop operation could be annoying, but the current version is less noticeable than some similar systems.</p>, <p>The BMW X5 delivers premium surroundings, ample features, and BMW performance. Options add greatly to the purchase price.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-x4/
[<p>The BMW X4 is a swoopy, low-roofline SUV, smaller than the X6 that helped establish the Sports Activity Coupe trend a decade ago. Introduced for the 2015 model year, the X4 is unchanged for 2018. A redesigned X4 is expected to debut as a 2019 model.</p>, <p>In addition to its compelling shape, the sport-luxury X4 delivers strong performance. Two distinct versions are offered, each with all-wheel drive. In the X4 xDrive28i, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 240 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. That’s sufficient to yield 0-60 mph acceleration in about six seconds.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55506" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x4-2.jpg" width="200"/>For swifter, more stimulating performance, BMW developed the X4 M40i, packing a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine that generates 355 horsepower and a burly 343 pound-feet. In less than five seconds, the M40i blasts from a standstill to 60 mph. Both models use an impressively competent 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Porsche’s Macan is a prime competitor, with comparable specifications. One downside of the X4 stands out: the back seat is short on space, especially for passenger heads. Entry into the rear compartment is a tad challenging, too. That’s the price to be paid for the lush curves that flow along the roof.</p>, <p>Neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the X4. A rearview camera is standard, but many advanced safety features are offered only in expensive option packages.</p>, <p>Adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking are available for a fairly reasonable $1,200 additional. Blind‑spot monitoring, a head‑up display, and speed-limit display go for $1,700. Parking sensors and a surround‑view camera system add $700.</p>, <p>Because the X4’s low roof pillars and obstructed rear hatch roofline affect outward visibility, blind-spot monitoring is an especially prudent addition.</p>, <p>For the category, the X4 looks marvelous outside, with an interior that’s not far behind.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X4 xDrive28i ($47,600) has the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with all-wheel drive. Standard features include synthetic leather upholstery, power front seats, 19‑inch wheels, adaptive headlights, wood trim, a 6.5‑inch infotainment display with Bluetooth connectivity, power tailgate, and rearview camera.</p>, <p>Cold Weather, Premium, and M-Sport packages are available. Options include adaptive dampers ($1,000) and Harman Kardon surround sound ($875). Apple CarPlay ($300) requires the ($1,700) navigation system. Android Auto is not available. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>M40i ($59,250) contains the 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine with all-wheel drive, and comes with deeper sport seats, leather upholstery, pushbutton start, adaptive dampers, and parking sensors. The M Sport appearance package is standard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55505" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x4-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Whether the X4 is primarily a styling statement or a laudably sensible crossover model is debatable. What’s not open to dispute is the vehicle’s fashionable body contours, especially along the roofline.</p>, <p>Like the larger X6, the X4 gives up some functionality. Based upon the conventionally profiled X3 crossover, the X4 carves away quite a lot of cargo space and some head clearance, in exchange for its dramatic fastback roof.</p>, <p>Athletic in both appearance and approach to sporty driving, the X4 features bulky fenders that can wrap around available 20‑inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55503" height="182" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x4-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Although BMW’s upright X3 crossover, from which the X4 was spun off, seats five passengers readily, the X4 barely manages four. That’s because the sloping roofline slashes at least 2 inches of rear-seat headroom, compared to the X3.</p>, <p>Deeply sculpted back-seat indentations for two persons affirm that the X4 isn’t meant for families. Legroom also is in short supply, but head space is the main concern.</p>, <p>Front seats, in stark contrast, rank above average. To obtain more sporty seats with good support, comfortable for a broad range of body types, the M-Sport package can be added. Front seats also are sportier in the M40i edition.</p>, <p>Cargo capacity also is significantly compromised by the coupe‑like roof. Volume totals 17.7 cubic feet with second-row seats upright, but the cargo hold is oddly-shaped. With those back seats folded, capacity expands to 49.4 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55504" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x4-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x4-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x4-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Since the X4 is a BMW, ride and handling qualities are sure to satisfy the enthusiastic driver. All the more so if that driver is behind the wheel of the M40i, which is particularly adept at breezing briskly through highway curves and corners.</p>, <p>Performance, too, strikes a compelling chord, no matter which engine is beneath the hood. Neither engine feels underpowered; but again, the M40i edition makes its potent turbo six-cylinder engine spring forcefully into action.</p>, <p>For vehicles in this category, driving fun isn’t always a strong point. Not only does the M40i’s inline six excel in power delivery, it comes on strong when responses are called for, and it backs down calmly when more sedate cruising is the goal.</p>, <p>BMW’s smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission is so carefully tuned, it almost seems to know in advance exactly when it will be called upon to downshift. Even manual-shift fans are likely to nod in agreement over this automatic’s prowess.</p>, <p>Like any conventional-style performance SUV or crossover, the fashionable M40i doesn’t conceal its tall ride height. Essentially, it could be said that the driver sits atop the vehicle, rather than within it.</p>, <p>Standard all-wheel drive ordinarily splits power in a 40/60 ratio, front/rear, but can send every bit of it to the back wheels, if needed. A performance controller can split torque side-to-side, too. Unlike some AWD systems, BMW’s is intended for off-road use.</p>, <p>Optional adaptive dampers produce firmer suspension responses, enhancing comfort and flexibility.</p>, <p>As for fuel economy, the base X4 xDrive28i is EPA-rated at 20/28 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. The X4 M40i manages only 18/25 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Both X4 models are well-equipped, but priced relatively high for what amounts to a compact crossover, despite its coupelike roofline. Even the base version features wood accents in an upmarket interior. Considering its performance, features, options, and fine infotainment systems, it may rank as good value. Still, that sleek roofline, cutting into back-seat headroom, effectively turns the X4 into a veritable two-seater, at least for long treks.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mazda-cx-9/
[<p>The Mazda CX-9 is a handsome three-row crossover that blends sport and family functions. The handling is sharp and the ride firm, while carrying seven people in comfort.</p>, <p>It’s front-wheel drive, with available all-wheel drive sending up to 50 percent of the power to the rear wheels when they need it.</p>, <p>For 2018, Mazda CX-9 comes with G-vectoring, which cuts ignition spark to put a small amount of weight on the front tires, to make the handling more stable in corners. Otherwise, there are no major changes for the 2018 model year. The current-generation CX-9 was introduced as a 2016 model.</p>, <p>The CX-9 uses one engine, a 2.5-liter turbo making 250 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque, when Premium gas is used; however, it drops to 227 hp on Regular. The engine was named one of Wards “10 Best Engines” in 2017.</p>, <p>It’s mated to a quick six-speed automatic that’s smoother than rivals having eight, nine, or ten speeds. But its sporty nature is missing something: paddle shifters.</p>, <p>With front-wheel drive, CX-9 rates 22 miles per gallon City, 28 Highway, 24 Combined, according to the EPA; with 1 less combined mpg with all-wheel drive. That 6-speed automatic might be smoother than some with 9 or 10 speeds, but the reason for their being is to improve fuel mileage. So the CX-9 mileage suffers a bit.</p>, <p>With a long wheelbase of 115.3 inches and overall length of 199.4 inches, it’s bigger on the outside than the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander, but those inches mostly vanish on the inside, where Pilot and Highlander offer more space. The CX-9 wins back on cabin beauty and luxury feel, but loses again on tech, with mediocre connectivity and an infotainment system that has been behind rivals for at least two years.</p>, <p>For 2018, CX-9 comes with automatic emergency braking at low speeds, called Smart City Brake Support, along with blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The IIHS gives the CX-9 a Top Safety Pick Plus rating, but only the Grand Touring or Signature model with LED headlamps. The Sport and Touring models get a mere Marginal rating due to less-effective headlamps.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55490" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx9-2.jpg" width="200"/>The CX-9 Sport ($32,130) comes with cloth upholstery, three-zone climate control, and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Smart City Brake Support, blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert now come standard.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available for Sport, Touring, and Grand Touring ($1800). (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>CX-9 Touring ($34,960) includes leather upholstery, power heated front seats, push-button start, three-zone automatic climate control, two USB ports, Bluetooth audio streaming (no CD), rearview camera, 18-inch alloy wheels, an 8.0-inch screen, and LED headlamps.</p>, <p>Grand Touring ($40,470) adds lane-keep assist, lane departure alert, moonroof, adaptive cruise control, power liftgate, and upgraded infotainment with 8.0-inch screen. An option package adds automatic LED foglamps, navigation, Bose speakers, automatic windshield wipers, sunroof, SiriusXM satellite radio, 20-inch wheels, and head-up display.</p>, <p>Signature ($44,315) comes standard with all-wheel drive and adds Nappa leather, Japanese rosewood inlays, and real aluminum trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55486" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx9-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx9-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx9-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The CX-9 is elegant, with a long hood, tapered fenders, and dramatic (for an SUV) roofline. Its tall nose features a large but delicate grille that’s tilted at the top like a Volvo XC90, and LED headlamps; on the Signature, the grille has LED background lighting. The rear pillars arc upward. The wide stance gives an athletic look that could pass for Italian.</p>, <p>The CX-9 cabin is car-like, with a low shelf-like dashboard similar to the design in other Mazda vehicles. The materials feel upscale and expensive. The brown Nappa leather in our test Signature was gorgeous. The switchgear placement sometimes seems haphazard, and there’s a lot of glossy black plastic that will show smudges. The driver’s line of sight includes a 4.6-inch screen with trip information and functions.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55489" height="194" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx9-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The touchscreen sits awkwardly on the dash like a TV on a Motel 6 dresser (a design that makes it easier for the manufacturer to upgrade on later models). The radio is easy to tune, but the infotainment system feels dated. The system is menu intensive and takes too many clicks to program. The navigation system lags competitors. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity are not available.</p>, <p>The CX-9 has less room inside than its rivals, however the split-fold second row is on a sliding track, which allows one inch more legroom than the Pilot or Highlander. The rear seats recline but lack support from contour.</p>, <p>The front seats are spacious but firm, and also lack support. Good adjustment, and a tilt/telescope steering wheel, but a wide center console steals side legroom.</p>, <p>The third row is not for adults. Behind it, there’s only 14.4 cubic feet of cargo space. With the third row folded flat, there’s 38.2 cubic feet. The CX-9 works best like this, as a five-seat crossover.</p>, <p>With both rows folded, we fit in two kayaks and two electric bicycles. The only problem was that the liftgate wouldn’t close all the way, and there’s no way to shut off the beeper that warns you it’s open. So we drove all the way to the river with the radio on full blast to drown out the warning telling us what we obviously already knew.</p>, <p>For all it’s sporty slant, we’re not as entertained on the road as we should be. That’s unlike the CX-5, which we declared to be the most fun compact crossover we’ve ever driven. What was especially no fun was the Lane Keep Assist constantly telling us we were about to run off the curving two-lane road when we promise you, we were not.</p>, <p>The turbocharged 2.5-liter engine responds smoothly and quickly to make the most of its 250 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque, but the engine needs high-test gas to get that power. It runs fine on regular, but only makes 227 horsepower. Mazda says the difference only occurs above 4500 rpm, so it’s not something you’ll notice around town or even cruising on the freeway, just when you’re very hard on the throttle. There, it growls and strains a bit when it’s carrying five people. Some competitors with V6 engines are more powerful.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55487" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx9-driving.jpg" width="200"/>When it’s carrying just one, it feels super smooth and fast, accelerating onto the freeway.</p>, <p>The turbocharger was designed by Mazda, to respond without the lag that inherently comes with turbos, and the engineers succeeded in their goal. When you floor it from idle it lags for a second, but you don’t drive like that.</p>, <p>The CX-9 uses a simple suspension, struts in front and multilink in rear, to deliver a well-controlled ride with the standard 18-inch wheels. The brakes inspire confidence.</p>, <p>The steering is on the heavy side, with a medium amount of feel, making it a pleasure to drive on twisty roads. But the optional 20-inch alloy wheels deliver a firm ride that turns twitchy on rough roads. That’s because the sidewalls of the tires aren’t as wide as the standard 18-inchers, so there’s less absorption of the bumps. They run the dampers out of range.</p>, <p>With only six gears in the automatic transmission, against rivals that have as many as 10, the CX-9 looks behind them, but not necessarily. The 6-speed automatic easily keeps the engine in its powerband, and shifts smoother than some with more speeds, whose programming is more complicated, with more choices to get wrong.</p>, <p>Mazda’s G-vectoring is not the same as other cars’ torque vectoring. Torque vectoring uses the brakes on one side of a car to give a greater sense of grip or mitigate the effects of understeer. One consequence of that is the driver loses a sense of steering feel. G-Vectoring, on the other hand, cuts ignition spark to put a minimal amount of extra weight on the front tires, effectively creating a wider contact patch, stiffening the tire sidewall and creating more stable steering feel, both in straight lines and corners.</p>, <p>There is a transmission sport mode that raises the shift points, but there are no driving modes to change the throttle and steering response.</p>, <p>With no paddle shifters, no sporty modes, and a turbo four that’s sometimes stretched, the CX-9 can’t be called terribly sporty. It has elegant looks, but it’s not as roomy inside as it should be, and the third row is for kids. The infotainment system is easy to use but dated. We like the ride and steering the most.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-flex/
[<p>Introduced for the 2009 model year and facelifted for 2013, Ford’s sizable, defiantly squared-off crossover continues to stand apart from the crowd. The futuristic, space-age design isn’t quite as distinctive as it used to be, but the Ford Flex remains a practical, family-friendly utility vehicle.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Flex is a carryover, with little change evident from 2017.</p>, <p>2018 Flex SE, SEL, and Limited trim levels offer a choice of two V6 engines:</p>, <p>Standard is the long-lived 3.5-liter V6, rated at 287 horsepower and 254 pound-feet of torque and paired with Ford’s familiar 6-speed automatic transmission. With front-wheel drive, the base engine serves well enough. Because the Flex is no lightweight, optional all-wheel drive extracts quite a bit of its performance potential.</p>, <p>Optional is an Ecoboost twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 that develops 365 horsepower and 350 pound-feet, also working with a 6-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is standard on a Limited with the optional EcoBoost engine, adding $8,200 to the retail price of a regular front-wheel-drive Limited with the standard engine.</p>, <p>Three-row seating is standard, providing seven-passenger capacity. At 117.9 inches, the Flex wheelbase is almost 7 inches longer than that of a Honda Pilot.</p>, <p>Ford offers some valuable active-safety technology for the Flex, but most features are optional, and only for the most costly trim levels. The Limited model, for instance, comes with blind-spot monitoring. Adding forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, coupled with adaptive cruise control and a power-folding third-row seat, means paying $2,900 additional.</p>, <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave Flex Good scores for most crash-tests, with an Acceptable rating in the challenging small-overlap frontal-impact test.</p>, <p>All Flex crossovers have a rearview camera. Also standard is a system that can apply front braking to the outside wheel, intended to provide a more secure feeling when zipping through corners.</p>, <p>Ford’s optional MyKey system lets parents set limits on a youngster’s driving habits. MyKey can restrict vehicle speed, stereo volume, and various entertainment features. Additional Flex options include a panoramic sunroof, second-row captain’s chairs, a power-folding third-row seat, a heated steering wheel, and a towing package.</p>, <p>Flex SE ($30,300) has a 3.5-liter V6, 6-speed automatic, front-drive, three rows of seats, a second-row bench, Bluetooth-enabled and voice-controlled SYNC infotainment, 17-inch wheels, CD player, cloth seats, heated power mirrors, rear parking sensors, and a rearview camera. All-wheel drive is not available on the base model. (Prices do not include $895 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Flex SEL ($33,000) adds an 8.0-inch touchscreen, SYNC 3 infotainment, remote start, keyless ignition, heated power front seats, 18-inch wheels, woodgrain trim, and dual-zone automatic climate control. All-wheel drive adds $1,950.</p>, <p>Flex Limited ($38,510) gets 12-speaker Sony audio, perforated leather seat trim, power front seats with driver’s memory, navigation, power liftgate, 19-inch wheels, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. All-wheel drive adds $1,950.</p>, <p>Only the Limited is available with the optional twin-turbo, 365-horsepower EcoBoost V6 engine. Priced at $8,200 including all-wheel drive, the EcoBoost version has an MSRP of $45,105.</p>, <p>A $1,495 Limited appearance package adds Shadow Black exterior details, deluxe leather-trimmed seats, and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Not many vehicles brandish a body that’s so idiosyncratic. In stark contrast to the battling curves that have served as the main trend for recent crossovers, the Flex relies almost solely on angles and dead-straight lines. The boxy profile is highlighted by a pattern of grooved ribs reaching down its flat bodysides. Roofs can be black or body-colored, and the front end has been likened to a computer’s USB port.</p>, <p>Hints of several other makes, from Mini Cooper to Range Rover, might be discerned when viewing a Flex. Still, taken in total, this Ford is in a league all its own.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55480" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-flex-interior.jpg" width="200"/>More sedate than charming in its current form, the Flex cabin benefits from a simple and effective control layout, centering on a large touchscreen. Touch-sensitive controls, arranged in a stack, work efficiently. In base models, the standard infotainment screen measures only 4.3 inches.</p>, <p>Quiet operation adds to the premium feel of the Flex. Upper trim levels get leather seating surface in the front and second rows, along with a power liftgate.</p>, <p>Comfort and usable space score highly, thanks to the boxy profile. Headroom is especially appealing. Adults can expect excellent seat comfort in front and second rows, whether the latter has captain’s chairs or the standard fold-down bench. Amply-padded second-row seats can accommodate occupants who are quite tall.</p>, <p>Easing into the front seats is no problem, facing abundant knee and shoulder room. Side bolsters are soft, but effective.</p>, <p>Third-row seats are usable, too. For short treks, at least, even those tall riders can manage. For enhanced storage, the split rear seat folds in two matching sections. Cargo volume totals 20 cubic feet behind the third row, growing to 83 cubic feet if both the second- and third-row seatbacks are folded down.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55478" height="143" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-flex-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Comfort heads the list of Flex benefits. Specifically, ride comfort. Overall, the suspension is effectively compliant, though a fast-moving Flex can bound a bit in tight corners. Even the available 20-inch wheels don’t mar its smooth ride quality.</p>, <p>Standing tall and riding high, the Flex comports itself well. Considering that a heavyweight Flex tips the scales at around 4,600 pounds, handling is significantly better than expected.</p>, <p>Steering feels crisp, with even effort throughout its range. Brakes have plenty of stopping power.</p>, <p>Acceleration is adequate with the standard 287-horsepower V6, helped by a fuss-free automatic transmission. Still, a bit more energy would be welcome. That’s the job of the more exuberant twin-turbo V6, optional on the Limited, which provides some lusty sounds as well lively response to the gas pedal. Paddle shifters are included with the EcoBoost engine.</p>, <p>In either configuration, Flex borders on fun to drive. Both engines do a credible job of handling the Flex’s heft.</p>, <p>Gas mileage is well below average, trailing several three-row rivals. Base models with front-wheel drive and a V6 are EPA-rated at 16/23 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. With all-wheel drive, the estimate dips to 16/22/18 mpg. The twin-turbo V6 version is EPA-rated at 15/21 mpg City/Highway, or 17 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Despite its age, the Flex remains a solid competitor in the large family-vehicle category, helped by an impressive standard-feature list. While substituting for a minivan in utility, a Flex is priced more like a classy Lincoln. That’s almost logical, since the family-oriented Flex boasts a fair number of luxury-car touches. Advanced safety features are costly, too, offered mainly for Limited trim.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-edge/
[<p>The Ford Edge crossover SUV fits between the compact Escape and the large midsize Explorer. Now in its second generation, redesigned for the 2015 model year, the popular Edge is based upon the same foundation as the Ford Fusion sedan.</p>, <p>Except for a new option group, featuring gray wheels and trim pieces, little has changed for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p>Ford offers three engine possibilities and four trim levels: Edge SE, SEL, Titanium, and Sport. Base engine is a turbocharged four-cylinder, making 220 horsepower. When running on Premium (93-octane) gasoline, output escalates substantially: to 245 horsepower and 275 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>Next up is a 3.5-liter V6 that develops 280 horsepower and 250 pound-feet. Strong choice, standard in Sport trim, is a twin-turbo, 2.7-liter V6 that generates 315 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque when running on Premium-grade gasoline.</p>, <p>Each engine mates with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive an option. The Sport edition comes only with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>As expected by its dimensions, the Edge is more spacious inside than Ford’s Escape. In terms of appearance, it’s sleeker than the huge Expedition with its truck foundation, or even the unibodied Explorer.</p>, <p>Like many vehicles today, the Edge can be equipped with some of the latest active-safety technology. But most features are optional rather than standard, available only on upper trim levels. Available safety systems include blind-spot monitoring, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and a 180-degree front-end camera setup.</p>, <p>All Edges have a rearview camera and a driver’s knee airbag. Inflatable rear seatbelts are optional. Top Edge models get a large, configurable instrument cluster to replace the usual gauge setup.</p>, <p>Except for one instance, crash-test scores have been good. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave Ford’s Edge a five-star overall rating, with five stars for individual tests as well. Crash-testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety resulted in Good scores, with the exception of an Acceptable rating for the more stringent small-overlap frontal-impact test. That score kept Edge from receiving a Top Safety Pick designation.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55471" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Ford Edge SE ($29,220) comes with the 2.0-liter turbo four engine, 6-speed automatic, cloth seats, air conditioning, cruise control, SYNC, a six-speaker AM/FM/CD player, and 18-inch alloy wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $895 destination charge.)</p>, <p>All-wheel drive ($1,995) is available on many models. Front-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>Edge SEL ($31,955) adds power front seats, rear parking sensors, LED signature lighting, satellite radio, dual-zone automatic climate control, and heated power mirrors. Options include the 3.5-liter V6 engine, heated seats, blind-spot monitoring, and navigation.</p>, <p>Edge Titanium ($35,930) gets a 12-speaker Sony audio system, heated front seats, hands-free liftgate, SYNC 3 infotainment, a sunroof, and 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Edge AWD Sport ($40,675) has distinctive styling cues, a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6, all-wheel drive, a sport-tuned suspension, adaptive steering, SYNC 3, leather-trimmed seats with sueded cloth inserts, a hands-free liftgate, and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55474" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Similarities to Ford’s other crossover SUVs are minimal. Designers chose instead to give the Edge a clean, more spartan appearance. Few suggestions of the familiar tough-truck, hard-duty themes are evident. As a result, the Edge seems more likely to deliver longer-lasting appeal than some companions and competitors.</p>, <p>At the same time, nothing about the design is likely to alter the entire crossover-SUV category. For instance, the front end is appropriately slanted, while the Edge profile includes somewhat thick pillars. An appropriate-size grille neatly balances the relatively large front end.</p>, <p>Although the Edge cabin is subtle, if not austere, its materials are nicely textured. Plentiful space for people and cargo adds to its appeal. So do the soft-touch surfaces and the comparatively tall dashboard, though considerable glossy black trim is used.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55475" height="199" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-interior-150x150.jpg 150w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-interior-95x95.jpg 95w" width="200"/>Seats are less appealing, those in front suffering from skimpy padding and flat,short cushioning. Supportive bolsters are largely absent, detracting further from comfort.</p>, <p>The back seat amounts to little more than a flat, rather hard bench. Installation of a panoramic sunroof cuts significantly into headroom.</p>, <p>Rear seatbacks recline and fold to create a large cargo well. Volume behind the second-row seats total 39.2 cubic feet, expanding to 73.4 cubic feet with the seatbacks folded. Small-item storage is bountiful.</p>, <p>In the Sport edition, perforated-leather front seats lack bolstering and contouring, but lateral support beats that of the regular seats.</p>, <p>Actual knobs, buttons, and switches control many functions. Controls for the climate system are helpfully identified. Active noise cancellation quiets the cabin, though not in every model.</p>, <p>Quick, nicely <img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55473" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-edge-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>weighted steering helps give any Edge an eager feel. Steering and ride control don’t differ much from the related Fusion sedan. Ford’s electric power steering has ample on-center feel and tracks neatly on the highway.</p>, <p>Parking maneuvers can be accomplished without struggling back and forth with the steering wheel. Adaptive steering, standard on Titanium and Sport models, amplifies effort at lower speeds. Brakes can seem a little touchy at times, but they produce reassuring halts.</p>, <p>Unless big tires are mounted, the Edge’s ride is carefully composed and admirably controlled. The combination of a stiff body and an independent suspension translates to precision road feel and excellent body stability.</p>, <p>Performance is satisfying with any engine. Budget-minded buyers should appreciate the standard 220-horsepower turbo four, which develops smooth power even at low-end speeds, with little turbo lag.</p>, <p>Though low-end torque is less evident from the optional 3.5-liter V6, passing power beats that of the turbo power. More traditional than the turbo, the V6 ranks as a reliable all-around performer. Transmission downshifts are quick and crisp with each engine.</p>, <p>More than some vehicles dubbed Sport, the Edge variant deserves its model designation but suffers a stiff ride, battling potholes and harsh pavement. Special steering ensures lower-speed agility, but stiffer shock absorbers roughen the experience. Enthusiasts are likely to enjoy ts responsive turbo V6 and quick steering, along with the taut ride and gurgling exhaust.</p>, <p>Real-world fuel economy might fall short of EPA estimates. A 2017 base Edge with 2.0-liter turbo four was EPA-rated at 20/29 mpg City/Highway, or 24 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive was rated at 20/27/23 mpg. The 3.5-liter V6 was EPA-rated at 17/26 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined with front-drive. The all-wheel-drive Sport edition, with twin-turbo V6, was rated at 17/24/19 mpg.</p>, <p>Exuding an uncomplicated aura, any Edge delivers a pleasant drive, helped by sharp road behavior. Four trim levels should appeal to quite a range of crossover-SUV customers. Lower-end models may compete against Honda and Hyundai compact crossovers. A stiff ride limits the appeal of the Sport model.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-subaru-outback/
[<p>A five-passenger wagon, the Subaru Outback is a compelling alternative to taller SUVs, offering excellent capability in all types of weather and brilliant handling on unpaved roads. Outback blends features of compact crossovers, SUVs, and small wagons.</p>, <p>Its superb all-wheel drive and long-travel suspensions were developed while winning world rally championships. Its Porsche-like horizontally opposed engines lower its center of gravity for improved handling dynamics, while a generous ground clearance allows quick travel on primitive roads and capability in rugged terrain. On paved roads, it feels smooth and refined, on wet roads it feels safe and secure.</p>, <p>The current Outback is in its fifth generation and was last redesigned for the 2015 model year.</p>, <p>The 2018 Outback features revised styling, with new headlights, grille, bumpers, and mirrors. An updated infotainment system features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. A new safety system locks doors when the 2018 Outback reaches 12.5 mph. Subaru claims reductions in wind, road, and engine noise. Improvements may be modest in scope, but they boost the refinement of a vehicle that’s already impressive.</p>, <p>Four trim levels are available: base, Premium, Limited, and Touring. Most Outbacks have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, horizontally opposed (flat) engine, making 175 horsepower and 174 pound-feet of torque. We’ve found</p>, <p>A more powerful, smoother-running 3.6-liter flat-six is optional for Limited and Touring models. Developing 256 horsepower and 247 pound-feet, the six-cylinder engine consumes more fuel.</p>, <p>All Outbacks use a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Outbacks are based upon Subaru’s midsize Legacy sedan. An elevated suspension, hefty roof rack, and unpainted black body trim raise its stature in terms of perceived capability.</p>, <p>An impressive 8.7 inches of ground clearance helps boost the utility factor. Outbacks are not meant for serious off-roading, but they’re capable of conquering quite a few obstacles and inclines after the pavement ends.</p>, <p>Every Outback has eight airbags and a rearview camera. Subaru’s EyeSight suite of advanced safety technology is standard on the Touring edition and optional for Premium and Limited. It’s not available with base trim. The EyeSight group includes such features as automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, active lane control, and lane-departure warning. Subaru installs forward-facing cameras inside the windshield, where they’re less likely to be impeded by debris or snow/ice.</p>, <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2018 Outback Good scores on each crash test. When fitted with the EyeSight group, it earned a Top Safety Pick Plus award, and was rated Superior for front crash prevention.</p>, <p>In crash-testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2018 Outback earned five stars overall and for frontal- and side-impact. Only the rollover rating (a calculated score) dipped to four stars, which is typical for taller vehicles.</p>, <p>Outback 2.5i ($25,895) comes with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive, 17-inch alloy wheels, cloth upholstery, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, and roof rails. The 6.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Outback 2.5i Premium ($27,995) adds a power driver’s seat, heated front seats and mirrors, 8.0-inch touchscreen, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Two option packages include the EyeSight safety suite.</p>, <p>Outback 2.5i Limited ($32,695) includes perforated leather-trimmed upholstery, Harman Kardon audio, 18-inch wheels, blind-spot monitoring, power front seats, heated rear seats, pushbutton start, power liftgate, and moonroof. An option group adds EyeSight and navigation. Outback 2.5i Touring ($36,490) features black cladding, dark gray wheels, Java brown leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, lower-profile roof rack, woodgrain trim, and EyeSight safety group.</p>, <p>Outback 3.6R Limited ($35,395) and 3.6R Touring ($38,690) get the 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $915 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55467" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-outback-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The styling has been revised for 2018, led by a new grille and bumpers, but the changes aren’t easy to discern. Though closely related to the Subaru Legacy sedan, the Outback conveys an outdoor-oriented demeanor, reinforced by bodyside cladding,</p>, <p>The hefty roof rack that comes on most models is highly functional, with stowable crossbars. A slimmer rack is used on Touring models, and cross bars are optional rather than standard.</p>, <p>Comfortable and roomy inside, the Outback features a particularly functional, cleanly designed dashboard. Soft-touch materials appear here and there. Limited and Touring editions combine simulated wood with genuine leather. Most Outbacks have French stitching on seats and dashboards.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55466" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-outback-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-outback-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-outback-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Cloth upholstery in base and Premium models feels durable, while upper-trim Outbacks look and feel upscale.</p>, <p>Not only are front seats comfortable, they provide great views, especially useful for the driver. Nicely supportive and well-bolstered, they are mounted on long seat bases.</p>, <p>The center stack is not the prettiest, if sitting in the seat admiring the interior is something you like to do. Once underway, however, the controls for climate and audio prove to be ergonomically excellent, making it easy to changes settings in a flash. For example, one highly visible button turns on the seat heater; no need to work through menus as other automakers have you do. The navigation map on the center stack is big and easy to read, better than most of them. The radio on our test car annoyingly turned on every time the car was started.</p>, <p>Back-seat riders can rejoice, because they get plenty of space: 38.1 inches of legroom, to be precise. Additional sound deadening and laminated side glass for 2018 help curtail wind and road noise, making an already-quiet vehicle even more hushed.</p>, <p>Raising the tailgate reveals 35.5 cubic feet of cargo volume, with rear seatbacks upright. Fold those seats and cargo space grows to 73 cubic feet. Liftover height is far lower than competitors provide.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55465" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-outback-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-outback-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-outback-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>In addition to practical merits, Outbacks ride and handle well. In each version, crisp, carlike steering is complemented by a supple ride. Outbacks promise comfortable, composed motoring, even better for 2018, due to suspension tweaks. Limited and Touring models ride a little firmer, but differences are subtle.</p>, <p>Rolling through winding roads, an Outback is easy to enjoy. Standard torque vectoring can brake each wheel individually, to improve stability during brisk cornering.</p>, <p>The base four-cylinder yields adequate acceleration, feeling almost lively in urban driving. Passing power diminishes on upgrades and at higher altitudes. The 2.5-liter four-cylinder sounds rough and noisy at times, especially when slowly lugging up hills. The continuously variable transmission, or CVT, stresses smoothness. It’s an improvement over the rubber band feel of earlier CVTs, but there is still that feeling of elasticity between the power pedal and engine response. Using the shifter paddles on the steering wheel, the driver can induce the CVT to mimic a conventional automatic transmission with gears: Pull back on a paddle and the transmission will feel like it is downshifting to a lower ratio for quicker acceleration.</p>, <p>Subaru’s 3.6-liter six is smoother and produces greater thrust. Six-cylinder Outbacks accelerate effectively, even when filled with passengers and luggage. We prefer the responsiveness and power of the six-cylinder. The six-cylinder engine costs more, however, and it is only available on upper models. And fuel economy is lower.</p>, <p>Either way, the Outback is ready for gravel roads and two-tracks. Its 8.7-inch ground clearance helps it on rough roads, though it’s limited by long front and rear overhangs that might scrape on primitive trails. An X-Mode off-road setting alters throttle response and traction-control operation, while engaging hill-descent control helps the driver maintain control on steep, slimy downhills. We found the Bridgestone Dueler all-season tires on one of our test models lacked grip on packed snow at low temperatures. Real snow tires would turn one of these cars into an unstoppable winter machine. For fast travel on gravel roads, these cars are among the best.</p>, <p>On paved roads for everyday driving, the Outback is fairly smooth and reasonably quiet. It handles very well. The suspension is relatively soft and offers a relatively large amount of travel, great on rough roads. It’s easy and enjoyable to drive quickly on smooth, winding roads, but it doesn’t offer the crisp transient response of an Audi with a sports suspension.</p>, <p>Subaru’s four-cylinder engine is impressively thrifty, EPA-rated at 25/32 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined. Fuel-efficiency isn’t the forte of six-cylinder models, EPA-rated at only 20/27 mpg City/Highway, or 22 mpg Combined. Both engines use Regular-grade gasoline, while some of the competition requires more expensive, higher-octane Premium.</p>, <p>The Subaru Outback is a practical wagon with outstanding all-weather capability and excellent handling in slippery conditions. Well-equipped in each trim level, the Outback blends impressive utility with a classy cabin.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mazda-cx-5/
[<p>The Mazda CX-5 is a midsize crossover that delivers crisp driving response with practical cargo and people hauling capability. Rivals include the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and Subaru Forester.</p>, <p>The CX-5 was redesigned for 2017, with a retuned engine, stiffer chassis with wider track, more stylish exterior, better-looking and much quieter cabin, and many detail improvements. So for 2018 there are no changes, except for the addition of some equipment, for a very small increase in price.</p>, <p>Standard is a 2.5-liter gas engine that makes 187 horsepower, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The powertrain of the CX-5 is crisp, and the steering precise, thanks to the rigidity of the chassis, as well as its standard brake-based torque vectoring system that shifts torque to outside wheels in corners. The CX-5’s excellent handling makes it more fun to drive than the other compact crossovers. Ford and Subaru off more powerful turbocharged engines.</p>, <p>The CX-5 is small for a compact crossover, with a wheelbase of 106.3 inches and overall length of 179.1. As a result, it has less room inside than the Honda CR-V and Nissan Rogue. But that same trait makes it easier to park and enhances its responsive handling.</p>, <p>Fuel mileage is 24 miles per gallon city, 31 highway, and 27 combined with front-wheel drive, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The 2016 CX-5 earned Top Safety Pick+ of the insurance industry’s IIHS, so the 2018 model should equal that, with the stiffer chassis including stiffer roof pillars.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55453" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx5-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2017 Mazda CX-5 comes in Sport ($24,150); Touring ($26,215); and Grand Touring ($29,645). All-wheel drive is optional ($1300); front-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>CX-5 Sport comes with LED headlamps, 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, rearview camera; cloth upholstery, and two USB chargers that can charge bigger things.</p>, <p>CX-5 Touring adds leatherette upholstery, acoustic front windows, power driver’s seat, heated front seats, better six-speaker sound system, rear USB ports, and blind-spot monitors. An optional package ($780) adds automatic headlamps, navigation, power liftgate, and Bose 10-speaker sound. Another package includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning ($625).</p>, <p>Grand Touring models add leather and 19-inch wheels to the above. Options beyond that include heated rear seats and a new head-up display.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55456" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx5-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The CX-5 is an eye-catching compact crossover. It doesn’t look boxy. It states style. The styling changes made for 2017 were subtle, and should hold up for years.</p>, <p>It’s a cliche to say a car looks like it’s moving when it’s standing still, but it’s a near-impossibility to say that about a crossover. However we will say it about the CX-5.</p>, <p>The front pillars are pushed back, and the shoulders follow. There’s a slim chrome boomerang under the windows to accelerate the flow. The mesh grille is classier than chrome bars in other SUVs, a bold rounded trapezoid that reaches toward LED headlamps. The black cladding is thin and the taillamps are tidy.</p>, <p>The CX-5 cabin is much like that of the more deluxe CX-9. It’s enhanced by some of the details that were addressed for 2017, for example clean interior lighting, a tidy steering wheel, and a shift lever located in a natural position for the driver’s hand. Mazda pays close attention to ergonomics. The pushed-back A pillars allow good visibility from the driver’s seat, and better ergonomics because the armrests are raised to a more natural position.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55457" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx5-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx5-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx5-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Thanks to the addition of nearly 100 pounds of sound-deadening material, the cabin is as quiet as a Lexus. However, cabin engineers missed a couple things. The 7.0-inch touchscreen sits atop the dash, a bit too far away, and reflects smudges. The resolution is sharp, but the infotainment system is finicky; things like programming presets or entering destinations take more touches than should be necessary, and the controller on the center console is a bit hard to grip.</p>, <p>Mazda takes a Spartan approach to infotainment. This works when it makes things simple, but it’s difficult to find a happy functioning medium.</p>, <p>There’s decent shoulder room in the rear, with rear doors that open wide. Thanks to scalloping in the back of the front seats, there’s enough legroom for a six-footer in the rear, although three of them might push the comfort level a bit. The rear seat reclines, another feature new for 2017.</p>, <p>Behind the rear seat, there’s 31 cubic feet of storage, and 60 cubic with the rear folded flat. That’s quite decent, although a bit less than those competitors we’ve mentioned, the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, and Subaru Forester. However we can state that we stuffed a ton of stuff inside, including furniture, along with a kayak and four Jeep tires on the roof, to take a kid back to college.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55458" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx5-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The response in every direction feels finely tuned. Mazda nailed it. We’re not surprised.</p>, <p>The performance is sharp from the engine, transmission, and especially the steering. The throttle response is quite sharp, which encourages smooth driving; that also means it’s not very forgiving of a loose or unthinking foot, but we’ll take that over sloppy any day.</p>, <p>The transmission is programmed to stay in gear for a bit longer under acceleration, which you especially feel when the car is accelerating onto freeways. It knows where it is, at least most of the time, by reading your foot.</p>, <p>We got about 150 miles of seat time at the launch of the CX-5, and then another full week carrying around equipment like kayaks and bikes. That time was all on models with 19-inch wheels, rather than the standard 17s. The ride is usually firmer with bigger wheels because the tire sidewalls are thinner, but ours didn’t feel stiff. Most of the bumps were soaked up by the independent front suspension and multi-link rear. The steering rack is mounted directly to the front suspension for more sensitivity, and better feedback. But not too much, on bumpy roads.</p>, <p>The precise cornering comes with progressive steering that’s firm but not heavy. The torque vectoring helps cut down head toss. Torque vectoring works by making tiny adjustments to the power and traction in individual wheels, in the corners; this improves balance which makes steering and handling sharper and more accurate. That’s what the driver feels: precision and better balance.</p>, <p>Long list of exceptionals here, starting with the big four: powertrain, handling, looks and cabin. When you’re tops in those four, you’re virtually for sure the best in class. Infotainment might be the only area where it doesn’t beat its rivals. In short, the Mazda CX-5 is hands-down a winner.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-hyundai-tucson/
[<p>The Hyundai Tucson is the smallest of the brand’s compact crossovers. Last redesigned for the 2016 model year, Tucson is in its third generation.</p>, <p>Some equipment groups have been adjusted for the 2018 model year. What had been the SE Popular Equipment Package has been renamed SEL, adding a 7.0-inch display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. SE Plus, introduced during 2017, is now SEL Plus. During 2017, Sport trim was replaced by Value trim. SiriusXM radio is now included with SEL trim, rather than SE. HD radio now is standard in SEL trim and up. Only the SE edition now gets a CD player. Limited AWD models include a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>Focusing on utility rather than passion, the South Korean automaker maintains a relatively simple, yet engaging design theme. Blending refined ride quality with quiet dependability, the Tucson doesn’t necessarily excel in any specific attribute. Passenger space and performance might trail some rivals, but a Tucson can be counted on to simply accomplish its mission effectively.</p>, <p>Hyundai offers five Tucson trim levels: SE, SEL, Value, Eco, and Limited. In base Tucsons, a 164-horsepower four-cylinder engine mates with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Also available is a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder, producing 175 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission couples with the turbo. Front-drive is standard, with all-wheel drive an option.</p>, <p>Tucson Eco is rated by EPA at 26/32/28 mpg City/Highway/Combined.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55443" height="142" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-tucson-2.jpg" width="200"/>Every Tucson has a rearview camera, but advanced safety technology is largely restricted to the Limited trim level, at best.</p>, <p>Crash-test scores have been good, though ratings are not yet available for 2018 models. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2017 Tucson a five-star overall rating, with five stars for both frontal and side impacts. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave Tucson a Top Safety Pick award. A weaker score for headlights kept the Tucson from earning Top Safety Pick+ status.</p>, <p>Only the most costly model includes forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Both Value and Limited editions feature blind-spot monitoring, and the Limited adds lane-departure warning and parking sensors.</p>, <p>Rather than offer option packages, Hyundai bundles a number of features into specific trim levels. They include leather upholstery, navigation, a panoramic sunroof, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p>Tucson SE ($22,700) comes with the 164-hp 2.0-liter engine and 6-speed automatic, plus air conditioning, cruise control, a rearview camera, Bluetooth with audio streaming, a 5.0-inch infotainment touchscreen, CD player, and 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Tucson Eco ($24,150) gets the turbo-four engine, dual-clutch transmission, special wheels and tires.</p>, <p>Tucson Value Edition ($26,550) upgrades to the turbocharged engine and adds rear parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, pushbutton start, a hands-free power liftgate, panoramic sunroof, and 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Tucson Limited ($29,775) features leather seating surfaces, power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a hands-free liftgate, 8.0-inch touchscreen with navigation, and 19-inch wheels. The Ultimate option package includes active-safety features. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55446" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-tucson-rear.jpg" width="200"/>No awkward body lines or tacky flaws mar the skillfully crafted sheetmetal of the Tucson. It’s a model of simplicity and clean design, highlighted by short window area.</p>, <p>The Tucson’s six-edged grille isn’t far removed from other Hyundai crossover front ends. Neither are the geometrically derived headlights. Viewed from the side, in fact, the Tucson looks like a downsized duplicate of the large three-row Santa Fe. Inspiration probably came from the midlevel Santa Fe Sport, too.</p>, <p>The Hyundai Tucson is a little smaller than the Honda CR-V.</p>, <p>For a more majestic look, the 19-inch wheels on upper trim levels might be worth considering.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55447" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-tucson-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-tucson-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-tucson-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Tucson’s conservatively designed cabin is scrupulously arranged. The base Tucson SE suffers from hard plastic trim, but upper-level models have less of the tawdry plastic marring the view of interior surfaces. Leather-upholstered Limited editions feature soft-touch plastics, plus stitching atop the gauges.</p>, <p>Also laid out carefully, the dashboard conveys a look of elegant simplicity. Positioning of instruments and controls is excellent, and no nonessential graphics clutter the dials. Some functions are controlled by console buttons; others belong to the touchscreen. One caution: many knobs and buttons are similarly shaped, thus demanding a quick glance before adjusting.</p>, <p>Front and rear seats are carefully-shaped for four adults. Front occupants enjoy amply-bolstered, comfortable seats, regardless of trim level.</p>, <p>Rear seatbacks are rather upright, but can be reclined. Tall riders can expect abundant space, with good clearance for heads and knees. A fifth passenger, however, is likely to feel squeezed.</p>, <p>Cargo space trails that of some competitors, including the Honda CR-V. Volume totals 30.1 cubic feet, growing to 61.9 cubic feet when seatbacks are folded. In addition, the cargo floor can be lowered.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55445" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-tucson-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Despite being smaller than some rivals, the Tucson’s suspension and tires yield a well-damped, controlled ride. Only with 19-inch wheels does the ride turn firm. Still, some jarring can occur, at least for an instant, when crossing expansion joints or tackling harsh pavement.</p>, <p>Sportiness is minimal, as the Tucson focuses on predictable handling. That’s typical in the small-crossover category, as is largely lifeless electric power steering.</p>, <p>Not only is the SE’s base engine short on power, it’s not more frugal with fuel than the more satisfying turbo four used in the other models.</p>, <p>Smooth-running and more than sufficiently powered for typical usage, even the turbo can feel limited when filled with people and luggage. Shifts from the turbo’s dual-clutch automatic transmission occur smoothly, without notable delay. Even in Sport mode, though, takeoffs can feel somewhat sluggish. When starting off, the non-turbo engine actually feels a tad more responsive.</p>, <p>On slippery surfaces with optional all-wheel drive, a switch can lock the torque split between front and rear wheels, for best low-speed traction. All-wheel drive also includes torque vectoring, which enhances cornering performance.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is decent, especially with turbo power. The 2017 model with 2.0-liter engine and front-drive was EPA-rated at 23/30 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined. All-wheel-drive lowered the estimate to 21/26/23 mpg.</p>, <p>With the 1.6-liter turbo, front-drive Tucsons were EPA-rated at 25/30 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined. All-wheel dropped that estimate to 24/28/25 mpg. Tucson Eco with front-drive was EPA-rated at 26/32 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined, dipping to 25/30/27 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Every Tucson trim level is reasonably well-equipped., though not many options are available for personalization. Midlevel models tend to be the most satisfying compromise in value, and turbo engines are the most rewarding to drive. Hyundai’s excellent warranty raises the desirability quotient.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mazda-cx-3/
[<p>The 2018 Mazda CX-3 has been significantly improved over the 2017 version of the subcompact crossover. It’s nothing you can see, and it’s not easy for a manufacturer to hype, but a number of updates improve the car: new suspension bushings, control arms, engine mounts and more sound-deadening material. Such improvements occur year after year, with Mazda, and many updates go unreported.</p>, <p>The CX-3, built on the platform of the subcompact Mazda 2, was introduced for 2016, and has sold well. It’s sporty, attractive, practical, affordable, economical, and fun to drive.</p>, <p>The CX-3 is front-wheel drive, with available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55437" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx3-2.jpg" width="200"/>It uses one powertrain, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. With a modest 146 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque, it manages to deliver enthusiasm and energy not often found in the crossover SUV world, while bringing EPA-rated mileage of 31 Combined miles per gallon, among the best in its class. Its top rival might be the Honda HR-V, which gets similar mileage. Another competitor, the Chevrolet Trax, gets similar mileage, as well.</p>, <p>The CX-3 gets top crash ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with five stars overall, including for frontal and side impacts (four stars for rollover). The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the CX-3 its top Good ratings in each test, naming it a Top Safety Pick Plus.</p>, <p>For the top CX-3 Grand Touring model, there is an available group of active safety features, including lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, adaptive headlights, automatic emergency braking, and rain-sensing wipers. It’s called i-ActivSense, and is affordably priced.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55436" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx3-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Mazda CX-3 Sport ($19,960) includes air conditioning, Mazda Connect infotainment with a 7-inch touchscreen, rearview camera, cruise control, power windows/locks, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, keyless start, and Bluetooth streaming audio and phone connectivity. Six airbags are standard.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard. All-wheel drive is available for all models ($1,250). (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>CX-3 Touring ($21,960) adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, six-speaker sound, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and heated mirrors. An optional Tech Package includes premium Bose audio, a panoramic moonroof, satellite radio, HD radio, and a cargo cover.</p>, <p>Grand Touring ($24,990) comes with paddle shifters, a head-up display, leather seat upholstery with suede inserts, heated front seats, LED adaptive headlights, LED foglamps and taillights, Bose seven-speaker audio, satellite radio, navigation, and automatic climate control. The i-ActivSense is optional ($1,170).</p>, <p>In a world of look-alike crossovers, the CX-3 stands out. Its stylish exterior follows Mazda’s Kodo design language, developed some years ago. It’s simple but not dull.</p>, <p>The sheetmetal blends sensuous and flowing forms with gently complex shapes, to come up with a profile that’s both athletic and elegant.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55434" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx3-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The cabin is sporty and tasteful, things not generally found in a subcompact crossover. It feels like the stylish Mazda3 hatchback. The instrument panel is neatly laid out, with surrounding soft-touch components, giving a premium look and feel. The climate controls are sturdy, the steering wheel simple and modern.</p>, <p>Unfortunately the monochrome gauges overdo the minimalism, and bring basic down to a feeling of low-budget. The head-up display that’s standard in the Grand Touring model brings it back up a bit, but the display isn’t crisp enough.</p>, <p>The cabin space is more or less good for a subcompact, in some places more good than others. In the front seats there’s enough head, leg, and shoulder room, but the rear seat is less inviting. Legroom is about the same as a BMW 3 Series, but the CX-3’s sloping roofline sharply reduces head room in the rear.</p>, <p>The rear seats fold down to expand the storage space onto a flat cargo floor. We love this in a subcompact crossover. The sloping liftgate, so stylish from the exterior, doesn’t significantly affect the space inside. With the rear seat up, the cargo capacity is an acceptable 12.4 cubic feet, growing to an impressive 44.5 cubic feet with the seatbacks down.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55435" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-cx3-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The CX-3 delivers brisk performance and sharp handling for the class.</p>, <p>When you step on the gas, the 146-horsepower engine responds smartly. The CX-3 weighs a mere 2,809 pounds, and that helps. All-wheel drive adds about 143 pounds, and lowers the fuel mileage by 2 mpg, but it doesn’t detract from the CX-3’s acceleration or ability to maneuver nimbly through corners.</p>, <p>Mazda is known for sharp dynamics and a superior driving experience, and the CX-3 does not betray that. That’s saying something for a subcompact crossover. Its personality is sporty and its road feel abundant. It inspires a refreshing level of confidence along with the motoring pleasures.</p>, <p>On the highway and during suburban jaunts, the 2.0-liter engine typically purrs quietly. In the city, however, especially when merging into traffic, you can hear it growl. Pushed hard in Sport mode, the engine responds vigorously, willing to rev toward its 6500-rpm limit. But the sound it makes isn’t so satisfying.</p>, <p>Paddle shifters are standard on the Grand Touring, but unavailable for Sport or Touring editions. The 6-speed automatic on those models may be manually-shifted using a gate on the gearshift lever.</p>, <p>The Mazda CX-3 is sporty, attractive, practical, affordable, economical, and fun to drive. It’s safe and has vast cargo space for a subcompact crossover. Mostly, it’s quick and nimble compared with the rest of the class.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-x1/
[<p>The BMW X1 crossover is built on the front-wheel-drive Mini platform, which technically makes it a subcompact crossover, but it appears much bigger than that because of its height.</p>, <p>The X1 was redesigned for 2016, and for 2017 front-wheel-drive was offered in addition to all-wheel drive. For 2018, a rearview camera is added as standard equipment, and some optional packages have changed.</p>, <p>BMW X1 rivals might include the Acura RDX, Volvo, or a Ford Escape Titanium. More optimistically, BMW sees the X1 competing with the Range Rover Evoque and Audi Q3.</p>, <p>Handling is pleasant but uninspired; and with front-wheel drive it could be a small Ford or Kia. For a BMW, X1 is inexpensive. Interior materials, and the front-wheel-drive platform, reflect that.</p>, <p>The BMW X1 uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, mated to a paddle-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. It’s really quick, maybe the best thing about it, with strong power for passing.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X1 rates an EPA-estimated 23/32 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined with front-wheel drive, one mile per gallon lower with xDrive all-wheel drive. The IIHS gives it its best rating, Top Safety Pick Plus.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55427" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2018 BMW X1 sDrive28i ($33,900) comes with front-wheel drive; X1 xDrive28i ($35,900) comes with all-wheel drive. Leatherette upholstery is standard. (All prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>X1 sDrive28i Convenience Tier ($36,400) includes SiriusXM, panoramic moonroof and other features, while Premium Tier ($39,700) adds navigation and active-safety features. The Luxury Package ($1550) upgrades to leather upholstery and premium trim materials.</p>, <p>With the twin-kidney grille, the X1 is clearly a BMW, and with its height and greenhouse it’s clearly a crossover, not a stylish BMW wagon.</p>, <p>The big nostrils of the grille are framed by cat’s eye headlamps, with icing-like sculpting that stretches down the sides of the car to the high taillamps. Dark cladding wraps around the rear and touches the low air intakes up front.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55429" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The dashboard looks smart, with its big round analog gauges, but the standard interior materials don’t meet the quality expected in a premium vehicle. The front seats are inadequate in thigh bolstering and thin on back support. We haven’t tried the sport seats.</p>, <p>The back seats are comfortable, however. There’s good headroom, thanks to the height, and generous legroom in the rear for a subcompact, although not enough width back there for three adults. The seats are easy to climb in and out of, thanks to wide door openings. There is an available rear seat that reclines and slides rearward by five inches. Forward, if cargo space is needed.</p>, <p>Cargo space is good for a subcompact crossover, a bit less than a compact. It’s 27.1 cubic feet with the rear seat up and 58.7 cubic feet with it down. That’s more than the Audi Q3 or Range Rover Evoque, but way less than a Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4.</p>, <p>The low dashboard and fairly thin windshield pillars allows excellent visibility.</p>, <p>We like the optional wood trim and leather with contrasting stitching, and the head-up display, and the 8.8-inch touchscreen that’s mounted on top of the center console festooned with audio and climate buttons. The screen comes with a touchpad on the iDrive knob.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter turbo engine, with 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, accelerates from zero to sixty in 6.4 seconds. That’s very quick for the fast and quick by any standard. The X1 inspires confidence in traffic. It responds like a BMW when you put your foot down.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55428" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-x1-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The speed-sensitive electric power steering is quick and well weighted, and although it’s lacking in BMW feel, but you can still run the X1 on twisty roads harder than rivals. The good brakes complement such conditions.</p>, <p>The X1 ride is comfortable as it is, even on standard 18-inch wheels with run-flat all-season tires; conventional all-season tires with a space-saver spare are available at no extra cost.</p>, <p>The Driving Dynamic Control modes are Sport, Comfort, and Eco Pro, which change the sensitivity of the steering, throttle, and transmission. Not surprisingly, given the intent of the X1, we found a significant difference between the settings, as it’s supposed to be. Power is quite slow to arrive in Eco Pro, medium slow in Comfort, and quicker in Sport, or if you’re using manual control in the shift gate or the paddleshifters. In any mode other than Sport, the transmission resists shifting down during uphill acceleration.</p>, <p>BMW’s all-wheel drive xDrive uses a clutch and hydraulic pump system that can shift 100 percent of the power to the rear wheels in a small fraction of a second. Our seat time included some miles in the mountains on roads with rocks and mud from recent landslides. The X1’s good ground clearance was useful, however, on some gravelly spots, we lost some confidence along with lost traction. A Range Rover, Volvo, Audi, or Subaru exudes more confidence on gravel.</p>, <p>The BMW X1 is a sweet subcompact crossover SUV, with a strong powertrain, excellent safety, and good fuel mileage. Its base price is attractive, but the base car isn’t so much. It takes options and money to make the X1 excellent.</p>, <p>Sam Moses wrote this review, with staff reports by The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-lexus-nx/
[<p>Expressive design melds with comfortable accommodations in the Lexus NX compact luxury crossover. Introduced for the 2015 model year, NX is the smallest member of the Lexus crossover family.</p>, <p>All 2018 Lexus NX models received a mild facelift. The spindle grille has been modified, and front/rear lights redesigned. The Lexus Safety System Plus package is now standard, and the contents of Comfort and Luxury option packages have been revised.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year, Lexus has renamed the model previously known as NX 200t to NX 300.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus NX comes in three versions, with a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive: NX 300, NX 300 F Sport, and NX 300h hybrid.</p>, <p>The NX 300 uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 235 horsepower. Its 6-speed automatic transmission mates with either front-drive or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55421" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-nx-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The F Sport, boasting sporty styling touches, gains a bigger imitation air intake for 2018. Amply bolstered sport seats feature black or red upholstery, with accent piping. Pedals are drilled aluminum.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is standard on the NX 300h hybrid. A specially tuned 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine works with twin motor-generators. Combined output from Toyota’s hybrid drive system is 194 horsepower. The hybrid uses a continuously variable transmission (CVT).</p>, <p>An electric-only mode is included in the NX300h, along with the usual Normal, Sport, and Eco choices. Acceleration to 60 mph with the hybrid takes a leisurely 9.1 seconds.</p>, <p>Launching the NX gave Lexus a new design language, led by an exaggerated, oversize grille and extroverted body details. More recently, other small crossovers have adopted comparable styling themes, so the NX has lost some shock value since its 2015 debut. Similar in overall length to likely competitors, the NX rides a wheelbase that’s up to 9 inches shorter.</p>, <p>Crash-test results have been good, but not perfect. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 2017 NX a Top Safety Pick Plus designation. All tests earned Good ratings. Frontal crash protection was rated Acceptable, but only if equipped with a specific option package.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2018 NX five stars overall and for side-impact, but only four stars in the frontal-crash test.</p>, <p>Lexus has made more safety technology standard for 2018, including adaptive cruise control, lane-departure alert, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and automatic high beams. Like some rivals, visibility is somewhat impaired by thick rear pillars.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55420" height="106" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-nx-300h.jpg" width="200"/>NX 300 FWD ($35,985) comes with the 2.0-liter turbo engine, front-wheel drive, 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, power front seats, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, steering-wheel controls, automatic headlights, Bluetooth connectivity, rearview camera, and suite of active-safety features. The NX 300 AWD adds all-wheel drive ($37,385).</p>, <p>NX 300 F Sport ($38,375) gets visual enhancements including a black mesh grille, tuned suspension, and tunable noise-enhancement. Expanded instrumentation includes a G-Force meter. All-wheel drive comes on the NX 300 F Sport AWD ($39,775).</p>, <p>Options include a new power tailgate with a kick sensor, 18-inch wheels, and navigation with a new 10.3-inch touchscreen. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>NX 300h AWD ($38,335) has the hybrid powertrain with 2.5-liter engine, all-wheel drive, power-folding mirrors, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, power front seats, 8-speaker audio, dual-zone climate control, Scout GPS Link, and 8.0-inch screen.</p>, <p>One of the most extroverted-looking crossovers, the NX was quite startling when it emerged for 2015. Beneath the jarring surface, the NX is essentially a twin-box utility wagon like many others.</p>, <p>Above the dramatically protruding, hourglass-shaped grille, L-shaped LED running lights join swept-back headlights. The hybrid-model grille has a milder pattern of horizontal bars.</p>, <p>Bodysides flaunt sharp creases and pointy shapes. Deep door indentations make the sills look asymmetrical. F Sport versions feature a black grille, black mirrors, and other sporty-look details, along with 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55422" height="156" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-nx-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Luxurious cabin materials are no surprise. Neither are quietness and comfort. Cabins are restrained, making use of familiar trim materials.</p>, <p>Large round instruments sit on a wide, angled dashboard, above a protruding console. Lexus uses rotary switches for ventilation control.</p>, <p>Despite a comparatively short wheelbase, legroom and headroom are satisfying. Front seats are spacious, supportive and comfortable, readily adjustable in several directions. Seating positions are slightly lower than in some competitive vehicles.</p>, <p>Luxurious upholstery continues into the rear seats, but they’re less supportive. Back-seat cushions also are somewhat flat. Because of sharply-angled roof pillars, rear occupants may have to lean forward to get the best views. F Sport seats have more substantial side bolsters, as well as generous head clearance.</p>, <p>Cargo volume is good, totaling 17.7 cubic feet behind the rear seat. With that seat folded down, volume grows to only 54.6 cubic feet, near the smallest in the category. Numerous trays, a console bin, and large glovebox provide ample storage capacity.</p>, <p>Lexus’s infotainment system can be tricky, requiring movement of a finger across a console touchpad. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay do not exist.</p>, <p>Roadholding and carlike handling capabilities are satisfying. Body roll is minimal, but not wholly absent. An NX is exceptionally quiet on most roads, but road sounds may intrude.</p>, <p>Performance from the 2.0-liter turbo qualifies as mildly sporty, but around average for the compact crossover class. Furthermore, the turbo four isn’t as pleasurable or smooth-running as expected. To keep fuel-economy high, the engine switches periodically to more efficient Atkinson-cycle operation. Coupled with some turbo lag, that system can delay power delivery, resulting in uneven operation.</p>, <p>Hybrid models are less sporty than their gasoline-only counterparts, but the gas/electric powertrain is better balanced and smoother. A kickdown switch maximizes power when pushing the pedal to the floor. Engine howl is nicely restrained.</p>, <p>Below 25 mph, the hybrid can run up to 0.6 mile on battery power. Eco mode in the regular NX constricts performance, except on flat roads.</p>, <p>F Sport engine output is identical to that of the regular NX 300, but the suspension has sportier tuning. Sport mode sharpens acceleration and keeps engine speed higher than usual. Road noise and a harsher ride are the penalties for picking an F Sport.</p>, <p>Fuel economy ranks around average. With front-drive, the turbo-engine model has been EPA-rated at only 22/28 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive loses 1 mpg in the combined figure. The 2017 NX 300h was EPA-rated at 33/30 mpg City/Highway, or 31 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Well-equipped for its price, the NX 300 isn’t the strongest performer in the compact crossover category, but few cars stand as far apart from the pack in styling. Not everyone falls for its front-end bulk or bodyside exaggerations, but newly standard safety features and roadgoing qualities enhance its appeal. F Sport models ride rougher, while the hybrid excels in gas mileage, without adding too much to the base price.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by John Voelcker, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-fiat-500x/
[<p>The Fiat 500X is a compact crossover that’s entertaining to drive comes with a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The 2018 Fiat 500X offers more standard equipment than 2017, including a rearview camera and a 7.0-inch touchscreen. New Urbana and Blue Sky editions are available for 2018.</p>, <p>The Fiat 500X is made in Italy to North American standards with heavy American engineering influence. Introduced for the 2016 model year, it didn’t change for 2017.</p>, <p>The compact crossover market is booming, and the 500X has a bunch of rivals, including the Jeep Renegade, on whose platform the 500X is built. Also in this class: the Honda HR-V, Chevrolet Trax, Buick Encore, Mazda CX-3, Hyundai Kona, Mini Countryman, just to name some of them.</p>, <p>Size-wise, the 500X slots between the super-trim Fiat 500 and awkward 500L. Looking like a tall hatchback, it’s more mainstream than those two.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55414" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-500x-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-500x-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-500x-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The ride is firm but not punishing, and the handling is responsive but not as quick as the Fiat 500. The available all-wheel drive helps in sand and snow, although it doesn’t give the 500X the offroad capability of the Jeep Renegade, especially not the Trailhawk model. To save fuel, the all-wheel drive actually detaches the driveshaft and rear differential from the front wheels, until wheelspin at the rear calls it back.</p>, <p>Base engine is a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder making 160 horsepower that’s fun but unrefined, mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox that’s a hoot. Only the Pop model gets this powertrain, which can also be found in the Dodge Dart. Fiat says only one in 20 500Xs will have this powertrain.</p>, <p>The main powertrain is a 2.4-liter four cylinder making 180 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of torque, that dates back to the Dodge Caliber, but it’s been much improved over the years. It’s mated to a 9-speed automatic that’s pretty rough, and which Fiat is working on improving.</p>, <p>The EPA rates the turbocharged 1.4-liter 500X at 25 miles per gallon City, 34 Highway and 28 Combined; and the front-wheel-drive 2.4-liter at 23/31/27 mpg. The all-wheel drive 500X rates 21/30/24 mpg.</p>, <p>It gets great safety reports from the IIHS, who give it the Top Safety Pick Plus rating, including the top Good score for the notoriously difficult small overlap front test, as well as an Advanced rating for front crash prevention when it’s equipped with optional automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The 2018 Fiat 500 X comes in three models: Pop ($19,995), Trekking ($23,685), and Lounge ($25,515). Pop comes with the 1.4-liter turbo and 6-speed manual.</p>, <p>Trekking and Lounge come standard with the 2.4-liter and 9-speed automatic, which is optional for the Pop.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available with the 2.4-liter engine ($1900).</p>, <p>Although it was designed in Italy, the profile of the 500X looks a bit Audi-like, which is to say mature, with clean sides and a gentle arc to the roofline. It keeps Fiat familiarity its chrome mustache, clamshell hood, and stacked twin headlamps.</p>, <p>The Trekking has more rugged front fascia and its own wheels, but the same driving personality.</p>, <p>The cabin is neat and clean, with nice materials, and big round gauges and climate controls, and a medium-sized LCD screen in the dash for infotainment and camera displays. Despite a shiny swath of black plastic on the dash, the colorful trim makes the 500X cooler than almost all of its rivals. It makes the interior of the Honda HR-V look like an accident.</p>, <p>Comfort in front is generally good. The seats are firm, with good lumbar support and limited bolstering that still fits larger passengers. The optional leather seats could use more definition at the bottom and less at the headrests, which have an uncomfortable edge. But there’s a nice knee pad on the side of the center console.</p>, <p>Two adults can fit comfortably in the rear, although kneeroom is understandably scant with the front seats pushed back (after all it’s a compact); same with headroom if the optional panoramic moonroof is fitted. The Honda HR-V has more room in rear.</p>, <p>The Fiat’s cargo space measures 18.5 cubic feet in the second row and 50.8 cubic feet with the rear seat folded almost flat. The 500X is about five inches shorter than the 500L, but it’s a bit wider and better packaged, so it has almost as much interior room, and it matches most of its rivals. But not the HR-V, with Honda’s fold-away Magic Seat. However the Trekking and Lounge models have an innovative height-adjustable cargo floor that works with a flat-folding passenger seat to enable carrying big and long things like outdoor toys, so the Fiat does its best to make some magic too.</p>, <p>Noise in the cabin is fairly low except at full throttle or the revs that 80 mph require.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55413" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-500x-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-500x-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-500x-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The ingredients for fun might be there, but with no chassis or suspension development since the debut, more time is needed. We like the ride and handling, as well as the 6-speed manual gearbox, but it only comes with the Pop, whose 1.4-liter turbo doesn’t have enough power for any kind of authority. So it leaves us longing for what doesn’t exist: a 2.4-liter six-speed and tuner shocks, to take on BMW and the Mini Countryman.</p>, <p>The 2.4-liter engine in the Trekking and Lounge delivers good performance and fuel mileage, but its 9-speed automatic needs more tweaking. We’ve tested this powertrain in the Jeep Cherokee and Chrysler 200, where it feels the same, maybe worse.</p>, <p>The engine is mostly smooth if not especially free-revving, and has enough power to easily propel the car’s 3100 pounds, but the transmission lets it down. It’s slow to upshift in the two lowest gears and slow to downshift unless it’s in Sport mode. Paddleshifters would help in these situations, but they’d be a waste the rest of the time.</p>, <p>The 500X feels perky, with quick but light steering (although lacking feedback) and pleasing responsiveness, both around town and on the highway. Trekking and Lounge models have the Dynamic Drive system with Auto, Sport, and Traction Plus modes, which change the throttle response, transmission response, and steering resistance.</p>, <p>The ride is firm on a strut-type suspension, with good road manners for the class, even with the optional 18-inch wheels. Its cornering is composed despite having a body that’s tall for the wheelbase. But of all the dynamics, the feel of the brakes might be best.</p>, <p>It’s frustrating that everything about the 500X works, in turning the Fiat 500 into a crossover, except the powertrains. The 1.4-liter turbo engine in the Pop isn’t quite quick enough for us, and the capable 2.4-liter engine is mated to a transmission that struggles. That said, the Pop is a charmer at its price point.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-trax/
[<p>Chevrolet’s smallest utility vehicle, launched as a 2015 model, doesn’t qualify as fancy. Most entrants in the small-crossover category strive for and achieve a degree of stylistic flair, but Chevrolet took an opposing path. Externally plain, the tall-riding, strictly straightforward Trax stresses practicality inside.</p>, <p>Little has changed for the 2018 model year. Equinox and Traverse crossovers sit above the five-door Trax in Chevrolet’s lineup</p>, <p>Three Trax trim levels are offered: base LS, midrange LT, and top-rung Premier. Front-wheel drive is standard, but all-wheel drive is an option for each trim level.</p>, <p>Developing 138 horsepower, the 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine mates with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Peak torque, totaling 148 pound-feet, is available starting at only 1850 rpm.</p>, <p>Like many of the smallest crossovers, Chevrolet Trax is based on a subcompact-car foundation. Specifically, it’s related to the Sonic hatchback and sedan. Some folks dub the Trax a tall hatchback or wagon, rather than a subcompact crossover.</p>, <p>All versions except the LS have LED running lights and taillights. Indisputably plain, devoid of chrome trim, the LS is fitted with steel wheels and black plastic mirrors that suggest an econocar. Trax LT comes with alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Build quality has been good, without noticeable squeaks, rattles, or buzzing.</p>, <p>New for 2018, a Redline trim package is available for the LT, adding black 18-inch wheels with red accents, black trim elements, plus black cloth and synthetic leather upholstery.</p>, <p>Crash-testing has yielded good results. The 2017 Trax earned top Good ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, except for an Acceptable score in the small overlap frontal crash (passenger-side). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2018 Trax five stars overall and five stars in each individual test except rollover prevention, where it got four. That rollover score (a calculated figure) is typical for tall utility vehicles.</p>, <p>A rearview camera and 10 airbags are standard, but active-safety features are offered only on top models. Forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are standard only on Premier trim, but unavailable for any other version. Blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking assist are standard on Premier, but optional for LT trim.</p>, <p>Chevrolet’s MyLink system includes Bluetooth pairing for hands-free phone and audio, a USB port, auxiliary input jack, plus Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Navigation is available using smartphone mapping.</p>, <p>Trax LS ($21,000) comes with front-wheel drive, a rearview camera, air conditioning, cloth upholstery, remote keyless entry, 7.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and MyLink entertainment. Steel wheels have plastic covers. OnStar 4G LTE connectivity with wi-fi hotspot capability is available. LS options include keyless ignition, a power sunroof, and Bose premium seven-speaker audio. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is optional on all models ($1,500).</p>, <p>Trax LT ($22,900) gets 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, satellite radio, remote start, LED taillights and daytime running lights, and roof-mounted side rails. All-wheel drive adds $1,500.</p>, <p>Trax Premier ($27,295) includes a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, leatherette seat upholstery, 18-inch alloy wheels, foglamps, chrome accents, keyless ignition, a power sunroof, and Bose premium audio. Blind-zone alert, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, forward collision alert, and rear park assist also are standard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55408" height="146" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-trax-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Many small-crossover competitors rely on visual flair to attract notice. For its Trax, Chevrolet has relied upon practically, keeping the design simple, even generic. Modest updating for the 2017 model year brought the front end closer to the appearance of other Chevrolet models; but overall, little is distinctive about the Trax.</p>, <p>In terms of basic shape, the Trax might be considered somewhere between a short crossover or SUV, and a tall hatchback. Lack of a window aft of the rear door makes the hatchback designation more logical.</p>, <p>Even though the Trax shares its foundation and front doors with Buick’s Encore, body styling differs substantially between the two GM vehicles.</p>, <p>Inside as well as out, the Trax comes across as practical and straightforward. Boasting a relatively spacious cabin for its size, it can seat four adults, or five, for short journeys.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55407" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-trax-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-trax-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-trax-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Black plastic is prominent around the traditional, horizontally-arranged dashboard, with its conventional gauges. Yet, some details counteract any dreariness. Even the base model’s black cloth upholstery boasts blue accent stitching. Premier trim features attractive two-tone upholstery, with contract stitching decorating the instrument panel. In some areas, patterned trim edges aside the less-appealing black plastic panels.</p>, <p>Front seats are comfortable, though the two occupants might feel rather close together. The driver gets a fold-down armrest, but there’s no between-the-seats console.</p>, <p>Unlike some smaller vehicles, seat cushions are long enough to satisfy taller drivers. Upper trim levels include power seat adjustment, but moving a very short lever is the only way to alter backrest angle.</p>, <p>Rear seating is acceptable for adults. Pulling a fabric tab lets the bottom cushion fold forward. The front passenger seatback also folds.</p>, <p>Cargo volume ranks around average, totaling 18.7 cubic feet with the seatback upright, expanding to 48.4 cubic feet when folded down. Passengers can expect plenty of storage spots around the cabin: bins, trays, and twin gloveboxes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55406" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-trax-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Like other attributes of the Trax, ride comfort and handling qualities score average for the Trax’s category. No hint of sporty behavior will be observed, but the ride is comfortable and roadholding ranks as controlled. Electric power steering is admirably responsive, yielding good maneuverability.</p>, <p>Acceleration can only be called slow, even when compared to other vehicles in its class, which is hardly renowned for speed or sportiness. Chevrolet’s little turbo four simply lacks sufficient vigor to propel the Trax to highway speeds with any degree of haste. Passing on the highway thus requires some pre-planning.</p>, <p>Transmission gears are widely spaced, with a high-ratio sixth gear. That translates to relaxed, fuel-efficient highway cruising. A Trax rides quietly overall, but the engine can sound harsh when pushed.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is satisfactory, but some small-crossover competitors do better. With front-wheel drive, the Trax is EPA-rated at 25/33 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined. Optional all-wheel drive drops the estimate to 24/30 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Despite a lack of flashiness, the Trax represents good value. The base LS model is indisputably plain, but otherwise the Trax scores well on safety and features, and satisfactory in comfort and quality. Relatively feeble performance is a drawback, and fuel economy isn’t as impressive as some rival subcompact crossovers. Chevrolet’s Trax excels in connectivity and infotainment.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by John Voelcker, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-4runner/
[<p>The Toyota 4Runner is an old-school, body-on-frame SUV, not a crossover like its kin the Highlander. It’s in the fifth year of its generation, unchanged since 2016, although for 2018 three new colors are available, along with new wheels for the TRD Offroad and TRD Pro models.</p>, <p>Its only engine is a smooth 4.0-liter V6 making 270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque that makes it quick, and a five-speed automatic transmission, which feels like enough gears if you haven’t driven the eight- and nine- and ten-speeds, many of which offer problematic shifting anyhow.</p>, <p>The 4Runner drives better than a truck this size should. It’s even easy to maneuver in parking lots. It’s comfortable for long hours, with a fairly smooth ride and very little road noise.</p>, <p>Inside, it’s less refined than the Ford Explorer or Dodge Durango, two main competitors that, unlike the 4Runner, are unit-body crossovers. Because the 4Runner’s bolted-on body is narrower and its floor higher, we would have expected less cargo space than in a same-sized crossover, but somehow the 4Runner provides 90 cubic feet with the second row folded.</p>, <p>The TRD Off Road and TRD Pro Series models only come with 4WD. The TRD Pro is serious, with Bilstein shocks having remote reservoirs, Nitto all-terrain tires, TRD front springs, skid plates, exclusive wheels, and TRD trim and badging.</p>, <p>The ruggedness of the 4Runner chassis makes it much better equipped than any car-based crossover to hold up to regular driving along primitive two-tracks, boulder-stream river banks, and other rugged terrain.</p>, <p>Eight airbags are standard. The 4Runner scores well in crash testing, but does not always achieve the top rating in each test by NHTSA and IIHS.</p>, <p>The base SR5 model with rear-wheel-drive is EPA rated at 17 miles per gallon City, 22 Highway, and 19 Combined. With four-wheel drive it gets 1 mpg less.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55397" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-2.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-2.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-2-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2018 Toyota 4Runner SR5 comes with rear-wheel drive ($34,410) or four-wheel drive ($36,285). Standard equipment includes power driver seat, roof rack, audio system with satellite radio, Bluetooth audio streaming, and Toyota’s Entune services. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>4Runner Premium comes with 2WD ($36,240). The Limited 2WD ($42,725) and Limited 4WD ($44,760) come with dual power front seats, navigation, and a 15-speaker JBL sound system.</p>, <p>The 4Runner 4WD TRD Off Road ($37,535) and 4Runner TRD Pro ($42,675) are tuned for rugged terrain.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55400" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The 4Runner looks like what it is, a brawny SUV, not what it’s not, a crossover. It also looks like a surly catfish, with its nose that belongs on a truck. Which means it’s where it belongs, because the Runner is a truck. It doesn’t pretend to be sleek, although the boxy body has some chrome flash.</p>, <p>The windows are high and rear pillars slope downward toward 1986.</p>, <p>The TRD Pro Series takes the mad fish look one step farther with its mouthy grille and skidplates like silver scales under the chin.</p>, <p>Overall, the interior is nice, but still less refined than the Explorer or Durango. The cabin isn’t fancy but it’s detailed well, with simple and sensible controls that are chunky yet still precise. Unlike the exterior, the interior avoids chrome. There are fewer controls on the centerstack, because the offroad controls are overhead. The steering wheel has audio and Bluetooth buttons.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55401" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The front seats are wide and supportive, and with the optional perforated leather, they look great and are comfortable for long trips.</p>, <p>Second row passengers will find decent room at the outboard seats, a flop-down armrest, and backrests that adjust 16 degrees. Three abreast is a bit tight, but not unreasonable.</p>, <p>A third row is available for the SR5 and Limited, but it’s difficult to climb back there. It folds flat when not in use, leaving a fat 47.2 cubic feet of cargo space; or with the second row folded, there’s 90 cubic feet. A sliding floor that pulls out for easy loading is optional, and popular. It takes just one cubic foot of cargo space, and is a relief, given the height of the floor.</p>, <p>4Runners don’t have a power tailgate, but they do have a useful power rear window. It’s nice for tossing in small items, and pleasant to drive with the window down around town.</p>, <p>The 4.0-liter V6 engine with five-speed automatic delivers decent acceleration, and the 278 pound-feet of torque meets offroad or towing demands. The transmission holds its own for a five-speed; it shifts quickly, though it lacks the number of gears offered by the competition.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55399" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-4runner-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Given its off-road capability, the 4Runner is impressively responsive on pavement. Steering and maneuvering are delightful, something that’s surprising if you don’t know 4Runners, which have a history of good handling. At a crawl, it handles with precision and control, important when creeping through a boulder field.</p>, <p>The SR5 with the base suspension can be bouncy on patchy pavement, and it leans more in the turns. If you’re driving it outside its comfort zone, it will let you know that it’s still a truck with tall sidewalls and a soft suspension. Optional active dampers broaden that comfort zone.</p>, <p>The 4Runner is surprisingly free of wind noise for its boxy shape, and it’s there’s little road noise thanks to the soft suspension.</p>, <p>What the 4Runner lacks on the road, it makes up for off the road. There are differences in the 4WD systems among the different models. Limited models get full-time 4WD that’s geared for the road, along with active dampers that smooth the bumps and level out cornering, called X-REAS. The X-REAS suspension enhancement is a nice setup if you like to drive briskly on winding paved roads.</p>, <p>The TRD Off Road model offers as an option the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, using hydraulics to add stability on the road, and more traction with more wheel travel off the road. The system senses when one real wheel is light, and applies less power to that wheel and more to the wheel that’s more grounded.</p>, <p>The TRD Pro is another animal, maybe a wild one. It uses a tweaked suspension with reworked springs and Bilstein remote-reservoir dampers, Nitto all-terrain tires, skid plates and other TRD parts. We’ve had some off-road time behind the wheel, and it aced every test we put it to.</p>, <p>Another element 4Runner brings to the table is durability. It’s hard to measure but 4Runners appear to hold up much better to repeated use through boulder fields and other rugged terrain that would leave any crossover on the side of the trail.</p>, <p>The Toyota 4Runner is a great choice for someone who needs a rugged SUV. It can handle rugged terrain much better than a crossover. Its closest competitor is the Dodge Durango, which has a more refined cabin, but the 4Runner wins on powertrain and durability.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with NCTD editor Mitch McCullough reporting from the Northeast, and staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-lexus-gx-460/
[<p>The Lexus GX 460 might look like a luxury SUV, but behind its big spindle grille and under its fancy wrap it’s built for heavy duty. Sharing its basic structure with the Toyota 4Runner, the Lexus GX is built body on frame. Clues to its mission can be found in the tailgate that opens horizontally and the many offroad controls in the cabin, sprinkled into the leather and wood.</p>, <p>Highly capable off road, every model is all-wheel drive. It’s powered by a smooth 4.6-liter V8 mated to a sweet six-speed automatic. The steering is dull and the ride smothered, but after all it’s a tank, not a crossover. It’s a relatively durable vehicle, able to withstand a fair amount of pounding over rugged terrain.</p>, <p>And being a tank, it’s safe and thirsty. At least we assume it’s safe, because it’s big and well-built. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the NHTSA or IIHS, but all models have 10 airbags, active head restraints, and a rearview camera. As for the thirst, the EPA rates it at 16 Combined miles per gallon, on Premium gasoline.</p>, <p>For its price, the base GX 460, should have more standard equipment, that is, some of the features that are optional. Other Lexus models do. Leather seats and navigation, to name two things. A safety package adds forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, attention assist, lane-departure warnings, and automatic high beams. Blind-spot monitors are also sold as an option, as are surround-view cameras.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55389" height="138" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Lexus GX 460 ($51,855) comes with four-wheel drive, moonroof, 18-inch wheels, rearview camera, power front seats, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen. Options include heated and ventilated front seats, navigation, blind-spot monitors, and smartphone-app connectivity.</p>, <p>GX 460 Premium ($57,855) adds navigation, heated and ventilated seats, and mahogany trim. GX 460 Luxury ($63,230) includes an adaptive suspension, upgraded leather, rear air suspension, heated steering wheel. Options include 17-speaker Mark Levinson audio and dual-screen rear-seat DVD entertainment. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55393" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Lexus GX tries to make up for its slab-sided styling with its big awkward nose but only draws attention to it. A big spindle grille was slapped onto a boxy front end, a design mismatch that gives the SUV a split personality.</p>, <p>Being an old-school SUV, it’s tall, a bit narrow, and has a high floor. So the front occupants ride way up there. On plush cushions. With lots of room. Commanding view for the driver. Big step to get in, though.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55391" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The trim is luxury soft, wrapped around chunky shapes, bulky door handles. The dash panel is upright, with controls over horizontal bands of wood. The controls are neither overwhelming nor complex, a relief, because so many rivals are. Real buttons in the right places. Legible gauges. The center stack for audio, climate and navigation is clean. Good steering-wheel controls.</p>, <p>Too bad it’s saddled with bad infotainment. The system has a large display but is difficult to navigate. Lexus doesn’t offer Android Auto or Apple CarPlay as useful, streamlined bypasses.</p>, <p>Layers of rich materials belie its roots. The shape inside is dated, but details give it elegance. Its functional shortcomings are covered by leather, real or synthetic on the base GX460.</p>, <p>The sliding second-row seat yields great legroom and much space, as long as no one is in the third row. Which is difficult to reach, cramped, and with the power-fold feature doesn’t fold flat, making the cargo space high and narrow. The side-hinged tailgate makes it quite awkward. And the seat can’t be removed.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55390" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Lexus GX does its best to handle more like a crossover, but still feels a bit wobbly. A lot of suspension travel, soft ride, spongy brakes, slow steering, artificial feel.</p>, <p>The 4.6-liter V8 makes 301 horsepower, giving the GX a zero to sixty time of 7.8 seconds; both the horsepower and 0-60 time can be matched by many V6s. The six-speed automatic is quick and smooth.</p>, <p>Toyota’s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System is standard equipment, same as the Land Cruiser. It uses air springs at the rear, and enables one rear wheel to push down for traction, when the other rear wheel gets light.</p>, <p>It makes the ride smoother, even on winding two-lanes, despite top-heavy dynamics. However the system hides body lean, and steals something from the seat of the driver’s pants.</p>, <p>The ride gets even smoother with available adaptive dampers (standard on the Luxury).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55388" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-gx-offroad.jpg" width="200"/>All-wheel drive comes standard. The power is split 40/60 front/rear, with a Torsen differential to transmitting more to the rear when needed. It’s a full-on offroad system, with a low range, center diff lock, and crawl control, which takes over at settable speeds between 1.0 and 3.7 mph.</p>, <p>Like the Toyota 4Runner, the Lexus GX is a capable vehicle off road, for the right price. Styling, fuel cost, spacey handling, spongy brakes, and inconvenient cargo carrying are its downsides.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-pathfinder/
[<p>The Nissan Pathfinder is a front-wheel-drive midsize crossover with an optional (and relatively roomy) third row, and available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Last redesigned for 2014, it was substantially freshened for 2017 with a tweaked nose and tail, new engine, firmer suspension and better infotainment. The 2018 Pathfinder is updated with automatic emergency braking, and another warning, called Rear Door Alert, to check the back seats for forgotten pets or children, after you get out of the car.</p>, <p>A crossover that drives more like a car than a truck, Pathfinder is built on the chassis of the Altima and Maxima sedans. However, with all-wheel drive it can manage snow and rugged terrain, and it is rated to tow up to 6000 pounds. For 2017, the chassis was reinforced where the tow hitch mounts, to create this capability.</p>, <p>The 3.5-liter V6 engine has direct injection and variable valve timing, and makes 284 horsepower and 259 pound-feet of torque. It’s mated to a continuously variable transmission. The CVT is better than many.</p>, <p>It’s EPA-rated at 20 miles per gallon City, 27 Highway, and 23 Combined with front-wheel drive, one less mpg with all-wheel drive. It aces the crash tests. NHTSA gives it five stars overall, and the IIHS gave it the top score in every category.</p>, <p>Standard safety equipment includes six airbags, with the side-curtain airbags having a rollover sensor and covering all three rows. A rearview camera and rear sonar parking sensors are also standard. Then there’s the Easy Fill Tire Alert that honks the horn when you’ve inflated a tire to the correct amount.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55382" height="146" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pathfinder-2.jpg" width="200"/>2018 Pathfinder models include S with front-wheel drive ($30,790) or all-wheel drive ($32,480), SV, SL, and Platinum. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Pathfinder SV ($33,480) comes well equipped with tri-zone automatic climate control, eight-inch touchscreen, HD radio, satellite radio with SiriusXM Travel Link, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, rearview camera, and 18-inch alloy wheels. It’s available with all-wheel drive ($35,170).</p>, <p>Pathfinder SL ($37,500) and SL AWD ($39,190) get rear park assist, blind-spot monitors, surround view, and rear cross-traffic alerts.</p>, <p>Pathfinder Platinum ($42,320) and AWD ($42,010) gets navigation, heated and ventilated front seats, a 13-speaker Bose audio system, panoramic sunroof, motion-activated power liftgate, 20-inch wheels, and active safety features including adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning and emergency braking.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55385" height="156" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pathfinder-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The nose and tail are both blocky, to make the Pathfinder look more like a truck; the similar-sized Murano is the Nissan crossover that looks like a crossover (if not a space ship). On the truck-like Pathfinder, a bold chrome grille completes the disguise.</p>, <p>The overall lines go back to crossing over, with a long hood, raked windshield, flowing side creases with chrome touches, and upswept third window. The shapes, angles, and directions somehow make the Pathfinder look smaller than it is. You have to stand up against it to appreciate its enormity, mid-size or not.</p>, <p>The cabin stays true to the incongruous styling, where a glossy dashboard meets the soft matte material on the door panels. The plastics are hard and fabrics are unremarkable. The Pathfinder finds some influence from its elegant sibling the Infiniti, but not here.</p>, <p>The touchscreen is hard to clean, with its pinch and swipe control on tile icons, part of the NissanConnect infotainment system and its connectivity. There are two interior colors, Charcoal and Almond.</p>, <p>The Pathfinder does a good job of balancing comfort, access, space and storage. There is a lot of elbow room, cupholders in the door pockets and center console along with two big trays, map pockets on the front seatbacks, no less than three bottle holders in each rear door, and cupholders on each side of the third row.</p>, <p>The comfortable front seats have good back support but little side bolstering, while the driver has a lot of adjustment. Our seat time included a long trip on the highway, and we have no complaints. The lack of bolstering doesn’t do a thing for cornering, but the Pathfinder isn’t a vehicle to be tossed around anyhow.</p>, <p>The bench seat in the second row slides back and forth 5.5 inches for legroom, as long as there’s no one in the third row. It slides and folds to gain access to the third row, with a feature called Latch and Glide that allows child seats to stay in place even while the seat partially collapses. But not if a child is in it. The little ones will have to climb out, for the bigger kids to get in the third row.</p>, <p>The second row is not so comfortable, because the rear seat has a leaned-back, legs-splayed seating position. It’s the compromise for its folding capability, to improve third-row access.</p>, <p>The optional third row is roomier than most, with short, flat cushions that sit quite low, providing headroom enough for early teens but not fully grown people. It actually rakes back a bit.</p>, <p>With all the seats up, the Pathfinder has only 16 cubic feet behind the third row. With both rows folded, there is a solid 80 cubic feet of cargo space, still nothing like the massive 116 cubic feet in Chevrolet Traverse, but that’s a full-size SUV.</p>, <p>The Pathfinder keeps away vibrations and road noise better than some others in the class.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55384" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pathfinder-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pathfinder-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pathfinder-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The continuously variable transmission (CVT) uses Nissan’s D-Step shift logic, to mimic the distinct shifts of an automatic transmission; it works, to remove most of the high revving of a CVT, but it still drones a bit. And sometimes it’s slow to respond. When the V6 has been running casually for a while, and you suddenly need power, the CVT delays the delivery. The strong V6 must hate being stifled, all that torque going to waste.</p>, <p>The 3.5-liter V6, new with the latest technology last year, is quite quick for what it is, with a zero to sixty time of less than seven seconds.</p>, <p>The suspension is fairly firm, significantly stiffened for 2017. The ride is still comfortable; you can feel the bumps, but it’s not harsh. And the handling controlled, with hydraulic-electric power steering that’s fairly quick, well-weighted, and has decent on-center feel.</p>, <p>The Pathfinder is lighter than you expect it to be, given its size and appearance, so you can pitch it back and forth on choppy roads, and it won’t freak out like its heavier rivals. But first check the tires; the low-rolling-resistance tires on some models, both 18-inch and 20-inch, don’t have the grip that the chassis can handle.</p>, <p>There’s some torque steer in front-wheel-drive models, but not in the all-wheel-drive versions, which send most of the power to the front wheels until it’s needed in back for traction or stability. The driver can select front-wheel drive only, maximizing fuel efficiency, or a locked all-wheel-drive mode to distribute power equally front and rear. Meanwhile, the system moves power from side to side, as needed.</p>, <p>The Pathfinder has less ground clearance than a Subaru Outback (whose CVT is the best), but it handles ruts with stability, while the locking center differential provides more traction offroad than most rivals.</p>, <p>Good ride, even better handling, great V6, 22 mpg with awd. CVT not as smooth as an automatic. Third row more useful than other mid-size crossovers. A million bins and cupholders. Super safe. Blocky styling makes it look like a truck. Perfect for a family with four kids and a pet.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-land-rover-range-rover-velar/
[<p>Introduced for 2018, Range Rover Velar follows a fresh design path and winds up as a stunning rendition of the authentic SUV. A sleek, gorgeous shape reveals a long hood, sloping roofline, and big open wheel arches. Its designer even omitted door handles, which might detract visually from the gracious body lines.</p>, <p>Gambling on uncommon beauty, inside and out, Land Rover hit a home run with Velar, creating a new benchmark in the luxury SUV category. Rugged, offroad-ready hardware, lets the new Velar live up to Land Rover heritage and its record of rough-country dominance.</p>, <p>A midsize luxury SUV, Velar is smaller than Land Rover’s Range Rover Sport but larger than the Evoque. It shares powertrains and a similar structure with the new Jaguar F-Pace.</p>, <p>Velar comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that develops 247 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55377" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-3.jpg" width="200"/>Stepping up on the performance scale, a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 whips up 380 horsepower and 332 pound-feet. The supercharged V6 is paired with an adjustable, highly capable air suspension. The adjustable setup can raise or lower the Velar by as much as 3 inches, up to total ground clearance of 9.9 inches.</p>, <p>Land Rover also offers a turbodiesel four-cylinder option. Particularly adept off-road, the diesel generates 180 horsepower and a brawny 317 pound-feet of torque, available at low engine speeds. The fuel-efficient turbodiesel yields up to 30 mpg in highway driving.</p>, <p>Each engine mates with an 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Velars are rated to tow up to 5,500 pounds with a V6, or 5,200 pounds with the turbo four.</p>, <p>Range Rover offers five trim levels: standard, S, SE, HSE, and the limited-production First Edition. All three engines are available in S, SE, and HSE trim, but that standard version comes only with the gasoline four-cylinder and the First Edition is V6-only. Only 500 First Editions are to be built.</p>, <p>All Velars come with automatic emergency braking, a rearview camera, and lane-departure warning. R-Dynamic trim levels add blind-spot monitoring, drowsy driver monitoring, traffic sign detection, and adaptive speed limiter. R-Dynamic HSE includes adaptive cruise control, blind-spot assist, and lane-keep assist.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55378" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-2.jpg" width="200"/>The Range Rover Velar P250 Standard ($49,900) comes with the 2.0-liter turbo four, 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, synthetic leather upholstery, 10-way power seats, emergency braking, rear park assist, a rearview camera, eight-speaker audio, and dual 10-inch touchscreens. Velar P250 S ($54,700) upgrades with 19-inch wheels, perforated leather upholstery, Driver’s memory, power-folding heated mirrors, 11-speaker Meridian audio, navigation, and telematics services. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Velar P250 R-Dynamic SE ($60,100) includes 20-inch wheels, 17-speaker audio, a 12.3-inch driver information cluster, aluminum interior accents, and advanced safety features. Velar P250 R-Dynamic HSE ($67,600) comes with 22-inch wheels, 20-way power seats with memory and massage, heated/cooled front seats, and additional safety features.</p>, <p>The more powerful supercharged 3.0-liter V6 comes with the Velar P380 S ($64,200), P380 R-Dynamic SE ($69,600), P380 R-Dynamic HSE ($77,100). The P380 First Edition ($89,300) features 22-inch wheels, a full extended leather interior with two-tone seats, 23-speaker 1600-watt Meridian sound, head-up display, and surround-view camera. A Fitbit-like activity key can replace the keyfob.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter diesel four-cylinder engine comes with the Velar D180 S ($56,200), D180 R-Dynamic SE ($61,600), and D180 R-Dynamic HSE ($69,100).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55373" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Simply stunning, the Range Rover Velar sets a new benchmark for design of a modern SUV. Few would deny that it’s one of the best-looking SUVs; if not Number One.</p>, <p>Evolved from Jaguar’s F-Pace, the cleanly profiled Velar shies away from superfluous curves, omits door handles, and holds back on decoration. Up front, the hood seems unusually long. An uninterrupted character line extends back from the headlights.</p>, <p>Designers maintained a pinpoint focus on basic proportions. As a result, the Velar is the most aerodynamically efficient vehicle in Land Rover’s history.</p>, <p>If the Velar’s exterior represents a narrowed focus, its cabin takes an opposing path, emphasizing expressive lines, colors, and detail work. Sleekly modern, it’s one of Range Rover’s prime examples of interior opulence.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55375" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Leather covers most Velar seats, but optional premium grey textile (cloth) upholstery exudes an even greater sense of refined quality. Brushed aluminum accents and a leather-covered upper dashboard add to the premium aura. The base model uses synthetic leather and suede, but every Velar feels expensive.</p>, <p>Otherwise understated, the central console holds twin 10-inch infotainment touchscreens. Upper trim levels add a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. The infotainment system not only looks great, it responds well, despite lacking Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>Front seats promise comfort during the longest drives. Rear seats are reasonably comfortable for most riders, but short on legroom for taller passengers. With rear seatbacks upright, cargo volume totals 34.4 cubic feet, expanding to 70.1 cubic feet with those seats folded down.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55374" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-offroad.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-offroad.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-velar-offroad-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>All three engines supply sufficient power, though they’re not especially refined. The supercharged V6 propels the Velar to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds, an impressive performance, but it doesn’t feel that swift.</p>, <p>Acceleration to 60 mph takes only a second longer with the gasoline turbo four, which doesn’t emit a confident note when pushed. Passing demands some planning ahead.</p>, <p>Despite abundant sound-deadening material, even the V6 doesn’t sound satisfying when accelerating hard. Picking the turbodiesel costs only $1,500 additional, though its economic value is most notable in long highway trips.</p>, <p>Behaving willingly but unobtrusively, the 8-speed automatic blends into the background. Slight hesitation might stifle downshifting to pass, with the four-cylinder engine. Paddle shifters help.</p>, <p>While steering accurately and confidently, the Velar provides limited feel through the steering wheel. Even in Sport mode, electric power steering feels somewhat artificial.</p>, <p>Big tires translate to a relatively rough ride. Picking tires no bigger than 20-inch is a sensible compromise, but a V6 version with its adjustable suspension might be wiser yet.</p>, <p>Off road, Velar performs as expected of a Land Rover, extremely well, in other words.</p>, <p>Neither Velar nor its rivals qualify as frugal. V6 versions are EPA-rated at 18/24 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined. Gasoline-powered turbo-four models rate higher: 21/27/23 mpg. Turbodiesel models are the most efficient, EPA-rated at 26/30 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Every luscious Velar is opulently trimmed, down to the base model with its leatherette upholstery. Front seats are superior, cargo space excellent, materials exceptional. Technology is admirable, though active-safety features come mainly on upper trim levels. Multi-screen infotainment ranks as remarkable.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-pilot/
[<p>The Honda Pilot is a hit among full-size crossovers. With seating for eight, it’s Honda’s most versatile vehicle. It works for some as a family vehicle for buyers priced out of Volvos. It’s got rounded edges like a Ford Explorer (rounded first generation, boxy second, back to rounded).</p>, <p>The 2018 Pilot is in the third year of its third generation. There are no significant changes for 2018.</p>, <p>The ride is compliant and plush, the steering relaxed. It feels luxurious and mature, like its upscale sibling the Acura MDX. It weighs about 4200 pounds, depending on equipment, while some rivals hit 5000 pounds. It pulls strongly with its 3.5-liter, 280-horsepower V6, and uses either a 6-speed or 9-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive available. On top of that, there’s an optional traction management system for more traction in snow or mud. It can tow up to 5000 pounds.</p>, <p>In crash testing, the 2017 Pilot earned a Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS, but it received only an Acceptable rating for headlamps. It got five stars overall from the NHTSA, with four stars from frontal crash results.</p>, <p>Safety equipment includes a wide-angle rearview camera, and as the models increase in price, more equipment is added, including blind-spot monitors, a LaneWatch camera with a wide view down the right side of the car, a multi-rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, active lane control, road-departure warning, and forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking. Also, it won’t go into gear if the driver’s seat belt is unlatched or the door is open.</p>, <p>With front-wheel drive and the 6-speed automatic, the Honda Pilot is rated by the EPA at 19 miles per gallon City, 27 Highway, and 22 Combined. One less mpg with all-wheel drive. The 9-speed transmission improves that by about one mile per gallon.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55364" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pilot-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Honda Pilot comes in LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, and Elite models. Pilot LX ($29,995) comes standard with cloth upholstery, air conditioning, cruise control, seven-speaker 200-watt sound system with 5.0-inch color touchscreen, USB port, 17-inch wheels, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and CarPlay and Android Auto. As with most models Pilot LX is available with all-wheel drive ($31,795).</p>, <p>Pilot EX ($32,430) upgrades with three-zone climate control; a power driver seat; a LaneWatch right-side camera; satellite radio; remote start; two more USB ports; and Pandora audio streaming and texting capability. EX and EX-L trims get a larger 8.0-inch display and the Android-based Display Audio interface, with its big tiles and icons and generally friendly operation.</p>, <p>Pilot EX-L ($35,905) sports leather; a power tailgate; a power moonroof; heated front seats; and the one-touch second-row seat.</p>, <p>Pilot Touring ($41,020) and Pilot Elite AWD ($46,420) come with a 10-speaker, 540-watt premium audio system. Pilot Touring models adopt Honda Sensing safety system, Blu-ray DVD entertainment; a navigation system; 20-inch wheels; memory seats; parking sensors; two more USB ports, for a total of five; ambient lighting; Stop/Start; and a 115-volt outlet.</p>, <p>Pilot Elite upgrades with LED headlights; a second panoramic roof panel over the rear seats; rear heated seats; front ventilated seats; a heated steering wheel; automatic high beams; HD radio; and second-row captain’s chairs. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55366" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pilot-rear.jpg" width="200"/>With soft corners and rounded fenders, the Honda Pilot balances its glass to metal better than any rival, for example the Chevy Traverse, and stays away from the rugged look of crossovers like the Dodge Durango.</p>, <p>The Pilot is very well finished, with a neatly organized cabin surrounded by lots of glass, from tall side windows to an available huge panoramic roof that floods the cabin in natural light.</p>, <p>We see design elements borrowed from the Accord sedan, as well as some utility touches from the CR-V. All the lines and materials are subdued, save for the big touchscreen on upper trim levels. Soft-touch surfaces give it enough luxury to compare well to crossovers like the Buick Enclave.</p>, <p>The front space and comfort is excellent. The seats are well bolstered, with good definition, on the EX-L models and higher. A high driving position gives a commanding view out of the vehicle even for short drivers.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55365" height="179" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pilot-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The controls and storage in front are usefully placed and arranged. The steering wheel has round controls to operate the driver’s smartphone and the car’s audio system, needed because there’s no volume control on the touchscreen; the passenger is out of luck. A shallow bin in front of the deep cupholders holds a smartphone right next to a high-power USB port. There is no shift lever with the 9-speed transmission, giving space. A sliding lid covers the deep center console.</p>, <p>Second-row seating is a split-folding bench or a pair of captain’s chairs on upper trims; between those buckets is a floor-mounted tray with cupholders. On EX-L and above, a power button folds forward the second-row seats and slides them forward. The floor is low and there’s room to climb back to the third row, although it might be a tight climb for adults.</p>, <p>But once they’re back there, there’s an amazing amount of space. Head and leg room are as good as we’ve ever seen, although the seat cushion sits on the floor.</p>, <p>Behind the third row there’s a huge 18.5 cubic feet, as much as the trunk in a full-size sedan, and there’s a reversible cargo panel for messy or muddy things. Behind the second row, there’s 55.9 cubic feet, as much as many SUVs have behind the first row; and behind the first row, there’s a vast 109 cubic feet. It holds nearly as much as a Honda Odyssey minivan. All it lacks are sliding side doors.</p>, <p>On the EX-L trim level, an acoustic windshield absorbs some noise. Touring and Elite models get acoustic glass on the front doors, so passengers can talk with ease.</p>, <p>Honda’s audio and infotainment systems aren’t the best, but the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto interfaces are easier than before.</p>, <p>The SiriusXM audio system has time-shifting capability. You can create a custom channel that blends several stations into one, while it buffers songs so that repeat playback is possible. The system can also drop in alerts on the display for scores and weather.</p>, <p>Apple’s Siri Eyes Free is also included in the Pilot’s Display Audio system: just hold down the steering-wheel “talk” button and you’ll be able to ask Apple devices for all sorts of information.</p>, <p>The Pilot’s navigation system is Garmin-based, and includes live traffic reports, 3-D map views, and on-the-go rerouting.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55368" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pilot-driving-2.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pilot-driving-2.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-pilot-driving-2-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Pilot’s engine is a revamped version of Honda’s direct-injected 3.5-liter V6. Wound up toward redline, it has a lovely engine note that underscores Honda’s legendary reputation as an engine builder. We estimate acceleration from zero to sixty in less than seven seconds.</p>, <p>The LX, EX and EX-L use a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the Touring and Elite get a new 9-speed automatic, which brings one more mile per gallon. We prefer the 6-speed. It has a narrower spread of gears (first gear is higher and sixth gear lower), making it a bet less quick from the start and a bit less relaxed on the freeway, but it shifts more cleanly. Only once or twice did we feel it wait too long to upshift; while with the 9-speed, it happened fairly often. It also surged when it unnecessarily shifted to a lower gear. If we had wanted that gear, and had shifted with the paddles, there wouldn’t have been an issue.</p>, <p>With the 6-speed, there’s a shift lever on the console. With the 9-speed, a bunch of buttons replaces that lever, as well as the paddles. The 9-speed also has a Sport mode and shift logic that anticipates downhill gear changes, and can hold gears when cornering. Clicking the left paddle twice does a double downshift to make the most of the engine’s energetic thrust and sound. When you use the paddles one time, the transmission goes into manual mode for 30 seconds, before reverting back to automatic in order to save fuel. If you put it in Sport mode, the transmission stays in manual.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive system has torque vectoring that lets it turn in more sharply to corners, which doesn’t necessarily work with the soft suspension. Pilots with the big 20-inch wheels are more softly damped, to counteract the harshness that big wheels can induce. The front-wheel-drive version is firmer, on its standard 18-inch wheels and tires, on the lower trim levels.</p>, <p>The AWD can send up to 70 percent of power to the rear wheels, and further split the power between them using electronic actuators and hydraulic clutches. It all happens quicker than you can think.</p>, <p>Finally, most versions of the Pilot come with a traction-management system like the one on the Land Rover Discovery Sport (and borrowed for the Ford Explorer). It lets drivers choose a mode (Normal, Snow, Mud, or Sand) and sets up the drivetrain for ideal traction, whether it means starting in second gear, speeding up throttle progression, or disabling traction control. It and the Pilot’s 7.3 inches of ground clearance give it serious all-weather capability, but it’s still limited, not designed for hardcore off-roading.</p>, <p>The Pilot rides on an independent suspension, struts in front and multiple links in the back for precise body control. Its dual-path shocks dampen the lighter bumps to a gentle audible thunk, while the secondary action in the shocks rounds off the edges of deep potholes. The Pilot also uses its brakes to help corner better, by applying an inside front brake in tighter corners. That’s torque vectoring.</p>, <p>The available road-departure mitigation uses sensors and cameras to determine if the Pilot is leaving the pavement, then tries to pull it back on the road with stability, braking, and steering inputs. The package comes standard on Pilot Touring and Pilot Elite trims. We don’t like it. Far too often, it thinks you’re headed off the road when you’re not.</p>, <p>The Honda Pilot offers a huge amount of value and quality for its price. If you need to seat eight, it’s impossible to go wrong.

[<p>The Ford Explorer, about the same size as a Honda Pilot or Chevy Traverse, has made a graceful transition to from a rear-wheel-drive to a front-wheel-drive family hauler (with all-wheel drive available). Though not as rugged as it used to be, it is a mid-size crossover SUV that can tow 5000 pounds and carry seven people, and has a vast 81 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats folded flat.</p>, <p>The current generation began with model year 2011, with its transition from traditional SUV to car-based crossover, and was last revised for 2016. Mechanically, it’s long in the tooth, but there is no question the styling holds up; if anything the Explorer looks classier than those crossovers chasing edges.</p>, <p>Base engine is a 3.5-liter V6 used in other Fords, from Flex to Fusion. It makes 290 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, and can accelerate the Explorer to 60 miles per hour in about 8.5 seconds, using the standard 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55350" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-2.jpg" width="200"/>Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive is available.</p>, <p>The popular EcoBoost four-cylinder 2.3-liter turbo is available on some models, standard on Explorer Limited AWD. It’s the same engine that’s in the Mustang and Lincoln MKC. It makes 280 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque, and is way better than the V6, starting with its exhaust note.</p>, <p>Offering high performance is the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 making 365 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque; it comes with Explorer Platinum and Explorer Sport AWD models. If they made an Explorer SHO it would have this engine. The Explorer Sport with this twin-turbo V6 gets 20-inch wheels, bigger brakes and a stiffer chassis. It can’t run with a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, but delivers respectable acceleration performance.</p>, <p>The twin-turbo V6 gets an EPA-rated 18 mpg Combined city and highway, just two miles per gallon less than the base V6, at 20 mpg Combined. The EcoBoost turbo four-cylinder rates 22 mpg, but many EcoBoost owners report that their mileage doesn’t achieve the EPA rating.</p>, <p>The Explorer earns five stars in its NHTSA crash rating in every category except rollover, but SUVs never ace that one. With the IIHS, the Explorer got top scores in the moderate-front overlap, side impact and roof strength tests, but only Marginal in the small-overlap crash test, which relatively few ace.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55348" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-3.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-3.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-3-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Ford Explorer ($31,990) comes standard with the 3.5-liter V6 engine, front-wheel drive, cloth upholstery, air conditioning.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available for all models. Front-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>Explorer XLT ($34,020) and XLT AWD ($36,170) upgrade with 18-inch wheels, keyless ignition, satellite radio, navigation, and 10-way power driver’s seat.</p>, <p>Explorer Limited ($42,090) features leather seating, 20-inch wheels, heated steering wheel, interior ambient lighting, heated and cooled front seats, heated second row, power folding third row, 12-speaker Sony sound system. Limited AWD models come with the 2.3-liter turbo engine.</p>, <p>Explorer Sport ($45,950) and Platinum ($53,940) get the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>There’s a Sport Appearance Package for lower trims, rendering a more aggressive look with 20-inch wheels, a gray grille insert and black cladding, black roof rack, and gray leather seating with gray suede accents and contrast stitching. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55352" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>For being in the eighth year of its generation, the smooth styling holds up. It was revised for 2016, so it’s not so old, more like distinguished. Distinguished by being classy and subtle, showing restraint at a time when others are going all overboard on edgy and futuristic.</p>, <p>The roofline window-line, from the shoulders up, has timeless beauty. It’s the most graceful pillar/roofline in the game. With tinted rear glass and the small roof spoiler, it flows like a hawk.</p>, <p>There’s continuous cladding from the front to rear bumpers, over the wheelwells and under the doors, but it’s not intrusive.</p>, <p>On a wheelbase of 113 inches, the Explorer is sixteen and a half feet long, and weighs 4900 pounds fully loaded.</p>, <p>Ford wants the Explorer cabin to be up there with Audi and BMW, and they say they will stay on it until it is. It’s at least as handsome as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, while being a bit more contemporary, as revised for 2016.</p>, <p>But if it’s going to be tops, the infotainment must be tops, and Ford’s Sync 3 isn’t. It’s way better than the previous painful MyFord Touch, but we wish Sync 3 were simpler. It isn’t a better alternative to Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55354" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-interior.jpg" width="200"/>There are a lot of control knobs and buttons on the dash, intelligently put there for 2016.</p>, <p>With tight door seals, engine mounts that absorb vibration, and acoustic glass all around (except for the Base), it’s soft and quiet in the cabin. Forward visibility is good thanks to a high seating position, although there are over-the-shoulder blind spots thanks to those rear pillars. Beauty has a price.</p>, <p>The front seats (heated on most models) are supportive and comfortable, with soft cushions, the right amount of bolstering, and high soft armrests. The rear seats provide plenty of legroom but need more padding; the horizontal cushion is short and slanted awkwardly, and there’s not enough width in the center for an adult.</p>, <p>Rear bucket seats are available, which are more comfortable and open the access to the available third row. That reduces the seating capacity to six, but it’s a more convenient use that works for many. The dual-panel moonroof really opens things up.</p>, <p>The third row like so many is cramped for adults, but okay for kids, who (if you don’t have the rear buckets) climb back there over the forward-flipped second row.</p>, <p>The third row folds forward, with available power, to create a vast 81 cubic feet for cargo with a floor that’s nearly flat. There’s still 21 cubic feet even with all rows up.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55353" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-explorer-driving.jpg" width="200"/>It’s easy to find the limits of the base V6. It’s quick enough around town, but on a winding road under acceleration between the curves, there’s not enough torque at lower rpm, demanding constant downshifting of the transmission to find it, and the shifts are slow unless you’re in Sport mode, which most models have. That mode brings quicker shifts and throttle response. Paddle shifters aren’t available at all.</p>, <p>The 2.3-liter four-cylinder turbo has sharper acceleration with good low end, so it spurts away from corners. It loves Sport mode. It has a sweet sound: throaty, with amplified engine notes piped into the cabin. If you’re the least bit enthusiastic about driving, you need this engine.</p>, <p>The suspension uses MacPherson struts in front with an isolated subframe, and multi links in the rear, with anti-roll bars at both ends. The Sport gets a quicker steering rack, firmer suspension bits, and a strut tower brace with stiffer anti-roll bar in front.</p>, <p>The Explorer’s off-road capability is modest. Rugged terrain is not its forte. But it will get you and six friends or family through the snow to a ski resort, and back down off the icy mountain safely, an achievement maybe not so modest. The system has Normal, Mud, Sand, and Snow modes, and electronically varies the throttle and braking to deliver the best traction.</p>, <p>There are many tough competitors in the class, and Explorer has aged, but it remains a solid choice. Graceful, brawny exterior, sports suspension with the right bits. Can seat six, happily. Vast cargo space. Six-speed automatic, Sync 3 infotainment are the weak spots.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-hr-v/
[<p>The Honda HR-V is subcompact crossover back for its third year, with only changes to the wheels and paint colors for 2018. It’s based on the versatile and economical Honda Fit, and is slightly smaller than the CR-V. lt looks sportier than the CR-V and more SUV-like than the wedge-shaped aerodynamic Fit.</p>, <p>There is one engine, a 1.8-liter four-cylinder that makes 141 horsepower and 127 pound-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive is optional with the continuously variable transmission (CVT). A six-speed manual transmission is available, but the vast majority of HR-Vs use the CVT.</p>, <p>The HR-V is comfortable to drive, and it can be fun, but it isn’t sporty. Its strengths are versatility and economy, like the Fit only different, because the Fit isn’t considered a crossover. Competitors include the funky Fiat 500X, sporty Mazda CX-3, and Chevrolet Trax, which shares a platform with the upscale Buick Encore.</p>, <p>The CVT gets better gas mileage than the manual transmission, but it offers no excitement. It gets an EPA-rated 31 Combined miles per gallon with front-wheel drive, or 29 mpg with all-wheel drive. That pretty much ties it for best in class with the Mazda CX-3.</p>, <p>The cabin is clean and well organized, with a nice center stack with an optional big display. The roofline is curved for more headroom. The rear passengers have plenty of hip and legroom.</p>, <p>The HR-V steals the popular features of the Fit, like the fold-flat 60/40 rear seat, and the Magic fold-flat front seats. A flat cargo space behind the front seats, and a dropped front seatback, makes it like a minivan. With all-wheel drive and a roof rack, it’ll do anything.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55339" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-2.jpg" width="200"/>Honda HR-V comes in LX and EX models. Front-wheel drive with six-speed manual gearbox is standard, all-wheel drive with CVT is optional ($2100). (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda HR-V LX ($19,570) comes with cloth upholstery, air conditioning, tilt-and-telescoping steering column, Bluetooth, five-inch color display, four-speaker 160-watt audio system, single USB port, auxiliary audio jack, and 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>EX ($22,420) adds sunroof, fog lights, automatic climate control, heated front seats, six-speaker 180-watt stereo system, seven-inch display screen with the HondaLink interface, Pandora, text message function, second USB port, and Honda Lane Watch.</p>, <p>EX-L Navi CVT 4WD ($26,340) adds leather, navigation with voice recognition and real-time traffic, HD radio, and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Safety equipment on all models includes frontal airbags, front side airbags, side curtain airbags, electronic stability control, traction control, ABS, Brake Assist, Electronic Brake-force Distribution and multi-angle rearview camera.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55343" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The HR-V is perky and blunt, a smooth blend of hatchback and coupe. Honda says it’s designed to look like a coupe, with its short overhangs, sharp creases and aggressive angles. From the front it resembles the larger CR-V, but with a wider front grille and a stronger nose. From the side, the curved roofline is punctuated by a roof spoiler. A sharp, rising character line runs from the door up into the D-pillar. In the rear, a strong crease swoops from the outside of each tail light, creating a wide grin.</p>, <p>The cabin feels heavy on fabric and plastic. The controls are well laid out, with a five-inch touchscreen on the center stack, and better seven-inch screen on the navigation model, that’s perfectly located in the high center console, that helps separate the driver from the front passenger. Below the center stack there’s a small storage space that can fit a phone, with a USB port. The door pockets are wide and shallow.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55341" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The front seats are quite comfortable, with a fine fabric, but small persons might not find a place that fits, with the manual adjustment.</p>, <p>The leather on the top EX-L model feels somewhat stiff.</p>, <p>Rear visibility is good despite a small rear window. When you get used to Honda LaneWatch, it’s helpful. When you flip the turn signal, a screen shows the rearward view of the side of the car that’s turning, from the point of view of the sideview mirror.</p>, <p>If you go by total interior space, more than 100 cubic feet in the LX, the HR-V is the roomiest vehicle of its kind. In the rear seat, adults have excellent headroom and legroom.</p>, <p>The 60/40-split rear seat can fold completely flat, and Honda’s Magic Seat that folds and flips the second-row seat like a lawn chair. The rear cargo is square and flat with a ton of space. With the seats up, there’s a fat 25 cubic feet of cargo space; with them down, there’s 58.8 cubic feet. Compare to the Chevy Trax, with 18.7 cubic feet and 48.4 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55342" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-hrv-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The power is adequate, considering it brings back more than 30 miles per gallon, but the HR-V lacks oomph when the throttle goes down, thanks to the continuously variable transmission, which lags between shifts. However, on the EX models there is a sport mode that brings a bit of snap to the shifts, and using the paddle shifters helps a lot. Thank heavens they are there, to salvage some fun out of driving the car.</p>, <p>With the manual transmission, the acceleration feels fine, zipping around town and out on the highway. However it gets 3 mpg less, at 25 city, 33 highway, and 28 combined. But give Honda credit for offering it, as an option to their unexciting CVT. If only they built a CVT with as much feel as Subaru.</p>, <p>The HR-V is designed for commuter driving, not sporty cornering or off-roading, so the ride is better than the cornering. The body motions are well controlled, and it never feels brittle, even on terrible roads. The suspension uses struts in front and a torsion beam in the rear, with standard 17-inch wheels; it’s more absorbent than that on the Fiat 500X, Jeep Renegade or Chevy Trax.</p>, <p>As for handling, it’s adequately confident and balanced, although far from entertaining on a twisty road. The steering is fairly relaxed. If cornering is what you want in a small crossover, the Mazda CX-3 is the way to go.</p>, <p>The HR-V is a strong contender in the subcompact crossover class. It’s exactly what Honda bred it to be: a cross between the Honda Fit and CR-V. It’s not exciting to drive, but it is exciting in its ability to do so much and carry so much, while getting 30 mpg.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-land-rover-discovery-sport/
[<p>Land Rover Discovery Sport was created for 2015 as an entry-level model, replacing the LR2, and it’s been upgraded a bit each year. Smaller than the Discovery, it’s a highly capable unit-body SUV competing against premium crossovers like the BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.</p>, <p>The 2018 Discovery Sport offers a new engine with more power, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder making 286 horsepower. The base engine makes 237 horsepower, and is smooth and strong enough, its turbocharger using less boost. Both engines are mated to a paddle-shifting 9-speed automatic that responds sharply.</p>, <p>One thing the Discovery Sport has on its rivals is an available third row, so it can theoretically seat seven passengers. However, it’s not much of a third row, so Land Rover calls it a 5+2. The Discovery is better for seven passengers.</p>, <p>The Discovery Sport has a lot of the small Range Rover Evoque in it, although the Sport is a bit longer and wider.</p>, <p>Discovery Sport is 150 pounds lighter than the LR2 it replaced, thanks to an aluminum hood, roof and liftgate, as well as the use of high-strength steel in the chassis, about 20 percent of it. It’s still too heavy to be nimble, but it handles with verve and tackles off-road challenges with ease.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is standard. The Haldex system moves power between the front and rear wheels, up to 100 percent at each end, and then between the left and right wheels, depending on where the traction is needed. Its Terrain Response system has normal, grass/gravel/snow, mud/ruts, and sand modes, along with a new dynamic mode.</p>, <p>The Discovery Sport is rated to tow up to 5500 pounds, with standard Tow Hitch Assist, Tow Assist, and Trailer Stability Assist.</p>, <p>Even with direct fuel injection and the 9-speed transmission, fuel mileage for the Discovery Sport is disappointing, at 22 miles per gallon EPA Combined. And it requires Premium gasoline.</p>, <p>Whereas the Range Rover models are oriented around luxury, the Discovery line is oriented more around utility. Discovery Sport comes with a premium level of standard equipment, but luxury features like heated seats are optional.</p>, <p>Available safety equipment includes lane-departure warning, parking assist with perpendicular parking, trailer-sway control, and automatic headlamps. In the top two models, the optional automatic emergency system uses cameras to detect objects and will brake to reduce the impact or stop before impact if there’s time, from a speed no more than 32 mph.</p>, <p>The 2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport comes in SE, HSE, and HSE Luxury models, all equipped with all-wheel drive and the 237-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine.</p>, <p>Discovery Sport SE ($37,795) includes leatherette trim, eight-way power seats, a 10-speaker audio system, an app-based infotainment system with an eight-inch screen, rearview camera, 18-inch alloy wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Discovery Sport HSE ($42,395) ) adds 10-way power seats in upgraded leather, a fixed glass roof, xenon HID headlamps, front parking sensors, a power liftgate, and a proximity key. HSE Luxury ($46,795) has high-grade leather seats finished with a special diamond pattern, navigation, 19-inch alloy wheels, and some styling items.</p>, <p>The HSE and HSE Luxury are available with the more powerful 286-horsepower engine ($7000).</p>, <p>Options include heated seats, heated steering wheel, a power liftgate that can be opened with a swipe of a foot under the rear bumper, ambient mood lighting, and a Meridian audio system, to name some. The Entertainment Pack adds a 16-speaker audio system, navigation, and Land Rover’s new 10.2-inch infotainment system. The Intelligent Dynamics Pack includes a mode that tightens up the suspension and steering for better handling on curvy pavement. Several appearance packages are available including exclusive alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Land Rovers aren’t as boxy as they used to be. The Discovery Sport is distinctive in the sense that it doesn’t commit to the soft crossover look, but its sculpting is still smooth and not chiseled. Its profile is rakish, with a flair of extant Land Rover ruggedness. The wheels are big for the body, so the Sport looks planted. It’s all about the stance.</p>, <p>The thin strips of honeycomb grille, clamshell hood, skid plates, short overhangs, and keyed headlamps say Range Rover. The roofline pulls over the rear pillars in an athletic manner, ending at a stubby tailgate spoiler as it does. If North Face designed cars, they would look like this.</p>, <p>The Design Package is especially good looking, and brings the Disco Sport to life. It features special front and rear bumper designs, integrated rear tailpipes, gloss black 20-inch spoked alloy wheels, and black trim inside and out.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55334" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-discoverysport-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-discoverysport-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-discoverysport-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Discovery Sport’s cabin is business-like, with the horizontal dash and vertical centerstack meeting with the rigidity of a T-square. It’s not stark, but rather an elegant contrast to the smooth-but-still-SUVish exterior. There’s plenty of hard plastic, but it’s mostly hidden away where it doesn’t matter so much. Soft-touch surfaces abound, especially on the knobs and dials; and the rotary shift controller, rising from the piano-black center console upon startup, is a nice centerpiece. The climate control knobs are from Jaguar.</p>, <p>Graphics on the optional 10.2-inch infotainment screen are really nice, but the option requires adding a number of other features that shoot the price still higher. There’s a USB charging port for every passenger, including the tiny people squeezed into the third row.</p>, <p>Thanks to the high seating position and thin pillars, the forward visibility is excellent. Not so the rearward visibility when the third row is deployed. But that’s normal, and at least the Disco Sport has a standard rearview camera, for safety when backing up.</p>, <p>There’s good space in the first two rows, and the second row sits higher than the first, for good passenger visibility through the windshield; that’s part of the Land Rover identity. The second row also reclines, and slides on a 6.3-inch track, allowing for lots of leg room.</p>, <p>The optional third row is not only small, it’s thinly padded. It folds up from the cargo floor and has an even higher seating position than the second row, great for kids but it puts adults’ knees into their chins. So forget it, adults. Families needing a third row should look to the Discovery, not the Sport, but that plus-2 is there for the occasional need.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55335" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-discoverysport-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-discoverysport-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-discoverysport-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The base 237-horsepower engine can accelerate the Discovery Sport from zero to sixty in 7.8 seconds, and it can hit 124 miles per hour. We haven’t driven a 2018 model with the upgraded engine.</p>, <p>Land Rover blends road tenacity with offroad ability like no other brand. The stocky 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, making 237 horsepower and 251 pound-feet of torque at just 1750 rpm, is responsive and confident. The broad torque curve helps the Discovery Sport feel peppier than it actually is. It’s as comfortable on the freeway as it is rock crawling on trails.</p>, <p>The paddleshifting 9-speed automatic can launch in second gear for smoothness and skip gears if necessary, for example when you floor the throttle and it shifts down. It can be a little busy as it sorts through gears, but it’s mostly unobtrusive. Speaking of unobtrusive, we found the standard engine stop-start system to be relatively smooth.</p>, <p>The suspension is front struts and rear links, both mounted to subframes for isolation from noise and vibration. The electric power steering has a variable ratio to improve on-center response. There’s not much feedback but it’s nicely weighted. It’s confident on a curvy road and unwinds predictably.</p>, <p>Big disc brakes on all four wheels provide terrific finesse and a firm pedal feel at speed. The brakes stop the weight of nearly 4000 pounds just fine.</p>, <p>The suspension allows more travel and more control during rebound than the Evoque, not surprising because the Evoque is intended to be less of an offroad vehicle. The traction control system with its modes decides which wheel gets the power. That might not be traditional off-roading, but it works. The Discovery Sport can handle a steep rocky climb. The weak link will be the tire sidewalls.</p>, <p>The Discovery Sport offers approach and departure angles of 25 and 31 degrees, along with 8.3 inches of ground clearance and a wading depth of nearly 24 inches. The maximum tilt angle and gradient angle are 27 and 45 degrees. That all translates to high capability over very difficult terrain.</p>, <p>Through the Haldex 5 center-differential clutch pack and brake actuation at the individual wheels, the system can send torque to whichever wheel has the most traction, and up to 100 percent to either axle.</p>, <p>The Terrain Response system’s modes affect throttle sensitivity, transmission response, differential behavior, steering weighting, and stability systems. It works with the Haldex 5 center-differential clutch pack and brake actuation to deliver torque to the wheel that has the grip to use it. We drove the Discovery Sport on some steep trails covered by snow and ice, rugged enough to challenge the car’s angles, ground clearance, and traction systems. Besides being very capable, we found it very easy to drive off-road.</p>, <p>Superb powertrain, stylish looks, elegant cabin, great ride and handling, 5+2 seating, and over-achieving offroad capability, all for a reasonable entry-level price. If you can live without the stylish options, it’s a bargain, even with barely-20 fuel mileage on premium fuel.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-cr-v/
[<p>The Honda CR-V, a compact crossover SUV with room for passengers and cargo, was all new for 2017; so for 2018 it’s unchanged. CR-V’s driving dynamics are appealing and it’s relatively refined and isolated from road turmoil. The Honda’s main rival is the Toyota RAV4, but the compact crossover field is crowded with good cars.</p>, <p>CR-V LX models uses a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 184 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>All other models use a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that makes 190 horsepower and 179 pound-feet. That’s a mere 6 horsepower difference on paper, but the turbo feels much stronger. All models use a gearless continuously variable transmission (CVT).</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available, including on the LX. When road conditions warrant, the all-wheel-drive can distribute greater power to rear wheels for more stable handling and greater all-weather capability. A rearview camera is standard on all models.</p>, <p>The fuel mileage is high, from 27 to 30 miles per gallon depending on the powertrain. A front-drive LX is EPA-rated at 26/32 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers that estimate to 25/31/27 mpg City/Highway/Combined. A turbo with front-wheel drive is EPA-rated at 28/34 mpg City/Highway, or 30 mpg Combined, while the all-wheel-drive version lops 1 mpg off each figure.</p>, <p>All models except the LX (about 75 percent) include Honda Sensing, a suite of safety technology including automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane-departure warning. If the CR-V starts to drift, lane-keep assist can nudge the CR-V back where it belongs. The system determines drift by the driver not using the turn signal to change lanes, so if you start to change lanes without using the turn signal, the steering wheel will resist. Honda Sensing also includes road departure mitigation, blind-spot monitoring, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the CR-V five stars overall in crash testing, with five-star scores in each test with contact, and four stars for rollover prevention, typical for crossovers and SUVs, which are taller than sedans.</p>, <p>Top ratings also were given by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which awarded the CR-V a Top Safety Pick+ for those CR-Vs with Honda Sensing and LED headlamps.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55324" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Honda CR-V LX ($24,150) comes with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and CVT, plus automatic climate control, four-speaker audio, a rearview camera, cruise control, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED running lamps, keyless entry, and Bluetooth audio. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $940 destination charge.)</p>, <p>CR-V EX ($26,950) comes with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, and adds 18-inch wheels, heated front seats, power driver’s seat, automatic headlights, heated mirrors, pushbutton start, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, satellite radio, and moonroof. Also standard is the Honda Sensing suite of safety technology.</p>, <p>CR-V EX-L ($29,450) upgrades with leather-trimmed seat upholstery, a power tailgate, power passenger’s seat, driver’s seat memory, and eight-speaker audio. Navigation is optional ($1,000).</p>, <p>Touring ($32,650) includes navigation, LED headlights, automatic wipers, a hands-free power tailgate, 330-watt audio, side roof rails, unique wheels, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available for all trim levels except LX ($1400).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55325" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The CR-V exudes a sense of upscale. It can be seen as stylish or quirky. Up front are aerodynamic LEDs, but the front bumper protrudes a bit, as if it weren’t part of the headlamp design. Upswept rear roof pillars continue a CR-V design theme that’s been going on for years. The taillights sit high, separated by a chrome strip on a tailgate with a curious bulge. The badging is oddly positioned.</p>, <p>The layout of the cabin is more conventional than the outside styling, and it’s widely acclaimed. Five occupants enjoy room and comfort, surrounded by materials of high quality. For both passengers and cargo, the available space is used in an especially effective manner.</p>, <p>The 2017 redesign increased the cargo area by nearly a foot, without increasing the CR-V’s exterior length. In the back, legroom grew by 2 inches. And the rear seat is wider, making more room for the third passenger back there, always squeezed in a compact.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55327" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Pull a lever, and the adjustable second-row backrests fold totally flat, a convenient feature. A removable panel reveals a concealed, under-floor storage area.</p>, <p>All trim levels except the LX include a 12-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support; however the wide center console may cut into the driver’s leg space.</p>, <p>Organized and functional, the dashboard reaches toward luxury in top-level Touring trim. CR-V EX and Touring editions rely more on their 7.0-inch touchscreen than on traditional switches or buttons. A new screen coating is used to resist fingerprints, and a volume-control knob has been added.</p>, <p>The navigation system is one of the easiest to use. Inputting an address is as easy as typing it in on a computer. However the system in our test car sometimes dropped the destination when stopping and restarting the car, forcing a laborious re-entry.</p>, <p>Honda engineers carefully blended composed handling with a refined ride. The CR-V is intended for the core of the compact crossover market, so its driving behavior is slanted more toward a premium feel than aggressive or sporty. Steering is accurate and responsive, and the car feels secure and confident when moving briskly on curvy two-lanes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55328" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-crv-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The suspension subdues flawed pavement. The frame was stiffened as part of the 2017 redesign, enabling a softer suspension to be used without affecting the overall stability. It might not handle better in corners than the athletic Mazda CX-5, but the ride is more comfortable.</p>, <p>Performance is adequate in the LX with the base 2.4-liter engine, but considerably stronger in models using the 1.5-liter turbo, whose acceleration and passing power are helped by torque that is fully there at a low 2000 rpm. The turbo CR-V can reach 60 mph about 1.5 seconds quicker than a 2.4-liter LX, although the engine sounds harsh when accelerating hard.</p>, <p>The continuously variable transmission is the weakest link in CR-V, sluggish when accelerating at highway speeds. Pushing harder on the throttle to compensate causes it to jump to a lower ratio, not what the driver intended, an annoying trait.</p>, <p>The Honda CR-V is one of the best of the many compact crossover SUVs, a leader in cabin space, refinement and comfort. Handling is good, ride quality is very good. The base CR-V LX is nicely equipped, however its 2.4-liter engine is considerably slower than the EX and other models with the smaller but more powerful turbocharged engine. The CVT is the weak link here, with a hesitation when you most need a quick response.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with Mitch McCullough reporting from the Northeast, and staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-nissan-rogue/
[<p>Nissan Rogue is a small crossover. Now in its fifth year of production, the Nissan Rogue has tough competition with updated rivals like the Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and Mazda CX-5.</p>, <p>Rogue is comfortable and has all-wheel drive available, but its powertrain and handling are unexciting compared to those others. For 2018, the optional third-seat has been dropped. It was very small.</p>, <p>The 2018 Rogue SL model can be optioned with Nissan’s new ProPilot Assist technology, a step closer to autonomous driving. With ProPilot Assist, the Rogue can automatically accelerate, brake, and maintain the distance from other vehicles with no driver input, in certain situations.</p>, <p>Also for 2018, the standard infotainment system has been updated to include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the entry-level Rogue S gets a nice 7.0-inch touchscreen, and there are two new colors. For 2018, all but the base model get standard liftback opening with a wave of the foot under the rear bumper.</p>, <p>It’s hard to put the Rogue in a box, because the smaller Nissan Juke is deemed a compact, and the larger Pathfinder a midsize. Rogue is a big compact or a small midsize, closer to the Pathfinder in size. Nissan sells a smaller, less-powerful crossover called the Rogue Sport that’s cheaper but certainly not sportier.</p>, <p>Rogue comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder mated to a continuously variable transmission, making 170 horsepower with 175 foot-pounds of torque, delivering mediocre acceleration and a strong 29 EPA Combined miles per gallon with front-wheel drive, 27 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The cargo area is handy for cargo, but unsecured floor panels make the Rogue a terrible choice for dog owners.</p>, <p>Rogue has earned a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS, with mostly top Good scores, an Acceptable headlamp rating, and Superior front crash prevention. The NHTSA gives it four stars. It’s a rare discrepancy, for a vehicle that gets the top rating from IIHS not to get five stars from NHTSA. It appears that it’s the SL model with LED headlamps that earns the top score from IIHS.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55319" height="148" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-rogue-2.jpg" width="200"/>Rogue S ($24,680), Rogue SV ($25,900), and Rogue SL ($31,060) come with the 2.5-liter engine. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Rogue S includes climate control; Bluetooth with audio streaming; rearview camera; 17-inch wheels and all-season tires; tire pressure monitor; and an AM/FM/XM/CD audio with a USB port and four speakers. Options include blind-spot monitors, a lane-departure warning system, and a forward-collision warning system with emergency automatic braking for the SL Premium.</p>, <p>Rogue SV adds satellite radio; alloy wheels; automatic headlights; a power driver’s seat; keyless ignition, and NissanConnect, which enables the use of smartphone apps like Pandora. A Premium Package for the SV comes with a 7.0-inch touchscreen; voice-activated navigation; real-time traffic and weather data; a surround-view camera system; a power liftgate; heated cloth seats; blind-spot monitors; and a lane-departure warning system.</p>, <p>Rogue SL gets leather upholstery, heated front seats, Bose audio, NissanConnect, Siri Eyes Free, navigation, power tailgate, surround-view camera, 18-inch wheels. A Premium Package for the SL adds a panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot warning, lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control. Options include that ProPilot Assist, plus run-flat tires, a panoramic sunroof, those advanced-safety features, and LED headlamps to go with the standard LED running lights and taillamps.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55318" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-rogue-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Rogue got a light tweak for 2017, including a V-neck grille with LED running lamps in front and LED taillamps in back.</p>, <p>The shape is handsome and proportions good, but the styling is conservative and benign. It’s almost un-Nissan-like. There’s no wild sculpting like on the Nissan Juke. It looks like any other similar-sized SUV.</p>, <p>The interior is handsomely finished with high-quality materials, low-gloss plastics and metallic trim. It’s simply laid out with round knobs and a centerstack with LCD monitor. There’s a cowl over the gauges and slim vents in the center.</p>, <p>Like the Altima sedan, the front seats are very comfortable, with dense foam and great shaping. Manual adjustment standard in the S model, power in the rest; heating is optional. The driving position is good, although the non-adjustable steering wheel (reshaped in 2017) is raked a bit flat, like a bus.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55317" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-rogue-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-rogue-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-rogue-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>One excellent feature is the flat-folding front passenger seat, increasing cargo versatility. And the cabin is fairly quiet, with more sound insulation added in 2017.</p>, <p>The second row slides on a nine-inch track to expand the legroom, reclining for long-distance comfort, and tucking behind the front seats for cargo. When the rear is folded, there’s a sizeable 70 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>, <p>In the back, where the optional third row used to be, there are panels with stowage boxes and bins in the back. They’re great for things like tools, coolers, or muddy boots.</p>, <p>They’ve turned the Rogue into a terrible car for transporting large dogs, however. When the dog steps on one of the panels forming the cargo floor, the panel flips up and the dog falls into the bin, which could cause an injury to the dog.</p>, <p>The rearward visibility is obstructed a bit by the pillars, so we like the surround-view camera that’s standard on the SL and optional (in a package) on the SV. It presents a composite 360-degree view from four cameras and provides great security when parking not only in reverse, but in tight side and even forward spaces.</p>, <p>The Rogue accelerates from zero to sixty in about eight seconds, a long time nowadays. It’s noisy and hits an end to progress in the acceleration too soon, meaning it gets even slower from 60 to 80 mph. And that’s not even in the Eco mode, which dulls the throttle and keeps the engine from revving high.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55316" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-rogue-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The Rogue is blown away by the turbocharged fours of the Ford Escape EcoBoost, and Hyundai Santa Fe.</p>, <p>The CVT is programmed to imitate an automatic transmission with gears, and it’s quick and smooth, although nothing like that of the outstanding Subaru Forester.</p>, <p>The Rogue’s ride is calm and composed, quite comfortable on the independent suspension, not too firm, as the tall all-season tires absorb freeway roughness.</p>, <p>The Rogue doesn’t wander over grooved concrete, and it responds smoothly, but it’s kind of slow and not very communicative. It would be an understatement to say the steering and handling lacks the vivid feedback of a Mazda CX-5 or Ford Escape.</p>, <p>Nissan is clever in how the Rogue uses its stability control, by cutting the throttle to smooth bumps (preventing surging over them, like coasting over speed bumps), and braking the inside front wheel to sharpen cornering lines by rotating the car. You can’t consciously feel these things, but you can feel the more comfortable results.</p>, <p>The Rogue is a dated product and competition is strong. The engine is weak. The CVT is fairly quick, but not nearly as sharp as that of the Subaru Forester. Nice ride, but soft handling. Look for deals.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with New Car Test Drive editor Mitch McCullough reporting from New Jersey, and staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mini-countryman/
[<p>A new plug-in hybrid model joins the 2018 Mini Countryman lineup. The five-seat Countryman was a new design for 2017, so it hasn’t changed for the 2018 model year otherwise.</p>, <p>Though the bodywork looks the same, Countryman is a bit more refined and a lot bigger than the traditional Mini Cooper hardtop. The crossover is 8 inches longer on a wheelbase that’s 3 inches longer than that of the hardtop, but it’s also blown up all around. It’s taller, because it’s a wagon, and has more ground clearance. It’s larger than the Mini Clubman.</p>, <p>Countryman is built on the platform of the BMW X1, and shares engines and suspension components as well. Front-wheel drive is standard, and it’s available with BMW’s ALL4 all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Though not as vibrant as the hardtop, the Countryman has a ton of personality and character and, relative to other subcompact SUVs, it has fabulous handling.</p>, <p>The base engine is a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder making 134 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque. The Cooper S gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder cranking out 189 horsepower and 207 pound-feet.</p>, <p>There’s also John Cooper Works model, with that engine turbo-boosted to make 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. All-wheel drive is standard, along with a sport suspension and body kit that gives the Mini some muscle. John Cooper founded the Cooper Car Company with his father after WWII, and his open-wheel rear-engined cars ruled for years, including the F1 world championship in 1959, the year the Mini was born, and 1960. Minis remain available with the classic Cooper stripe.</p>, <p>The standard transmission is a 6-speed manual gearbox, with an optional 8-speed automatic for the 2.0-liter engine, and a 6-speed automatic for the front-wheel-drive 1.5-liter. ALL4 all-wheel drive isn’t meant for rugged off-roading, but rather for security on slippery roads. It’s good for snow and ice, or maybe sand and mud if that happens.</p>, <p>The new plug-in hybrid is called the Cooper S E ALL4. It uses the 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine to power the front wheels, and an electric motor driven by a lithium-ion battery to power the rear wheels. The total horsepower is a neat 221; transmission is a 6-speed automatic. It can run 24 miles on all-electric power, far enough to be a gasless daily commuter in a small town.</p>, <p>All versions include eight airbags and a rearview camera. Two advanced safety features are available in an option package: adaptive cruise control, along with forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>With either the 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual, and front-wheel drive, the 1.5-liter Countryman gets 28 Combined miles per gallon. ALL4 gets two miles per gallon less with manual, three less with automatic. Premium gasoline is required for all models.</p>, <p>The Cooper S with its turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder 24 Combined mpg in either front-wheel or all-wheel drive, with the manual. But go for the 8-speed automatic and it brings it up two or three miles per gallon.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55308" height="142" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-countryman-final.jpg" width="200"/>The Mini Countryman Cooper ($26,600) comes standard with the 1.5-liter engine, front-wheel drive, leatherette upholstery, panoramic sunroof, automatic headlights, a 6.5-inch infotainment screen, rearview camera, rear parking sensors, and 17-inch wheels. The ALL4 ($28,600) adds heated seats, as all-wheel-drive buyers probably live where it’s cold. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Cooper S ($31,200) gets the more powerful 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, LED headlights and foglamps, sport seats, and 18-inch wheels. Cooper S ALL4 ($31,700) adds all-wheel drive and heated seats to Cooper S.</p>, <p>John Cooper Works ALL4 ($37,800) is the sport-performance edition, with its 228-horsepower engine, firmer suspension with 18-inch wheels, and body kit.</p>, <p>The Cooper S E ALL4 plug-in hybrid ($36,800) with its gasoline/electric powertrain, can go 24 miles on electric power alone, according to BMW, and can be plugged into an electrical outlet for recharging.</p>, <p>An optional tech package supports Apple CarPlay. There are so many options it’s dizzying, as customization is what it’s all about. It can get expensive in a hurry.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55310" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-countryman-rear.jpg" width="200"/>We already said what best describes the Countryman: it’s large. For something called a Mini. It’s also bulbous and ungainly, although it does its best to hide its girth. And the Countryman really does labor against the disadvantage of being compared to the Mini Cooper. If the smaller car weren’t an icon, or if it didn’t exist at all, no one would be calling the Countryman fat. Size-wise, it would be just another compact SUV.</p>, <p>But back to the body-shaming. It has a protruding chin under its bulging headlamps. There’s an attempt to look rugged, with unpainted fender flares. The roofline is curious. Mini purists might not be crazy about it. Or the whole adventurous car.</p>, <p>The cabin is well laid-out and comfortable, carefully furnished and finished, while still being characteristically quirky and joyful. Soft-touch plastic surfaces are plentiful, while materials are high quality. Tall windows and slim pillars provide good forward visibility for the driver.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55309" height="206" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-countryman-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Four adults can ride in comparative comfort, with decent legroom in rear; but the fifth one needs to be slim, if he or she is in the middle rear seat. It’s fairly quiet, although the wide 18-inch tires on the Cooper S can be noisy.</p>, <p>At the dashboard center, a large circular panel functions as a hub for most operations, with some controlled by toggle switches. A 6.5-inch screen is standard. The 8.8-inch touchscreen displays elegant maps, but navigation is a costly option.</p>, <p>Characteristically, over-the-top gauges and wild lighting convey a feeling of youthful excess. It seems to be popular.</p>, <p>After all the to-do about enlargement, the Countryman still feels confining with a full load of people and luggage. But what compact wouldn’t.</p>, <p>In addition to vibrancy, Minis are known for handling, and the Countryman doesn’t let down the reputation. It’s delight to drive, more so than the BMW X1.</p>, <p>The electric power steering is precise, the chassis stiff, and the suspension tuned by experts in the art. The driving experience is stimulating yet relaxed. Except when it feels slightly jumpy, almost darty. The steering can be over-precise, if the driver is. But if the Countryman wanted to be easy like a Honda CR-V, well, never happen.</p>, <p>Rolling through the curves, it stays firmly planted, not much body lean. The plug-in hybrid is heavier, carrying its battery pack and motor, so it doesn’t toss around so easily.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55307" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-countryman-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-countryman-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-countryman-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The ride control is great. There is an available adaptive suspension that tightens the ride at the flip of a switch.</p>, <p>In ruts and potholes, most of the thumping and crashing is curtailed.</p>, <p>The three-cylinder turbocharged 1.5-liter engine is peppy enough, although you can feel it vibrating in the steering wheel, when you’re working to keep up. The four-cylinder turbocharged 2.0-liter engine is smoother, as well as faster.</p>, <p>The 8-speed automatic that’s available for all-wheel-drive models holds back a bit when starting off. But there’s another 8-speed automatic available, with paddle shifters, and programmed for sportier driving. We’ll take that one. Or be happy with the 6-speed manual transmission that’s a joy to shift, with either engine.</p>, <p>We got good seat time in the new plug-in hybrid, the Mini Cooper S E Countryman All4. The three-cylinder engine is matched with a 65 kw (87 hp) electric motor and 7.6-kwh battery for a combined output of 221 hp. The electric motor powers the rear wheels, and sends some power to the front as well, which makes it a through-the-road hybrid system.</p>, <p>To accelerate up to highway speed using all-electric power, you have to pay attention. It’s not as fast as gas power. But it’s well-silenced, when both the motor and gas engine are being used.</p>, <p>The EPA rates the all-electric range of 12 miles, while BMW claims 24. We wonder why. Must be different test criteria. Maybe the Mini test track is downhill. We take back what we said about it being a gasless daily commuter. We were going on PR.</p>, <p>BMW marketing of the Mini Cooper S E Countryman All4 is fairly casual on the plug-in thing. Some buyers of the plug-in hybrid won’t even bother to plug it in; what for, to save a half-gallon of gas, while adding the chore of plugging it in at night? It’s not always convenient, we’ve been there a few times.</p>, <p>But they can still say they drive a hybrid.</p>, <p>The Mini Countryman might be fat, but it has a fun personality. It’s less imaginative than the Mini Cooper, but it’s meant for an older and less free crowd, who might have a child or two. The cabin is quiet and refined, the handling is superb, the 1.5-liter engine works. But for the Countryman to work for us, we’d have to really need it, and only the Cooper S with ALL4.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-land-rover-range-rover-evoque/
[<p>The Range Rover Evoque is a unique car, tiny yet sophisticated, luxurious and stylish. For the mountain traveler, it offers four-wheel drive and offroad capability, sort of an offroad sports car.</p>, <p>It’s small for an SUV, and light, at only 3600 pounds. So the handling is nimble.</p>, <p>For 2018, Evoque gets a new engine to go with its smooth 9-speed automatic transmission, as well as some new available trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55303" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-evoque-convertible.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-evoque-convertible.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-evoque-convertible-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2018 Evoque comes in two body styles: as a five-door SUV or a two-door convertible sports car/SUV. The three-door coupe has been dropped.</p>, <p>Evoque doesn’t have any exact rivals, due to its small size. It’s closest to the BMW X1.</p>, <p>The 2018 Evoque replaces the previous Ford-built engine with one built by Jaguar Land Rover. Like the Ford engine, it’s a turbocharged 2.0-liter four cylinder making 237 horsepower (compared to 240 hp). But now there’s also a more powerful version with more turbo boost, making 286 horsepower.</p>, <p>Evoque comes standard with what Land Rover calls Active Driveline, with active differentials and torque vectoring. The system decouples the rear wheels above 22 mph, and re-couples them within 300 milliseconds whenever drive is needed from the rear. For rugged terrain, All-Terrain Progress Control makes the vehicle crawl at any slow speed the driver sets, so the driver can focus on steering around rocks or trees or whatever. In addition to all-wheel drive, Evoque comes with hill descent control and trailer stability assist.</p>, <p>The Evoque is wildly more capable offroad than most could imagine. On the road, it is composed, with an easy ride. The convertible looks sporty but it’s no sports car.</p>, <p>2018 models come in five-door versions, including Evoque SE ($41,800), SE Premium ($45,900), Landmark Edition ($48,400), HSE ($51,100), HSE Dynamic ($54,300), and Autobiography ($62,600). The 286-horsepower engine is available for the HSE Dynamic ($57,300) and Autobiography ($65,500).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55302" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-evoque-driving-convertible.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-evoque-driving-convertible.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-evoque-driving-convertible-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Evoque Convertible comes in SE Dynamic ($52,100) and HSE Dynamic ($57,800).</p>, <p>Evoque SE gets leather, navigation, automatic climate control, infotainment with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, 12-way power front seats, front and rear parking sensors, and 18-inch wheels. SE Premium models add LED accent lighting; a gesture-operated tailgate; and driver’s seat memory; and the InControl Touch Plus infotainment system, with an 8.0-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>HSE brings Oxford leather seats; heated front seats; a fixed panoramic glass sunroof; automatic high beams; and blind-spot monitors.</p>, <p>Dynamic models get a special Dynamic Mode for the Adaptive Dynamics system, and are distinguished by illuminated tread plates, bright exhaust finishers, a rear spoiler, and a perforated leather steering wheel.</p>, <p>Autobiography gets a panoramic moonroof, 10-inch infotainment, premium audio, in-seat massagers, and a surround-view camera system.</p>, <p>Available equipment includes forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, a mode that lets the Evoque follow the vehicle ahead in stop-and-go traffic, and adaptive cruise control. Also an 825-watt Meridian audio system; keyless ignition; a surround-view camera system; and a heated windshield and steering wheel. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>The Evoque looks like a chopped and channeled hot rod that flew half a century into the future. It’s definitely dramatic, with stylish sheetmetal that gives it the air of high fashion. The bottom half is blunt like an SUV, the middle is crisply folded over a linear beltline, and the roof sweeps back like a coupe or sedan.</p>, <p>The grille is less high fashion and more cow-bar. The wheel arches are powerful. The glass is pinched at the rear, with black pillars that are erased over a high windowline. It wraps to a bobbed and canted rear deck with glittery taillamps.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55301" height="92" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-evoque-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The Evoque is reasonably comfortable for four, but if you’re climbing in with two other passengers, you should elbow the others out of the way to get the front seat. They’re power adjustable on base models, all the way up to 14 directions on Autobiography versions with in-seat massagers. Adults in the rear seats will likely ask to move the fronts up. Way up.</p>, <p>Behind the second row, there’s a reasonable but not bountiful 20 cubic feet of cargo room that expands to 51 cubic inches with the seats down. Keep in mind this is a compact SUV. It works best for two people with the rear seats folded down for cargo.</p>, <p>The cabin is sleek but simple, and richly detailed. A number of interesting interior trims are available, from cool metallic to warm wood. The shapes and cues all say Range Rover, as does the instrument panel. Ambient LED lighting turns red to let you know you’re in Sport mode.</p>, <p>The front seats are handsome in their standard leather trim, comfortable and fairly well bolstered. Most Evoque models have a sunroof, which cuts into headroom. If you want a massage, buy the option and you can get one without ever leaving the comfort of your car.</p>, <p>Storage cubbies are strong; there’s a large center console with cupholders under a sliding top, a reasonably roomy glove box, door-panel pockets, and a relatively deep bin below the armrest.</p>, <p>Land Rover’s latest infotainment system is a massive upgrade from its prior setup, but it’s not without some sluggish responses.</p>, <p>The stylish high rear deck destroys rearward vision, so the optional surround-view camera is a good idea, to supplement the rearview camera.</p>, <p>The Evoque moves quickly and confidently, behind its solid powertrain. The 9-speed transmission is shared with other manufacturers that haven’t calibrated their versions as well; in the Evoque it shifts smoothly, skipping the hesitation we’ve found in other cars with the same unit, though we don’t love it. The transmission helps with the fuel mileage, with those tall top gears.</p>, <p>The handling is car-like, nimble and balanced, with electric power steering that responds crisply to light inputs, as does its independent suspension; so keep an eye out for the light, crisp bumps. With the Dynamic package, adaptive magnetic dampers offer improved ride quality and body control. The torque-vectoring system reduces understeer in hard corners.</p>, <p>For trail riding, the short overhangs and good ground clearance enable the Evoque to ride over obstacles. We got some seat time offroad, and the Evoque did as much as any other compact crossover we’ve driven. For the most part, the Evoque has the off-road ability owners seek. The standard Terrain Response system has Normal, Snow, Mud &amp; Ruts, and Sand modes.</p>, <p>The unique and stylish Evoque could be a winner for some. It doesn’t promise anything that it doesn’t deliver. Superb 9-speed automatic. Beautiful cabin with room in front. Rear better for cargo than people.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>Launched as a 2010 model, the Panamera brought Porsche into a new vehicle category. Created to complement the German automaker’s illustrious sports-car heritage, the Panamera was a masterfully stylish four-door luxury fastback sedan, whose enchanting lines easily turned heads.</p>, <p>Redesigned for 2017, the second-generation Panamera grew slightly and adopted a fresh look. For the 2018 model year, a new Sport Turismo hatchback body style joins the sedan. The 2018 lineup includes twin hybrid plug-in models, topped by the 680-horsepower Turbo S E-Hybrid.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55294" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-turismo.jpg" width="200"/>Porsche offers 17 versions, five of which are Sport Turismos. The lineup includes a base model, all-wheel-drive Panamera 4 and 4S, long-wheelbase Executive, and Turbos.</p>, <p>The rear-wheel-drive base Panamera holds a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 rated at 330 horsepower, able to reach 60 mph in 5.4 seconds. All but the base model feature all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>In the Panamera 4S, a twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6 produces 440 horsepower (up 20) and 406 pound-feet of torque. Acceleration to 60 mph is achieved in as little as 4.0 seconds. The Panamera Turbo V8 raises the ante to 550 horsepower and 567 pound-feet.</p>, <p>A fast-acting 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, called PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) goes into all models.</p>, <p>Two E-Hybrid models are offered. The 462-horsepower, 2.9-liter 4 E-Hybrid develops 516 pound-feet of torque. Accelerating to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, it can travel more than 30 miles on electricity alone.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55291" height="136" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-2.jpg" width="200"/>Inspired by the 918 Spyder, the flagship Turbo S E-Hybrid boasts 680 horsepower and 626 pound-feet from its 4.0-liter V8/electric powertrain. Both hybrids use lithium-ion battery packs. Porsche says recharging takes 12.5 hours at a 110-volt outlet, dropping to 2.4 hours with a 240-volt charger.</p>, <p>Conventional models seat four, while the Panamera Executive, with its longer wheelbase, adds about 6 inches of rear-seat legroom. Sport Turismos come with either four-place seating or a 4+1 configuration that replaces the rear-seat console with a narrow, high-riding middle seat.</p>, <p>Not everyone swooned over the first generation. Some branded it lumpy; but the current Panamera is more cohesive in nature.</p>, <p>Neither the NHTSA nor the IIHS has crash-tested the Porsche Panamera.</p>, <p>All models have forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and a rearview camera. Active lane control, adaptive cruise control, Night Vision, and automatic parking assistance are optional.</p>, <p>The Porsche Panamera ($85,000) comes standard with the 330-horsepower, 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 and rear-wheel drive, plus 19-inch alloy wheels, partial leather upholstery, and parking sensors. The 12.3-inch infotainment screen features Apple CarPlay compatibility and navigation.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55292" height="107" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Panamera 4 ($89,600) adds all wheel drive. All except the base model have all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Panamera 4S ($103,000) uses a 2.9-liter V6 engine.</p>, <p>Panamera Turbo ($150,000) gets the 4.0-liter V8.</p>, <p>An extended-length body adds rear-seat space for the Panamera 4 Executive ($96,300), Panamera 4S Executive ($113,900), and Panamera Turbo Executive ($160,000).</p>, <p>The new hatchback body is use for the Panamera Sport Turismo 4 ($96,200), Sport Turismo 4S ($109,200), and Sport Turismo Turbo ($154,000).</p>, <p>The hybrid plug-in powertrain with 2.9-liter V6 is used for the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid ($99,600), Sport Turismo 4 E-Hybrid ($104,000), and Executive E-Hybrid ($104,100).</p>, <p>The hybrid powertrain with 680-hp, 4.0-liter V8 is used for the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid ($184,400), Sport Turismo Turbo S E-Hybrid ($188,400), and Turbo S Executive E-Hybrid ($194,800).</p>, <p>An adaptive suspension and rear-wheel steering are among the many options. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,050 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55290" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-rear-turismo.jpg" width="200"/>Brawny back fenders and short front and rear overhangs demonstrate kinship to the legendary 911 sports car. So does the rearward-sweeping, fastback-style roof in standard Panameras. Up front, all Panameras look about the same, with a long hood leading into a sinewy body shape.</p>, <p>New Sport Turismos repeat the Panamera’s heritage-laden design, but pushing the roofline up slightly and stretching it rearward. The back window is more positively slanted. Both body styles are hatchbacks, but the Sport Turismo’s is more obvious.</p>, <p>For a cabin so lovely, the Panamera is impressively utilitarian. Despite some plastic switches materials are in keeping with Panamera prices.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55293" height="148" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-interior.jpg" width="200"/>On the lower, vertical dashboard, everything looks high-tech. Twin 7.0-inch screens comprise the instrument cluster, augmented by a 12.3-inch touchscreen and a central tachometer.</p>, <p>Four passengers will be more comfortable than five, though space ranks above average in both front and back. Seats are somewhat low, but highly comfortable and supportive. Rear occupants in the standard Panamera get separate, amply-bolstered seats.</p>, <p>Sport Turismos can substitute 4+1 seating for the usual two-place individual seats. The Turismo’s bench has a tall center hump, likely to bring the additional occupant’s head close to the roof. Legroom is scant, too.</p>, <p>Cargo volume totals 17.4 cubic feet in standard model, but only 15 in the Sport Turismo. Folding rear seatbacks raises space close to 46 and 49 cubic feet, respectively.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55289" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-panamera-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Every Panamera is masterfully composed and compliant for daily driving. Ride and handling qualities are equally brilliant in Sport Turismo form.</p>, <p>E-Hybrids ride and handle like their gasoline-engine counterparts, including crisp steering that transmits road feel through the steering wheel. On bumpy pavement, a Panamera feels firmly planted.</p>, <p>Optional rear-wheel steering shrinks the turning circle, improves stability, and elevates confidence on winding roads. Optional ceramic brakes yield powerful halts, but can be troublesome in urban driving.</p>, <p>With any engine, acceleration is simply wondrous. The optional Sport Chrono feature, when activated, yields 20 seconds of additional boost.</p>, <p>Porsche claims the Panamera 4S can hit 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, (4.0 with Sport Chrono). Satisfying sounds tickle the driver’s ear. Turbo acceleration to 60 mph takes as little as 3.4 seconds, yet it doesn’t feel brutal.</p>, <p>E-Hybrids include Hybrid Auto and E-Power settings. Torque from either E-Hybrid powertrain is available almost instantly. The 4 E-Hybrid performs vigorously, while the Turbo S E-Hybrid rivals Tesla sedans.</p>, <p>Brake-pedal feel in an E-Hybrid can be troubling at very low speeds, when transitioning between regenerative braking and the conventional mechanical brakes.</p>, <p>With V6 and rear-drive, the base Panamera is EPA-rated at 21/28 mpg City/Highway, or 24 mpg Combined. The Panamera 4 hatchback and long-wheelbase Executive score 21/27/23 mpg. The Panamera 4S and 4S Executive manage a 21/28/23 mpg estimate, while Turbo editions are EPA-rated at 18/25 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The Panamera 4 E-hybrid hasn’t been EPA-rated, but Porsche estimates an MPGe rating at 51 mpg or higher, with at least a 20-mile all-electric driving range.</p>, <p>Panamera shoppers face plenty of choices. Even the rear-drive base model is abundantly equipped. Luxury features abound, though a few items typically seen at this price level are curiously absent. In addition to superior Porsche-level roadability, the Panamera is readily customizable, with outstanding infotainment and a wealth of intriguing technology available.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection.

[<p>The Fiat 124 Spider was reborn as a 2017 model, from the sweet little 1966-1986 roadster of the same name. However, this time around it’s more Japanese than Italian, as a partnership between Fiat and Mazda brought the light and rigid chassis from the MX-5 Miata to the sheetmetal and suspension by Fiat. It’s a win-win-win deal: Mazda, Fiat, and buyers of the two-seat 124. Just don’t call it a Fiata.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55272" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-124-abarth.jpg" width="200"/>The turbocharged 1.4-liter engine is Fiat’s, from the inventory of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the first time it’s been used in a rear-wheel-drive platform. It makes 160 horsepower (164 in the Abarth version) and 184 pound-feet of torque. It comes with a six-speed automatic, which falls short of the spirit of the car, or the same six-speed manual that the MX-5 uses, which is far more fun than the automatic: The manual brings crisp shifts and a sweet clutch.</p>, <p>A sporty Abarth model features a sports suspension and other performance enhancements.</p>, <p>Because the 124 Spider was new for 2017, there aren’t any significant changes for 2018. Options for the Fiat 124 Lusso and Abarth models are more flexible. There’s a new Red Top Edition, and there are three new colors: Puro Blanco Perla (pure white pearl), Grigio Chiaro (silver metallic) and Blu Scuro (dark blue metallic).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55273" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-124-classica.jpg" width="200"/>The Fiat 124 Spider convertible comes as Classica ($24,995), Lusso ($27,595); and high-performance Abarth ($28,295). Also the Lusso Red Top ($27,595).</p>, <p>Lusso gets handsome leather seats, but it only comes with the automatic. The Abarth adds Bilstein shock absorbers, limited-slip differential, a sport mode that alters the engine dynamics, and special trim.</p>, <p>There are MoPar chassis enhancements available, along with a tuned exhaust system and turbo bypass air valve.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55277" height="102" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-124-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The 124 Spider and MX-5 have the same 90.9-inch wheelbase, but the Fiat is 5.5 inches longer and a small bit wider. It only resembles the MX-5, it doesn’t really look like it. The Fiat has a longer hood with a retro rectangular grille and scooped headlamps, features that make it resemble the original 124. There are strong character lines on the side panels, a higher rear deck over a slightly bigger trunk, and contemporary alloy wheels.</p>, <p>The convertible top is by Mazda, easy to operate with one hand, and easily secured with a single windshield header latch; it’s perfectly simple. The fabric is heavier than that in the MX-5, to provide more sound insulation. There is no hard-top as there is with the MX-5, but the twin rollbar hoops are taken from the MX-5.</p>, <p>The Classica trim is black and body-colored; Lusso trim is silver; and Abarth is gunmetal, often with a black hood.</p>, <p>Only a few interior bits are shared with the MX-5; the Fiat’s soft-touch materials are better, and its cabins is more refined. There’s a Fiat instrument package, Fiat door panels, Fiat cloth upholstery in the Classica, and elegantly stitched Italian leather in the other two models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55275" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-124-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Naturally there’s the availability of navigation and connectivity, with readouts on the small screen rising from the dash, like the MX-5.</p>, <p>The interior is snug like the MX-5, especially the passenger side; the Spider’s extra length is all in the overhangs. Six-footers will be challenged.</p>, <p>With the top down, the cockpit is fairly free of turbulence; caps stay on, without having to be turned backwards. Conversation is possible, with raised voices, but still possible. With the top up, the interior is quiet at freeway speeds. Fiat put extra effort into noise suppression.</p>, <p>The turbocharged 1.4-liter engine uses a single overhead cam. Thanks to 22 pounds of turbo boost, it makes a strong-for-its-size 160 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque. But the MX-5 is quicker, because although its engine isn’t turbocharged, it is 2.0 liters. The Fiat will do zero to sixty in 6.8 seconds, while the MX-5 will do it in just 6.0 seconds. The Fiat’s weakness at the low end is felt more with the automatic transmission, which is otherwise responsive; using the shift paddles helps, but they’re not available on the base Classica.</p>, <p>The Fiat feels better out on the highway, where it brings a better mid-range passing response, especially with the manual gearbox.</p>, <p>The Spider brings some sports car traits than not all sports cars deliver: flat cornering, cat-like reflexes, eager responses, quick steering with sharp accuracy, extension of the driver’s will.</p>, <p>It’s about 100 pounds heavier than the MX-5, but the Fiat is still a very lightweight 2436 pounds, so it changes directions quickly, although not without body lean. But it’s still precise, and always predictable.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55274" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-124-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-124-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-124-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The ride in the Classica and Lusso is surprisingly supple, even soft, in not quite like a family sedan, but close.</p>, <p>The Abarth is in no way soft, and far less supple. In fact, some might say it’s stiff, as well as loud. Some also would say that’s what makes it so much fun. It’s quicker to turn in, and more responsive, taking full advantage of its Bilstein shocks and strut tower brace.</p>, <p>We got to drive an Abarth on an autocross course in a big parking lot, where its handling was impressive, but the super-aggressive laps didn’t offer much sense of what it would be like to drive around town every day.</p>, <p>We got more seat time in the Lusso, and it’s pleasant enough, but the 6-speed automatic leaves something to be desired. Shifting is smooth but leisurely, and the manual function, achieved by moving the shift lever fore and aft, doesn’t seem to quicken the shifts.</p>, <p>The 6-speed manual is far more satisfying, with crisp engagements and a sweet clutch.</p>, <p>The 1.4-liter engine’s 184 pound-feet of torque give it respectable thrust, thanks also to boost from the turbocharger. But it doesn’t rev as freely as the MX-5’s naturally aspirated 1.5-liter engine. We guess that it’ll do zero to sixty in about 6 seconds, same as the MX-5.</p>, <p>The Fiat 124 Spider brings Italian styling and it’s more comfortable than the Miata. Its a turbocharged engine is good and quick, but it’s not as satisfying as the higher-revving normally aspirated engine in the MX-5. Go for the crisp 6-speed manual with a user-friendly clutch, rather than the slow-shifting 6-speed automatic, which means a Classica, unless you want the hard-edged sportiness of an Abarth.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review from the Pacific Northwest, with Mitch McCullough reporting from the Northeast, and staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-7-series/
[<p>The 2018 BMW 7 Series comes with more semi-autonomous driving features than before. Otherwise, the BMW 7 Series carries over unchanged for the 2018 model year. 2016 brought an engineering leap, perfecting the balance at 50/50 and saving weight by using tricks from the i electric car: carbon fiber in the chassis, and aluminum in the doors, trunk lid and suspension.</p>, <p>The 7 Series cars are sporty and comfortable to drive. Some models are available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The BMW 740i uses a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 making 320 horsepower, a sweet engine. The BMW 750i packs a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 making 445 horsepower, mated to a silky 8-speed automatic transmission, pulling zero to sixty in 4.3 seconds.</p>, <p>There’s also a new 740e plug-in hybrid that mates a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with a 9.2-kilowatt hour battery to get a total of 322 horsepower. All-wheel-drive is standard. We’ve found the 740e to be very relaxed because the hybrid system is seamless. But it’s burdened by additional weight of about 400 pounds. BMW says it can travel 23 miles on all-electric power.</p>, <p>The Alpina B7 xDrive uses the 4.4-liter V8, and is fitted with Integral Active Steering that combines variable-ratio electric steering at the front axle with active steering on the rear axle. This helps to blast the Alpina from zero to sixty in a supercar-like 3.6 seconds.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55264" height="139" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li.jpg" width="200"/>With its V12 engine, the M760i xDrive is nearly as quick, with zero to sixty performance of 3.9 seconds. The twin-turbo V12 makes an awesome 600 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>On all models, Driving Dynamics Control sets the steering, throttle, shock absorbers and transmission, to three modes: Sport, Comfort and Comfort Plus. A complex system called Active Comfort Drive with Road Preview adds anticipatory functions to the active chassis with air suspension, while the Integral Active Steering (variable-ratio rear-wheel steering) now comes with all-wheel drive. The automatic transmission downshifts on its own, based on what the navigation system tells the transmission about the road ahead, for example a hill.</p>, <p>The 740i gets an EPA-rated 23 Combined miles per gallon with all-wheel drive, or 24 Combined mpg with rwd. The 750i gets 19 Combined mpg with awd, 20 mpg with rwd. The 740e gets 27 Combined miles per gallon, using all of its 23 miles of electric range.</p>, <p>The 7 Series hasn’t been crash-tested because it’s a low-volume product. Standard safety equipment is bountiful, from active headlamps to active headrests to rearview camera. Optional safety equipment includes everything from night vision to a watchdog sensor that flashes a coffee cup if it sees you getting tired.</p>, <p>Driver Assistance Plus Package II includes adaptive cruise control, active lane-keep assist, Side Collision Avoidance, and Traffic Jam Assistant. It provides semi-autonomous driving, following cars ahead and providing steering assistance to keep the car in its lane.</p>, <p>The 2018 7 Series includes the BMW 740i ($83,100), 740i xDrive ($86,100), 750i ($96,400), 750i xDrive ($99,400), Alpina 7 ($138,800), M760 xDrive ($156,700), and 740e ($90,700).</p>, <p>Options include the Rear Executive Lounge Seating Package with a sliding front passenger seat, footrest, rear entertainment with two 10-inch screens, a fold-out table, Touch Command Tablet enabling the passenger to control all his or her own creature comforts including web surfing. The Luxury Rear Seating Package includes heated and ventilated rear seats, massage, and a Vitality Program.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55267" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The 7 Series styling is classic again, after more than a decade of BMW pushing boundaries with wedges and swirls. There’s a formal profile, lots of glass, and clean sheetmetal. The nose is fairly blunt, with a proud kidney grille that actively manages airflow, behind the grille. The beltline from hood to taillamps is beautiful. Chiseled brightwork runs low along the sides, lifting the car.</p>, <p>Now it’s the cabin’s turn to push boundaries, by maximizing and exaggerating BMW design themes, taking ideas from the futuristic i8. The instrument panel is like a horizontal shelf, its formality enforced by satin-metallic brightwork on the knobs, many of which change temperatures for the comfort of your fingertips. It might be called retro-futurism. You’ll want to linger there.</p>, <p>The corners are pushed outward to make more space in the cabin, and the rear is limo-like, luxurious for two (who might be optionally ventilated and massaged), but room for three. Superb front seats hit the sweet spot between comfort during hours in the saddle, and support in the twisties.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55268" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The interior wood and diamond-stitched leather is the highest quality, as expected from BMW. Heated armrests, front and rear. Ambient carpet lighting standard. Fragrance is available, under a panoramic LED roof.</p>, <p>Although late to the theater, BMW does touchscreen now, to the max. The iDrive 5.0 uses a 12.3-inch landscape-oriented screen. Still, some people don’t like all those finger-smudges a touchscreen collects. So on the 7 Series there is also the familiar iDrive controller, now with a handwriting touchpad (also steering-wheel controls and voice recognition).</p>, <p>More futuristically, iDrive also now has Gesture Control. There’s a 3D sensor in the iDrive knob, and you just flash the sensor one of five hand signals, to get the sound system volume raised or lowered, answer or don’t answer the phone, or browse a 360-degree of the cabin. The system is a bit slow.</p>, <p>The Bowers &amp; Wilkins surround sound is certainly not dull, with 1400 watts and 16 speakers. Nor is the head-up display. The standard Adaptive Headlamps don’t just turn with the car, they consider speed, steering angle and yaw.</p>, <p>The 740i is our favorite. With 320 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque, the 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine isn’t the quickest but it’s the sweetest.</p>, <p>The 740e hybrid performs well enough, but it’s a four-cylinder. We’re not ready for a 2.0-liter four in a full-size BMW, even if it is enhanced with an electric motor. Besides; its 27 mpg vs the 740i’s 23 mpg isn’t enough of a difference for us, and that 27 mpg is only if you use up 23 miles in all-electric first.</p>, <p>As for the 4.4-liter V8, it’s strong, but it’s not the best V8 out there.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55266" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-760li-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The B7 Alpina and the M760 with its V12 engine are in another league, more expensive and less practical.</p>, <p>In Sport mode, the active anti-roll bars keep the 740i fairly flat in fast corners, and help this car feel unlike any 4600-pound sedan you’ve ever driven. The power is responsive, the light steering is made heftier and quicker (some might think too quick), and there’s road feel without rigidity, although sharp bumps get through the low-profile tires.</p>, <p>Due to its considerable mass, the 7 Series is not exactly nimble, but it changes directions easily. The electric power steering is light and direct; in Sport mode it can actually feel too quick for everyday driving.</p>, <p>With double-wishbone front and five-link rear suspension, all with active air dampers, any 7 Series can be set for firm or comfortable; the ride height changes with the settings. Sport mode makes the ride choppy, especially with the big wheels and low-profile run-flat tires. Comfort mode backs off on the aggression and smoothes out the ride, while Comfort Plus makes it buttery for rough streets or bumpy highways.</p>, <p>The chassis combines high-strength steel, aluminum, and carbon-reinforced plastic. Lighter suspension pieces reduce unsprung weight by 15 percent, a significant step in the chase of good handling. The latest bonding methods add thermal and acoustic insulation, reducing the amount of sound insulation needed thereby reducing weight.</p>, <p>The 8-speed automatic transmission is linked to navigation data, making the shift characteristics change with curves and terrain. The transmission itself excellent, though we’re not sure about navigation-based shifting. To save fuel, it coasts at speeds up to 100 miles per hour. To improve EPA ratings, an automatic Stop-Start feature turns off the engine when the car stops, then back on again when it’s time to move. BMW was the first with this system, but is not noted as being the smoothest.</p>, <p>The BMW 740i is an excellent choice for the class, powered by a sweet twin-turbo inline 6-cylinder engine. The 8-speed automatic is excellent. The 50/50 weight distribution makes the handling of a 7 Series feel special, for a full-size sedan with a comfortable ride. The cabin is very roomy, with elegant wood and leather. The lines are gorgeous.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-audi-a8/
[<p>Audi A8’s laurels are led by its aluminum space frame, stiff and light. It’s a very refined sedan, a strong and sometimes favored contender against whatever Mercedes-Benz or BMW want to throw at them. A relatively dated product, its stylish contour keeps it looking fresh, even though 2018 is the last year of this generation, and brings no changes.</p>, <p>An all-new A8 is coming for model year 2019.</p>, <p>The A8’s wheelbase is long, making a better ride and more room in the back. The high-performance Audi S8 uses a shorter wheelbase that used to be under the A8.</p>, <p>Base engine is a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 making 333 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque. It’s relatively thirsty, EPA-rated at 22 miles per gallon Combined.</p>, <p>If want to get less fuel mileage than that, the 18-mpg engine is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 making 450 horsepower and 444 pound-feet; that one brings a breathless zero-to-sixty time of 4.4 seconds. Both engines mate with an 8-speed automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. For extra chassis balance, there’s an available dynamic handling package with sport rear differential.</p>, <p>The Audi S8 slams 605 horsepower on you. It’s a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 that adds 517 pound-feet of torque. Needless to say it brings a rousing road experience, especially strapped into the deep Valcona leather bucket seats, as you accelerate from zero to sixty in 3.7 seconds that will most certainly be startling.</p>, <p>The S8 has LED lighting, 21-inch wheels, quad oval tailpipes, adaptive dampers and air springs. Its trunk is small for a full-size sedan, and rear leg space is limited by the short wheelbase. But it has 605 horsepower.</p>, <p>A8 L 3.0T ($82,500) has the supercharged V6 engine, Quattro all-wheel drive, leather upholstery, navigation, full-LED headlights, power front and rear seats, a sunroof, and power-closing trunk lid. Standard infotainment boasts satellite radio, Bluetooth phone and streaming, Bose speakers, and a USB port. Curiously, a rearview camera is optional, though parking sensors are standard.</p>, <p>A8 L 4.0T ($92,000) features the twin-turbo 450-horsepower, 4.0-liter V8.</p>, <p>S8 ($115,900) uses the shorter wheelbase and comes with a 605-horsepower V8. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Numerous safety features include front knee and rear-side passenger airbags. Audi’s Pre Sense system can tighten seatbelts before an impact occurs. Advanced safety technologies come in option groups, including adaptive cruise control with stop/go capability in traffic, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, and Night Vision.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55259" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-a8-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The A8 is stylish, nothing flashy, not even excessive. It’s sophisticated, restrained and low key. It’s way less sleek and dramatic than the Audi A7 sedan.</p>, <p>It’s well detailed. Front LED lighting highlights the expansive elegance of the hood and shoulders. What used to be the Sport package of exterior tweaks is now standard, making it officially in our book a sport sedan. Never mind that the gearshift lever is patterned after the throttle of a yacht.</p>, <p>The S8 is the ultimate sleeper, hiding its 605 horsepower under a hood and body that’s no different than the A8 sedan, except four inches shorter, although it looks longer because it’s lower. The subtle spoiler on the deck lid is the only cue.</p>, <p>If the A8 exterior is well detailed, the cabin is extremely well detailed, with the best materials, whether it’s leather, wood, aluminum, plastic, or splashes of chrome. It’s plush and comfortable. The standard front seats adjust 18 ways, upholstered in perforated leather, and comfortable; it feels like two cushions, soft on top of a firmer one. At startup, tweeters rise from the dashboard, to name one cool detail.</p>, <p>Two adults have plenty of room in the rear, comforted by individual climate control. An option includes a footrest for the right side and recline/massage for the left. The dual panel sunroof doesn’t steal head space. Trunk space is 13.2 cubic feet, slim for a full-size car. The S8, with its shorter wheelbase, has a smaller trunk.</p>, <p>Audi engineering keeps away almost all wind and road noise. The A8 is silent and serene.</p>, <p>The standard infotainment system is impressive, using Audi’s Multi-Media Interface, a knob on the console that spins and clicks, to scroll and select audio, phone, climate, and navigation.</p>, <p>There are a couple flaws to the infotainment system. Some controls are duplicated needlessly, and voice control has a mind and voice of its own. It doesn’t always respond properly to commands. Good luck if you can find one of those in life.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55258" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-a8-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-a8-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-a8-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>When you read the term lightweight aluminum chassis, it only means that aluminum weighs less than steel. It doesn’t mean that the car is light. The A8 might be your best example (among very few), it comes out pretty porky, at 4670 pounds fully equipped.</p>, <p>But the chassis and suspension engineers scored an ace, in making the A8 feel as light and nimble as a full-size car can feel. It’s a complex suspension, which the Quattro system understands, to make the A8 feel sure-footed in corners. The front-to-rear torque split varies from 40/60 front/rear, to 60/40 front/rear.</p>, <p>The supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine is very responsive and has fabulous torque down low. It’s not especially smooth, and can be noisy when the throttle is way down. Acceleration to 60 mph takes 5.5 seconds.</p>, <p>The gearshifts in the 8-speed automatic are smooth, quick, well-spaced, and well-programmed, which is to say they come at the right times, so no invasive surges. In manual mode, the paddleshifters can be used.</p>, <p>The 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8, with 450 horsepower, is basically the same engine as in the S8, with 605 horsepower. The difference is all in plumbing, breathing, and electronics. One thing that means is that the structure of the 4.0-liter engine is strong, strong enough to handle 30 percent more power without breaking.</p>, <p>Drive Select can control the response of the engine, transmission, steering, and suspension. Comfort, Auto, or Dynamic mode can move the car from sedate to dramatic. In Comfort or Auto mode, the transmission tends to shift quite early, and it downshifts a lot.</p>, <p>There’s also an Individual mode, so an owner can find the overall setting for how he or she likes the car to feel. There’s a lot of tweaking and awareness, to find that place. It’s not unlike adjusting an 18-way power seat, it takes some experimenting and moving around.</p>, <p>The S8 isn’t a hotrod, not even with 605 horsepower and 517 pound-feet of torque. It’s too smooth to be a hotrod. t. It’s an executive uber-car. The ultimate full-size luxury car, with the ultimate motor. It’s breathtaking in its power, and execution. With an 8-speed automatic, Quattro, adaptive dampers and air suspension, it’s got it all.</p>, <p>We like the excitement of the base engine, the supercharged 3.0-liter V6. Any A8 is well detailed, quiet, comfortable, and roomy–near the top of each category, compared to rivals the full-size luxury segment. The Quattro and 8-speed automatic flawlessly add to the dynamics. The S8 is a Master of the Universe kind of car.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>Handsome and capable, the Jeep Grand Cherokee can easily pull off luxury for the family, with refined handling and ride. It’s also a wilderness trekker for adventuresome people and a tow vehicle for summers with the boat or horses. It can also be a hotrod SUV.</p>, <p>Multiple powertrains, some of them incredibly powerful, are available, along with a choice of all-wheel-drive systems to manage conditions ranging from ice and snow to boulder fields.</p>, <p>2018 is the eighth model year of Grand Cherokee’s fourth generation, so it’s undeniably old by car years. A new 2018 Grand Cherokee Sterling Edition celebrates 25 years of the Grand Cherokee.</p>, <p>And it had to happen, the car world would be remiss if it didn’t: an SUV with the power of the ultimate muscle car. The muscle car would be the 707-horsepower Dodge Hellcat with its 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine, and now we have the identically powered 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. Naturally its drive components are bulked up, including the transmission, suspension, brakes, cooling system, and all-wheel-drive system, The Hellcat can go 180. It’s sleek compared to the Jeep, but Chrysler says the Trackhawk can go that fast too. What’s even more impressive is how an SUV with that much power can be so tractable, docile and comfortable around the neighborhood. Most passengers in the Trackhawk will never guess it has that much power unless they are told or it’s demonstrated to them by punching the throttle.</p>, <p>Back in the mainstream, the base Grand Cherokee engine is a 3.6-liter V6 making 295 horsepower and 290 pound-feet of torque. It’s strong at the low end, and responsive in the mid-range. It’s EPA-rated at 19/26 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops it by 1 mpg.</p>, <p>The 5.7-liter V8 makes 360 horsepower, while its 390 pound-feet of torque carries it to a first in class in towing, with a capability of 7200 pounds. But even the V6 can tow 6200 pounds. Equipped with cylinder deactivation, the V8 is EPA-rated at 14/22 mpg City/Highway, or 17 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>If it’s towing and fuel mileage you care about, there’s a turbodiesel 3.0-liter V6 making 240 horsepower and 420 pound-feet. It tows 7400 pounds, and is EPA-rated at 22/30 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined with rear-wheel drive. With its big tank, the diesel has a range of 730 miles of highway travel.</p>, <p>An optional air suspension can boost the highway mileage, by lowering the vehicle closer to the ground. Or it can raise it from 6.4 inches to 11.3 inches above the ground, for offroad around rocks.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55252" height="108" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-srt.jpg" width="200"/>The Grand Cherokee SRT, with its 6.4-liter V8 making 475 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque, can accelerate from zero to sixty in just 4.8 seconds, if equipped with launch control. Grand Cherokee SRT has all-wheel drive and that helps traction off the line too. With all the on-track tuning the suspension has received from engineers, it’s just about the best handling SUV anywhere. It’s a gas guzzler, at 15 Combined EPA miles per gallon.</p>, <p>Each engine is mated to a responsive 8-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard Laredo, Limited, Overland, and Summit. Three separate four-wheel-drive systems are available, with the transmission having a low crawl ratio. The Selec-Terrain system automatically alters powertrain settings to suit the terrain: Sand, Mud, Snow, Rock, or Automatic.</p>, <p>Smaller changes for 2018 include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto added to the Uconnect infotainment system with the 8.4-inch touchscreen; a 7.0-inch screen on base models replacing a 5.0-inch screen; and active noise cancellation that comes along with the available Alpine audio system.</p>, <p>A rearview camera and trailer sway control come standard. Blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and frontal-crash warning are optional.</p>, <p>The Grand Cherokee earns five stars overall in crash testing by NHTSA, with four-wheel drive. If it’s rear-wheel drive, it’s only four stars. The difference appears to be in rollover resistance, with all-wheel drive earning four stars, and rear-wheel drive a mere three. The IIHS gives it the best Good scores, except for Marginal in the challenging small-overlap frontal collision.</p>, <p>2018 Grand Cherokee models are Laredo ($30,595), Altitude ($36,690), High Altitude, Limited ($38,195), Overland ($44,995), Summit ($50,995), SRT ($67,395), Trailhawk ($43,295), and Trackhawk ($85,900). Plus that anniversary Sterling Edition. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Laredo comes with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive ($32,895), new fabric upholstery and 17-inch aluminum wheels, air conditioning, keyless entry, a CD player, satellite radio, rearview camera, and parking sensors. An off-road option package includes skid plates and Selec-Terrain.</p>, <p>Grand Cherokee Limited gets 18-inch wheels, leather seating with a power front passenger seat, heated front seats, a power tailgate, and remote start. Options include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, navigation, and off-road assistance systems.</p>, <p>The turbodiesel V6 and Hemi V8 engines are available for Limited models and above.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55253" height="154" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-trailhawk.jpg" width="200"/>The Trailhawk comes with Quadra-Drive II four-wheel drive, 18-inch off-road tires, red tow hooks, an electronic limited-slip differential, air suspension, Selec-Speed Control, skid plates, and a black leather interior. Trailhawk has front and rear tow hooks, skid plates, 18-inch off-road tires, and an air suspension.</p>, <p>Overland upgrades with Nappa leather seating with ventilated front seats, a panoramic sunroof, leather-trimmed dashboard, 20-inch wheels, and navigation. Two-wheel drive is standard. All-wheel drive ($47,995) includes an air suspension.</p>, <p>Summit ($50,995) features its own wheel and wood choices, a suede headliner, 19-speaker, 825-watt Harman Kardon surround-sound audio, parking assist and a trailer-hitch camera view.</p>, <p>SRT gets leather/suede seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, metallic pedal pads, active noise cancellation, and a leather-trimmed/heated steering wheel. Performance Pages display timers and performance data. Options include a dual-pane sunroof, Luxury package, and SRT Night package.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55251" height="109" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Grand Cherokee carefully blends traditional with contemporary design, in a shape that is classic SUV. Its looks convey pedigree. It’s very handsome, with an expressive but understated grille that doesn’t carry an excess of chrome. It’s more sophisticated than its luxury competitors, especially the large ones.</p>, <p>The rear end is distinctive and assertive, with LED taillamps and strong details.</p>, <p>All Grand Cherokees boast an intelligently designed cabin layout. The upper models are richly equipped, with materials and textures that match luxury rivals, such as real wood trim on the dashboards and doors. A console bin holds illuminated audio ports. Uconnect infotainment systems with simple interfaces rank among the best</p>, <p>Front occupants get wide cushions with satisfying bolstering, except for the base Laredo, which has short, flat seat bottoms.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55250" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Grand Cherokee has a roomy interior that holds five grown-ups, with good legroom all around. Six-footers have ample headroom. Big doors open 78 degrees make climbing in and out easy.</p>, <p>Cargo volume with the rear seats up is 36.3 cubic feet. The seatbacks recline 12 degrees, and the flip down with a lever for more cargo space.</p>, <p>Forward visibility is past a hood and over fenders whose slope makes it easier to see the car’s corners. Only the big square sideview mirrors transmit any noise into the cabin, from the wind.</p>, <p>The Grand Cherokee excels in ride, handling, steering, and off-road prowess. Its smooth road manners make it feel like a crossover that has quick responses and a controlled ride.</p>, <p>With five engines and three four-wheel-drive systems, you can build or choose the Grand Cherokee that works for you. For high performance, both the SRT and Trackhawk offer great grip, impressive handling, and a ride that’s softer than the comparable Dodge SRT and Hellcat Chargers and Challengers. The SRT and Trackhawk hold their own against the best from Porsche, BMW M, and Mercedes-AMG, and they do it for a lot less money.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55249" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-grandcherokee-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The V6 engine has strong low-rpm torque to deal with demanding situations, especially off-road conditions. It can tow up to 6200 pounds.</p>, <p>The 5.7-liter Hemi V8 makes the SUV feel almost like the brawny Dodge Charger sedan, including its rousing engine note. But because the V6 is so powerful, we don’t think the V8 is necessary, or worth the penalty in fuel mileage, at 17 Combined mpg for the V8 versus 21 mpg with the V6.</p>, <p>The 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6 lacks the punch of the V8, and doesn’t have as much passing power as the gasoline V6, but it has awesome torque for towing and gets 25 mpg. It’s a bit loud while idling and at low speed.</p>, <p>The SRT uses a 6.4-liter V8 making 475 horsepower, and its fantastic handling puts it in the rarified air of the best European SUVs like the Porsche Cayenne. It brakes to a stop from 60 mph in just 116 feet, which is impressive for any vehicle, let alone a 5104-pound SUV.</p>, <p>The new Trackhawk can accelerate from zero to sixty in 3.5 seconds, and does the quarter-mile in 11.6 seconds, stunning times for an SUV. Yet when motoring around neighborhood streets, it’s as docile as any other sport-utility, with little indication of its incredible performance.</p>, <p>Three all-wheel-drive systems are available. Basic Quadra-Trac I has a locking differential and 50/50 front/rear power split, but no low range. It will do the job in snow and mud, but don’t expect it to climb sand dunes.</p>, <p>Quadra-Trac II has the two-speed transfer case that Quadra-Trac I lacks, with an electronic limited-slip rear differential for more traction at the rear wheels. It also comes with hill-start assist and hill-descent control. It can split torque variably from front to rear when slip is detected at either axle, so 100 percent of the power can go to one axle if that’s where all the traction is.</p>, <p>Quadra-Drive II is for the most severe off-roading.</p>, <p>Jeep also adds its Selec-Terrain system to both the Quadra-Trac II and Quadra-Drive II systems. It offers Auto, Sand, Mud, Snow, and Rock modes that optimize the electronics of various vehicle systems to provide the best grip over each terrain. Any Grand Cherokee with the Selec-Terrain system and an off-road package gets Jeep’s Trail Rated badge.</p>, <p>We’ve scrambled up a 200-foot climb with a 55-degree incline, using the Selec-Terrain system that controls the speed in increments of one kilometer per hour. The smart electronic controls make for brainless throttle control during off-roading. Although you still have to steer.</p>, <p>The beautiful Grand Cherokee offers more than its share of good things, with virtually nothing bad. It’s hard to go wrong with the powertrains, from the base V6 to Hemi V8 to turbodiesel to even the ridiculous 707 supercharged horsepower. Great 8-speed automatic transmission, impressive brakes, and realistic room for five.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-acura-mdx/
[<p>Acura MDX is a roomy, midsize near-luxury crossover, enjoyable to drive, with sharp handling. MDX offers three rows to seat up to seven. It comes with a strong V6 or an even quicker hybrid powertrain. Opting for Super Handling All Wheel Drive improves stability and handling in dry and slippery conditions.</p>, <p>For 2018, Acura MDX gets a new 7-inch capacitive touchscreen with a faster response time and simpler menus and commands on the dual-screen interface. There are also two new colors for 2018: Basque Red and San Marino Red. The current, third generation model was introduced for the 2014 model year. It was revised for 2017 with fresh styling, better ride and handling, and more safety features.</p>, <p>The standard engine is a strong and smooth 3.5-liter V6 with direct injection making 290 horsepower and comes with a paddle-shifting nine-speed automatic transmission. MDX comes standard with front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Super Handling All Wheel Drive transfers power front-to-back and side-to-side as needed, sending more power to the outside wheels in a curve, called torque vectoring. SH-AWD has been in Acura vehicles for more than a decade, and is still one of the few mechanical torque vectoring systems on the market. It works very well, stabilizing the car while making best use of available grip.</p>, <p>The MDX Sport Hybrid model uses a 3.0-liter V6 and seven-speed dual-clutch transmission mated to a three-motor system with one motor at the transmission and two for the rear wheels; the hybrid system was largely borrowed from the Acura NSX supercar and RLX sedan. It makes a total of 321 horsepower, and rates 25 miles per gallon EPA Combined. The Sport Hybrid includes SH-AWD, although the system is mechanically different from that in the non hybrid.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55241" height="142" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-mdx-models.jpg" width="200"/>The standard 3.5-liter engine is EPA-rated at 21 mpg Combined, with SH-AWD, on Premium fuel. With the optional Stop/Start feature, which comes in a package, it gets 1 mpg more, though that feature can be annoying. It also uses two-stage Variable Cylinder Management that stops the fuel to three cylinders when the car is cruising. Despite all this technology, it still only gets 21 mpg Combined with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>MDX is rated to tow up to 3500 pounds.</p>, <p>The MDX earns Top Safety Pick Plus from IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety), as well as five stars overall from NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), including five stars in front and side crash test, four stars in rollover.</p>, <p>Safety equipment includes the AcuraWatch suite with forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, road departure mitigation, and an adaptive cruise-control system with low-speed follow. A multi-view rear camera is also standard, while blind-spot monitors, surround-view cameras, and front and rear parking sensors are optional.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55243" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-mdx-2.jpg" width="200"/>Acura MDX ($44,200) is equipped with leather, eight-speaker audio system with satellite radio, tri-zone automatic climate control, four fast-charging USB ports, 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat, automatic headlamps, multi-view rearview camera, heated front seats, folding second-row seats, power tilt/telescope steering, steering-wheel audio and phone controls, and 12-volt power outlets in the center console and front armrest. Front-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>SH-AWD is extra ($2000).</p>, <p>The Technology Package ($4,400) adds navigation, blind-spot monitors, front and rear parking sensors, remote start and 19-inch alloy wheels. The Advance Package ($6,050) adds Stop/Start, roof rails, and Milano premium perforated leather upholstery with ventilated front seats. The Entertainment Package ($2,000) adds a DVD player, a 150-watt AC inverter, heated second-row seats, and second-row window shades. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>The Sport Hybrid adds $2,000 to an MDX SH-AWD.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55239" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-mdx-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The diamond pentagon grille comes from the Precision concept car that got a positive reaction at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show. The facelift for 2017 included sculpted front fenders, a new hood, and jewel-like headlamps, with available LED foglamps.</p>, <p>We find the chrome rocker panels and body trim tarnish the styling.</p>, <p>The profile seems less upright than some SUV rivals, with its chiseled front end, tapered roofline, and the smooth rear end. Ironically, while the smaller Acura RDX crossover looks larger than it is, the Acura MDX looks smaller than it is.</p>, <p>The sloping and tiered dashboard sort of mimics the grille, as it leads into a V-shaped centerstack that doesn’t try to be opulent, but again the chrome trim gets in the way of things, sometimes reflecting into the driver’s eyes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55240" height="194" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-mdx-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The center console offers a whole lot of function, with a deep bin, tray for cellphone, another larger tray with sliding woodgrain top, traction strips so things don’t slide around, conveniently located cupholders, and another small bin for keys, with power outlet.</p>, <p>The front seats are plush and supportive, with low side bolsters that make sliding in and out easy. The driver’s seat slides back automatically when the door is opened.</p>, <p>The MDX is roomy for its class. The second row slides six inches fore and aft, giving either second- or third-row passengers more legroom (but not both). It’s split 60/40 and folds almost flat, although there are a lot of gaps and holes, not good for dogs. A small illuminated button at each side of the second row moves the seat to enable reaching the third row.</p>, <p>The optional captain’s chairs are the best way to reach the third row. Without them, getting back there is for kids. And once back there, the high floor level puts your knees at your chin, if you’re an adult or tall kid.</p>, <p>The third row folds perfectly flat by pulling a lever; the headrests flip forward, and can stay with the seats rather than having to be removed, a good safety feature because they won’t be missing when needed.</p>, <p>With both seats folded, the cargo space reveals an underfloor storage area with room for a laptop, camera bag, or more shoes. It has a lid that can be moved out of the way.</p>, <p>The cabin is very quiet and vibration-free, thanks to an active noise-cancellation system, an active engine mount system, acoustic glass in the windshield and windows, and heaps of insulation elsewhere.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55244" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-mdx-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-mdx-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-mdx-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The direct-injection V6 with Honda’s i-VTEC variable valvetrain is single overhead cam with four valves per cylinder rated 290 horsepower at 6200 rpm and 267 pound-feet of torque at 4500 rpm. It’s a smooth, refined engine, with acceleration whenever you need it, and it stays smooth to redline 6700 rpm.</p>, <p>The nine-speed automatic transmission is smooth most of the time, but sometimes it seems to get confused by so many choices, and hesitates. That’s in Drive mode, when the transmission does all the shifting automatically. But there’s a selector on the center console that switches the shift mapping between Drive and Sport. In Sport mode, and using the paddles to shift, you get quick upshifts or throttle-blip downshifts. The Sport mode works like a true manual mode because the transmission will actually let you hold onto gears all the way to redline, or all the way down to where you’re starting to lug the engine.</p>, <p>However the push-button shifter on the console is brilliant; it frees up space on the console, and is easy to use with its distinct buttons. One nice feature is that the transmission automatically shifts into Park when you turn off the engine.</p>, <p>The MDX also uses what Acura calls IDS, for Integrated Dynamics System, with Comfort, Normal, Sport and Sport Plus modes. The Sport mode quickens steering response, while the Comfort setting brings a lighter steering feel. The steering doesn’t send a lot of feedback to the driver, but the MDX feels capable and coordinated when driven near the limit. Actually, its handling is admirable for a vehicle this size; it’s as close to nimble and responsive as you can get in a seven-seat vehicle. It’s a very easy car to drive.</p>, <p>Special shock absorbers smooth the ride over rough pavement, even with the 20-inch wheels on the Technology and Advance packages. There’s just a bit of body lean in the corners.</p>, <p>The Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system not only provides excellent all-weather traction, it makes a difference on dry roads. The system can vary front-wheel torque distribution from 90 percent down to 30 percent (that’s 70 percent to the rear), or up to 100 percent to either the left or right wheels. That greatly improves stability when driving in winter, especially when patches of snow and ice are mixed with patches of wet pavement, or when the left wheels are on ice and the right wheels are on dry pavement.</p>, <p>The Acura MDX brings great handling, a smooth ride, and a fine engine. It isn’t the cheapest SUV, it’s not great on fuel mileage, and it needs premium gas. Nine-speed automatic sometimes hesitates. With optional captain’s chairs, it seats six.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Jeep Renegade is the smallest crossover you can buy. Less than 167 inches in overall length (13.9 feet), it’s shorter than a Range Rover Evoque or a Subaru Crosstrek. Being so efficiently small, it fills a need, easy to park, relatively rugged, and having fantastic off-road traction with its two-speed transfer case providing low-range gearing.</p>, <p>The Renegade is built by Fiat Chrysler in Italy, on the Fiat 500x chassis, the first Jeep product built completely outside North America. It’s very popular in countries where gas costs much more than here (mostly due to taxes).</p>, <p>Renegade was introduced as a 2015 model. For 2018, the interiors have been revised with new seat colors and fabrics and fresh bezel treatments. A new Selec-Terrain shifter dial allowed the creation of more storage space.  2018 Jeep Renegade models are available with the latest Uconnect system with larger displays and more features, including navigation, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are available. 2018 Renegade models come standard with a rearview camera, and sunroof options have been expanded.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55224" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-renegade-latitude.jpg" width="200"/>Renegade is smaller than the all-new Jeep Compass, the next size up in Jeep’s crossover lineup. The Wrangler is shorter than the Renegade, but it’s a highly focused offroad vehicle, not a crossover.</p>, <p>There are no precise competitors for the Renegade. There are all-wheel-drive crossovers that might be considered, but they’re oranges to the apple. For example there is the Nissan Juke, the Honda HR-V, the new Toyota C-HR, Hyundai Kona, or even the Range Rover Evoque, which matches the Renegade’s traction, but it’s in another class altogether.</p>, <p>Renegade comes with two powertrains, with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The base engine is a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder making 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission.</p>, <p>The more powerful option is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder making 180 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 9-speed automatic. It comes standard on the Trailhawk and Desert Hawk models.</p>, <p>The 1.4-liter turbo gets an EPA-rated 27 miles per gallon Combined, while the 2.4-liter rates 25 mpg Combined city and highway.</p>, <p>The federal NHTSA gives the Renegade four stars for crash worthiness, while the insurance industry’s IIHS gives it top scores in all but the small-overlap front crash test on which few vehicles earn a Good rating. Optional active-safety features include forward-collision warnings and automatic braking, lane-departure warning, and blind-spot monitors.</p>, <p>The 2018 Renegade comes in Sport ($17,995), Latitude ($21,495), Altitude ($22,190), Limited ($27,195), Trailhawk ($26,895), and Deserthawk ($28,390). (Prices are MSRP for 2017 models and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55227" height="139" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-renegade-walk.jpg" width="200"/>The Renegade is short in length, but relatively tall, exaggerated by sides that are flat and vertical. It has a spunky kind of distinction, or a distinctive kind of spunk. Details flaunt the fact that it’s a Jeep, from the seven-bar grille to the big round headlights. The black fender flares are oversized, making the tiny Renegade look tough. The taillamps have an X shape in them, intended to suggest jerry cans strapped to the rear, as a reminder of Jeep’s WWII heritage.</p>, <p>Imagine a bulked-up subcompact, and you might see the Renegade interior, with its big round knobs and center vents in a pod on the dash.</p>, <p>The front seats are comfortable and well bolstered, with good shoulder room. But in the rear, the subcompact size comes back with seriously limited legroom. For there to be reasonable comfort for back-seat passengers, the front seats have to be slid forward.</p>, <p>The rear seats fold flat, and so does the front passenger seat, creating a ton of cargo space for the Renegade’s size.</p>, <p>In short, Renegade is better for two plus their cargo than it is for four adults.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55223" height="300" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-renegade-driving.jpg" width="200"/>On paved roads, the Renegade feels adequately refined. We like the combination of the 1.4-liter turbo engine with front-wheel drive in the city, even with its manual gearbox. It’s lighter and more direct than the 2.4-liter.</p>, <p>The Trailhawk feels ponderous around town where handling is tight, because of its additional weight.</p>, <p>Off road, the Renegade is no Wrangler, but with its modes for Mud, Sand and Snow, it’s quite remarkable. We drove it up steep and rutty hills, nearly 45 degrees, and back down again using the hill descent control to control the speed, and grip at each wheel. The little Jeep will cross streams and climb boulders almost as tall as its wheels. No worries about getting it muddy, or getting to the other side of the bog.</p>, <p>The Trailhawk has one inch more ground clearance and bumpers that allow steeper approach and descent angles. There’s also a Rock mode, which enables the Trailhawk to crawl along at less-than-walking speed, a great feature.</p>, <p>The Jeep Renegade is a solid small utility vehicle, with a suspension and two-speed transfer case that add capability over rugged terrain. Excellent powertrains, especially the fuel-efficient 1.4-liter turbo, make the Renegade compelling. The manual transmission keeps the Jeep real. Comfortable front seats. Big cargo room for the tiny size, thanks to rear and front passenger seats that fold flat.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-kia-soul/
[<p>The Kia Soul is a compact hatchback with good handling and an efficient cabin layout, and boxy styling. Last redesigned for 2014, Soul got a new turbocharged engine for 2017. For 2018, Kia Soul has no significant changes.</p>, <p>There are three engines for three models. The base model gets a 1.6-liter four-cylinder making 130 horsepower, mated to a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic. It’s slow and the automatic transmission searches too much for the correct gear.</p>, <p>The Plus model (which Kia calls +) gets a 2.0-liter four that makes 161 horsepower, mated to a six-speed automatic. It’s quicker, but the transmission does the same thing.</p>, <p>The Exclaim (!), gets a 1.6-liter turbocharged four making 201 horsepower, that’s also used by the Hyundai Elantra Sport. It’s mated to a smooth seven-speed dual-clutch automatic manual transmission. It responds with spirit when you accelerate with spirit, however at low speeds there’s turbo lag.</p>, <p>Fuel mileage is good for the Soul but not at the top of its class, as it’s not a wedge or jelly bean; its boxy shape is less aerodynamic. The slow 1.6-liter engine with sluggish six-speed automatic gets 27 Combined EPA-rated miles per gallon, while the quicker 2.0-liter gets the same 27 mpg. The quickest engine, the 1.6-liter turbo in the Exclaim model, gets 28 mpg. There’s also a Soul EV electric vehicle.</p>, <p>Soul aces crash testing, impressive for a compact. It gets five stars overall from the NHTSA, and the top Good scores from the IIHS. Six airbags are standard, and a rearview camera is standard on the Exclaim and Plus. There’s an available safety suite including blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, and forward collision warning. The warranty is noteworthy. Five years or 60,000 miles, with powertrain for 10 years or 100,000 miles.</p>, <p>Kia Soul ($16,100) comes with cloth seats, air conditioning, Bluetooth, satellite radio, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. Manual transmission is standard, automatic is available ($17,700). No rearview camera, cruise control, or front center armrest. Soul+ ($20,300) gets upgraded cloth upholstery, a 5.0-inch touchscreen, rearview camera, 17-inch wheels, and body-colored bumpers and trim.</p>, <p>Soul! ($22,800) comes with the turbo engine, 18-inch wheels and sporty exterior bits. Inside, there are leather seats and piano black trim, a 4.3-inch LED instrument cluster, and keyless ignition.</p>, <p>The rearview camera is only available in a package ($2000). (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55214" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-soul-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Soul is as physically perky (if you see it that way) as it’s always been, but that seems like a long time now, so it’s not so fresh any more. It’s still fun to look at. It puts a splash of spirit into the sameness of the highway. Crossovers that all look the same, blah blah boring. The Soul steps out of that.</p>, <p>The proportions are right, as the sharp angles on the chunky sheetmetal work with the roofline. The windshield pillars are abrupt while leaning back a bit, keeping the profile from being too square, although it’s still square.</p>, <p>The Soul needs the body-colored trim in the Plus and Exclaim models, to smooth the lines and enhance the shape. There is a shape, and it’s distinctive.</p>, <p>For a compact hatchback, the Soul becomes a compact cargo van. There’s 24.2 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, and with them folded there’s a vast 61.3 cubic feet. The Soul might not be svelte, but the shape scores at swallowing bicycles.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55215" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-soul-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-soul-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-soul-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>And there is an amazing 39 inches of rear seat legroom, more than many midsize crossovers. The Plus and Exclaim have a folding center armrest in the rear, so we’re talking four adults in comfort.</p>, <p>There’s a black sea of plastic in the dash, with chrome and glossy trim. What a missed opportunity to make Soul special. There are some soft materials and upscale touches, such as the steering wheel and gauges that the driver looks down on, because the instrument panel is low.</p>, <p>The centerstack with its controls is canted toward the driver. Speakers sit on top of vents at the edges of the dash. They can be made to throb to the music, in fluorescent blood red.</p>, <p>The seats are firm and supportive, but a tall driver might find himself oe herself sitting too high, with his or her thighs running out of support.</p>, <p>It’s safe to say that Kia didn’t go whole hog on the sound deadening. The turbocharged engine noise breaks into the cabin and howls at 4000 rpm, in the Soul! model. The two slower engines are louder.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55216" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-soul-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-soul-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-soul-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 1.6-liter engine is slow, with a minimal 130 horsepower and 118 pound-feet of torque. But if you don’t commute on the freeway, it keeps up. For an entry-level new car, considering the cargo capacity and cool factor, the base model with the six-speed manual is a good car for the money.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter only comes with the six-speed automatic transmission whose downshifts are responsive and quick, although at freeway speeds, it shifts between fifth and sixth gears too much. It can be locked in manual so it only upshifts at redline, but that probably won’t keep it from downshifting from sixth to fifth.</p>, <p>The turbo engine, built by Hyundai, makes 201 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque, enough so there’s torque steer if you stand on it. With this engine, the Soul is a quick car on a winding backroad.</p>, <p>Not so quick around town, though. Driving slowly, it feels lethargic and unwilling, with a sluggish throttle response and non-linear acceleration; the transition from gliding to accelerating is slow, and it responds to more throttle with too much throttle.</p>, <p>The suspension is right, because the Soul doesn’t feel like a tall box in the corners, and the ride isn’t too busy on its short wheelbase. Twin-path dampers deliver good control, confidence in corners, and isolation from small bumps.</p>, <p>The Soul is no Volkswagen Golf or Mini Cooper, but it’s handling is responsive on a quick winding road, while also accelerating and braking. A Sport mode tightens the steering, making the Soul sporty and fun.</p>, <p>The transmission can be so slow to transition between Drive and Reverse. It gets old fast, especially when you’re in a hurry.</p>, <p>Four-wheel disc brakes are standard, with brake assist and hill-start assist, even on the base model. They work well, easy to modulate for smooth, controlled braking.</p>, <p>The Soul lives up to its name; it does have soul, as well as compelling virtues. The base model, especially with the 6-speed manual transmission mated to its 1.6-liter engine, is a good value, although maybe not so much if you have to pay $2000 for a rearview camera (in a package). The 2.0-liter turbo Soul! with the seven-speed dual clutch transmission ! turns the Soul into a pocket rocket.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-colorado/
[<p>The Chevrolet Colorado is the best of the midsize pickups, with virtues that surpass most of what is offered by the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier, and even the individualistic Honda Ridgeline.</p>, <p>We’ve found the Colorado beats the top-selling Tacoma in ride, handling, packaging, fit and finish, interior space and materials, connectivity, driving position, and bed features.</p>, <p>And now we think the Tacoma TRD Off-Road, perennial ruler of rugged terrain among midsize pickups, may have finally met its challenge in the form of the new Colorado ZR2, introduced late in the 2017 model year.</p>, <p>Colorado ZR2 is a hard-core off-road truck with its own bodywork designed to improve approach and departure angles. It rides on a big wide track, lifted suspension, and hefty 31-inch Goodyear all-terrain tires. It has a mean and adventuresome look, ready for the Baja, with locking differentials, front and rear. There’s a choice between a superb diesel or a wonderful V6. The Colorado ZR2 feels highly capable to us, and it’s way more comfortable than the Tacoma TRD. It’s just the thing for traversing a boulder field.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55208" height="138" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-colorado-z71.jpg" width="200"/>For most, the Colorado Z71 delivers more than enough four-wheel-drive capability, plenty for primitive roads and two-tracks.</p>, <p>The current, second-generation Colorado was introduced in the U.S. as a 2015 model, notable for its comfort. For 2017, Colorado got a new 3.6-liter V6 with direct fuel injection, making a strong 308 horsepower and 275 pound-feet of torque, with a new 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The standard Colorado engine is an eminently usable 2.5-liter four cylinder making 200 horsepower with a sharp 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission. It’s winning powertrain either way.</p>, <p>Also available is a 2.8-liter turbodiesel four-cylinder that makes 369 pound-feet of torque, with 181 horsepower at the top end. It’s the best choice for towing, rated to pull up to 7700 pounds, though we’d opt for a Silverado long before approaching that kind of weight. The diesel also works well for rugged terrain. The diesel is rated by the EPA at 30 miles per gallon Highway with two-wheel drive. We found it smooth, very refined, and powerful, emitting a wonderful sound.</p>, <p>A 100th Anniversary Edition package is available for the 2018 Colorado, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first Chevrolet truck.</p>, <p>The Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon are mostly identical mechanically.</p>, <p>Colorado rides on a boxed frame with coil spring suspension in front, leaf springs at the rear. The electric power steering is weighted well. Its ride and handling is far better than the Nissan Frontier, as well as the Tacoma. Four-wheel disc brakes with long-life rotors are standard.</p>, <p>Buyers can choose among cab and bed configurations, including the standard extended cab with two small rear doors, a very small bench seat, and six-foot bed; or the four-door crew cab with either a five- or six-foot bed (or no bed at all, for commercial sales). There’s no regular cab any more.</p>, <p>A crew cab Colorado works well as a second family car.</p>, <p>Four-wheel drive is available. On Colorado LT and Z71 models four-wheel drive can be activated manually. Autotrac activates the front wheels electronically, like all-wheel drive, for better grip and control on the road. Four-wheel-drive drops fuel economy by about two miles per gallon compared with rear-wheel drive. On the base model, the part-time four-wheel-drive system is simpler, intended more for mud, sand or snow.</p>, <p>The Z71 should suit most off-road needs, with a slightly raised suspension, unique dampers, and limited-slip rear differential. The ZR2 should be able to manage most any navigable situation encountered.</p>, <p>Fuel economy for the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and automatic transmission is an EPA-rated 20/26 mpg City/Highway, or 22 mpg Combined. The turbodiesel is rated 22/30 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. Colorado 4WD 3.6-liter V6 is rated 17/24 mpg City/Highway, 19 mpg Combined on Regular gasoline. It runs on four cylinders when six aren’t needed to maintain the speed.</p>, <p>Colorado gets four stars overall from the NHTSA in crash testing, with five stars for side impact. Colorado earned the top Good rating for the demanding small overlap front test from the IIHS, a score that few vehicles achieve, let alone pickup trucks.</p>, <p>The Colorado doesn’t go in for luxury features. That’s covered by the GMC Canyon Denali.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Colorado comes in base, WT, LT, Z71 and ZR2 models in many configurations. We counted 23, spanning a wide price range.</p>, <p>Standard equipment on all models except the base includes six airbags, stability control, trailer sway control, hill start assist, rearview camera, easy-lowering tailgate, touchscreen audio, and USB port. The Z71 gets hill descent control. Options include forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, Bluetooth, navigation, OnStar, 4G LTE data connectivity, and a larger touchscreen with Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55209" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-colorado-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Chevy Colorado doesn’t have the relentlessly rectilinear lines of the full-size Chevy Silverado, nor the fat grille of the GMC Canyon, overkilled by chrome. The Colorado’s rising shoulder line softens the pickup silhouette with boxy fenders. The grille is slim and relatively small. The Colorado looks like a truck, a good-looking truck. It does not look like a Honda Ridgeline.</p>, <p>The ZR2’s front bumper is trimmed for clearance over rocks, and its wheels are pushed out. It looks planted, despite the lifted suspension. The hood bulges. The ZR2 is clean, avoiding the aftermarket look. It classes up any off-road gathering.</p>, <p>In the cabin, the Colorado is like the Silverado, rugged and upscale, with a fit and finish that’s better than that of the Toyota Tacoma or Nissan Frontier.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55205" height="144" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-colorado-interior.jpg" width="200"/>It feels plenty truck-like inside, but there’s an element of sedan in the well-finished dashboard, the seat bolstering, and aluminum-look door and dash trim. The beefy steering wheel has lots of controls. The shift lever is mounted on a wide and tall console that can store an iPad, while holding two big cupholders and up to four USB ports, along with many small storage slots, bins, and trays.</p>, <p>There’s excellent headroom and legroom and a big view out the windshield. The front seats are relatively skinny, and have a more natural driving position than other trucks in the class, with a higher hip point and a more ergonomic relationship to the steering wheel, unlike the splayed-legs stance you have to take in the Tacoma. The Colorado is far more relaxing to drive for trips longer than an hour.</p>, <p>The rear of the extended cab is a pair of jump seats best suited for packages or child seats, or maybe kids. The crew cab offers cramped accommodations for two adults in the back seats, with bolt-upright seatbacks and a marked lack of knee room. Keep that in mind when you’re thinking of making it a second family car.</p>, <p>The bed is a big selling point. The payload is 1410 to 1590 pounds, while there’s an available bed extender that stretches the six-foot bed to eight feet, as big as a full-size truck, by using the tailgate. The step on the bumper makes it easy to climb into, and the slow-dropping tailgate will be appreciated every day. There are some 17 points for tie-downs, either a spray-in bedliner or a drop-in one, and available cargo dividers, a system of racks and carriers, cargo nets and tonneau covers, and a drop-in toolbox.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55204" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-colorado-driving.jpg" width="200"/>For a pickup truck, the Colorado offers a smooth ride that handles bumps well, making it a compelling alternative to a car. Some motions make it into the cabin, but wide sidewalls on the tires absorb a lot. We would be fine with a commute over rough roads in a Colorado, which we can’t say about the Tacoma or Frontier.</p>, <p>The Honda Ridgeline is also a rival, but it’s different. The Ridgeline has unitbody construction (like a car or a crossover), while the Colorado is body-on-frame, better for trucks because that design is superior for towing, hauling and durability.</p>, <p>The 3.6-liter V6 makes 308 horsepower and 275 pound-feet of torque, mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The 2.8-liter turbodiesel was new for 2016. It makes 181 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque at just 2000 rpm, so it pulls like a V8 across the rev range, even at high elevations and up steep grades, with few downshifts. The optional exhaust brake helps control downhill speeds with a full load. We find it smooth, solid and confident, a delightful diesel.</p>, <p>If you don’t carry or tow big loads, the base 2.5-liter engine, with its 200 horsepower and 191 pound-feet of torque, will probably work for you. It’s acceptable for medium-speed urban duty. You can get it with a manual transmission, however the 6-speed automatic works well with the four-cylinder engine. Now you have a car that can haul stuff.</p>, <p>The Toyota and Nissan four-cylinder trucks get better fuel mileage and Tacoma dominates in durability and rugged-terrain capability, but the Colorado is a far better choice for the kind of driving and infrequent hauling that a lot of truck buyers do. The Colorado is a much more comfortable truck and it’s nicer to drive than the Tacoma or Frontier.</p>, <p>The new ZR2 uses active dampers, developed with the experience from decades of offroad endurance racing, and even Formula 1. They are named Dynamic Suspensions Spool Valve dampers supplied by Mulitmatic. The technology is also used on the Chevy Camaro ZL1. The reaction time of these dampers to deal with wheel movement is astonishingly quick.</p>, <p>We found the ZR2 drives very nicely around town, ours equipped with the diesel. We haven’t driven one off pavement yet, but the suspension feels extremely capable and we have no doubt it will deliver. The Goodyears have aggressive tread on the edges of the sidewalls for traction in muddy ruts.</p>, <p>The Chevy Colorado offers a strong powertrain, good looks, convenient cabin, smooth ride, and decent handling. We think it’s best in class, the best truck among midsize pickups. We like all of its characters: from simple four-cylinder stick-shift Work Truck, to second family car, to high-tech offroad monster.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with NCTD editor Mitch McCullough reporting from New Jersey and staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-gmc-canyon/
[<p>The GMC Canyon is a rear-wheel-drive midsize pickup truck with the smooth ride and comfortable cabin of a car. Four-wheel drive is available, with an automatic mode that works like all-wheel drive in cars. Competitors include the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier, Honda Ridgeline, and the Chevrolet Colorado.</p>, <p>Arguably the best in the class, Canyon and Colorado are built on a traditional truck frame. Structurally and mechanically, the GMC and Chevy are nearly identical but differ in styling, trim and some features.</p>, <p>For 2017, Canyon got a new 3.6-liter V6 with a new 8-speed automatic, to add to the base 2.5-liter four cylinder with a 6-speed. For 2018 there are only a couple of small changes. Leather seats are added to the All Terrain offroad package, and a warning light for the windshield washer fluid level is now standard.</p>, <p>The four-cylinder engine makes 200 horsepower and is remarkably adequate for most needs, while its 6-speed automatic shifts quickly.</p>, <p>Best fuel mileage (an EPA 25 Combined mpg) and towing (up to 7700 pounds) comes from a 2WD 2.8-liter four-cylinder turbodiesel that makes an enormous amount of torque, but it’s expensive.</p>, <p>The base four-cylinder is rated by EPA at 22 Combined mpg with the 6-speed automatic, 1 mpg less with the manual transmission. With the V6 and all-wheel drive, it gets 19 mpg. It uses a cylinder deactivation system that cuts two cylinders when the throttle is light or backed off.</p>, <p>Canyon comes as an extended cab, with rear-hinged rear doors and a small bench seat in the back that can fit groceries or two child seats; or a crew cab, with four full-sized doors and seating for two adults in the rear. The bed lengths are 6-foot, 2-inch and 5-foot, 2-inch.</p>, <p>Standard safety features include six airbags and a rearview camera, oversized sideview mirrors, and trailer sway control. Forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems are available, rare features for a midsize pickup. NHTSA gives the Canyon four stars overall in safety, while the IIHS has only tested it for frontal impact, giving it the top score.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55199" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-canyon-denali.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 GMC Canyon comes in SL, base, SLE, SLT, and Denali, along with many cabin and powertrain configurations. The SL is priced at a bargain-basement $21,085, and the upscale Denali with 4WD tops the line at more than twice that, $43,570. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charges.)</p>, <p>Standard equipment on the base includes air conditioning, power windows, power driver’s seat, and USB port. The base and SL are largely the same, except the SL is intended for more primitive work, with vinyl flooring instead of carpeting, and fewer features.</p>, <p>Canyon SLE adds an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, cruise control, and other features. More options are available for the SLE, including an All Terrain X package for offroad that includes skid plates, hill descent control, and all-terrain tires. Plus leather upholstery, new for 2018.</p>, <p>Canyon SLT, with heated leather seating surfaces and automatic climate control, was bumped out of the top luxury spot by the Denali, with cooled seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55196" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-canyon-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Canyon has a strong family resemblance to its big brother the full-size GMC Sierra, and also some resemblance to its close relatives the midsize Chevrolet Colorado and full-size Silverado. Mostly in the front fascia and grille, the tidy tail, and the squarely flared wheel arches. The shoulder line sweeps up at the rear pillar, a nod to the global market, in particular Southeast Asia where it’s popular.</p>, <p>The Denali has its own grille, wheels, and bolt-on bits that we think detract from the cohesion of the design. Fancy seems incompatible, in this case; it is a truck, after all. We like the simplicity of the SLE and SLT.</p>, <p>Canyon’s cabin is rugged and stylish. It fits the image of business truck, but wouldn’t be out of place in a crossover or wagon. The seats, armrests, cupholders, and console shift lever feel almost sedan-like, even more so on the top models with their tasteful aluminum trim and contrasting stitched soft-touch materials.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55197" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-canyon-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The quality of the trim should embarrass the pedestrian Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier, although the Honda Ridgeline is up there with the Canyon.</p>, <p>Almost everything about the cabin is convenient. On the instrument panel, a central pod contains the main controls and a display unit, with the gauges behind a beefy steering wheel with controls. There’s ample storage in bins both open and covered, and there’s a storage space under the rear seat of the crew cab. The step-in height is reasonably low, and running boards are available. It’s unfortunate that the second row is bolt upright.</p>, <p>Any Canyon model is far more comfortable than the Tacoma or Frontier. The front seats are shaped well for passengers of all sizes, they have good bolstering, and a higher seating position still with more headroom than the Frontier or Tacoma. There’s great room to stretch in front, although that upright second row wears on passengers after a while. The Canyon would not make the family happy if it were the only family car.</p>, <p>That might be where the Denali comes in, but we doubt it. It is clearly upscale, although the fit and finish is still shy of luxury standards. That same level of fit and finish is acceptable and not even noticed on the other models, but at twice the price, Denali should deliver.</p>, <p>The extended-cab comes only with the longer 6-foot-2 bed that can accept an optional extender to haul items eight feet long, such as plywood or two-by-fours. The crew cab has front-hinged rear doors, and comes with either the longer bed or the 5-foot-2 bed. There’s a step in the rear bumper to make it easy to climb up into either bed, and a tailgate that’s easy to raise and lower. Also available are 17 tie-down points, a choice of a spray-in bedliner or drop-in one, cargo dividers, a system of racks and carriers called GearOn, cargo nets and tonneau covers, a drop-in toolbox, and trailer hitches and harnesses.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55198" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-canyon-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-canyon-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-canyon-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The base four-cylinder is adequate, making the Canyon an acceptable second car for the family, with its fuel mileage of 22 miles per gallon; its open bed for cargo gives it an advantage over a compact crossover. Its payload ranges from 1450 to 1620 pounds, enough for a bed full of rocks or sand, not much less than a full-size truck.</p>, <p>With 200 horsepower and 191 pound-feet of torque, the 2.5-liter engine works hard, but it’s smooth and fairly quiet. It feels better driving around town, where it’s perky. And it’s better with just rear-wheel drive, and the 6-speed automatic that shifts well. The manual is only available in the base model with rear-wheel drive, and we’re not sure why you would want one, almost irrelevant because you can’t hardly get one anyhow.</p>, <p>Most popular is a Canyon 4WD with the new 3.6-liter V6, making 308 horsepower and 275 pound-feet of torque. It comes with an 8-speed automatic we like.</p>, <p>The four-cylinder turbodiesel is a 2.8 liter making 181 horsepower but more importantly 369 pound-feet of torque. It’s a charmer that only sometimes feels rough, and it works well with the 6-speed automatic. It can easily tow 7700 pounds, only 700 more than the rating for the V6, but the turbodiesel shows less stress because it has 94 more foot-pounds of torque to support acceleration.</p>, <p>Applause for GM for the ride that’s almost level to a sedan, on a conventional suspension that’s comfortably tuned. It rounds off bumps nicely, although like any body-on-frame design, the Canyon transmits a fair share of secondary ride motions to the cabin.</p>, <p>The handling is nimble and cornering confident. It’s not all that much smaller than a full-size Sierra but drives like it is. The electric power steering is weighted well and tracks mostly true.</p>, <p>GMC’s AutoTrac allows manual selection of 4WD or an Auto mode that frees the electronics to vary the torque between axles depending on traction needs. This is a good system for wintry conditions when traction is inconsistent. An automatic locking differential is available on some models.</p>, <p>The Canyon is a strong contender in the midsize truck class. It’s got a strong base powertrain, comfortable and efficient cabin, smooth ride and good handing.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-dodge-challenger/
[<p>Dodge Challenger, Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro are three of a kind (never mind that in NASCAR it’s the Mustang, Camaro and Toyota Camry, the latter front-wheel drive in production form).</p>, <p>The Mustang and Camaro are smaller, nimbler, and more graceful, so the Challenger can’t run with them in the corners. But MoPar fans don’t much care. They have the 707-horsepower SRT Hellcat, with its 6.2-liter supercharged V8. Megahorsepower can quickly make up for handling disadvantages.</p>, <p>And now, the SRT Demon joins the 2018 Challenger lineup. Try 840 horsepower and 770 pound-feet of torque. Why? Well, it’s a factory production drag car, the fastest muscle car in history, offering acceleration from zero to sixty in 2.3 seconds, a quarter-mile time of 9.65 seconds, and a top speed of more than 200 miles per hour. It’s the first production car that will do a wheelstand: 2.92 feet, as certified by Guinness World Records.</p>, <p>But wait, there’s more. For 2018 there’s another new model, the Hellcat Widebody. It gets fender flares, 20-inch aluminum wheels that are 11 inches wide, and 305/35ZR20 Pirelli tires.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55189" height="92" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-hellcat.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Challenger Hellcat gets a new grille and fender badges, so-called Air-Catcher headlamps with the Hellcat logo, and Demonic Red Laguna leather upholstery. New options include Brembo brake calipers painted black, orange and gunmetal; and a wheel finish called Matte Vapor.</p>, <p>Drive one of those, and you can sneer at Camaro and Mustang drivers.</p>, <p>There are more new performance upgrades and options for 2018, as well.</p>, <p>We would be here a long time, if we got into the details of all of the Challenger possibilities. There are no less than 16 models. Challenger SXT, SXT Plus, R/T, R/T Plus, R/T Shaker, R/T Plus Shaker, R/T Scat Pack, T/A, T/A Plus, T/A 392, GT AWD, 392 HEMI Scat Pack Shaker, SRT 392, SRT Hellcat, SRT Hellcat Widebody, and last but for sure not least, the SRT Demon.</p>, <p>Base engine in Challenger SXT is Chrysler’s 3.6-liter V6 making 305 horsepower and 268 pound-feet of torque. The R/T uses a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 with 375 horsepower and 410 pound-feet of torque. The R/T Scat Pack and SRT 392 use a 6.4-liter Hemi V8 making 485 horsepower and 475 pound-feet. The Hellcat’s supercharged 6.2-liter V8 makes 707 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque, and can do the quarter-mile in 11.2 seconds and reach a top speed of 199 mph.</p>, <p>Transmissions for the Challenger are an 8-speed automatic or 6-speed manual. It depends on the model which one is standard, and which one is optional.</p>, <p>The V6 gets an EPA-rated 23 combined miles per gallon with the automatic (30 mpg highway), while the 5.7-liter V8 gets 18 mpg combined with the 6-speed manual and 19 mpg with the automatic. The manual needs premium fuel, while the automatic is okay with regular. That’s because the engine mated to the manual gearbox is a bit more powerful.</p>, <p>In crash testing, the NHTSA gives Challenger five stars overall, with four stars for frontal collision and rollover. The IIHS gives top Good scores for moderate overlap front and side impacts, but only Marginal in the difficult small-overlap front collision test, with Acceptable grades for roof strength head restraint security. Automatic emergency braking isn’t available on the Challenger.</p>, <p>The 2018 Dodge Challenger lineup ranges from the entry-level V6-powered SXT ($26,995) to the SRT Demon ($83,295). In between are the R/T with the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 ($33,495), and the T/A 392 with the 6.4-liter V8 ($38,995), and the Hellcat ($63,795).</p>, <p>Challenger SXT includes hound’s-tooth cloth upholstery, 18-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, rearview camera, power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The infotainment and rearview camera are newly standard for 2018.</p>, <p>The Challenger GT is the all-season car, with all-wheel drive standard. It adds an 8.4-inch infotainment screen, heated and ventilated leather-upholstered seats, Alpine-branded audio, rear parking sensors, and more.</p>, <p>The R/T designation means hemi. Challenger R/T models get bigger wheels, brakes and a rear spoiler, among other things. The Shaker designation means a bulging hood with wide but relatively slim and restrained intake for the cold air induction. The 392 means 6.4 liters.</p>, <p>Challenger SRT models have things like HID headlamps with automatic high-beams, lightweight 20-inch aluminum wheels with grippy tires. Black cloth upholstery is standard, with regular or fancy Nappa leather available.</p>, <p>There are many options, either stand-alone or in packages, including LED headlamps and taillamps, synthetic suede upholstery, adaptive cruise control, a forward-collision warning system, blind-spot monitors, and cross-traffic alerts. For 2018 there are a quite a few new and miscellaneous equipment and trim upgrades and availabilities, to all the models. Things like optional Brass Monkey wheels on the SRT 392; optional red Brembo brake calipers on the R/T and R/T 392; a Performance Handling Package on 5.7-liter models with four-piston Brembo brakes and the high-performance suspension; and new F8 Green and IndiGO Blue colors, to add to the already eye-catching Plum Crazy.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55187" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Challenger might not have a roofline or profile as sporty as the Mustang or Camaro, but its lines are clean enough to hold its own. It’s pure and retro all the way, with a shape much like the original 1971 Challenger. And the 2018 version looks very similar to the 2008 model that marked the rebirth of the Challenger. Nice face that has become iconic, nice flared fenders and hips. The Shaker hood with the power bulge may be a throwback to the Sixties, but then you might say that about any car with a hood scoop, including a Subaru.</p>, <p>The hound’s-tooth cloth trim might be throwback, but models with leather make the cabin feel a bit like a luxury coupe. Well, close. The front seats would be at home in a Mercedes, especially in Nappa leather. There’s a base high-tech 7.0-inch customizable instrument cluster TFT screen, or 8.4-inch touchscreen with sharpened resolution and quicker software for infotainment.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55191" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-interior-srt.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-interior-srt.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-interior-srt-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Acoustic glass and heavy sound insulation keep the cabin noise down even with high-performance tires. The Hemi’s engine noise enters the cabin, as it should; that’s what any Hemi buyer wants. The Hemi uses a 2.75-inch electronically controlled active exhaust system to deliver that signature sound.</p>, <p>The rear seat falls a bit short, compared to the front. Three people can fit only for a short time. There’s less headroom than the Challenger’s size might suggest. And climbing in through the front doors takes some contortion.</p>, <p>The trunk is very large, 16.2 cubic feet, more space than some midsize sedans. It’s wide, long and shallow, able to fit several large suitcases, making this muscle car a good traveling car. When that passenger in the middle of the rear seat starts complaining, you can offer them more room in the trunk.</p>, <p>The thick roof pillars and high beltline detract from rearward visibility when on the road, but the new-for-2018 rearview camera solves the backing-up issue.</p>, <p>The SXT with its 3.6-liter V6 is the easiest to drive and has the most compliant suspension; taller sidewalls on the tires help. It’s still firm enough to handle fairly well. With its 305 horsepower and paddle-shifting 8-speed automatic, there’s enough power to feel like a muscle car; after all, it wasn’t that long ago that 300 horsepower was considered a lot for a V8. The SXT isn’t short on acceleration for passing, unless of course you compare it to something extreme like a Hellcat. The SXT is an easy car to live with that exudes a lot of style.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55185" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The different models have different suspension setups, so they ride and handle differently, but any Challenger is stable and predictable even on twisty roads, and can be driven quickly. Not as nimble as a Mustang or Camaro, but the electric power steering is accurate and nicely weighted.</p>, <p>The SRT models are markedly firmer, while reducing body lean in the turns a significant amount. An upgraded Performance Handling Package tightens the suspension on R/T models and adds four-piston Brembo brakes.</p>, <p>The Challenger GT offers all-wheel drive for winter weather capability.</p>, <p>Jumping up to the SRT 392 with its 6.4-liter V8, you get 485 horsepower and 475 pound-feet of torque, along four-piston Brembo brakes and 20 x 9-inch aluminum wheels. You also get adaptive suspension and SRT drive modes that determine power, transmission shift points and speed (if you don’t shift manually with the paddles), steering quickness, stability control levels, and even suspension firmness. The drive modes include Sport, Track and Default modes, while Custom mode enables drivers to choose separate settings.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55190" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-challenger-drift.jpg" width="200"/>The Hellcat’s power steering is hydraulic, which gives it more road feel, although that feel is anything but delicate, given its weight of 4500 pounds. Still, it’s relatively easy to drive for a car with such a humongous amount of horsepower. The Hellcat dampers are high-tech Bilsteins, but there’s an available adaptive suspension whose Normal mode isn’t much firmer than the standard SXT. Optional Pirelli P Zero performance tires give the Hellcat heaps of grip on dry pavement, but they’re scary on snow or ice. Big Brembo brakes inspire about as much confidence as you can have in a 4500-pound car that can go 200 miles per hour.</p>, <p>Our seat time in the Hellcat included one 30-minute blast at daybreak on a remote Oregon road that twisted upward into the mountains. We didn’t pass a single car in either direction. We drove it like we stole it, which to say almost as fast as we could without risking tossing it over a cliff. We reached the small town for coffee in about half the time it took 24 other autojournos driving different high-performance cars, and our smile was twice as broad. Mind-blowing acceleration out of corners and a quick-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission will do that to you. The Hellcat was indeed a beast, but we were almost amazed by how composed it remained.</p>, <p>The Demon will push back your eyeteeth, with a g-force of 1.8 g in its acceleration from a standing start to 30 miles per hour in one second. To increase horsepower from the Hellcat’s 707 to 840, a few changes were made to the 6.2-liter supercharged engine. Including a bigger supercharger with increased boost pressure to 14.5 psi; upping the redline to 6500 rpm; SRT Power Chiller liquid-to-air intercooler chiller system; After-Run Chiller that keeps cooling the supercharger/charge air cooler after the engine is shut off; Air-Grabber induction system with hood scoop having a huge 45.2 square inches of intake. Changes to get that horsepower to the ground include the TransBrake system for grippy launches; and Torque Reserve, to bring over-the-top torque at launch.</p>, <p>Do the arithmetic between the Demon and Hellcat, and you’ll find that you pay $19,500 to raise the horsepower from 707 to 840. There are a number of engine changes to justify that but maybe what you’re really paying for is the ability to say your car is the quickest production car in the world, in a straight line (and prove it if you go to the drag strip), and the only one that can do a wheelstand.</p>, <p>Ironically, for that extra 20 thou you also get no rear seats, and just two speakers. It’s all about saving weight. But to add madness to the irony, Dodge will sell you back your rear seats for $1. And never fear, leather upholstery and an 18-speaker Harman Kardon sound system are optional. Plus, Demon buyers get a free one-day session at the Bob Bondurant School of High-performance Driving.</p>, <p>No argument here on pros and cons vs a Mustang or Camaro. Nothing will change your mind if you’re in one corner or another. The 2018 Challenger is a worthy MoPar. It’s handsome. It handles. Good transmissions. The SXT is both retro and stylish, and quick, no longer a dinosaur, if you need to justify a V6. If you’re not the type to worry about justifying your stuff, the Hellcat or Widebody Hellcat is for you. The Demon is for racers.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Dodge Charger is a full-size rear-wheel-drive sedan. It’s reminiscent of an old-school muscle car, a four-door longer in wheelbase than the two-door Dodge Challenger, with retro styling. Yet it’s comfortable and user friendly, with modern technology.</p>, <p>Charger’s body was last refreshed for 2015, and changes since then have been plenty but not major. For 2018, the Charger Hellcat gets a new grille and fender badges. There are some minor equipment changes for 2018: a rearview camera comes standard, a V6 performance package for the SXT has been added, and new colors are available for paint, wheels, brake calipers, and leather upholstery.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55176" height="108" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-charger-final.jpg" width="200"/>The scary-fast 707-horsepower Charger Hellcat gets the most attention, with a new grille and fender badges, and new options including aluminum wheels with a finish called Matte Vapor; brake calipers painted black, orange and gunmetal; gunmetal gray body stripes; and Demonic Red leather.</p>, <p>There are four Charger engines, all mated to an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. The responsive 3.6-liter V6 makes 292 horsepower; the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 makes 370 horsepower; the 6.4-liter V8 (392 cubic inches) makes 485 hp; and last but hardly least comes the SRT Hellcat with its supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 making 707 epic horsepower. It will go 204 miles per hour. It’s surprisingly composed for a beast.</p>, <p>The Charger strikes a brilliant balance between performance and livability, and it’s beautifully finished for the money. Though if it’s luxury you want, the Chrysler 300, which shares the Charger platform and powertrains, is the call.</p>, <p>The GT and GT Plus models are all-wheel drive, using an active transfer case and front-axle disconnect that can shift into rear-wheel drive to save fuel. The V6 engines in the GT models make a bit more horsepower, 300, to pull the extra weight of the system.</p>, <p>Shopping for a Charger could be very confusing if you’re not already a MoPar aficionado. There are many choices in equipment, so you have to be sure of things, in particular knowing what engine, suspension, exhaust and brakes you want. If you just want a Charger and don’t care about all that, the SXT works very nicely.</p>, <p>Fuel economy for the Charger V6 with rear-wheel drive is an EPA-estimated 19/30 miles per gallon City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. V8 models with cylinder deactivation get 19 mpg Combined, while the Hellcat gets 16 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The Charger gets five stars in safety from NHTSA, while the IIHS gives it the highest score in every category, including rollover and side impact, but a Marginal in the small front-overlap crash test. Standard safety features include airbags for the driver’s knee and full-length curtain airbags, as well as active head restrains in front.</p>, <p>Safety features including rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot monitors, lane departure warning with lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking are optional, or come with packages and higher trims.</p>, <p>Charger SXT ($28,495), SXT Plus ($30,495), and SXT Plus Leather ($33,495) come with the 292-hp V6 engine. Charger GT ($32,495) and GT Plus ($35,495) come with all-wheel drive and a 300-hp V6. Charger R/T and Daytona feature a 370-hp 5.7-liter V8. Charger R/T Scat Pack, Daytona 392 ($44,995) and SRT 392 ($51,145) get a 392-cubic-inch V8 with 485 horsepower. Charger SRT Hellcat ($67,995) gets a 707-hp 6.2-liter engine.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55180" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-charger-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Unlike the Challenger, which is trimmer and more shapely, and still looks great for the times, the Charger’s retro boxiness seems to be wearing off. It looks dated. (We wonder ourselves why we think it looks dated, since its whole point is to look retro. But never mind.)</p>, <p>Charger rides on a wheelbase that is four inches longer than that of the Challenger, though the Challenger is only two inches shorter than the Charger.</p>, <p>Charger’s low nose with black grille and fascia has a storm-trooper look; that’s the Blacktop Appearance Package, available even on the SXT, offering a lot of style for the money.</p>, <p>Charger’s profile shows swollen hips, a high beltline, and hard-edged pillars. But its short overhangs and big wheels are contemporary, and the blunt ends make it look more compact. Those big hips, the rear fenders, are smooth and not bulbous, tapering to LED taillamps whose shape dates to the Sixties. At night, a rectangle of red light comes out, piping that traces the perimeter of the rear end.</p>, <p>Each model has its own style. We like the R/T’s restrained aggression. The Hellcat gets a new grille and fender badges for 2018.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55175" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-charger-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The Charger is big, and comfortable for four. Legroom in the rear seat is less than some other full-size sedans, but it’s still decent. Headroom is good, although the high window line limits downward visibility out the sides.</p>, <p>The wide front seats with aggressive bolstering are race-inspired. The available retro hounds-tooth cloth upholstery isn’t. But Nappa leather is also available. Dodge brags that its top audio system is exclusive to the segment. It’s a 552-watt BeatsAudio system with subwoofer in the trunk.</p>, <p>The interior is simple, with above-average comfort, quality and technology. The surfacing is subtle, with soft-touch materials and trim accents in matte metallic. A 7.0-inch display screen is standard on the SXT, while other models use the Chrysler 8.4-inch touchscreen. But the SXT uses the same dashboard, center console, and door materials as the upper models. Which might not exactly be a selling point for them, since they cost thousands more.</p>, <p>The interior is quiet, with an active exhaust system allowing the satisfying soft rumble of the Hemi V8 into the cabin. In reviews of other Chrysler cars with that engine, we’ve called it plain loud. We think we’re right both ways, it depends on the silencing, and the Charger has it just right.</p>, <p>No worries about the 3.6-liter V6 in the Charger SXT and GT. It’s plenty quick enough to stay ahead of traffic, its 292 horsepower boosted by 260 pound-feet of torque. There’s a nice resonance to the exhaust note in the midrange.</p>, <p>The 8-speed automatic rifles through the gears with excellent shift action and logic. It can do its shifts in a very quick 160 milliseconds. On the SRT models it blips the downshift to match the engine and transmission speeds and make the downshift smoothly. The shifter is clunky, however.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55179" height="138" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-charger-driving-awd.jpg" width="200"/>The Charger GT offers all-wheel drive for winter weather capability.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, the 5.7-liter V8 will stay ahead of traffic at half throttle, using its 370 horsepower and 395 pound-feet of torque. It can accelerate from zero to sixty in less than six seconds, a brisk pace.</p>, <p>The 6.4-liter V8, a bored-out 5.7-liter Hemi, can do that time in a very quick 4.5 seconds. The Hellcat, with its supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi, can do it in a super quick 3.7 seconds.</p>, <p>The ride in some models is a bit soft, as after all it is a standard sedan, and there’s some body lean, but the handling does not feel retro at all. It’s capable and composed. The steering is accurate and nicely weighted. With so many available suspension setups, the ride and handling changes, but we have found all models will feel balanced within their limits.</p>, <p>The SXT gets an option to improve handling with the Super Track Pak, including Bilstein dampers, a 3.07 rear axle ratio, performance hood with air induction, performance front and rear fascias, sculpted side sills, and the Dodge Performance Pages data system and indicators.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55178" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-charger-driving-srt.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-charger-driving-srt.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-charger-driving-srt-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The SRT with a firm suspension delivers remarkable control given its hefty weight of more than 4000 pounds. The SRTs use huge Brembo brakes with six-piston calipers in front, adaptive dampers, and a drive-mode system with Sport, Track, Default and Custom mode, allowing the driver to make selections for transmission, throttle, and steering. The Bilstein adaptive damping suspension also has modes: Auto, Sport and Track.</p>, <p>It’s this system that enables the 707-horsepower Hellcat to be civilized on the highway. There’s also a lock to limit horsepower to 500, which is 400 horsepower more than is needed for valet parking.</p>, <p>If you don’t feel like being civilized all the time, you can hammer the throttle of the Hellcat and burn rubber and slide the tail in the turns. It gets nervous chasing through canyons, the suspension dances on smooth roads. To drive it quickly, in any direction other than a straight line, it’s a handful.</p>, <p>The Dodge Charger won’t disappoint MoPar enthusiasts, and that’s what matters. It gets top marks for the engines, transmission, cabin, and handling. The entry-level SXT has all the right features, as long as you don’t need that V8 rumble under the hood. If you do, the choices are rich. Enjoy them.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The current, fifth-generation Dodge Grand Caravan has been around since the 2008 model year, freshened for 2011, with Stow ‘n’ Go seats improved for 2013. For the 2018 model year, little has changed.</p>, <p>Threatened with extinction, especially after Chrysler launched its far more modern Pacifica minivan for 2017, the Grand Caravan continues to hang onto a tradition-minded corner of the minivan market. While undeniably an old-timer, first launched for 1984, the minivan is helped by a strong V6 engine, spacious interior, and versatile Stow ‘n Go seating.</p>, <p>Value-focused pricing also helps it appeal to budget-minded families. Dodge offers four trim levels: SE, SE Plus, SXT, and GT.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55157" height="139" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-2.jpg" width="200"/>Beneath its stubby hood, the familiar 3.6-liter V6 engine develops 283 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 6-speed automatic transmission sends power to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is not available.</p>, <p>Minivans are well-known for their flexibility, and the Grand Caravan is no exception. In addition to standard seven-passenger seating, it provides an appealing array of storage possibilities.</p>, <p>Weighed against its strong points are a couple of notable demerits. Interior materials, for one, look and feel cheap compared to more contemporary minivans. More important, safety testing has yielded some troubling results. Advanced safety technology is in short supply, too. Safety is typically a prominent selling point for family-focused buyers, and the Grand Caravan falls well short of the competition.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2017 Grand Caravan a four-star overall score, with four stars for frontal impact and five stars in the side-impact test. In crash-testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Grand Caravan earned Good scores in each test except one. The small-overlap frontal crash yielded a Poor rating.</p>, <p>Seven airbags and a rearview camera are standard, but not much more in terms of safety. Such advanced features as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane-departure warnings are not available at all. A Safety Sphere group includes blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-path detection, as well as rear parking assist, but it’s optional only on the GT trim level.</p>, <p>Grand Caravan continues to be popular, based on familiarity, pricing and the deal. Grand Caravan offers a lot of utility, but it’s a dated product, and the Chrysler Pacifica, launched as a 2017 model, is a far more appealing choice.</p>, <p>Grand Caravan SE ($25,995) comes with seven-passenger seating, three-row power windows, keyless entry, heated power mirrors, Stow ‘n Go third-row seat, a rearview camera, a 6.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and 17-inch steel wheels. Bluetooth connectivity is part of a Uconnect Handsfree option package. All Grand Caravans can get rear-seat DVD entertainment with a 9.0-inch screen. SE Plus ($28,695) includes the Handsfree package, premium cloth upholstery, second-row Stow ‘n Go seating, alloy wheels, and a Blacktop appearance package. Captain’s chairs substitute for a bench in the second row.</p>, <p>Grand Caravan SXT ($31,395) adds leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat, automatic headlights, foglamps, power sliding doors, remote start, a roof rack, and gray alloy wheels. Options include heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and Garmin in-dash navigation.</p>, <p>Grand Caravan GT ($34,395) features heated leather seats in the first and second rows, nine-speaker audio, three-zone automatic temperature control, navigation, a performance suspension, and monochromatic exterior. Optional only for the GT, a Safety Sphere package includes blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55156" height="148" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-rear.jpg" width="200"/>A relic, the Grand Caravan has been around in its current form for a decade. Only a glanced is needed to realize that basic fact. Rounded corners and mild curves cannot conceal the basic slab-sided design.</p>, <p>Although Dodge’s elder minivan looks somewhat narrow, it’s almost 79 inches wide. As a result, it doesn’t exactly qualify as lithe in urban driving. Steel wheels on the base SE trim level look especially dreary. On other trim levels, aluminum wheels come in a trio of possible colors.</p>, <p>Not only does the cabin appear humdrum, lacking in imaginative design, its materials tend to look and feel cheap, if not tawdry. Soft-touch plastic elements are fitted onto door tops and the dashboard. Just about everywhere else, the interior comes across as thoroughly low-budget.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55160" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Most controls are grouped within a tall center stack, which includes several pockets. From the front seat, outward visibility is good, and occupants can choose from a variety of seat-adjustment positions.</p>, <p>The Stow ‘n Go seats are a standout feature, available for the second and third rows. As their name suggests, they stow away neatly when not needed, providing impressively flexible space.</p>, <p>Both second- and third-row seats are overly firm. Only SE trim level comes equipped with a second-row bench. The otherwise-standard captain’s chairs are thinly padded, not ideal for long journeys.</p>, <p>In the third row, a three-place bench can be tumbled right into the cargo floor, which is admirably flat, long, and wide. The tracks from the third row can poke and damage some cargoes, but this can be addressed by putting floor mats on tope of them.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55159" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-caravan-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Acceleration from the strong V6 engine is admirable, sufficient to propel the Grand Caravan with a sense of authority. The 6-speed automatic shifts promptly, not often impeded by annoying gear-hunting. The engine is well-muted, as if it’s actually some distance away from the minivan occupants. At times, hard acceleration can cause the steering wheel to pull toward one side.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, that impressive powertrain cannot overcome the Grand Caravan’s lumpy ride quality, stemming from its firm suspension and a weak overall structure.</p>, <p>The firm ride seems to transmit pavement flaws right into the cabin’s trim pieces. Don’t be surprised to hear a periodic rattle from interior fittings. On the other hand, even when traversing rough terrain, sounds from the outside world are commendably subdued.</p>, <p>Grand Caravan fuel economy is beaten by newer designs such as the Chrysler Pacifica and Honda Odyssey. Grand Caravan is EPA-rated at 17/25 mpg City/Highway, or 20 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Despite its demerits, including weak safety scores, the Grand Caravan does offer quite a bit for its value-focused price. Discounted prices shouldn’t be hard to find. Still, topping the Grand Caravan in spaciousness, the far more modern Pacifica also earns greater safety scores and is substantially better-equipped. Especially in base trim, the Grand Caravan has quite a meager standard-equipment list.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-dodge-durango/
[<p>The Dodge Durango is a crossover because it’s a unitbody, so it’s not built with the body bolted onto the frame like the more rugged truck-based SUVs. Durango behaves like a crossover, with very nice road manners, like a car.</p>, <p>It doesn’t look like a crossover, however, and some of its capabilities resemble those of a truck-based SUV. It’s handsome, not too soft, clean but rugged like the SUV it used to be. It can tow up to 7400 pounds. It seats seven, with a third-row seat standard equipment on all models but the base SXT where it’s optional. It’s rear-wheel drive, not front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is optional.</p>, <p>Durango is built on the chassis of its cousin the Jeep Grand Cherokee, stretched with a longer wheelbase to make decent room for seven. It shares character with the Mercedes-Benz M- and GL-Class, which are also crossovers, arguably.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55148" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-citadel.jpg" width="200"/>Durango’s competitors include full-size truck-based SUVs from Chevrolet, GMC, Ford and Lincoln, among others. Being rear-wheel drive, it’s sportier than rivals with front-wheel drive like the Honda Pilot and Nissan Pathfinder. Dodge PR says the Durango is the Dodge Charger of SUVs, and that’s a good description.</p>, <p>That’s a lot of competition in the class, and the Durango is getting a bit long in the tooth; the 2018 model is the eighth year of its generation, although there have been countless changes and upgrades along the way. And there’s a bunch more for 2018, changes to equipment and trim, but no redesign, unless you count the spectacular new SRT model.</p>, <p>Like the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT before it, the Durango bolts in Chrysler’s big 392 cubic-inch V8 making 475 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque. It’s all-wheel-drive only, using a beefed-up version of the 8-speed automatic that’s in all Durangos. It is awesome fast. So fast that it comes with a one-day session at the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving.</p>, <p>The base engine is Chrysler’s strong 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 making 290 or 295 horsepower with 260 pound-feet of torque. The bigger engine is a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 making 360 hp and 390 lb-ft. Both engines use an 8-speed automatic transmission. The V6 can tow a class-leading 6200 pounds; the Hemi V8 can tow a class-leading 7400 pounds. It’s loud.</p>, <p>The V8 gets a rugged two-speed transfer case, while the V6 uses a simpler single-range electronic system.</p>, <p>Gas mileage is not so hot. The V6 gets an EPA-estimated 19/26 miles per gallon City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined with rear-wheel drive, or 18/25/21 mpg with all-wheel drive. The 5.7-liter V8 is rated 14/22/17 mpg with all-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive. All come with the stop/start system that shuts off the engine at a stoplight.</p>, <p>The crash ratings are not so hot, either. The chassis might be showing its age, earning four stars overall from NHTSA; only three stars in rollover for all-wheel-drive models (four for rear-wheel-drive), but five stars in side crash. The IIHS gives it good scores in most of the tests, except for Marginal in the fearsome small-overlap.</p>, <p>New standard equipment for 2018 includes a rearview camera; sport steering wheel with paddle shifters; shifter with Auto Stick selector gate; Apple CarPlay and Android Auto using the Uconnect system with an 7.0 or 8.4-inch touchscreen radio system.</p>, <p>The camera has the eminently helpful trailer view that makes it easy to perfectly place your trailer-hitch ball under the cap on the trailer tongue. Also standard on other models is the UConnect infotainment system with 8.4-inch display screen.</p>, <p>The 2018 Dodge Durango comes in SXT ($29,995), GT ($37,795), R/T ($43,695), and Citadel ($42,145) models. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.) All-wheel drive is optional ($2600).</p>, <p>Standard equipment in the SXT includes six airbags, full power, air conditioning, cruise control, tilt/telescope steering wheel, an AM/FM stereo, USB port and aux jack, 7.0-inch infotainment system, plenty of USB inputs, 18-inch alloy wheels, three-zone automatic climate control, keyless ignition, and manually adjusted front seats. 2018 Durango SXT’s also get a leather sport steering wheel and rear park assist.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55149" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-gt.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-gt.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-gt-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Durango GT models get a power liftgate, paddle shifters and synthetic suede seats, plus a firmer suspension, special steering tuning, rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>Durango R/T gets the Hemi 5.7-liter V8. Plus a Beats audio system, upgraded leather upholstery, and ventilated front seats. Durango Citadel comes with Nappa leather.</p>, <p>Options include an Alpine audio system, blind-spot monitors, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning that can bring the vehicle to a complete stop at slow speeds, heated front seats, third-row seat, satellite radio, 115-volt outlet, and 20-inch wheels. Second-row captain’s chairs are also available, along with a power sunroof, power tailgate, Beats by Dr. Dre audio system with 10 speakers and subwoofer, and HDMI and Blu-ray rear entertainment system.</p>, <p>Front Park Assist joins ParkSense Park Assist System with sensors in the front bumper to detect obstacles and includes a shut-off switch and is standard on Durango R/T, Citadel and SRT models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55150" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Durango is classy, with a muscular nose and boxy profile with soft edges, conservative flat sheetmetal. From the rear, you wouldn’t say it looks like a truck, although you won’t mistake it for anything else. Monochrome trim and a twin exhaust give it some sport.</p>, <p>The R/T and SRT are wider and lower, with sharper front fascia with a lower valence to house a new cold-air duct, and LED fog lamps. It’s a three-slot hood scoop, with a center air inlet duct flanked by heat extractors.</p>, <p>Inside, there are no hints of its truck past at all. The tightly sealed cabin is rich but subtle, quiet and refined, feeling like a luxury SUV, like its foreign ancestor the Mercedes ML. The flowing dash is covered in soft-touch materials and displays metallic-ringed gauges and a bright 8.4-inch infotainment touchscreen on most models (SXT uses a 5.0-inch touchscreen). The R/T shows off leather upholstery with woven red inserts and red stitching.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55152" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Front passengers have it good, with well-bolstered cloth seats and a driving position that works for all sizes. The leather seats are flatter than the cloth, so if you like sporty driving that’s something to consider.</p>, <p>Three adults fit comfortably in the second row, with available captain’s chairs for two individuals, with a low console with one cupholder between them. It’s minimalist. There’s an optional larger console with two cupholders, 12-volt outlet and USB port. We suggest getting it.</p>, <p>Either way, there is a hump on the floor, over the rear-wheel-drive’s driveshaft.</p>, <p>The third-row seat is eminently usable compared to others. It actually fits two adults, although it’s a bit difficult to climb back there. It’s split 50/50 and folds, although not into the floor like the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, which might be a better option if it’s a people-carrier you need more than a tow vehicle. But when the Durango’s second row is folded there’s 84.5 cubic feet of space, room enough for a six-foot couch and a coffee table, or a stack of 10-foot-long two-by-fours.</p>, <p>The rear visibility is hindered by wide roof pillars, so with the SXT, the rearview camera option is a must.</p>, <p>As for the new SRT, it seems to deserve its available high-performance Demonic Red Laguna leather upholstery with carbon-fiber trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55147" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-towing.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-towing.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-durango-towing-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>When the Durango isn’t showing off its SUV strength by towing a big load, it drives like a crossover, meaning it behaves more like a car. The independent suspension provides a supple and well-damped ride, although there’s some head toss on patchy pavement. The steering is heavy but precise, and the brakes are big and secure for towing.</p>, <p>If you do tow a lot, even though the V6 can do 6200 pounds, the muscular Hemi V8 might be a better choice, for its additional torque; it can tow with the best of them, including some Ram 1500 pickup trucks. The 8-speed transmission works for towing even with its wide ratios.</p>, <p>The 295 horsepower made by the V6 has a lot of weight to push, but the engine is smooth and quiet.</p>, <p>The ride in the SXT and Citadel is firm but supple, while the SRT borders on harsh. And the available 20-inch alloy wheels amplify bad things on pavement. Think twice if frost heaves are big in your town.</p>, <p>That harsh-riding SRT will shoot you from zero to sixty in a Viper-like 4.4 seconds, and on to the quarter-mile in 12.9 seconds (certified by the NHRA). With 470 pound-feet of torque, there’s enough pulling power to tie for the lead in the class with 8600 pounds towing. Never mind that the SRT is in a class of two, the other not coincidentally also called SRT, being the Jeep.</p>, <p>Durango’s 8-speed automatic shifts fast, predictable, and buttery smooth. It’s compatible with the V6, Hemi V8, or even the monster SRT, after being strengthened for the rigors.</p>, <p>Solid engine, transmission, ride and handling, and excellent cabin and third-row seat. Despite its age, Durango holds its own. However, fuel mileage, if not crash-test ratings, might be a dealbreaker. But never a dealbreaker for the SRT, which we’d take in a heartbeat. It’s less nimble than the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, being longer, but if you need that extra cargo space, it’s the hottest hauler you can buy.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>Introduced as a 2009 model, the Dodge Journey midsize crossover SUV gets a simplified lineup for the 2018 model year. Still appealing to budget-minded families, the 2018 Journey comes with seven-passenger seating. Journey Crossroad models now ride on 19-inch Black Noise aluminum wheels. The optional Blacktop Package is now available on the 2018 Journey SE, as well as SXT and GT versions.</p>, <p>Four value-focused trim levels are offered: SE, SXT, Crossroad, and GT. Front-wheel-drive versions except the GT come with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 173 horsepower and 166 pound-feet of torque. All-wheel-drive models get a 3.6-liter V6 that develops 283 horsepower and 260 pound-feet. It’s optional on front-wheel-drive models and standard on GTs.</p>, <p>Every four-cylinder Journey uses a 4-speed automatic transmission, at a time when competitors have turned to transmissions with several more gear ratios (though many have refinement issues with 8- and 9-speed automatics). That’s just one of the ways in which the model is clearly behind the times. Fortunately, a 6-speed automatic mates with the V6 engine.</p>, <p>The Crossroad edition, in particular, retains some rugged design features, suggesting off-road potential. In reality, that model is no more capable of off-pavement driving than its mates.</p>, <p>Journey’s appeal as a family vehicle is diminished by crash-test scores, as well as a lack of modern, high-tech safety equipment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2017 Journey a five-star rating in its side-impact crash test, but only four stars overall and for the frontal-impact collision. Rollover prevention also is rated four stars, but that’s typical of relatively tall vehicles. The 2018 Journey has been given only a partial crash-test score by the federal government: four stars for frontal impact and rollover. Partial crash-testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety yielded Good scores on side-impact and moderate-overlap frontal tests, but the small-overlaps frontal test for the driver’s side earned a Poor score. Headlights also were rated Poor.</p>, <p>As for safety features, only the Crossover and GT trim levels can be equipped with a rearview camera, and it’s part of a Driver Confidence Group. Even comparatively common safety features, such as blind-spot monitoring, are not available at all. Neither are adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The Journey was not a class-leading product when it was introduced as a 2009 model, and now it’s a dated product. Look for deals on these.</p>, <p>Journey SE ($22,495) has a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive, power windows and locks, 4.3-inch touchscreen audio with USB, three-row seating, and 17-inch steel wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.) Journey AWD SE ($26,895) has the V6 engine and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55138" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-final.jpg" width="200"/>Journey SXT ($25,695) adds appearance upgrades, foglamps, alloy wheels, and body-color mirrors. A greater number of options are available. AWD SXT ($29,195) has the V6 engine and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Journey Crossroad ($27,895) comes with leather/mesh seat upholstery, an 8.4-inch infotainment system, Bluetooth, unpainted cladding, and 19-inch alloy wheels. Options include navigation and rear-seat entertainment. AWD Crossroad ($31,395) gets the V6 engine and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Journey GT ($32,495) has a stiffer suspension, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and comes standard with the V6. A trailer-tow package is optional only for GT. AWD GT ($34,395) gets all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Blacktop Package, available on all except Crossroad trim, includes black roof rails, black mirrors and grille, and 17-inch alloy wheels (19-inch on SXT and GT).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55139" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Dodge Journey looks downright dowdy compared with the latest crossovers, a lingering throwback to the past. Journey SE models are distinctly downscale, with untinted window glass and 17-inch steel wheels with plastic hubcaps. Journey SXT trim moves it up a notch with alloy wheels, LED taillights, body-color mirrors, and foglamps.</p>, <p>The Crossroad relies on more rugged looks, not unlike Subaru rivals, but off-road capabilities are no better than other versions. The chrome roof rails and a body kit jazz up the Crossroad a bit. The bright bars front and rear, intended to suggest skid plates, visually stand out too much.</p>, <p>Measuring a modest 192 inches overall, a Journey might fit into some garages that would be tight for a minivan.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55142" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Versatile and functional, the well-configured Journey cabin falls short on flair. Trailing most rivals, it’s also less spacious than newer crossovers with three rows of seats.</p>, <p>No Journey qualifies as luxurious, by any means. Yet, interior materials are generally good in view of Journey prices. Cloth upholstery in SE and SXT editions feels durable. Easy-clean leather-faced seats are optional on Crossroad and standard for GT. Leather/mesh in the Crossroad is the most enticing choice.</p>, <p>Though it’s contoured, with soft edges and good-looking graining, the dashboard can only be called dull. Crossroad and GT trim brings an 8.4-inch infotainment system that’s delightful to use. Unfortunately, it’s incompatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>Cabin space is decent, for a three-row vehicle of the Journey’s size. Front seats are average, with no height control for the passenger. Two riders fit neatly into the second row, but three will be a squeeze. The bench slides fore/aft, but the seat-folding mechanism trails that of newer crossovers. Children are the best candidates for the third row, which falls short on space.</p>, <p>With both the second and third rows folded flat, cargo space totals 67.6 cubic feet. Raising all seatbacks leaves only 10.7 cubic feet behind the third row. Small-item storage is ample, abetted by under-seat bins in the second-row floor.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55141" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-journey-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Ride comfort is adequate, though quality varies. Standard 17-inch wheels yield the most supple ride, while optional 19-inchers can produce jiggly responses on troubled pavement.</p>, <p>Journeys handle confidently, though all models suffer considerable body lean when cornering. Hydraulic-type power steering feels natural and centers appropriately during highway driving.</p>, <p>Chrysler’s four-cylinder engine isn’t strong enough to propel a two-ton Journey with much vigor, and can feel overmatched when carrying several passengers. The 4-speed automatic is a relic from an earlier era, and deserves to be ditched.</p>, <p>Especially with all-wheel drive, the V6 engine is the wiser choice. Acceleration is strong, but the 6-speed automatic can grow confused at times, especially at low speeds.</p>, <p>Journeys trail the competition on noise and refinement. Both engines emit a rumbling that intrudes into the cabin.</p>, <p>Aged transmissions impair fuel economy, which trails most rivals. Four-cylinder models are EPA-rated at 19/25 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined. With front-drive, V6 models are EPA-rated at 17/25 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. Estimates drop to 16/24/19 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Considering the number of three-row crossover competitors that are way more refined nowadays, the dated Journey’s only real drawing card is its price. Substantial discounts should be available. Even so, standard features are limited, and a Journey feels well behind the times in just about every area.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-buick-enclave/
[<p>Buick Enclave has been fully redesigned for the 2018 model year. In addition to a sizable list of improvements, Buick has introduced a new top-of-the-line version, named Avenir.</p>, <p>Enclave was first launched as a 2008 model, then facelifted for 2013. The all-new 2018 Enclave begins the second generation of Buick’s largest premium crossover. Among the more expressively designed crossover SUVs, the Buick Enclave is related to the Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia.</p>, <p>Buick says the new Enclave is sleeker and more aerodynamic than its predecessor. The wheelbase has grown, the roofline is lower, and the windshield is more angled. Vehicle weight has dropped a little, and use of LED lighting has increased. Buick promises a 10-percent increase in cabin space, including concealed under-floor storage.</p>, <p>In addition to promising a smooth ride, the Enclave’s allure mixes lovely body lines with greatly improved handling. A considerable helping of technology also enters the picture.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55128" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-avenir.jpg" width="200"/>The new Avenir has some unique styling cues, as well as premium-grade materials. A premium suspension with continuously variable, real-time damping is available for the Avenir.</p>, <p>Four trim levels are offered, topped by the new Avenir. Each employs the same powertrain: a robust version of GM’s latest 3.6-liter V6, producing 310 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. A quick-shifting 9-speed automatic is the sole transmission. Enclaves are available with standard front-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. Two all-wheel-drive systems are available: standard and twin-clutch.</p>, <p>Engine output has grown by 22 horsepower, compared to the 2017 model, though torque has declined slightly. Active noise cancellation promises to reduce engine sound to a subtle purr.</p>, <p>A substantial amount of accident-avoidance technology is available. Typically, those safety items are offered in Driver Confidence or Technology packages, for upper trim levels only. Each Enclave has a rearview camera, parking sensors, and a rear-seat reminder. Automatic emergency braking is offered only on higher-cost models.</p>, <p>Safety options include adaptive cruise control and active lane control with lane-departure warning. An available rear camera mirror can expand the field of vision to 300 percent, according to Buick. An optional surround-view camera provides a 360-degree view.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55131" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-models.jpg" width="200"/>Enclave ($39,995) comes standard with front-wheel drive, LED headlights, a power hands-free tailgate, keyless ignition, pushbutton start, heated power front seats, cloth upholstery, three-zone automatic climate control, and 18-inch wheels. Eight-inch touchscreen infotainment includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. (Prices do not include $975 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Essence ($44,215) adds perforated leather seat upholstery, lane-change alert, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. All-wheel drive ($2,000) is additional.</p>, <p>Premium ($48,015) includes 10-speaker Bose audio, ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, front/rear parking sensors, power third-row seats, and forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking. Upgraded twin-clutch all-wheel drive ($2,300) is available.</p>, <p>Avenir ($53,415) has distinct styling touches as well as navigation, wireless charging, a wood-accented steering wheel, a dual moonroof, and 20-inch wheels. Upgraded twin-clutch all-wheel drive ($2,300) is an option.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55132" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Fetching in silhouette, the reworked Enclave no longer suffers from a bottom-heavy appearance. Inclined LED headlights lead the way, flanking a slatted grille that splits into wide wings. The nose is lower and sleeker than before. A metallic bodyside strip carefully defines the Enclave’s side view, drawing attention to its overall shape.</p>, <p>Avenir editions have a unique mesh grille with chrome wings, said to be inspired by concept models. Six-spoke 20-inch Avenir wheels have a pearl nickel finish.</p>, <p>Elegance continues into the rich yet subtle Enclave cockpit, blending technology with tastefulness. The cabin’s fit and finish excels and offers impressive comfort.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55130" height="163" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The standard seats are upholstered in cloth but offer masterful elegance. Other Enclaves upgrade to leather. Avenir models apply leather to the dashboard, console, and door panels. Electronic instruments and display touchscreens appear in an expressive sweep across the dashboard, which also contains buttons and traditional switches. Metallic frames on the air vents overlap each front door, helping to keep the cabin cohesive. Buick’s IntelliLink is among the simpler infotainment interfaces.</p>, <p>Adults in the first and second rows not only get plenty of space, they can expect to be coddled. They also get good head clearance and leg space. Power front seats are supportive and comparatively firm. Firm second-row bucket seats slide fore/aft to expand either leg or cargo space. Even with the optional dual-pane sunroof, headroom is sizable.</p>, <p>The second-row’s right-hand passenger seat pivots to ease access to the third row, which provides ample space. Even six-foot adults can fit comfortably, though the seat is somewhat low.</p>, <p>Cargo space excels. Cargo volume behind the third-row seat totals 23.6 cubic feet, growing to 58 cubic feet with that seat folded away. Though it’s not fully flat, the load floor is vast, with cargo capacity reaching 97.6 cubic when second-row seatbacks are down.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55129" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-enclave-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>With its strong V6, the latest Enclave accelerates quicker and drives better than its predecessor. It even sounds more appealing. Buick estimates 0-60 mph acceleration at 6.4 seconds, with front-wheel drive. Most versions can tow 1500 pounds, 5000 with a towing package.</p>, <p>Shift qualities of the 9-speed automatic, beats some rivals with comparable 9-speed transmissions. Even at low speeds, shifts are never fidgety. Paddle controls are included, along with a semi-manual mode.</p>, <p>Road manners rank as lovely, matched by a well-composed ride. The Enclave suspension yields a suitably taut, firm ride, which never feels jittery. Optional adaptive shock absorbers broaden the range of pavement mastery further yet.</p>, <p>Electric power steering is short on off-center heft, and the sense of on-center accuracy could be better. Regardless, an Enclave steers smartly and predictably. Body lean is well controlled with the standard suspension, helped by firm springs.</p>, <p>Two all-wheel-drive systems are available. Mid-level models get a simple system that uses antilock brakes to control wheelspin. Premium and Avenir AWD twin-clutch systems have a rear differential and can tailor the delivered power.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is significantly improved, yet falls behind some competitors. Front-drive models are EPA-rated at 18/26 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers the estimate to 17/25/20 mpg, well worth it in wintry conditions.</p>, <p>Judged on looks alone, the redesigned Enclave stakes a strong claim on the crossover market. A strong engine and satisfying ride enhance its appeal. Even in base trim, the Enclave is equipped well. Plenty of options are available, including modern advanced safety technology, but most are bundled into packages.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chrysler-pacifica/
[<p>Chrysler Pacifica is the latest word in minivans and is arguably the best in its class, beating standout Honda Odyssey with brilliantly designed foldaway seating.</p>, <p>Way back in the mid-1980s, Chrysler unveiled the first minivan, as a 1984 model. More than three decades later, after the original minivan had gone through several generations, the company developed a modern-day minivan to take the place of the original. Lighter in weight and more efficient than its ancestors, Pacifica was born.</p>, <p>Launched for the 2017 model year, the Pacifica gains a new base L model for 2018. Additional safety features also have been made standard on all 2018 Pacifica models. The Plug-in Hybrid version adds a Touring Plus model. The 2018 Pacifica comes in seven trim levels: L, LX, Touring Plus, Touring L, Touring L Plus, and Limited.</p>, <p>Beneath the Pacifica hood, Chrysler’s 3.6-liter V6 makes 287 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque, driving a 9-speed automatic transmission. All Pacifica models are front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is not available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55122" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Chrysler Pacifica may be the best minivan available for hauling cargo, with a capacity of 140 cubic feet, quickly convertible to people use. And while the Honda Odyssey excels at hauling people, Pacifica does a fine job at that, as well, offering comfortable second-row seats and adult-size third-row seating. Indeed, there is nothing mini about this minivan.</p>, <p>For increased fuel economy, Chrysler also offers a Plug-in Hybrid Pacifica, combining a gasoline engine with an electric motor and 16-kWh lithium-ion battery. Capable of traveling up to 33 miles on electricity alone, the Hybrid gets an EPA equivalent rating of 84 MPGe. Hybrid models lose cargo-carrying ability, however, because the second-row seats don’t fold away.</p>, <p>Developing the Pacifica allowed Chrysler to get away from the familiar, near-boxy profile, turning the basic minivan idea into a sleek family hauler. Pacificas rank highly in safety, flexibility, and utility. They also maintain the minivan’s original mission: to do just about everything well.</p>, <p>Safety is a strong point. Pacificas have scored well in crash-testing. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the 2018 Pacifica five stars overall, and also for both frontal and side impacts. The four-star rating for rollover resistance, a calculated score, is typical for taller vehicles.</p>, <p>All Pacificas are now equipped with a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring, and rear parking sensors. Forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking remain optional, only for certain versions.</p>, <p>In all crash tests performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 2017 Pacifica earned Good scores. Available frontal crash-prevention systems gave it a Superior rating, and the Pacifica was named a Top Safety Pick+.</p>, <p>For certain trim levels, a Technology package combines forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and surround-view cameras. The optional lane-departure warning nudges the vehicle back into its lane, as needed.</p>, <p>Taking a page from the Honda Odyssey, an in-car vacuum cleaner is optional.</p>, <p>The new 2018 Chrysler Pacifica L ($26,995) comes with cloth seats, third-row Stow ‘n Go seating, rearview camera, 17-inch steel wheels, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross path detection, rear parking sensors, Bluetooth, 7-inch touchscreen audio with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,095 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Pacifica LX ($29,795) upgrades with 17-inch alloy wheels, foldaway second-row seats, steering-wheel audio controls, three-zone air conditioning, and a power driver’s seat. Pacifica Touring Plus ($32,595) gets power sliding side doors, a power driver’s seat, three-zone automatic climate control, garage-door opener, alarm, automatic headlights, and remote start.</p>, <p>Pacifica Touring L ($35,495) includes perforated leather seats, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a chrome roof rack. Touring L Plus ($38,695) adds a heated steering wheel and second-row seats, 13-speaker Alpine audio, and wireless streaming.</p>, <p>Pacifica Limited ($43,695) gets hands-free sliding side doors, a hands-free power liftgate, panoramic sunroof, 18-inch wheels, in-car vacuum, power-folding third-row seat, navigation, and real-time-traffic.</p>, <p>Pacifica Hybrid Touring Plus ($39,995) is equipped similar to gas-engine Touring Plus, with power sliding doors, a 7-inch digital display, remote start and a security alarm. Hybrid Touring L ($41,995) gets bright bodyside moldings, perforated leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, and a power liftgate. Hybrid Limited ($44,995) includes hands-free power sliding doors and liftgate, 20-speaker Harman Kardon audio, an upgraded console, and auto-dimming inside mirror.</p>, <p>Suave compared with traditional minivans, Pacifica nevertheless retains that body style’s practical credentials. Topped by a glassy cabin, the sizable Pacifica starts with a slim, sleek nose, ending with a kickup at the rear pillars. Side glass is surrounded by bright metal trim pieces.</p>, <p>Windshield pillars angle slightly inward at the base, helping to make the Pacific appear smaller and narrower, when viewed from the interior. In reality, it’s no smaller than its top rivals: the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55123" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Pacifica’s interior features organic shapes and matte finishes. Lighthearted elements are carefully executed.</p>, <p>Ready to carry up to eight occupants and their gear, the Pacifica shines in flexibility. Unlike the upright rear seats in Odyssey and Sienna, most Pacificas are fitted with foldaway seats, besting the competition in both comfort and utility. The sculpted, stitched dashboard wraps neatly around front passengers.</p>, <p>Front-seat passengers get a panoramic view ahead, with reasonably supportive seats flanking a console with a deep storage bin.</p>, <p>Second-row seats promise sufficient padding and adjustments. In eight-passenger versions, the removable second-row center seat serves as an armrest. We find seven-passenger versions easier to live with. Second-row seats fold easily into the floor; except Hybrid models hold batteries in those spaces, so second-row seats don’t fold away.</p>, <p>Adults fit nicely in the third-row seat, even enjoying ample headroom. Under-leg support is satisfying, too. Rear-seat video entertainment is available.</p>, <p>Cargo volume behind the front seats totals 140.5 cubic feet, dropping to 87.5 cubic feet behind row two, and 32.3 behind the third row.</p>, <p>Outward vision excels, especially in rear-quarter views. Sliding side doors have abundant glass and a relatively low door line.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55124" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-pacifica-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Chrysler’s V6 engine delivers plenty of power to send the Pacifica energetically forward, at a fully appropriate pace.</p>, <p>Crisp performance is complemented by spirited handling and a supple ride. Road behavior ranks at or near the top of the minivan class. In fact, a Pacifica handles far better than most minivan drivers are likely to expect.</p>, <p>A tight body structure helps yield a smooth, controlled, well-damped ride. Comparatively firm springs and dampers yield a composed feel over almost any surface, including harsh, flawed pavement.</p>, <p>Electric power steering has a little heft, and helps the Pacifica track nicely on the highway. Winding roads aren’t a problem, and the steering feels natural as it winds and unwinds. Brakes could stand some improvements, as the pedal feels somewhat stiff, lacking a progressive feel.</p>, <p>A rotary dial controls the transmission, which responds predictably, without the jerkiness or stumbling behavior suffered by some 9-speed units.</p>, <p>Pacificas top the minivan class in fuel economy, though not by much. The 2018 Pacifica is EPA-rated at 18/28 mpg City/Highway, or 22 mpg Combined. The Plug-in Hybrid is EPA-rated at 84 MPGe (equivalent) City, 32 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Indisputably modern, unlike some members of the minivan class, Chrysler’s latest entrant delivers just about every benefit that’s needed. Prices are comparatively high, but the Pacifica ranks as the most flexible minivan on the market. Honda’s recently reworked Odyssey is the only serious contender.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chrysler-300/
[<p>With a heritage dating back to 1955, the Chrysler 300 has long been a rolling legend. The current-generation, full-size four-door sedan was launched as a 2005 model, then mildly reworked for 2011. The 2015 model year brought freshened styling and updated technology, but no major changes since.</p>, <p>New Touring and Touring L trim levels have been added for the 2018 model year. Some trim groups have been revised for 2018. Cloth upholstery is standard on the 2018 Chrysler 300, along with 17-inch wheels. Chrysler’s 5.3-liter V8 is now standard in the 2018 Chrysler 300C.</p>, <p>Classic American styling meets traditional rear-wheel drive in the current Chrysler 300, which may have either a fuss-free V6 engine or a powerful, throbbing Hemi V8. Five trim levels are offered: Touring, Touring L, 300S, 300 Limited, and high-performance 300C. All-wheel drive is an option for all except the 300C.</p>, <p>In all 300 sedans except the 300C and 300S, a 3.6-liter V6 develops 292 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 300-horsepower version of the V6, with a cold-air intake and performance exhaust system, goes into the 300S sedan. Each Chrysler 300 uses an 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Stepping up in performance, the 300C unleashes a 5.7-liter V8 that generates 363 horsepower and 394 pound-feet of torque. In addition to V8 performance, including Sport mode and paddle shifters, the 300C delivers a compelling level of luxury appeal. The abundant standard-feature list includes premium audio, ventilated front seats, natural open-pore wood trim, and stitched Nappa leather upholstery. An analog clock sits on the 300C dashboard.</p>, <p>In recent years, crash-test scores for the Chrysler 300 have fallen behind rival sedans. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2018 model four stars overall, with a four-star rating for some frontal and side impacts. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2017 sedan Good ratings in frontal-impact tests, but Marginal in the small-overlap crash. A Superior rating for frontal impact applied only to cars with a safety-feature option group. Headlights were rated Poor.</p>, <p>Safety features also have not kept up with competitors. All Chrysler 300s have a driver’s knee airbag, rearview camera, and hill-start assist. An option package combines several elements of modern safety technology. Included are forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, active lane control, and adaptive cruise control, as well as automatic high-beam headlights.</p>, <p>Chrysler 300 Touring ($28,995) comes with cloth upholstery, 17-inch wheels, power driver’s seat, 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth audio, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a rearview camera. Rear-wheel drive is standard. AWD Touring ($31,495) has all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Touring L ($28,995) gets leather upholstery, heated power front seats, 18-inch wheels. AWD Touring L ($31,495) has all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>300S ($35,795) gets a 300-horsepower version of the V6, with an option for V8 power. A sport-tuned suspension, Sport mode, paddle shifters, black trim, and 20-inch wheels are standard. AWD 300S ($38,295) has all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Limited ($36,595) comes with perforated leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, Ash Burl wood trim, and 276-watt audio. AWD Limited ($39,095) has all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>300C ($40,995) contains a 5.7-liter V8, perforated and quilted leather, natural-pore wood trim, driver’s memory, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, and 20-inch wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55115" height="103" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-300-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Although its shape might be close to timeless, the Chrysler 300 might be deemed either beautiful or excessively blocky and squared-off. Either way, it flaunts an elegantly upright, if laid-back, silhouette.</p>, <p>Body metal has a brawny but well-tailored, distinguished look, helped by wide, square shoulders. A simple rectangular grille integrates fully into the near-classic profile.</p>, <p>Visually, the 300 hasn’t changed much since introduction as a 2005 model. The crisp long-nose/short-deck design has held up especially well. Exuding an air of sophisticated confidence, it represents a careful blend of angles and rounded corners. Chrysler 300S models get blacked-out body trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55110" height="166" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-traverse-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Richly detailed yet somber in base form, the 300’s cabin gets a warmer, higher-end look in upper models. That’s especially true when fitted with natural wood trim and quilted leather. Designed with organic shapes and smooth curves, the cabin is admirably roomy.</p>, <p>Front passengers get ample head and leg space. Seats with wide bottom cushions and supportive seatbacks are suitable for riders with bigger bodies. Upper-trim models offer particularly good support.</p>, <p>Legroom is skimpier in back, more like a midsize sedan than a full-size. Three moderate-size passengers can occupy the rear seat. Upper trim levels get opulent sport seats that practically cradle one’s body.</p>, <p>Base trim translates to hard plastic trim, but more costly models move up to subdued metallic trim and naturally finished wood. Materials reach a premium pinnacle in 300C and 300S sedans. Excellent infotainment systems interface with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The trunk holds 16.3 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Mature yet athletic in nature, the 300 demonstrates that big cars can handle well, without lacking ride comfort.. Confident and stable, the 300 transmits road conditions to the driver better than most front-drive sedans, though body roll and gentle heaving motions are inevitable.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55117" height="137" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-300-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Base models feel softer and more pliant than their upper-trim counterparts. Sport mode, on 300S and 300C, firms up ride and handling. Twisting roads make it clear that the 300 is a big car, but Chrysler’s electric power steering lightens the effort needed.</p>, <p>For a sedan of this size, the V6 engine delivers wholly sufficient, satisfying power. A V6 version tackles entry ramps without strain, and passing is accomplished with assured briskness.</p>, <p>When in action, the V6 emits a mild rumble. Exhaust sound is more exuberant from the V8, whose power bursts strongly but smoothly into play, accelerating to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds. Paddle shifters for the 8-speed automatic add to the muscular pleasure. Sport mode modifies shift speeds for quicker responses.</p>, <p>The 300S gets a retuned suspension with stiffer springs and firmer bushings, along with quicker steering and 20-inch wheels. Especially with the V8 option, the 300S is fun to drive as well as more tautly composed than its mates.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is satisfying with V6 power, but the V8 is less appealing. With the V6, the 2018 Chrysler 300 is EPA-rated at a reasonably thrifty 19/30 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers the estimate to 18/27/21 mpg. The V8-powered Chrysler 300C (or 300S) is EPA-rated at a less-compelling 16/25 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Chrysler’s big bruiser continues to draw fans of large rear-drive sedans, with or without the bonus of strong V8 power. All models are abundantly equipped, but the upper trim levels are most compelling with their premium leather and natural-finish wood cabin trim. Stately, engaging features keep the rapidly-aging sedan from fading away.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-traverse/
[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Traverse, a full-size crossover, is fully redesigned.</p>, <p>With fresh SUV styling, the 2018 Traverse features a new chassis and a new powertrain with 3.6-liter V6 engine making 310 horsepower.</p>, <p>The engine has all the right stuff: double overhead cams, aluminum block and head, variable valve timing, direct high-pressure fuel injection. Even with 20 more horsepower than the old V6, the new 3.6-liter gets better fuel mileage: 21 Combined miles per gallon with front-wheel drive, versus the previous 18 mpg EPA ratings.</p>, <p>The new chassis adds 2.0 inches to the wheelbase but only 0.7 inch to the length, while dropping 111 pounds overall to tip the scale at 4362 pounds. Chevrolet claims class-leading passenger space for eight people (seven with captain’s chairs), class-leading legroom in the third row, and class-leading cargo volume.</p>, <p>Two new models are added for 2018, Traverse RS, with a new turbocharged 2.0-liter I4 engine, and the luxurious Traverse High Country. Both the I4 and V6 engines use a smooth 9-speed automatic transmission, but only the V6 gets all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Rivals among full-size crossovers include Ford Explorer, Dodge Durango, Mazda CX-9, Honda Pilot, and Nissan Pathfinder.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55105" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-traverse-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Chevrolet Traverse is available in seven models and trims: L, LS, LT Cloth, LT Leather, RS, Premier, and High Country. The stripped L model ($30,925) is mostly for fleet use. The 3.6-liter V6 and 9-speed automatic transmission are standard.</p>, <p>Traverse LS ($33,045) is equipped with premium cloth, three-zone climate control, six USB ports, HID headlights with LED running lights, rearview camera, keyless ignition, 18-inch wheels, 7.0-inch touch screen, Bluetooth, and infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Traverse LT Cloth ($35,545) gets different 18-inch wheels, SiriusXM satellite radio, and power driver/passenger seats. A ($1,795) Convenience and Driver Confidence Package adds remote start, a larger 8.0-inch infotainment screen, heated front seats, blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, and a power liftgate.</p>, <p>Traverse LT Leather ($42,145) includes leather-appointed seats on the first and second rows, 20-inch alloy wheels, surround-view camera system, a 10-speaker Bose stereo, a larger display in the instrument cluster, and an auto-dimming rear-view mirror with Chevy’s trick Rear Camera Mirror. The LT Leather also includes the Convenience and Driver Confidence Package as standard, and adds a navigation function for the 8.0-inch infotainment system.</p>, <p>Traverse Premier ($45,445) adds LED headlights, 20-inch wheels, a memory function for the driver’s seat, a heated steering wheel, vented front seats, and a heated second row. The ($475) Driver Confidence II Package adds active safety systems, including lane departure warnings with active lane control, forward collision warnings with low-speed automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, active front lights. A ($2,495) Redline Edition Package adds a range of sporty, blacked-out options, as well as a panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>Traverse High Country ($53,045) adds a standard twin-clutch all-wheel-drive system, a panoramic sunroof, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, front pedestrian braking, high-speed automatic emergency braking, and upgraded interior materials.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is a ($2,000) option on LS, LT Cloth, LT Leather, and Premier.</p>, <p>All versions of the 2018 Traverse come standard with GM’s latest OnStar technologies. While 4G LTE wifi connectivity gets a lot of attention, Chevrolet’s Teen Driver and Family Link programs will give parents peace of mind. The former delivers reports on a young driver’s on-the-road behavior, while the latter allows parents to set boundaries on things like speed and the volume of the audio system. It also allows parents to set a maximum driving range. The system can also send text and email alerts.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55108" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-traverse-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Chevy designers wanted the Traverse to look like an SUV, not a crossover, and it does. It will fool everyone. It has the lines and shape of a classic Chevy Tahoe, as intended.</p>, <p>But it’s not a truck, it’s a crossover, built on a chassis shared with the Malibu. The truck demeanor is just pretend, and retro to boot: ironically, the previous generation Traverse, unashamedly a big crossover, looked smoother and cleaner, on its rounded lines.</p>, <p>It stands upright, with tall sides. The front is smooth, having a big grille with a gentle shape (unobtrusive black plastic in lower trims, handsome and modest chrome rails in higher trims) and discreet sweeping headlamps, available in Chevy’s D-optic LED design. The nose rolls up to the hood, and down over a black horizontal air intake to the body-colored bumper.</p>, <p>The C-pillar is thick and angled aggressively forward, conveying forward motion. The rear window is pinched at the bottom to give the pillar room to stretch; the corner shape adds to the flow of the shoulder line and roofline.</p>, <p>The straight wraparound rear glass nicely complements the roofline. The slim wraparound red taillamps are high at the shoulder line, which gives the rear end an uplifted look, at the same time creating a blank face that needs to be filled on the tailgate with a ridge and some sharp concavery. If it weren’t for the Chevy bowtie badge on the rear liftgate, it could be almost anything.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55110" height="166" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-traverse-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The cabin is also truck-inspired, so much that it seems to be shouting that it wants to be a Tahoe. The centerstack is high and wide, and meets a big flat dash. The quality of materials is highly dependent on the trim level, but even the LS has attractive plastics with a solid, durable feel, and bits of leather trim on the doors. The range-topping High Country shares some of the same plastic, however it comes with its own rich reddish leather called Loft Brown, which contrasts nicely with the bits of black plastic throughout the cabin. With door panels and dash trimmed in synthetic suede and wood, it’s one of Chevrolet’s best cabins.</p>, <p>The front seats are wide and supportive, and even the LS seats are eight-way power adjustable. We did 250 nonstop miles in an LT Leather model in comfort.</p>, <p>The second row, whether a bench or captain’s chairs, feature GM’s SmartSlide feature, improved for 2018. The bench seat splits and folds, while the curbside captain’s chair flops for easy access to the third row.</p>, <p>In the third row, the legroom is best in class with 33.5 inches, a fraction more than the Ford Explorer with 33.3. The Honda Pilot drops to 31.9 inches and the Nissan Pathfinder to 30.7. We squeezed a large person into the third row, 6-foot-2 and 245 pounds, and he managed to climb back without struggle and found a comfortable position, or so he said. Then we put three smaller persons in the third row, and they complained about lack of legroom. They didn’t want to hear “best in class.”</p>, <p>That made a full eight passengers for a test run, with three more in the second row, complaining about lack of shoulder room. We were glad for the new 310-horsepower V6 engine.</p>, <p>Realistically, it’s a six-adult vehicle. The optional captain’s chairs are four-way adjustable, to make it with more space.</p>, <p>The Traverse offers a ton of cargo space. There’s a vast 23 cubic feet behind the third row, much more than any sedan. With the third row flat it swells to 58.1 cubic feet, as much as some smaller crossovers have with their second row dropped. With both rows flat, it’s a vast 98.2 cubic feet, blowing the Explorer, Pilot and Pathfinder out of the water.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55109" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-traverse-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The new 3.6-liter V6 is much more pleasant than the old 3.6-liter V6. It makes 266 pound-feet of torque to go with its 310 horsepower, and it comes on low for a non-turbo engine, at just 2800 rpm. It’s very lively from a standing start, with an aggressive throttle response, and it’s smooth and linear up into high rpm. It has a new sound, too, deep and resonant under hard acceleration. The powerband is perfect for passing, whether at 45 mph on a two-lane or 65 mph on a freeway.</p>, <p>The 9-speed automatic transmission is also a big improvement. It’s slick and barely noticeable under gentle throttle, then quick-shifting under hard acceleration. Importantly, it’s consistent and the shifts come at predictable times.</p>, <p>If only the steering were as good as the powertrain. It’s heavy, numb on center, and offers little feedback. But something makes the Traverse feel lighter in the corners, so it’s easier to make the corrections demanded by the lifeless steering. That something might be the independent suspension with MacPherson struts in front and five links in rear, trying to make the handling more nimble and predictable.</p>, <p>Still, it handles better than the last Traverse. Nothing like a Mazda CX-9, but it won’t trip over itself in the twisties. The brakes are stouter in 2018, as well.</p>, <p>The Chevy Traverse looks like an SUV, a slightly smaller Tahoe, but it’s really a crossover. We like the new V6, new 9-speed, and new cabin with all its space. If you’ve got a big family, four or five kids, we recommend checking out the Traverse against its many worthy rivals.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-gmc-terrain/
[<p>The 2018 GMC Terrain compact crossover is all new, from the downsized chassis, to the all-turbo/9-speed powertrain, to the new body that moves from macho to mundane. The Terrain is much like the Chevy Equinox, with the same footprint, but sheetmetal that’s sculpted into bold scoops and creases, and bigger fenders.</p>, <p>The compact crossover is a tough class. Terrain competes not only against its near-twin Equinox, but also Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Mazda CX-5, and others. Terrain’s acceleration is smart, its handling sound, and its ride well tuned.</p>, <p>For 2018, the excellent 3.6-liter GM V6 engine gets disappeared. Its 301 horsepower will be missed in a vehicle as heavy as the Terrain, at 3500 pounds. Its replacement is a turbocharged 2.0-liter I4 making 252 horsepower, with vivid acceleration but a big thirst, achieving 24 mpg EPA Combined with fwd, 23 mpg with awd.</p>, <p>The base engine gets retired too. The old one was a 2.4-liter I4 with direct injection, making 180 horsepower and getting 25 mpg. The new one is a turbocharged 1.5-liter making 170 horsepower, but with more torque and fuel mileage of 28 mpg with fwd, 26 mpg with awd.</p>, <p>If the stats of the new engines don’t sound so impressive, look at it this way: the new 252-horsepower I4 gets just 1 less mpg than the old 180-horsepower one.</p>, <p>There’s also a diesel engine that gets better fuel mileage, 32 mpg with either front- or all-wheel drive. It’s entertaining in a grown-up way, but less energetic.</p>, <p>The new 9-speed automatic transmission pairs beautifully with the new engines, but lacks manual control, with audio controls where we wish there were paddle shifters.</p>, <p>GMC Terrain comes as SL, SLE, SLT, and Denali. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive available ($1750) on every model but the SL. The turbocharged 2.0-liter is an option on the Terrain SLE and SLT, and standard on the Denali.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55099" height="135" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-terrain-slt.jpg" width="200"/>Terrain SL ($25,990) is equipped with premium cloth, power features, active noise cancellation, air conditioning, cruise control, keyless ignition, 17-inch wheels, 3.5-inch digital display between the gauges, and rearview camera. There is a 7.0-inch touchscreen for audio, OnStar and in-car data hardware, two USB ports, and auxiliary jack, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Terrain SLE ($28,815) adds dual-zone automatic climate control. A trailer-tow package is an option on the SLE with the 2.0-liter turbo engine.</p>, <p>Terrain SLT ($32,315) gets leather seats and an 8.0-inch touchscreen, satellite radio, blind-spot monitors, a 110-volt power outlet, remote start, power driver seat, heated front seats, panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>Denali ($38,515) adds a handsfree tailgate, a power passenger front seat, HD radio, seven-speaker audio, navigation, 19-inch wheels, LED headlamps, and a bundle of safety equipment including forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors, lane-departure warnings, and rear parking sensors. The forward-collision warning bundle remains an option, as are surround-view cameras and automatic park assist. So are wireless smartphone charging, ventilated front seats, and heated rear seats.</p>, <p>The turbodiesel is available in SLE and SLT trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55098" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-terrain-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The styling of the previous Terrain was almost Hummer-like, with its edges and flat panels. The all-new Terrain smoothes most of them away, to a place where character gets blurred. It’s neither attractive nor distinctive, on the road it’s just another crossover.</p>, <p>The large grille is either a fat oval with chopped edges, or a big rectangle with chopped corners. It looks way better in black, like on the base SL, than with chrome, like the Denali. In fact it looks horrendous in the way GM does the chrome. The SL also has matte black plastic running the bottom perimeter of the car, front and rear fascia plus over the wheels and under the doors. It gives the Terrain some rugged purpose, and looks better than the Denali’s barely-flared metal fenders, although the Denali’s 19-inch painted alloy wheels smartly fill the wheelwells. The SL is cleaner, absent the Denali’s strip of chrome trim along the doors and over the window line.</p>, <p>The headlamps are shaped like the simplest bare-hand puppet, forefinger curved over the thumb, each facing center. They don’t grab you. Except if you imagine them yakking at each other over the top of the grille.</p>, <p>The rear end is shaped like midsize GMC Acadia but better looking.</p>, <p>Just for effect, that doesn’t work, the rear window is pinched, asymmetrically, and blacked out in back, continuing onto a wide band of black across the rear pillar. It’s supposed to flow, which it does about as much as painting a wide stripe on a box.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55097" height="186" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-terrain-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The all-new Terrain loses some inches in the wheelbase, length, and width, but still has about the same seating space as the Ford Escape and Toyota Rav4. Base vehicles have cloth seats with manual adjustment, while the leather has more bolstering, ventilation, and power adjustment. They’re good for long hours in the saddle, as long as you’re not too tall, as the driver’s seat lacks the enough support under the legs. The seating position is lower than before, which makes the Terrain feel less SUV-like.</p>, <p>The cabin isn’t cohesive, it looks like three separate zones, although it can come together with leather in a warm color, and aluminum trim. Compared to the Equinox, the materials are softer and it’s quieter, with more sound insulation under the floor. But the door panels have big chunks of the same plastic that composes most of the buttons on the instrument panel. This shouldn’t happen on an SUV in this price range.</p>, <p>The standard infotainment system is lovely and simple, with a 7.0-inch screen and big icons. The display is clear, bright, responsive, fast, and doesn’t drop its smartphone connection. But mostly it’s clean, without too many features or too much information.</p>, <p>There is ample small storage in the cabin, with a deep console double door pockets. There’s a special slot for a cellphone for the front passenger. In the rear cargo area, there are bins under the floor.</p>, <p>The downsizing is felt more in the rear than the front; legroom has decreased a tiny amount, from 39.9 inches to 39.7, but it feels like more since the second-row seat doesn’t slide any more. The available panoramic sunroof cuts 1.6 inches from headroom, in front as well. The rear passengers will appreciate tall doors, so there’s less ducking to climb in, but the they won’t appreciate the flat seat bottoms, even in leather.</p>, <p>The seats fold but not quite flat, to provide 63.3 cubic feet of cargo space, way less than the Honda CR-V. Behind the rear seats there is 29.6 cubic feet, again less than the Honda. The good news is the front passenger seat folds flat, like the Honda Fit, to provide room for long things from 2x4s to kayaks. An optional liftgate opens at the wave of a foot, to make loading those things easier.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55096" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-terrain-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-terrain-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-terrain-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The base engine, a turbocharged 1.5-liter I4, feels refined and quiet. It makes 170 horsepower and a strong 203 pound-feet of torque that comes at low revs, reaching its max at 2000 rpm. That gives it gutsy acceleration and the ability to push the 3500-pound Terrain around with some authority. The 9-speed automatic helps in this challenge, while the Equinox struggles with a 6-speed.</p>, <p>The transmission itself is smoother than other 9-speeds (Chrysler and Mercedes come to mind), but the method of shifting gears with a switch on the console, which is almost out of reach, is a what-were-they-thinking moment–more than a moment, it’s a lifetime with the car. And the notion of audio controls in the place of paddleshifters is one of the worst GM ideas since the Aztek.</p>, <p>The transmission pairs brilliantly with the new 252-hp 2.0-liter turbo that felt strong during our quick runs in the Appalachians, like it were capable of zero to sixty miles per hour in about 7.5 seconds. With 260 pound-feet of torque, it pumps out steady power and a cool whistling turbo sound as it climbs through the gears. If only it had a usual manual control, namely paddle shifters, we’d be comparing it to the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine of the Ford Escape, the benchmark for thrust and eagerness. Manual shifting would also be useful for towing, a likely prospect since this engine is rated to tow 3500 pounds.</p>, <p>Ironically, surprisingly, the new 1.6-liter turbodiesel can only tow 1500 pounds, same as the base 1.5-liter. Diesel torque aside, it only makes 137 horsepower. It’s heavier, slower, and vibrates a lot. It’s more expensive and only comes with a 6-speed transmission. It’s not worth the extra 9 mpg, at least not to us.</p>, <p>The optional all-wheel-drive is a part time, activated by a knob on the console, with different traction modes. It’s mechanically simpler, without a brain to self-activate.</p>, <p>The Terrain’s ride is biased more toward comfort than cornering. The ride only reveals its compact crossover nature with the sharpest of bumps. The suspension is same as before, struts in front and four links in rear, but the old hydraulic rack-and-pinion steering is replaced by electric power assist.</p>, <p>With the standard 17-inch wheels and tires, the handling is poised and predictable, if not very enthusiastic. But it helped us avoid six deer and two washed-out roads, during our seat time. The Denali has a higher state of suspension tune and 19-wheel wheels with better all-season tires. It tracks true but still doesn’t offer much feedback.</p>, <p>GMC Terrain is all new for 2018, a compact crossover SUV.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-accord/
[<p>The 2018 Honda Accord is all new, more upscale and more refined. Built around a new chassis that utilizes more high-strength steel, it’s wider and lower than before, and it looks more substantial. Inside, it’s roomier and quieter.</p>, <p>There are two new turbocharged four-cylinder engines, with a hybrid version available late in the model year. Gone is the brilliant, smooth, longtime V6 (though it remains in other Honda products).</p>, <p>The new engines deliver adequate performance, but it’s the handling and ride that make the new Accord stand out.</p>, <p>The new sedan brings a Honda-made 10-speed automatic, soft leathers, wood dash accents, interior noise cancellation, LED headlamps, advanced safety features, and a slick 8.0-inch touchscreen on every model but the base LX.</p>, <p>The standard Accord LX still offers a lot. It uses a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, mated to a continuously variable transmission, to bring a 33 Combined miles per gallon EPA rating, 38 mpg Highway. The ride is composed, the cabin is quiet, and there’s good rear legroom. A six-speed manual transmission is available for no cost.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55090" height="126" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-accord-sport.jpg" width="200"/>Sport models get upgraded equipment and appearance features.</p>, <p>The popular EX and EX-L models get upgraded upholstery, bigger wheels, and better audio. The Accord Touring model with adaptive suspension feels upscale, almost feels like a luxury car, and is enjoyable to drive on a winding road.</p>, <p>The upgrade engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four cylinder making 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. The 10-speed automatic is standard, a 6-speed manual available.</p>, <p>HondaSensing, standard on every model, includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, and adaptive cruise control. LED headlamps are standard.</p>, <p>The Accord Hybrid is expected in early 2018, beginning its third generation. Honda’s hybrid system is different than the others, using its internal combustion engine to power a generator that feeds two 181-hp electric motors that power the wheels. The engine is a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder making 143 horsepower, to make a total horsepower of 212 when combined with the electric motors. Compact batteries are relocated under the seat. We’ve had some seat time in prototypes, and the powerplant felt seamless.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55089" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-accord-touring.jpg" width="200"/>Models are the LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring. The 1.5-liter engine is standard. The 2.0-liter engine is available in Sport, EX-L, and Touring.</p>, <p>Accord LX ($24,445) gets a 7.0-inch screen. All other models get the 8.0-inch with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Standard equipment includes 17-inch wheels, cloth upholstery, Bluetooth connectivity, a 7.0-inch driver information display buried into the instrument cluster, and a USB port for charging and audio. Plus the advanced safety features.</p>, <p>Sport adds 19-inch wheels, chrome exhaust tips, spoiler, leather-wrapped steering wheel, power-adjustable driver’s seat, 8.0-inch touchscreen, synthetic leather inserts in the cloth seats, and foglights.</p>, <p>EX gets heated seats, satellite radio, upgraded cloth upholstery, moonroof, blind-spot monitors, another USB port, and a chrome grille.</p>, <p>EX-L brings leather accents, power-adjustable front seats, 10-speaker premium stereo, and optional navigation.</p>, <p>Touring offers heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, a head-up display, navigation, wireless cellphone charging and one-touch Bluetooth connectivity, and paddle shifters.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55087" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-accord-rear.jpg" width="200"/>With its classic profile and contemporary edges, the 2018 Accord is one of the best-looking cars in its class. If it was thought to be frumpy before, it’s not now. The design isn’t over-wrought. During our test drives, we’ve noticed people watching it.</p>, <p>We prefer the body-colored grille to the chrome version.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55088" height="188" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-accord-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Some of the interior trim packages make the cabin feel dark. The base cloth is handsome but seems thin.</p>, <p>The 8.0-inch touchscreen, taken from the Honda Odyssey minivan, sits atop the dash, eliminating the need to have dash material behind it. The display is sharp and the maps are easy to understand. Roads and icons are bright and clear. It’s easy to swipe and scroll. The infotainment system is a bit confusing at first, but it’s learned fast.</p>, <p>We found the new Accord supremely comfortable, for four people.</p>, <p>Five works only for short periods. The outboard rear seats are deep, with a hump in the middle. The rear seats are nearly 1 inch lower than before, but the doors open wider. The increased wheelbase allows more legroom in the rear, more than 40 inches, enough for a six-foot-tall person. The increase in width doesn’t seem to bring shoulder space, though.</p>, <p>The driver’s seat is 1 inch lower, gaining headroom in front. The front seats are taller and have more bolstering.</p>, <p>Standard active noise cancellation uses a microphone in the rear of the car to redact road noise. All but the LX have wheel resonators, a piece of material wrapped around the center of the wheel, that swallow tire noise.</p>, <p>The trunk is massive and holds 16.7 cubic feet, with a wider opening than on the previous generation.</p>, <p>The Hybrid, with its batteries now moved out of the trunk and under the rear seat, holds about the same as the standard models. The rear seats split and fold, opening up to the trunk to create big cargo-carrying flexibility.</p>, <p>Back by popular (buyers’) demand, there is a hard knob for tuning and scrolling on the radio, in addition to the volume knob. Other buttons for common functions flank the touchscreen. We’ve found this setup easy to use, and vastly superior to the previous Honda design that used touchscreen controls.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55091" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-accord-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-accord-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-accord-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The base engine, powering 80 percent of all Accords, is a 1.5-liter turbo four making 192 horsepower and 192 pound-feet of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or CVT. It’s strong on power at low revs, not so much at the top. We recommend the CVT, because the manual takes work to keep the Accord on the bubble.</p>, <p>The available 2.0-liter turbo four comes from the Civic Type R hatchback, but it’s a bit less aggressive in the horsepower, 252 hp and 273 pound-feet of torque. It’s quick, smooth and flexible. The 2.0-liter uses either a 10-speed automatic from the Odyssey van or a 6-speed manual from the Type R.</p>, <p>The 10-speed with paddle shifters works very well. The gear selector is on the console, a series of buttons that has become a standard design on Honda and Acura cars. They take some getting used to, but the buttons are shaped differently and look different and become easier to use with familiarization. A traditional shifter is quicker going from Drive to Reverse and back, however, because you don’t have to look at it.</p>, <p>With the manual, the clutch pedal is very light, and its engagement lengthy and late; and the throws on the shifter are long.</p>, <p>It also uses electric power steering system with ratios that adjust for the situation, for example it quickens when the driver turns it quickly. Out on the freeway, when there’s less turning, the steering is slower. It is well weighted, a big improvement over the previous Accord, precise, confident.</p>, <p>The suspension is basic front strut and rear multi-link, with fluid-filled bushings for a smoother ride. It’s more communicative than you might expect. Top models get adaptive dampers with modes, as in the Civic Si and Type R. They make the Accord feel composed and confident on challenging roads, while being relaxed when the road calls for it. The Sport gets 19-inch wheels that reduce the comfort of the ride.</p>, <p>The new Honda Accord delivers standout handling and a smooth ride, a comfortable cabin with intuitive controls, elegant looks. It’s loaded with safety features and delivers good fuel economy.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with NCTD editor Mitch McCullough reporting from New York and New Jersey, and staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The rear-wheel-drive BMW 6 Series is a luxury cruiser available in a choice of body styles. The four-door 6 Series Gran Coupe and two-door Convertible continue unchanged for 2018. The two-door Coupe has been discontinued. There’s also a luxurious Alpina B6 Gran Coupe and a high-performance M6 versions of the Gran Coupe and Convertible.</p>, <p>The 6 Series Grand Coupe and Convertible were facelifted for 2016, but the current generation traces back six years.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55075" height="109" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-6-granturismo.jpg" width="200"/>A new four-door Gran Turismo joins the 6 Series, but it’s related more closely to the 5 Series than it is to the other 6 Series models.</p>, <p>The 6 Series offers a choice of drivetrains: Base engine in the BMW 640i is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder making 315 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque, enabling it to accelerate from zero to sixty in a quick 5.3 seconds. The engine in the BMW 650i is a 4.4-liter V8 making 445 horsepower and 480 pound-feet of torque, enabling it to accelerate from zero to sixty in a super quick 4.3 seconds. Both engines use an 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The M6 uses a 4.4-liter twin turbo V8 that can go 186 miles per hour with the Competition Package. A 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is standard, but a six-speed manual gearbox is available. Imagine that. Imagine it in the convertible. Doesn’t get much cooler than that.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive, which BMW calls xDrive, is available. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the 6 Series.</p>, <p>The BMW 640i gets an EPA-rated 21/30 miles per gallon City/Highway, 24 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The 6 Series hasn’t been crash tested, and won’t be because of the price and low volume; but it’s safe to assume it’s safe. And there’s much available safety equipment, including forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking at city speeds, blind spot monitors, surround-view camera system, lane departure warnings, night vision cameras with pedestrian detection, and active steering assistants.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55076" height="111" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2018-6-convertible.jpg" width="200"/>The 640i Gran Turismo ($69,700), 640i Gran Coupe ($81,400), and 640i Convertible ($86,700) come with the I6. Standard equipment includes leather seats, dark wood trim, 18-inch wheels, adaptive LED headlamps, 10-way power adjustable front seats, keyless ignition, WiFi hotspot capability, rearview camera, and iDrive, an infotainment interface with 10.2-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>The 650i Gran Coupe ($93,000) and 650i Convertible ($98,300) come with the V8 engine. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination.)</p>, <p>All-wheel drive xDrive is standard in the Gran Turismo ($69,700) and Alpina B6 ($124,300) and available with other models ($3000).</p>, <p>Options include the M Sport package that adds 19-inch wheels and high performance tires, black brake calipers, LED fog lamps, and Alcantara headliner.</p>, <p>M6 Gran Coupe ($119,800) and M6 Convertible ($122,300) feature 560-hp performance.</p>, <p>The 6 Series is evocative. It’s low-slung and wide-shouldered, athletic and confident, yet still somehow understated. The nose creases tightly into the nine-slat kidney grille, flanked by bold headlamps and big air intakes. A taut and finely rendered hood reaches upward over the sleek windshield to the arching roofline. Its elegant curves and flared fenders lower the window line, at least to the eye. The rear is sleek, simple, and modestly tucked.</p>, <p>The powerful M6 is quite subtle in its changes, mostly a body kit and badging. If it were parked beside a 650i you could see a difference, but otherwise you’d pretty much have to look for the badging.</p>, <p>There cabin is business-like, seems almost stark. But it can border on exotic, with white leather and fine woods.. It’s well appointed, both low-key and high-tech, but ruled by order and restraint; rich muted shades of many available materials, textures and colors. The plastics and leather present a visual and tactile sensation. It can be made as bright and plush as the 7 Series.</p>, <p>There’s room to stretch up front, with power seats that adjust in many ways and directions. The M Sport package offers multi-function sport seats with more support in the backrest and thighs.</p>, <p>Even though it’s a four-door, the Gran Coupe is more suited for two people. In the rear, legroom is tight and headroom is low, because of the sloping sensuous roofline. Taller passengers will have to duck to climb in and out, and buckle their knees once they’re seated. For four occupants, the 5 Series or 7 Series is the way to go. Maybe the new Gran Turismo with a stretched interior will change that. We haven’t driven it yet.</p>, <p>The GT might also have more cargo space, although the Gran Coupe’s trunk is big, at 16.2 cubic feet. Convertibles have 12.3 cubic feet the top up and 10.5 with it down.</p>, <p>The Convertible’s back seat is best for kids on a fairly short top-down ride. But it has the best convertible top in the business. The folding fabric top raises or lowers in 20 seconds at 25 mph, and stows under a metal lid. It’s well insulated, and the glass rear window can be opened like the old convertibles that used a zipper around canvas that always shrunk and stuck the zipper. People would drive around with their convertible rear window permanently flopped down, and rainwater would make pools that would slosh into the rear seat if the driver put on the brakes too hard.</p>, <p>These are better days. The BMW convertible top looks way classy. As long as it’s not blue. No hardtop convertible needed.</p>, <p>The 6 Series is quick and sporty. The BMW 640i turbo six-cylinder performs competently in its class. Its 8-speed automatic transmission gets the most from its 315 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque. The engine gets most of its torque down low, at about 1700 rpm, and overcomes any doubt that the 3.0-liter engine might be breathless under acceleration. Actually, if it feels breathless, it’s at the top end. It’s been carrying the 4500 pounds of the car for a while, by then.</p>, <p>The BMW 650i is quicker and sportier. The twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8’s 445 horsepower is impressive, but it’s the 480 pound-feet of torque that makes us swoon. It’s one of our favorite engines. The 650i has a confident gas pedal. The turbochargers are seamless from 2000 rpm all the way up to 7000 rpm redline. The 650i’s linear power and symphonic bellow make winding roads enjoyable.</p>, <p>The 650i already weighs 264 pounds more than the 640i, so adding another 100 pounds for all-wheel drive might not be the best thing. We’re inclined to suggest that if you need all-wheel drive, go for the 640i, because it’s lighter and should be more nimble.</p>, <p>By most measurements now, the 6-Series is the Bavarian grand tourer, not a razor sharp sports car, or brawny muscle machine, and having plenty of passing power is part of the program.</p>, <p>The 6 Series handles with confidence, with steering sharp as a knife but not sharp as a razor. The suspension is firm, but tuned more for comfort than track days. The ride is so smooth that it begs for effortless high speeds. However with Driving Dynamics Control there are Comfort, Sport, and Sport+ modes to set suspension, steering, throttle and transmission response. The range of adjustments is almost astonishing, changing the 6 Series from cruiser to canyon carver.</p>, <p>But even the 650i is a step or two away from the M6, which turbo-boosts the 4.4-liter V8 to 560 horsepower and 500 pound-feet of torque. Its 7-speed dual-clutch transmission handles the burst of thrust that comes on at 1700 rpm. A 6-speed manual gearbox can be ordered for the same price. You’re not likely to find one on a showroom floor. We absolutely love the idea of an M6 convertible with big shift lever coming up out of the floor. Can you get one with a front bench seat?</p>, <p>The M6 uses an electronically-controlled limited-slip differential, 20-inch wheels, and firmer suspension settings than the 650i. But it still makes compromises for comfort, and the steering can feel a little numb when canyon carving. So for track days it’s the Competition Package, with a stiffer suspension and quicker steering. It also adds 40 horsepower and 30 mph to the top speed. A BMW driver’s training course comes with it. Excellent idea.</p>, <p>The brakes are plenty strong, but if you do track days, you might consider spending nearly $10,000 more, for ceramic brakes that don’t fade. They can be grabby when cold or around town, and ungodly expensive to service, but hey: if you want to run with the big dogs.</p>, <p>If a BMW 6 is what you want, there’s no reason not to buy one. It will fulfill your expectations. For its different missions, it has the correct highly engineered powertrain. The cabin is perfectly BMW. Its styling is classic elegant. But you must take a look at the Gran Turismo.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-audi-r8/
[<p>The mid-engine all-wheel-drive Audi R8 came on the scene in 2008, sharing structures with the Lamborghini Gallardo. R8 was developed from the racing cars that won Le Mans and other international sports car endurance races. It needed that pedigree to compete against cars like the McLaren 650S, Mercedes-Benz AMG GT, Porsche 911 Turbo and Corvette Z06. And now the new Lexus LC 500 and Acura NSX.</p>, <p>Since then, the R8 has gotten better, while enhancing its civility and capability as a daily driver, with a supple ride and fully finished cabin. The 2017 model year began its second generation, restyled and with a new platform built on the Modular Sportscar System (MSS) that’s under the Lamborghini Huracan. It’s an aluminum monocoque spaceframe that uses carbon fiber in the firewall and backbone tunnel for torsional rigidity, aided by two big X-shaped engine braces, over and behind the engine. The new chassis was 70 pounds lighter, as well as stiffer.</p>, <p>For 2018, R8 gets a new Audi Sport badge on the front fascia. The 2018 R8 V10 Plus has LED headlamps with the distinctive Audi laser design. There’s a new optional appearance package called Black Optic, with a dark interior, dark exterior accents, and 20-inch wheels. The interior inlays in all 2018 Audi R8 models get a bit darker.</p>, <p>Audi R8 comes as a Coupe or Spyder convertible.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55069" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-r8-coupe.jpg" width="200"/>Two versions of the 5.2-liter V10 engine are offered, the standard one making 540 horsepower and 398 pound-feet of torque, while the V10 Plus makes 610 hp and 413 lb-ft. Both engines are mated to an S Tronic 7-speed dual clutch transmission. Audi invented the dual-clutch automatic manual transmission in its early racecars, and remains the leader in the technology.</p>, <p>The R8 can be so mild a granny could drive it (in Comfort mode), but in Dynamic Mode it flies, from zero to sixty in 3.5 seconds. The V10 Plus takes just 3.2 seconds, using Launch Control to keep the tires from spinning.</p>, <p>It rates 17 miles per gallon EPA Combined, with the engine using deactivation down to five cylinders, and port injection, which efficiently manages the throttle mixture.</p>, <p>It hasn’t been crash tested because the NHTSA and IIHS don’t destroy expensive low-volume cars, but R8 offers race heritage and a monocoque chassis, not to mention extra airbags in the doors and roof.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi R8 Coupe ($164,900) and R8 Spyder ($177,100) come with a 540-hp V10. V10 Plus models feature a 610-hp engine.</p>, <p>R8 comes standard with Nappa leather upholstery, black Alcantara headliners, heated power sport seats, LED interior lighting, Audi’s MMI Plus with Navigation infotainment system, magnetic ride damper control, and 19-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>R8 V10 Plus adds LED headlamps, racing bucket seats and carbon ceramic brakes, and replaces the high-tech magnetic ride dampers with plain old shocks and springs, because they are stiffer. Racy options include active dynamic steering with variable assist and variable ratios, and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Because the design has been around for 10 years, it’s hard to still say it has supercar styling, but it does. It holds up and it’s not dated. It still looks sleek, smooth and not edgy. The restyling for 2017 kept it looking young.</p>, <p>The profile is low and markedly cab forward, the coupe roof arcing from the windshield to the carbon-fiber rear spoiler that raises at speed. In 2017 it was widened by 1.6 inches at the shoulders, and the horizontal lines were tweaked to make it look longer. The two-piece carbon-fiber side blades serve as air intakes.</p>, <p>The grille is a flat and wide three-dimensional trapezoid that flows into wedge-shaped LED headlamps. At the rear, LED taillamps match the shape of the headlamps.</p>, <p>The V10 Plus also has carbon-fiber front and rear diffusers and black exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>The cabin is small but comfortable, and roomy enough for two people in front, but there isn’t much storage space. Even the front trunk is only big enough for a couple of overnight bags.</p>, <p>The fit and finish is impeccable, and the materials are the usual high Audi quality. In fact, the R8 interior is among the finest in its class.</p>, <p>The sport seats are comfortable and supportive, with adjustable bolstering. The racing leather bucket seats in the V10 Plus are thinner, and thus allow more legroom, but the seatbacks don’t adjust. Both seats are fairly upright, affording good visibility through the windshield. Rearward visibility is poor because of the steep low roofline.</p>, <p>The V10 Plus has leather seats and dashboard, carbon fiber trim, aluminum pedals, and an Alcantara headliner. The stitching on the doors and dashboard is in black and the color of the body.</p>, <p>Audi’s new virtual cockpit uses a 12.3-inch screen in the instrument panel that keeps most of the controls directly in front of the driver, also the steering-wheel switches. The screen is configurable to the information the driver chooses to see, while a button on the steering wheel allows viewing of things like the Google Earth navigation.</p>, <p>The virtual cockpit can still be controlled by the MMI on the center console, but passengers can’t access the sound system. Also, the screen is easy to see but in some cases it only shows one function at a time, so for example you can’t multi-task with navigation and radio.</p>, <p>With Audi’s Dynamic Select modes, the character of the car is flexible and versatile. In Comfort or Auto, it’s relaxed and very easy to drive. In Dynamic or Performance (which shuts off the traction control) mode, the R8 is ready for the track, ready for a top speed of 199 mph for the V10 and 205 mph for the V10 plus. In Dynamic mode, the throttle response is quicker and so are the gearshifts; the dual-clutch transmission also holds the R8 in each gear for a longer time.</p>, <p>The S Tronic dual-clutch gearbox makes shifts that are perfect for everyday driving. There’s always power to spare, linear and constant, not arriving with a burst, like a turbocharged or supercharged car.</p>, <p>The V10 has plenty of reserve power. Unlike a turbocharged engine, the R8’s V10 delivers smooth, linear grunt through the entire rev range. It’s easy to hit the automaker’s 0-62 mph estimate of 3.2 seconds for the V10 Plus and 3.5 seconds for the standard R8 thanks to the standard launch control system.</p>, <p>The acceleration from 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds will push your eyeballs back into your skull. They will pop back out onto your cheeks when you hammer the brake pedal with the optional big carbon ceramic brakes. They demand a light touch on the street; in fact, we think they’re too sharp for the street.</p>, <p>There is a sailing mode eliminates engine braking at low speeds in Comfort mode. We like the feature because it rewards smooth driving, and lets the driver think for himself.</p>, <p>The available active dynamic steering is quick and precise, but too light for us.</p>, <p>Turning into a corner, the response is quick. If you enter a turn too quickly the R8 will understeer, and if you accelerate too hard through the turn it will oversteer, even in all-wheel drive, which raises the cornering limits. So it’s not idiot-proof. But the good news is it’s forgiving, maybe thanks to the all-wheel drive sending power to the front wheels to get the driver out of trouble. And the grip of the Pirelli P Zero tires is awesome, enough to give idiots extra room. Of course, even the best grip does not go on forever, so when the P Zeros say enough is enough, it’s possible to come to grief, but still not likely, as the R8 recovers with neutrality and obedience.</p>, <p>The Audi R8 stays strong in the game with McLaren, Mercedes, Porsche, Corvette, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and the discontinued Viper. Great seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. The 5.2-liter V10 is well developed.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi TT, in the third year of its third generation, is a sophisticated all-wheel-drive sports car with the right stance, styling and handling. It’s quick and nimble when it needs to be, and relaxed at the right time. It’s called a four-seater, but it’s more like a 2+2 Coupe, or a Roadster with small shelf in back.</p>, <p>For 2018 there is a new model, a hotrod called the TT RS, packing a 400-horsepower turbocharged five-cylinder engine under its hood and a paddle-shifting 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The RS rides lower, corners on a magnetic suspension, stops with 14.6-inch front brake discs and 8-piston calipers, and its quattro all-wheel-drive has been tuned for the mission. It accelerates from zero to sixty in a phenomenal 3.7 seconds, as quick as any old 600-horsepower V8.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55059" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tt-roadster.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tt-roadster.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tt-roadster-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The standard Audi TT engine is a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder with direct injection, making 220 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 6-speed S-tronic dual-clutch transmission. Audi basically invented the dual-clutch, which has the gears of a manual transmission, but acts like an automatic, only sharper. The TT accelerates from zero to sixty in 5.3 seconds, quick enough to be thrilling.</p>, <p>The Audi TTS adds boost to the turbo four to make 292 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque, accelerating to sixty in 4.6 seconds, a thrill and a half. The TTS gets a magnetic suspension, bigger brakes and cooler wheels.</p>, <p>The TT is EPA-rated at 26 miles per gallon Combined, the TTS gets 25 mpg.</p>, <p>The quattro all-wheel drive is the Haldex clutch-pack system that’s front-wheel-drive based, and responds to not only acceleration and traction but also steering inputs from the new variable ratio rack. The TT also has Audi Drive Select, with modes that allow the drive to select the level of response from the throttle, transmission, steering and stability control.</p>, <p>For the 2016 redesign, Audi developed a new body structure with a low center of mass, using high-strength steel in the floor and firewall to supplement the aluminum that saves weight.</p>, <p>A rearview camera comes standard. Active safety features are available, including the system that’s intended to keep the car in the absolute center of its lane. We find lane-keeping assist features bothersome.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55060" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tt-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Audi TT comes as a coupe or roadster. Audi TT Coupe ($43,950) and Audi TT Roadster ($47,450) come standard with automatic climate control; tilt/telescoping steering column; power features; ambient interior lighting; leather; 12-way power front seats with heating, Audi’s MMI infotainment system; Audi’s virtual cockpit programmable instrument cluster; a nine-speaker audio system; HD and satellite radio; Bluetooth; keyless entry; a rearview camera; front and rear parking sensors (new for 2018); a drive mode selector; automatic LED headlights; LED taillights; an adaptive rear spoiler; and 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Audi TTS ($52,950) and TT RS ($64,900) only come as coupes. Audi TTS Coupe ($52,950) adds leather and Alcantara seats, magnetic ride suspension, larger brakes, and 19-inch wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>A Technology package for the TT and TTS features a Bang &amp; Olufsen surround-sound audio system with 12 speakers and 680 watts of power, navigation, blind-spot monitors, a smartphone interface, and Audi Connect wife hotspot capability with access to apps, social media, and weather, fuel prices, and other information.</p>, <p>New for 2018 is the S line Competition package with high gloss exterior accents, brushed aluminum door sills and inlays, red brake calipers, S line sport suspension, leather and Alcantara sport seats with S line embossing, and a flat-bottom S line steering wheel.</p>, <p>Also new for 2018 is the TTS model’s Exclusive Interior package that includes Nappa leather, S embossed front seats with diamond stitching and extended leather trim and controls.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55061" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tts-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tts-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tts-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Audi TT has been around more than 20 years, and in that time has evolved from round and funky to round, sleek, and powerful. From cute to awesome. Others have evolved toward roundness, because it is aerodynamic. So the first funky TT was a pioneering leader. Maybe not iconic like the upside-down-bathtub Porsche, but still distinctive.</p>, <p>The TT has tucked-in overhangs and softly chiseled edges. It looks like a smaller version of the sensational R8 supercar. Its shoulders and creases, but especially its face, the wide-mouthed black grille, LED matrix headlamps.</p>, <p>The cabin feels radical, with a swoopy padded dash that envelopes the driver and hangs over the passenger’s legs like an aircraft wing. The whole cabin feels aerospacey. You can find jet engines in the round vents on the black dash panel, for example. If you’re looking for them. At the center of the vents are climate control buttons that press and twist.</p>, <p>The piped-in sound track from the engine reminds you it’s not a jet. The cabin materials bring you up to first class, they are high quality, goes without saying with Audi.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55062" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-ttrs-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The interior is purposeful, functional, and roomy (for a sports car) in front, with decent legroom and good adjustability in the driver’s seat. The front seats have good lateral support for the thighs and good bolstering for the back. In the coupe, the rear passengers’ legs will be buckled and heads might hit the hatchback glass.</p>, <p>The interface is Audi Virtual Cockpit, using a 12.3-inch high-contrast screen displaying three different gauge layouts, including a performance version. The driver chooses his gauge display with a “view” button on the steering wheel.</p>, <p>Most of Virtual Cockpit is controlled or not by voice command, steering-wheel switchgear, and a touch pad on the center console for MMI. A Navigation Plus package adds Audi Connect, with an embedded LTE data connection and Google Earth map displays, as well as Facebook- and Twitter-integrated interfaces. It also offers a search function that lets you input free text, scanning everything from navigation destinations to phone contacts to songs to podcasts.</p>, <p>Virtual cockpit offers passengers no physical control over audio or other functions. But there’s always voice command. Good luck with that.</p>, <p>The cabin materials and trim are bold, for example the flamboyant Express Red or Palomino Brown leather to choose over plain black or gray. There’s also Alcantara faux suede. The available S line package has diamond patterning on Nappa leather, and a lighting package enhances the interior’s ambience with accent lighting.</p>, <p>The trunk in the roadster is quite small at 7.5 cubic feet, but the coupe has a decent 12.0 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55064" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-ttrs-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-ttrs-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-ttrs-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The chassis is aluminum and steel, a design in pursuit of good handling, and the TT comes out fairly nimble and balanced. The progressive steering with variable ratio and variable electric assist allows quick flicks in switchbacks and mountain hairpins, while contributing to stability on the freeway. However road feel is a bit lacking.</p>, <p>The handling is fairly balanced despite an a less-than-ideal design, with the engine extending forward of the front axle, making weight distribution 60/40 front/rear–nose heavy. With that limitation, it’s inevitable that the TT will understeer, when it’s being pushed in corners.</p>, <p>The faster TTS uses a magnetic suspension that’s firmer than the TT’s while delivering a better ride on rough pavement. But still we want more road feel.</p>, <p>At 75 miles per hour a rear spoiler rises from the deck. Audi says it generates 110 pounds of downforce at 155 mph, which means you’ll never feel it. But it looks cool.</p>, <p>The TT RS is ready for the track. Its turbocharged 5-cylinder engine (Audi has a long history with winning five-cylinder racecars) makes a whumping 400 horsepower and 354 pound-feet torque, to get to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds using launch control to keep the tires from spinning. The larger engine actually puts more weight up front, but its power can be used to compensate for understeer. Quattro allows it.</p>, <p>The available Dynamic Plus package for the RS includes carbon ceramic front brakes, and fixed dampers instead of the magnetic dampers. The fixed dampers are firmer and lower the stance. The package also includes a carbon fiber engine cover, and an electronic release in top speed to 174 mph from a mere 155. Track only please.</p>, <p>The Audi TT looks great, handles well, and has a superb powertrain, with its 2.0 turbo available with 220 or 292 hp, take your pick. Or pick the new RS for another 20 grand, with an inline five-cylinder engine making 400 horsepower. We like them all, but especially the RS because it makes supercar power and speed out of a smaller engine and less weight.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>It’s the 60th birthday for the Chevrolet Impala (never mind that it went missing for a few years). 1958 was a great year, the year Impala was born, a classic out of the box. Try to buy a ’58 Chevy Impala today, especially a convertible. You’d be looking at $50k to $125k, last time we checked.</p>, <p>The 2018 Impala is still a full-size sedan, although today it’s front-wheel drive. Rivals include the Toyota Avalon, Hyundai Azera, and Ford Taurus. It’s comfortable, thrifty and engaging. It shares its platform with the Buick Lacrosse and Cadillac XTS. It’s eight inches shorter than the ’58 Impala, on a wheelbase that’s 6.5 inches less. Cutting out eight inches in sixty years doesn’t sound like a whole lot. And back then they had to make room for a V8.</p>, <p>This is the fourth year since the last redesign, which was a good one, for both the body and chassis.</p>, <p>There aren’t any changes for the 2018, however the standard equipment gets increased on all models, and there are new colors to choose from. Even the base model gets a rearview camera and 8.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. You won’t find that in many cars at the Impala’s price.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 2.5-liter four cylinder making 196 horsepower, with an available 3.6-liter V6 with 305 horsepower. Each engine is mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel mileage is respectable but not the best in class; the four-cylinder engine is EPA-rated at 25 miles per gallon Combined, while the V6 gets 22 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Impala gets five stars for its crash rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, while Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives it top scores in frontal- and side-impact collisions.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55053" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-impala-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Impala LS ($27,895) has the four-cylinder engine plus air conditioning, six-speaker audio, keyless entry, cloth upholstery, a power driver’s seat, rearview camera, 10 airbags, 8.0-inch touchscreen, and 18-inch steel wheels. Few options are available for the LS, which is marketed largely to fleet buyers. (Prices are MSRP and do not include the $875 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Impala LT ($30,220) also is four-cylinder. but adds Chevrolet’s MyLink infotainment, cloth/leatherette upholstery, power lumbar for front passenger, Bluetooth phone/audio, dual-zone automatic climate control, and 18-inch alloy wheels, Options include leather seating surfaces, 19-inch wheels, and the V6 engine.</p>, <p>Impala Premier ($36,420) gets the 3.6-liter V6, as well as perforated leather-upholstered seats, heated front seats, a power front passenger seat, 19-inch wheels, pushbutton start, and rear parking sensors,. Safety features include forward-collision and lane-departure warnings, and blind-spot monitoring. Navigation and a sunroof are optional.</p>, <p>An optional group of advanced safety features includes adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and lane-departure warning.</p>, <p>The Impala attempts to be muscular with its chiseled lines. Its proportions are similar to the Buick Lacrosse and Cadillac XTS, but the Caddy pulls it off best, with the Buick second.</p>, <p>However the Impala profile is sophisticated and the lines fairly crisp. The hood is invigorating, with stamped lines and ribs. The rear is an intricate intersection of surfaces, distinct from the Lacrosse and XTS.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55055" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-impala-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-impala-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-impala-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Impala is more spacious than the Toyota Avalon and Hyundai Azera, with ample room for five people and a their luggage if it’s not too much, in a sizeable trunk that’s 18.8 cubic feet. However the Impala doesn’t feel as big as other full-size cars.</p>, <p>The shape of the sweeping dual-cowl dashboard is lovely, but it’s ruined by a complex and heavy-handed mishmash of textures, lines, and materials. There are lots of storage bins in the cabin. The audio system has a hidden storage compartment behind the LCD screen. GM’s OnStar system includes a WiFi hotspot.</p>, <p>Support in the front seats is about the best in class, while there’s enough headroom and legroom for tall people. The power driver’s seat has an especially broad height range.</p>, <p>Although the back seat is wide and well shaped, the bottom cushion is low, flat, and a bit short. Yet headroom is still a bit tight, and the seat support could be better. Legroom is near limousine-level, while entry and exit is made easier by doors that are tall and wide.</p>, <p>As for cabin silence, the four-cylinder models include active noise cancellation, while upper trim levels are fitted with additional sound deadening and thicker glass.</p>, <p>Performance with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is fine for commuting most family use, but when power is needed for passing, the acceleration falls short of the spurt that’s available with the 3.6-liter V6, with its vivid acceleration that can almost make it feel like a sport sedan. It will do zero to sixty miles per hour in a healthy 6.8 seconds, bringing smooth, strong power.</p>, <p>The six-speed automatic can be shifted manually, using a switch on the lever, whose action is unfortunately awkward on account of the tall center console. Also unfortunately, the transmission isn’t seamless like some earlier GM transmissions. It shifts quickly enough, but if you’re not smooth with your foot, its response will be imperfect. So if you’re rough on the gas pedal, the transmission might be rough on you.</p>, <p>The Impala’s road manners are among the best in its large class, with composure and balance that’s better than the Toyota Avalon, Hyundai Azera, and Ford Taurus. It feels almost athletic out on the road, which is saying a lot for a full-size front-wheel-drive car. Quick and accurate, the belt-driven electric power steering never feels heavy or sluggish.</p>, <p>The Impala adeptly balances handling and a comfortable ride. Rebound springs help keep body lean under control. Excellent suspension damping keeps the ride subtle and restrained, although it feels a bit stiffer when rolling over small bumps than when encountering large ones.</p>, <p>The Impala offers an attractive body, composed handling and a satisfying ride. The inline four-cylinder does the job almost all of the time, as does the six-speed automatic. The V6 offers a lot more acceleration, for 3 less mpg.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-buick-cascada/
[<p>Buick Cascada is a compact convertible that’s all about style. Introduced for the 2016 model year, Cascada is the first Buick soft-top since the richly appointed Riviera of the mid-1980s, or the Reatta two-seater made in 1990-91.</p>, <p>Little has changed for the 2018 Cascada, but new color choices and color combinations with the soft top freshen the line. A Sport Touring trim level, with special design details, joined the lineup for 2017. Ranking as one of the least costly convertibles on sale today, the charmingly sedate drop-top has a distinctively continental aura.</p>, <p>Three trim levels are offered: base, Premium, and Sport Touring. Each version is stylish, fitted with a high level of standard features.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55046" height="137" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cascada-models.jpg" width="200"/>All models are front-wheel drive and use a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque, driving a 6-speed automatic transmission. An overboost provision can raise torque output briefly, to 221 pound-feet, when needed.</p>, <p>Buick’s convertible is pleasurable to drive, but it isn’t sporty. It’s more of a boulevard cruiser. Cascada has no direct competitors, now that moderately priced convertibles have faded away.</p>, <p>Rather than start fresh, General Motors looked to its highly respected European Opel division for the basis of the soft-roof Buick. Launched more than five years ago, Cascada’s European cousin hasn’t changed much since then. One sign of aging is the control layout, which relies heavily on buttons. Its infotainment system, too, hails from a prior generation of General Motors models.</p>, <p>Cascada lacks the most advanced safety features. A rearview camera is standard, but for a premium model, active-safety features are barely existent. Forward-collision and lane-departure warnings are optional, but automatic emergency braking is not available at all. Thus, Cascada is one of few current-model cars that cannot stop itself automatically if sensors detect an imminent crash.</p>, <p>Crash-testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration resulted in a five-star overall rating, with five stars for the side-impact test but only four for a frontal impact.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55047" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cascada-topdown.jpg" width="200"/>Cascada ($33,065) comes standard with perforated leather upholstery, eight-way power heated front seats, rear parking sensors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 7.0-inch touchscreen, heated steering wheel, and 20-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Premium ($36,065) adds navigation and safety features, including lane-departure and forward-collision warnings. Front/rear parking sensors, foglamps, and automatic articulating high-intensity discharge headlights are standard. Sport Touring ($37,065) gets unique wheels, sport alloy pedals, and a flat-bottomed, three-spoke sport steering wheel. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $925 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55048" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cascada-topup.jpg" width="200"/>An enticingly curvaceous body is the Cascada’s strong point. Assembled in Poland, it was designed and engineered in Germany, for the most part. Nothing about the Cascada is American, apart from its Buick badge. That German parentage results in an orderly, comparatively conservative overall appearance.</p>, <p>Suggestions of formal design contrast pleasantly with swoopy detail work. Up front, a heavily-chromed grille is blacked-out on the Sport Touring edition. All Cascadas ride on 20-inch tires that have a relatively low profile. Wheel designs differ by trim level.</p>, <p>This nicely-proportioned convertible looks just as good with its top down, as it does when the power-operated fabric roof is erected. The top can be folded in fewer than 20 seconds, at speeds up to 30 mph, in case of sudden weather changes in stop/go driving.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55045" height="144" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cascada-interior.jpg" width="200"/>In stark contrast with the Cascada’s attractive body, its cabin comes across as dated and behind the times. Most notably, the center stack is overloaded with buttons. The overall look is aeronautical in nature, but it doesn’t come off well. Although there’s nothing really wrong with the instrument panel, which angles slightly toward the driver, it’s a humdrum layout.</p>, <p>Passenger space is limited, giving the Cascada a 2+2 configuration, which isn’t unusual for convertibles. A Cascada is comfortable for the two front occupants, who benefit from supportive seats and ample space. However, the back seat is tight for two more, unless they happen to be youngsters.</p>, <p>Cargo volume totals 13.4 cubic feet with the roof raised, shrinking to only 9.8 cubic feet with the fabric top folded. Those figures are about on par for the soft-top class. Thick lining of the fabric top helps stifle road sounds.</p>, <p>Interior materials are pleasing to the eye and mostly soft to touch, though not especially upscale. Standard perforated leather upholstery features an attractive pattern.</p>, <p>Not only is the infotainment system, with its 7.0-inch touchscreen, outdated, it seems like a generation removed from systems in other Buick models. Though it’s relatively easy to use, such features as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are absent. GM’s OnStar includes a 4G LTE wi-fi antenna.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55044" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cascada-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cascada-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cascada-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Serving in its role as an open-roofed boulevard cruiser, the Cascada falls a bit short in refinement, but provides a pleasing experience. Potent performance isn’t part of the picture, but Buick’s convertible is relaxed on the road.</p>, <p>Large wheels and narrow tire sidewalls conspire to yield a choppier ride than expected – a bit like animal hooves pounding the pavement. Steering is accurate and appropriately-weighted, if short on road feel. The suspension fails to keep body lean fully controlled through curves and corners.</p>, <p>Despite relatively high power output for a small engine, the four-cylinder is overtaxed, largely because of weight. To retain body stiffness with the top down, a considerable amount of chassis bracing is required. Tipping the scale at nearly two tons, then, the Cascada is as hefty as some crossover SUVs.</p>, <p>In its attempt to deliver sufficient engine power, the turbocharger has to work quite hard. On the plus side, the Cascada engine is quiet and largely refined. Downshifts from the automatic transmission can be slow to arrive. Occasionally, they’re drawn out and woozy.</p>, <p>Fuel-efficiency falls short, partly due to the Cascada’s abundant weight. With its 1.6-liter engine, the 2018 Cascada is EPA-rated at 20/27 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Buick Cascada is an alluring, attractively priced convertible. All three trim levels are well-equipped, but most modern active-safety features are absent. The back seat is snug, the ride is choppy, and performance is lackluster.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-volt/
[<p>The Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid compact sedan with striking looks that are sleek and wedge-like. It offers the best of both worlds, able to run on electric power for 53 around-town miles, then switch to gas power to reach the next charge or the end of the tank of fuel on a road trip. If you don’t have a long commute you’ll rarely spend any money on gas.</p>, <p>Volt’s quality and capability were vastly improved for its second generation, so much that New Car Test Drive named it the Best Commuter Car for 2016. It’s now in the third reliable year of that generation. It didn’t change much for 2017, as there were no bugs to work out, nor has it changed for 2018.</p>, <p>Volt uses two motor-generators to drive the front wheels. They get their power from a lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of 18.4 kilowatt-hours. One thing different about the Volt from most other plug-in hybrids, is that even under full throttle, it doesn’t switch to gas; this means that if you drive it hard under electric power, you won’t be able to go 53 miles, because it will use up its charge at a faster pace. However, it isn’t burning gas when you don’t want it to.</p>, <p>One exception: the engine will switch to gas power when the outside temperature is below freezing. It does this to heat the cabin.</p>, <p>Alternatively, the Volt can go far on a tank of gasoline: 380 miles on its 8.9-gallon tank.</p>, <p>It takes nine to twelve hours to fully charge the Volt, using any household 120-volt outlet and the conveniently located charging cable in the car. Using the optional 240-volt Level 2 charging station, that time is cut to four and one-half hours.</p>, <p>Among plug-in hybrids, Volt’s 53-mile range is topped only by the BMW i3 REx, with 73 miles. But the i3’s tiny two-cylinder engine isn’t powerful.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55035" height="107" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-volt-models.jpg" width="200"/>For all practical purposes, the Chevrolet Volt has no competitors among plug-in hybrid cars. However, if a commuter is fixed on electric power, but finds that 53 miles a day isn’t quite enough, he or she might look at the Chevy Bolt, an all-electric subcompact whose range is a world-beating 200 miles.</p>, <p>Volt’s internal combustion engine is a 1.5-liter four-cylinder making 101 horsepower, new for this generation. Combined with the motor-generators, the total horsepower is 149 (111 kilowatts), with an impressive 294-pound feet of torque, as much as some V8 pickup trucks. Volt can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in eight seconds, quicker than a Prius; and that’s an all-electric versus gas-powered drag race, because the Prius switches to gas power under full throttle while the Volt stays with electric.</p>, <p>Volt’s combined EPA rating, using both electric and fuel power, is 42 miles per gallon; but that’s almost meaningless because it’s hypothetical and theoretical, based on some average person’s combined city-highway driving. An owner who never leaves the city might get infinite miles per gallon; indeed, some say they use their engines only enough to ensure the gas stays fresh.</p>, <p>Another rating that applies to plug-in hybrids is Miles Per Gallon Equivalent (MPGe), defined as the distance a car can travel electrically on the amount of energy contained in a gallon of gasoline. The Volt hits a strong 106 MPGe.</p>, <p>In crash testing, the NHTSA gives the 2017 Volt five stars in every category, and the IIHS rates it a Top Safety Pick+ when equipped with automatic emergency braking. It got top IIHS scores in every category accept headlamps, as the standard LED headlights were rated Acceptable. The optional automatic high beam units on Volt Premier earned the top Good rating.</p>, <p>Safety equipment includes 10 airbags and a rearview camera with sharp resolution. Optional safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assist with lane-departure warning, forward-collision warnings, and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>Chevrolet Volt LT ($33,220) and Volt Premier ($37,570) qualify for a $7,500 federal income-tax credit, a $1,500 California purchase rebate, and various other state, local, and corporate incentives. (Prices are MSRP.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55038" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-volt-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-volt-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-volt-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Volt is low, crisp and rakish, with character lines that accent the edges. The sharp nose sweeps back through the headlamps and fenders to the steep windshield and rising window line. The Volt looks like it’s striking, or zapping, or whatever a volt does.</p>, <p>The rear window is also steep, so the wedge isn’t chopped. The rear deck is high but not flat, while the liftgate has a single glass panel.</p>, <p>There’s not an actual grille, rather a two-panel design to look like one, using a diagram-like pattern that doesn’t offer much distinction from the entry-level Chevy Cruze.</p>, <p>There no gimmicks on the instrument panel to amuse you or try to persuade you that electric cars are cool. The first gen Volt was like that, good riddance, Volt owners agree. So this Volt has come back to Earth after its taste of being a spaceship.</p>, <p>The twin cockpit is accented in black and silver with some elegance, while two-tone interiors are available. The quality of the materials is high, and the touch is soft.</p>, <p>The gauges and instruments are easy to read, while the switches and controls are intuitive. Knobs for audio and climate control are conventional Chevy hardware. The eight-inch touchscreen in the center of the dash is easy to view, with crisp resolution. One exception to what we said about no gimmicks is the screen’s power flow diagram, which satisfies initial curiosity but then you stop looking at it.</p>, <p>The front seats are low but the side window deepens at the windshield pillar, giving the effect of a higher seating position. The seats have good bolstering and were comfortable for us after a long day driving.</p>, <p>Headroom and legroom in the rear is okay if not generous, but the side glass narrows back there to accommodate the roofline, making the rear feel tighter than it is. The outboard rear seats are separate and reasonably comfortable buckets. This car is in practical terms a four-seater. The center rear seat is compromised by the battery pack underneath. It’s mostly just a padded cushion with shoulder belt, and the passenger there has to spread his or her feet and straddle the battery tunnel.</p>, <p>Rearward visibility for the driver isn’t very good, especially over the shoulder, and also in the rearview mirror, as the sloped single-panel rear window reveals much of the rear deck, which blocks the space immediately behind the car. It’s unnerving to be tailgated, and in the rearview mirror you can’t see the front of the tailgating car, only the face and eyes of the driver. It makes it feel like the tailgating car is much closer than it is.</p>, <p>With poor rearward visibility, it’s important the Volt’s standard rearview camera is so excellent. The crisp image, displayed on the 8.0-inch center screen, the best we’ve seen in a compact car.</p>, <p>Thanks to the sleek aerodynamics there’s very little wind noise. However the silence of the rest of the car allows the tire noise to be heard; and tires on a high-mileage car can be louder because the rubber is harder for low rolling resistance. It’s an engineering challenge facing electric-car builders and tire-makers. Next invention will be a miracle tire.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55036" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-volt-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-volt-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-volt-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The electric Volt not only keeps up with traffic in the city and suburbia, it zooms around it. On and off the freeway for short trips. There is a mode that reduces the juice in order to extend the range, but even in that mode the Volt stays quick and smooth. And unlike some plug-in hybrids, the engine delivers full power from a low speed. Standing start to 30 mph is impressive.</p>, <p>The Volt lost a couple hundred pounds with this generation, but it’s still far from lithe. It feels heavy for its size, however the center of gravity is low so it corners flat. The feel of the electric power steering is decent.</p>, <p>It’s lively, and enjoyable on twisty roads, but it’s not sporty, it’s simply easy to drive, making it calming.</p>, <p>The powertrain allows both motors to power the front wheels together, or one motor to drive the car while the other recharges the battery; sensors tell it to do what’s needed, or what’s most efficient, so smoothly that the driver can’t feel it and never knows, unless he checks the power-flow diagram on the display screen.</p>, <p>Another thing you can barely feel is the regenerative braking, which is really good. With some electric cars and plug-in hybrids it’s so strong it’s intrusive.</p>, <p>The Volt is smooth, powerful, and handsome. Shows its chops as a plug-in hybrid. Fun to drive, though not much room in the rear. With its all-electric range of 53 miles, and government and marketing incentives, the cost-per-mile numbers might work.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-buick-envision/
[<p>The Buick Envision is a midsize/compact crossover, bigger than the popular Encore hatchback, smaller than the three-row Enclave wagon. Envision is narrow for its class and a couple of inches shorter than its front-wheel-drive crossover cousins, the Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain.</p>, <p>Envision is built in China and the vast majority of them are sold there.</p>, <p>It’s well-assembled and has a sweet ride, but the driving dynamics are average. It lacks features seen on the Lexus RX, Acura RDX, and Nissan Murano. It weighs 3800 pounds and can tow 1500 pounds when properly equipped.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available. Front-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 2.5-liter four cylinder making 197 horsepower. The fun and confident engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four making 252 horsepower, all-wheel-drive only. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The all-wheel drive is a twin-clutch system that splits power between the rear wheels, called torque vectoring, for better control in corners, not for better traction in mud or snow. The 2.0 turbo also uses Buick’s sophisticated HiPer strut front suspension that counters torque steer, mainly on front-wheel-drive models.</p>, <p>The 2.5-liter engine’s available all-wheel drive is a basic system.</p>, <p>The 2.5-liter with front-wheel drive gets an EPA-rated 22 miles per gallon City, 29 Highway, and 25 Combined, nothing to brag about. The 2.0 turbo with all-wheel drive gets 20/26/22 mpg.</p>, <p>In crash testing, the Envision gets five stars from NHTSA. It gets all top scores from the IIHS, and with the optional automatic emergency braking system, gets Top Safety Pick+. By then you’re pushing $50k.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55025" height="145" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-envision-final.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Buick Envision ($34,015) comes standard with power and heated cloth seats and rearview camera. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.) The 2.5-liter engine comes on base, Preferred ($35,870) and Essence ($37,720) models. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive is available.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine with twin-clutch torque-vectoring all-wheel drive comes as Preferred ($37,720), Essence ($39,570), Premium ($42,320) and Premium II ($44,960). Premium versions get air conditioned leather seats, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. The Driver Confidence Package, with automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, is available only on the Premium II.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55027" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-envision-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Envision is eye-pleasing but not double-taking. A deep shoulder line and rear roof pillar are vaguely European, with a line of thin chrome trim around the windows that’s suggestive of the BMW 3. At the front, a petite waterfall grille is flanked by LED daytime running lamps that flow upward into fenders with iconic faux portholes.</p>, <p>The rear taillamps are like blobs floating in space. LED accent lights are connected by a wide metallic bar studded with a Buick logo. It’s inoffensive but uninteresting.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55026" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-envision-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The instrument panel is a dramatic asymmetric sweep of controls, and a mish-mash of GM-generic switchgear. The sporty three-spoke steering wheel looks cool, too bad the handling doesn’t back it up. Fabric upholstery comes on the two lower models, with faux wood trim, while the others get leather in brown, black or tan, which doesn’t feel particularly nice. Big swaths of real wood trim and ambient lighting beautify the cabin on the Premium models. A climate control panel uses capacitive touch switches.</p>, <p>The 8.0-inch infotainment touchscreen, with busy graphics, sits high on the dash. Buick’s IntelliLink is one of our favorite systems, for its simple menus and plug-and-go Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p>The Envision is a bit narrow, which you can feel in the rear seat. The rear seat slides on a track for legroom. The rear seat will hold three adults, squeezed but with good headroom, and reclining.</p>, <p>There’s an excellent 26.9 cubic feet of space behind the rear seat, and 57.3 cubic feet with the rear seat folded, numbers that belie its exterior size.</p>, <p>It’s very quiet inside. We pushed it over some of the worst asphalt we’ve seen in a while, and didn’t hear one creak or rattle. Its doors slammed with the solid thunk we’ve come to expect from GM.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55024" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-envision-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-envision-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-envision-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>We found the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter feels confident and competent. The exhaust note is muffled and distant, releasing a light thrum under hard acceleration. There’s some turbo lag before the power hits, but when it does it’s smooth. This engine is used in other GM cars from the Chevy Malibu to Cadillac CT6. The 6-speed automatic transmission is always smooth.</p>, <p>We haven’t driven the 2.5-liter in the Envision but we have experience with this engine in other GM cars and weren’t impressed. Its 197 horsepower and 192 pound-feet of torque doesn’t sound like a lot for a 3800-pound crossover.</p>, <p>Envision’s strength is its excellent ride, its composure on choppy roads. Even with the bigger 19-inch alloy wheels and all-season tires, there’s not much road noise.</p>, <p>We drove an all-wheel-drive Premium on gravel roads, and had no problems with grip. The system is front-wheel-drive based, but sends power to the rear when traction is needed there. And then splits that power between rear wheels to help cornering and control.</p>, <p>Never mind the inviting steering wheel, the Envision isn’t into spirited cornering. However there’s not much body lean, and the electric power steering is steady, whether in a sweeper or switchback The system can counter-steer in crosswinds..</p>, <p>Nice cabin, good ride, solid 2.0-liter turbo, smooth six-speed automatic, average handling, forgettable styling, unimpressive fuel mileage, eyebrow-raising price. Made in China.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-avalon/
[<p>The Toyota Avalon is a full-size sedan with abundant interior space and leather-upholstered comfort. Sliding in and out of its seats is easy, and it’s smooth and quiet underway. Devoid of the latest in swoopy design, its near-classic appearance is aging well. With its modern safety features, the Avalon shows no significant change for the 2018 model year. Avalon was last redesigned for the 2013 model year.</p>, <p>Two distinct versions are available: one with a conventional V6 gasoline engine, and the other with a hybrid (gasoline/electric) powertrain. Both are fuel-efficient, and the Avalon Hybrid ranks among the most thrifty full-size family cruisers on the market.</p>, <p>In regular Avalons, a strong, smooth-running 3.5-liter V6 produces 268 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. With a 24-mpg Combined rating from the EPA, it’s right on track in terms of fuel efficiency with the large-sedan competition.</p>, <p>The Avalon Hybrid ties a 2.5-liter, 200-horsepower, four-cylinder gasoline engine with an electric motor, coupled to a nickel-metal hydride battery pack. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) takes the place of the 6-speed automatic. Acceleration is passable; reaching 60 mph takes 8.2 seconds. The EPA estimates 40 mpg in Combined city and highway driving.</p>, <p>Gas-engine Avalons come in five trim levels. Hybrids are available in XLE Plus, Premium, and Touring trim.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, Toyota made its Safety Sense group of safety features standard on all models. Included are a lane-departure warning with steering assist, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>Many automakers continue to limit modern active-safety equipment to top trim levels. Making them standard raises the status of Avalon against such full-size rivals as the Chevrolet Impala, Ford Taurus, and Hyundai Azera, helping to justify its higher price. In addition to a standard rearview camera, each Avalon has ten airbags.</p>, <p>A solid crash-test record also helps. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave Avalon a five-star overall rating and five stars in side-impact testing, though its frontal-impact test earned only a four-star score. Naming Avalon a Top Safety Pick, with Good crash-test scores, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has rated it Superior for frontal crash protection.</p>, <p>In any trim level, the Avalon is abundantly equipped. Top models come across as veritable luxury sedans.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55018" height="106" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-avalon-model.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Toyota Avalon XLE V6 ($33,500) is equipped with a V6 engine, 6-speed automatic, leather-trimmed seat upholstery, heated front seats, pushbutton start, rearview camera, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, 17-inch wheels, and the Safety Sense group. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $895 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Avalon XLE Plus V6 ($35,250) adds a moonroof and auto-dimming inside mirror. XLE Premium V6 ($36,700) comes with navigation, 9-speaker audio, driver’s memory, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and wireless charging.</p>, <p>Avalon Touring V6 ($37,900) gets a slightly revised suspension, 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, and LED daytime running lights.</p>, <p>Avalon Limited V6 ($41,300) includes heated/cooled front seats, three-zone climate control, heated rear seats, HID headlights, power rear-window sunshade, JBL 11-speaker audio, and softer perforated leather.</p>, <p>Avalon Hybrid XLE Plus ($37,500), Hybrid XLE Premium ($38,950), and Hybrid Limited ($42,800) come with the gasoline/electric powertrain and CVT.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55017" height="106" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-avalon-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Avalons used to be related to the Toyota Camry, but those days of equivalence are long gone. Today’s Avalon benefits from a contemporary, refreshing appearance.</p>, <p>Little, if any, trace of Camry styling can be seen, especially since the Camry’s recent redesign. Avalons boast gracefully shaped sheetmetal, even if overall presence isn’t as stirring as some European-brand competitors.</p>, <p>Curiously, the wide, deep front end looks overly aggressive for a sedan that aims toward family motoring. Vertically oriented daytime running lights enhance that effect, looking a bit out of place.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55016" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-avalon-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-avalon-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-avalon-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Simple and straightforward, the Avalon cabin isn’t as enticing as its exterior, lacking the posh details of European luxury models. Price aside, though, the Avalon ranks among the quietest, most comfortable sedans to be found.</p>, <p>It’s also one of the few that offers space for five adults, along with a full load of luggage. Avalons offer 16 cubic feet of trunk space, but Hybrid trunks are smaller by 2 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Though comfortable, front seats lack the level of lateral support that some drivers prefer. Still, they’re wide and flat, easy to get in an out, and seem solidly built. Soft leather boasts commendable stitching.</p>, <p>Rear seats are suitably contoured. Three average-size adults can occupy the back bench without troublesome squeezing. Slight head-ducking is needed to enter, due to the low roofline. But once inside, expect plenty of clearance for heads and legs.</p>, <p>Interior fittings are carefully installed, down to the small details. Even the graining of the leather upholstery seems to match neatly.</p>, <p>A two-tone treatment helps separate the amply-sized dashboard. Climate controls are operated via an attractive screen, but touch-sensitive controls have done away with the tactile feel of traditional buttons and knobs. Also unfortunately, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities are absent.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55019" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-avalon-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Avalon’s supple ride is accompanied by an admirable level of control. No hints remain of the floatiness that prevailed in early Avalons. Though the ride is firm, far removed from pillowy-soft, it’s rarely harsh.</p>, <p>Solid powertrains yield capable performance. Nothing about the gasoline V6 is overpowering, but it delivers plenty of passing power, while comparatively easy on fuel. All V6 versions include paddle shifters, and acceleration to 60 mph takes only 6.7 seconds. Eco, Normal, and Sport driving modes can alter steering effort, throttle operation, and shifting feel.</p>, <p>As for quietness, the Avalon’s hushed ride compares favorably with that of any sedan, including far more costly models. Credit goes largely to use of acoustic glass in the windshield and side windows. Both versions are quiet while cruising, without observable engine sound. Only when accelerating hard can the Hybrid’s coarse engine sound be heard. Sport mode in the Hybrid reveals slight electric-motor whine.</p>, <p>Fuel economy in the regular Avalon is EPA-rated at 21/31 mpg City/Highway, or 24 mpg Combined. The Hybrid scores near the top of the gas-mileage scale, EPA-rated at 40/39 mpg City/Highway, or 40 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The Toyota Avalon is safe and comfortable, a premium model that’s roomy and easy to with. On the road, the Avalon is smooth yet controlled and quite quiet. The Limited trim is luxurious.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-sequoia/
[<p>The Toyota Sequoia was last redesigned for the 2008 model year, and it has changed little since. A full-size, truck-based SUV, it offers three rows of seating and a V8 engine.</p>, <p>2018 Sequoia models get new grilles and LED lighting for headlights, taillights, and daytime running lights. A new gauge cluster for 2018 includes a 4.2-inch display screen.</p>, <p>Also new for 2018, the Sequoia TRD Sport edition joins the lineup with more focus on off-road capabilities. Rolling on large (20-inch) black alloy wheels, the TRD Sport features black exterior accents, sport-tuned Bilstein shock absorbers, and front/rear anti-sway bars.</p>, <p>Sequoia is powered by a reliable V8 and provides a well-composed ride. Sequoia can carry up to eight passengers. Folding the second- and third-row seats yields a massive 120 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>, <p>With its 5.7-liter V8 and truck-based chassis, a properly equipped Sequoia is rated to tow as much as 7,400 pounds. It works well for towing a small boat or light trailer.</p>, <p>Rated at 381 horsepower, the 5.7-liter V8 develops 401 pound-feet of torque, driving a 6-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive optional.</p>, <p>We found it to be a dated product. It’s inefficient compared with the latest crossover SUVs and the interior looks dated.</p>, <p>Standard active-safety technology includes lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. A rearview camera and front knee airbags are standard. Roll-sensing side-curtain airbags protect all three rows of seats.</p>, <p>Families that don’t really need the timeworn Sequoia’s carrying capacity and V8 vigor might consider a Highlander crossover SUV instead. At the other end of the scale, Toyota continues to offer its rough-and-ready Land Cruiser, also fitted with three seating rows. Smaller than Sequoia, the Land Cruiser promises hard-edged off-roading characteristics.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Sequoia SR5 ($48,300) comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, sunroof, three-zone automatic climate control, rearview camera, power-adjustable driver’s seat, Bluetooth connectivity, 6.1-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>All Sequoias come standard with rear-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional ($3,225).</p>, <p>Sequoia Limited ($56,795) adds leather seat upholstery, 20-inch wheels, a power liftgate, and chrome accents.</p>, <p>Sequoia Platinum ($64,010) includes a rear-seat Blu-ray player, adaptive cruise control, and premium audio. A standard load-leveling rear suspension makes Platinum the logical choice for towing.</p>, <p>Sequoia TRD Sport features 20-inch wheels, blacked-out exterior trim, off-road shock absorbers, and other performance enhancements. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $1,295 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55011" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sequoia-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Broad, curvaceous shoulders and a wide stance make it reasonably clear that the massive Sequoia is truck-based. Overall, Toyota’s largest SUV lacks angular elements and looks more rounded than comparable models from other manufacturers.</p>, <p>Details include rounded accents on the tailgate. A tall window line tends to make the Sequoia look even heftier than it is in reality.</p>, <p>The current grille and LED headlights seems somewhat out of place, though they give the Sequoia a noticeable presence. Special appearance features on the new TRD Sport include blacked-out body trim and chrome surrounding the grille.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55012" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sequoia-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sequoia-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sequoia-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The big Sequoia isn’t as space-efficient or comfortable as it appears to be, and the cabin has been showing its age for some time.</p>, <p>Prices are lofty, yet the interior falls well short of luxurious. Materials look cheap, dominated by hard plastic pieces, especially, matte-metallic plastic trim along the central console. Fit and finish win no prizes, either. Climate-control dials function well enough, but look especially outmoded.</p>, <p>Cargo capacity is undeniably appealing to large families and drivers who haul plenty of luggage or large items. With all seatbacks up, cargo volume totals 18.9 cubic feet, expanding to 66.6 cubic feet with the third row folded down.</p>, <p>Seats up front are wide and soft. Second-row seats can slide fore/aft to reapportion legroom, but the standard bench isn’t such a pleasant place. Captain’s chairs can be substituted, for greater comfort. The third row folds to boost cargo space, but it’s not acceptable for adults. Upper trim levels include power-folding seatbacks in the third row.</p>, <p>Storage cubbyholes and cupholders are bountiful, but not every seat gets a USB power port. Toyota’s easy-to-use Entune infotainment system works with a connected smartphone, and its navigation interfaces is more intuitive that most.</p>, <p>Stand on the gas pedal, and the Sequoia’s V8 delivers impressive performance. Most of the V8’s available torque output comes to life at low engine speed: around 2200 rpm. As a result, an unloaded Sequoia can accelerate to 60 mph in less than seven seconds. Pretty quick, that, especially given Sequoia’s weight.</p>, <p>Despite its outmoded design, Toyota’s 6-speed automatic operates reliably.</p>, <p>When equipped with four-wheel drive, a two-speed transfer case, containing a Torsen limited-slip differential, regulates the power split between front and rear wheels. On difficult terrain, the differential can be locked. Toyota’s electronic traction control system can help limit wheelspin, too.</p>, <p>Among the Sequoia’s admitted merits is a composed ride, as the truck-type suspension manages to absorb plenty of rough spots and bumps. Some tossing of passenger heads may occur when taking a corner, largely because of the Sequoia’s high center of gravity. Platinum trim includes a variable air suspension that can smooth the ride further.</p>, <p>The new TRD Sport edition adds Bilstein shocks and front and rear anti-roll bars.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is EPA-rated at a mere 13/17 mpg City/Highway, or 15 mpg Combined. Four-wheel drive sinks the Combined estimate slightly further, to 14 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Toyota Sequoia is past its prime, far behind competitors. Standard equipment impresses, but Sequoias lack conveniences that contemporary SUVs offer. Prices rise swiftly, approaching $70,000 when fully loaded. Add meager fuel economy, and the Sequoia sounds like a vehicle that can be recommended only if it’s a good deal.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-sienna/
[<p>The Toyota Sienna has something special going for it. If you need an all-wheel-drive minivan, look no farther than the Sienna. Actually, there’s nowhere else to look, as the Sienna is the only one, and thank you Toyota because it’s a good one.</p>, <p>The Sienna is focused on family, being roomy, versatile and reliable. It seats seven passengers with second-row captain’s chairs, or eight with the standard three-position bench. Side-curtain airbags protect occupants in all three rows. A rearview camera with 180-degree view is standard. Outward visibility is excellent.</p>, <p>Sienna got a new powertrain for 2017, a direct-injection 3.5-liter V6 mated to a new 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55003" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sienna-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Sienna gets a new front bumper, side sheetmetal, updated infotainment with more USB ports, new rear-seat entertainment system, and more safety equipment standard. It comes in five trim levels, with all-wheel drive available in three. It gets 22 EPA Combined miles per gallon with front-wheel drive, and 2 less mpg with awd.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Sienna five stars overall, with four stars for frontal crash and rollover. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ranked the Sienna Good in most areas, but only Acceptable for the small-overlap frontal crash procedure.</p>, <p>Available safety features include forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and parking sensors front and rear.

All-wheel drive is optional ($1,740).</p>, <p>Extras include rear-seat entertainment, power sliding doors, navigation, and voice projection for communicating with back-seat passengers.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55007" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sienna-rear.jpg" width="200"/>As minivans go, the Sienna is sharp and stylish, while not pretending to be anything but a minivan. A finned grille is on the LX, XLE, and Limited, while SE and Limited get LED headlamps. The SE with appearance package looks the sportiest, as the rocker panels and big wheels stand out. We’re not so sure about the clear taillight lenses, so 10 years ago.</p>, <p>The cabin is spacious, smartly finished, conveniently laid out, and very comfortable for all passengers. The front seats are supportive. The dashboard is sweeping and contoured, with big gauges that are easy to read. Audio and climate controls are easily reached by the front passenger. A 6.1-inch touchscreen is standard. Lower trim levels also get a 3.5-inch black-and-white LCD information screen, while upper models upgrade to a 4.2-inch color display.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55005" height="190" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sienna-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Storage for small things is bountiful, with a deep console and dual gloveboxes. A handy storage platform below the center dash between the front seats provides a convenient place for a purse or your take-out order.</p>, <p>The standard second-row bench slides back for legroom or forward for cargo space. Removing one section provides access to the foldaway third row, which can actually carry grownups and isn’t so difficult to reach. In the Limited, reclining lounge-type seats include footrests and leg-cushion extenders. Captain’s chairs are standard with all-wheel drive, which fold but not flat.</p>, <p>Adults can climb in and out of the back easily, however it can be a struggle to open the side door manually from the outside, should the power doors be reluctant to respond to the key fob, which commonly happens with SUV and minivan liftgates, and sedan trunks as well.</p>, <p>There is a massive 39.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and the deep well in the floor there easily holds and confines many grocery bags and boxes, superior to SUVs. With both rows folded, the space climbs to 117.8 cubic feet, not quite like a cargo van because the seats don’t fold into the floor, but still a ton of space.</p>, <p>The cabin of the Sienna isn’t as quiet on the highway as we would hope a family minivan to be.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-55006" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sienna-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sienna-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-sienna-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Minivans are expected to safe and maneuverable, not quick to accelerate or loaded with passing power. As long as a minivan reaches highway speeds reasonably early, stops effectively, and is responsive enough to steer around trouble, a minivan is considered okay.</p>, <p>The Sienna is more than okay, with a very healthy 296 horsepower from its 3.5-liter V6. It suffers no shortage of energy on the road, well above average for its class.</p>, <p>Tall and heavy, Sienna offers sluggish and lethargic handling. It’s slow to respond in transient maneuvers and seems to require more steering input than many SUVs. And there’s a fair amount of nose dive when braking. The SE is the sportiest model, with a tighter suspension and 19-inch wheels and tires.</p>, <p>The 8-speed automatic delivers upshifts so smooth they are practically imperceptible, however the engine and transmission don’t seem perfectly coordinated, as downshifting to pass can be slow. And, curiously, in the middle of a right-hand turn at an intersection, the transmission often selects a gear that’s too high (third), then is slow to get back down to second gear to accelerate. It’s disruptive and grows annoying.</p>, <p>The Toyota Sienna delivers cabin room, cargo space, seat comfort, convenience, versatility, safety, reliability, strong power from a V6, smooth shifting (most of the time) from an 8-speed automatic, and last but not least available all-wheel drive. All at an affordable price for the family.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-jeep-compass/
[<p>Jeep Compass, a front-wheel or all-wheel-drive compact crossover, is all new for 2018. Based on the sub-compact Renegade, the all-new 2018 Compass looks more like the midsize Cherokee, although it’s narrower (and slower).</p>, <p>Compass is powered by an aging and underwhelming 2.4-liter engine making 180 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, 6-speed automatic, or 9-speed automatic that isn’t as smooth as the new GM 9-speed.</p>, <p>But it handles well, and has a steady and comfortable ride on the standard 16-inch wheels and tires.</p>, <p>Compass is EPA rated at 26 Combined miles per gallon with front-wheel drive, 1 less mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54995" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-trailhawk.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-trailhawk.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-trailhawk-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>We most like the offroad Compass Trailhawk, which feels more like an authentic Jeep. It’s not serious about off-roading like the Wrangler or Cherokee, but the Compass Trailhawk beats other crossovers on the trails. It has higher bumpers for clearing rocks and climbing and descending ridges, along with one inch added ground clearance and more rugged all-terrain tires. Its 9-speed transmission locks into first gear with a 20:1 simulated crawl ratio, so you can go very, very slow, an important feature in rugged terrain.</p>, <p>Competitors include the Ford Escape, Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Nissan Rogue, Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain. Compact crossover is a tough game. That’s why the Trailhawk stands out.</p>, <p>Compass Sport ($20,995) is well equipped, with rugged fabric seats, rearview camera, full power equipment, air conditioning, two USB ports, keyless ignition, 16-inch wheels, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a 5.0-inch touchscreen audio system. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54993" height="143" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-latitude.jpg" width="200"/>Compass Latitude ($24,295) adds 17-inch wheels, cloth/vinyl seats, roof rails, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and more available equipment packages. Among them are a sunroof, Beats audio, navigation, blind-spot monitors, power tailgate, 7.0-inch touchscreen, tow package, and a safety bundle including forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>Compass Limited ($28,340) includes an 8.4-inch touchscreen, leather seats heated in front, 18-inch wheels, and an LCD screen in the instrument cluster.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available in these three models ($1500).</p>, <p>Compass Trailhawk ($28,695) comes standard with all-wheel drive and offroad rigging, including a 115-volt power outlet that’s useful for camping. But it also comes with leather, and upgraded infotainment.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54994" height="147" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The all-new Compass is quite attractive, faithfully copying the form and profile of the Cherokee only in about 7/8 scale. From the front, it looks more like the Grand Cherokee, having its seven-slot grille, with a black air intake below the body-colored bumper. There’s a lot of silver trim, but fortunately not the Cherokee’s thin grille and strange split headlamps.</p>, <p>The body looks sleeker with the optional black roof. Without the optional roof rack and alloy wheels, it looks very plain. The 17-inch wheels are big enough, 19-inch wheels overkill.</p>, <p>The Trailhawk brings some Jeep back into the Compass, with its higher ground clearance and all-terrain tires. But the nose and tail are less clean, with a front bumper that rises over a larger air intake; and horizontal silver trim on the liftgate that appears to have gotten lost on its way to the Limited.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54992" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cabin speaks Jeep’s current design language, with a lot of pleasant curves and organic shapes. It’s well finished. Climate controls are neatly positioned on the center console below the infotainment screen, and over a big dial that sets the modes for the all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The quality of materials is generally high, although it might be brightened with savvy trim packages. The dash panel is soft-touch plastic, and the substantial fabric seats in the Sport feel durable. The Latitude blends fabric and synthetic leather, while the Limited gets inexpensive leather.</p>, <p>But overall, the Compass doesn’t match its rivals. Headroom and legroom are good enough for four adults, but because it’s narrow like the sub-compact Renegade it’s based on, you can forget about five, at least in comfort. Even in the front, the occupants’ shoulders are close. And the seats need better padding in front and rear. Also, the headrests are angled too far forward, something manufacturers do to get better crash-test scores.</p>, <p>However the front seat is height adjustable (manual on the Sport, power on the Limited), which is useful for its versatility.</p>, <p>Despite its narrowness, the cabin feels sizable for a compact. There’s 27.2 cubic feet or cargo space behind the rear seat, which splits and folds to create more. But the cargo floor is 31.1 inches, a bit high for loading.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54997" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-compass-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Compass needs and deserves a better engine, to keep up with its ride and handling. Its 180 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of torque don’t sound so lame on paper, but on the road it struggles with more than two occupants. Add two more people and some gear in back, and it becomes work to keep the speed up.</p>, <p>The Sport and Latitude come standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, while the 6-speed automatic is optional. Unfortunately we haven’t driven a Compass with either of these transmissions, just the 9-speed automatic that we have found to be clunky in the Cherokee and other Chrysler models, especially downshifting for acceleration. So we might prefer the 6-speed automatic. By comparison, the new 9-speed in the GMC Terrain is smooth.</p>, <p>The independent suspension is tuned for comfort, except on the Trailhawk. But even the Trailhawk delivers a good ride. The Sport’s 16-inch wheels deliver the best ride, the Latitude’s 17-inchers are fine too, but with the 19-inch wheels the ride gets jittery.</p>, <p>There is some body lean, but the Compass still enters corners with confidence. The thick steering wheel suggests a level of sportiness that the chassis and steering don’t deliver, however. The Compass doesn’t handle like a Ford Escape or Mazda CX-5.</p>, <p>The Trailhawk offers something that the other compact crossovers don’t, never mind that it’s still only half-way to offroad. It’s a gentrified small Jeep, not a true-blue one. But it’s a nice compromise.</p>, <p>The raised bumpers give it higher approach and departure angles, but they detract from the clean styling. The one inch increased ground clearance gives it a total of 8.4 inches. The 9-speed automatic is programmed for rock crawling at very slow speed. But mostly, the traction control system adds two modes.</p>, <p>The Compass is one of the best looking compact crossovers. Its engine is dated and the 9-speed automatic lacks refinement. Ride quality is fine. The cabin is too narrow for comfort and the seat padding is too slim.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-genesis-g80/
[<p>The Genesis G80 is soft, comfortable and quiet, not intended to be a dynamic handler. Genesis is to Hyundai what Lexus is to Toyota, as of 2017, and the G80 rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan shares the Genesis showroom with the larger, more luxurious G90.</p>, <p>For 2018, Genesis G80 gets a twin-turbo Sport model, although it’s still a long way from handling like a Lexus.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54976" height="138" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Genesis G80 is revised with new front and rear fascia, tweaked headlamps, an updated eight-speed automatic transmission. Changes in the cabin include a restyled instrument cluster and revised infotainment system, and a rearview camera as standard equipment.</p>, <p>A 3.8-liter V6 comes standard, with a 5.0-liter V8 in the top model. The new G80 Sport gets a 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6.</p>, <p>The 3.8-liter V6 makes a healthy 311 horsepower and 293 pound-feet of torque. The V8 makes 420 hp and 383 lb-ft. The new twin-turbo V6 makes 365 hp and 376 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>The base V6 rates 22 miles per gallon EPA Combined city and highway, the V8 gets 19 mpg Combined, and the twin-turbo V6 rates 20 mpg.</p>, <p>The standard warranty is 10 years and 100,000 miles for the powertrain. A standard service agreement includes three years or 36,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance, with free pickup/dropoff and loaner.</p>, <p>The 2018 Genesis G80 3.8 ($41,750) comes with the 3.8-liter V6, leather upholstery, 8-inch infotainment system with navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto, a 7-speaker stereo, heated front seats with 12-way adjustability on the driver’s side, and bi-xenon headlights, and rearview camera.</p>, <p>Premium ($5,000) adds a 14-speaker Lexicon stereo, vented front seats, heated rear seats, a sunroof, LED foglights, a 7-inch display in the instrument cluster, a wireless charging pad, and front and rear parking sensors. Ultimate ($10,100) adds a 17-speaker Lexicon stereo, 9.2-inch touchscreen, upgraded leather upholstery with real wood and aluminum trim, surround-view camera system, LED headlamps, 16-way driver seat, head-up display, and power trunk.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54977" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-sport-models.jpg" width="200"/>The G80 Sport Ultimate ($55,250) features the 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6, 19-inch wheels, tuned suspension with continuous damping control, sport steering wheel and front seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, and copper bits in the exterior trim.</p>, <p>The G80 5.0 Ultimate ($57,000) brings the V8 engine with 19-inch wheels, a quad-tipped exhaust, and a suede headliner.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available for every model ($2500), and includes heated seats and steering wheel.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54980" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Genesis G80 is classic and handsome, with a stylish tall roofline. The new Sport looks fresh, with copper accents in the grille surround, on the center caps on the wheels, and around the LED headlamps.</p>, <p>The G80 cabin is lovely, packed with plush leather and real wood, and real carbon fiber and copper in the Sport. Fit and finish is excellent. Aluminum around the optional electronic shift lever looks fantastic. The shifter itself may be less fantastic to figure out.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54982" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The switchgear, too. Much of the cabin might be as luxurious as a Mercedes or Lexus, but the plastic buttons on the instrument panel say Hyundai.</p>, <p>The front seats are extremely comfortable, broad and widely adjustable. Options to the seat include heating, ventilation, and adjustable lumbar and bolsters. But no massage like the BMW 5-Series.</p>, <p>The tall roofline makes climbing into and out of the rear seats simple. There’s a decent 35 inches of legroom, but it’s less than BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The trunk holds 15.3 cubic feet of cargo space, less than average for a car this size.</p>, <p>The cabin is supremely quiet. Noise seems to vanish, from the engine, road, wind and tires. Bring on the 17-speaker Lexicon sound system.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54981" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-driving-sport.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-driving-sport.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-g80-driving-sport-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>We think the 3.8-liter V6 is the best and most practical all-around engine. It’s got plenty of power, with 311 horsepower and 293 pound-feet of torque. It gets the best fuel mileage of the three engines, never mind that 22 mpg in a V6 sedan is nothing to write home about.</p>, <p>But mostly we prefer this engine because it’s lighter, so models with the V6 handle more sweetly. And we include the new Sport model with its active suspension, when we say that.</p>, <p>The ride in all models is relaxed and isolated. The suspension beautifully soaks up bumps, although it’s too soft for hard cornering. The G80 leans in turns and the steering lacks precision. Even in the Sport, with its continuous damping control. The steering on the Sport, though light and lacking feedback, manages to be precise.</p>, <p>The new eight-speed automatic transmission is quick and smooth.</p>, <p>What you feel in the new 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 engine is the torque. Almost all of its 376 pound-feet of torque is available from a very low 1300 rpm up to 4500 rpm, so it is eager and always ready to leap forward. The throttle response is quick and there’s no turbo lag. You can’t even tell it’s turbocharged, you just know it’s fast.</p>, <p>The Genesis G80 is not inexpensive yet may not yet be perceived as true luxury. The G80 doesn’t handle as well as a Lexus and fuel efficiency is not a strong point.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-audi-a6/
[<p>The Audi A6 is a midsize near-luxury sedan with a reserved demeanor, no nonsense, while offering the features, refinement and safety found on more expensive sedans. Underneath, the A6 is much like the A7, without the passion or athleticism expressed by the A7’s sheetmetal. That’s not the mission of the A6.</p>, <p>The A6 with the passion mission is the S6, having something special under the hood, namely a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 with 450 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. It’s got quattro all-wheel drive and a seven-speed twin-clutch transmission, an engineering technology where Audi has always been a step ahead.</p>, <p>Standard engine in the A6 is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder making 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. It uses either a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission with front-wheel drive, or an 8-speed automatic with quattro all-wheel drive. It gets excellent fuel mileage, EPA rated at 28 Combined miles per gallon.</p>, <p>Quattro is proven, after many years of Audi again being a step ahead in all-wheel drive development. It’s well worth the cost, if inclement weather is in the car’s life.</p>, <p>There’s also a supercharged 3.0-liter V6, making 340 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque, with an 8-speed automatic and quattro. It’s a sweet engine, in a perfect spot between the four-cylinder and V8. It comes with both the Prestige model and Sport model, and works for both.</p>, <p>The only changes for the 2018 A6 are shuffled packages bringing more features at a lower price. The former Competition model becomes the Sport model, with a Competition package available.</p>, <p>The A6 Premium ($49,700) with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine comes with front-wheel drive or with quattro all-wheel drive ($51,900). Features include Google Earth maps, in-car high-speed data, and Bluetooth audio streaming. Navigation and keyless ignition are standard on all models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54967" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a6-s6.jpg" width="200"/>There’s also a Sport model with front-wheel drive ($51,200) or quattro ($53,400), with a flat-bottomed steering wheel and Valcona leather seats.</p>, <p>A6 Prestige ($56,500) comes with the supercharged 3.0-liter V6. There’s also a Sport model with the V6 and quattro all-wheel drive ($58,000).</p>, <p>The S6 is available in Premium Plus ($71,900) and Prestige ($74,400) trim.</p>, <p>The A6 is handsome, if understated. Its roofline sweeps back like a coupe. But it’s starting to show its age, even with LED headlamps. It’s rounded at the corners, and has sharp character lines on the sides, and the huge grille.</p>, <p>The A6 isn’t as stylish as the A7 with its lower roofline. But it can look hot, with the Black Optic package, including 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54969" height="107" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-s6-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The S6 is sinewy, with a muscular hood bulging with a V8, and black trapezoidal grille. A character line runs along the sides, just under the windowline, and only shows itself in the sun, when wearing light colors. At the rear, there’s a small diffuser that hints at a need for speed, and quad-tipped exhaust ports that fire a V8 bellow into the sky.</p>, <p>The dashboard and instrument panel are low and slim, with a pop-up display screen in the center. The standard S trim spruces up the interior.</p>, <p>The A6 has less room in the cabin than many midsize cars, because its nose is longer and it trunk shorter (with an average 14.1 cubic feet). There’s still good head and legroom, although taller drivers might find their right knee hitting the wide center tunnel.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54970" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a6-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a6-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a6-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The front seat is highly comfortable, we like the headrests. Heated and ventilated front seats are available, standard on the Prestige model.</p>, <p>Two six-footers can fit in back, with their knees touching the front seatbacks. The rear seats are highly comfortable; they fold for cargo, but not completely flat.</p>, <p>The fit and finish in the cabin is excellent, as it should be for a fifty-thousand-dollar (starting price) car. There are dozens of joints and seams in the trim and upholstery, it’s not easy to get them all right.</p>, <p>Like other German sedans, small storage bins in the cabin are few, and cupholders are small, although the door pockets have spots for water bottles. The center armrest bin is shallow and the glovebox small.</p>, <p>There’s an available head-up display, showing primarily the car’s speed, near the bottom of the windshield.</p>, <p>The S6 gets contrast stitching and available red hides, with carbon trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54968" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a6-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a6-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a6-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The A6 performance is solid, admirable, with a good ride. The 2.0-liter turbocharged makes a strong 252 horsepower and super-strong 273 pound-feet of torque, while the 7-speed dual clutch automated gearbox shifts with precision and speed, while being good for fuel mileage.</p>, <p>Quattro uses an 8-speed automatic that we like for its ability to find, hold, and swap gears with ease.</p>, <p>We’ve got a lot of seat time in different versions of the A6, and have found the handling to be consistently adept but uninspired, and short on feedback. The 3.0-liter is more engaging, but still without passion.</p>, <p>The supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 makes 333 horsepower in the Prestige and 340 in the Sport. Its 325 pound-feet of torque gives it oomph. The Competition package adds a sport-oriented rear limited slip differential that we’ve enjoyed on other models.</p>, <p>The S6 offers a lot performance for the $72k price, although it can’t match American iron on that score. Its twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 might be hugely powerful, but it’s also compact, and mounted as far back in the engine bay as possible, for better weight distribution and handling. The cornering is precise, although somewhat disconnected from the road.</p>, <p>Using its 450 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque, the S6 accelerates from zero to sixty in just 4.3 seconds. That’s about the same as its German competitors the Mercedes-AMG E43 sedan and BMW M550i xDrive.</p>, <p>The Quattro in the S6 is 40/60 front-to-rear split. The 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is seamless.</p>, <p>There’s and available sports rear differential that helps the control in turns, but it comes with a dynamic steering package that changes the ratio in a non-progressive and unpredictable fashion. We could do without it. But the rear differential might be worth it.</p>, <p>The 252-horsepower 2.0 turbo is a good engine with a great transmission, while the supercharged 3.0-liter V6 is worth its extra $5k, if you need 340 horsepower. The styling is smooth but dated, and the cabin is a bit small. The S6 throws 450 horsepower at you. It’s fast and handles competently, but there are sedans that are faster and handle better.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Audi A4 benefitted from a full redesign for 2017, so there are no major changes for 2018. For 2018, its high-performance sibling, the S4, gets the redesign that the A4 got for 2017.</p>, <p>The all-new 2018 Audi S4 features a lower nose, higher LED headlamps that are wispy and boomerang-shaped, and sharper sheetmetal creases. The S4 is powered by a new turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 making 354 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. The single twin-scroll turbocharger is designed to reduce turbo lag by feeding air to one bank of cylinders before the other. Using an 8-speed automatic transmission, it bursts from zero to sixty miles per hour in 4.4 seconds, faster than the BMW 340i and Mercedes AMG C43. The 2018 S4 front suspension uses more aluminum to reduce unsprung weight and thus improve handling, while available adaptive dampers lower the chassis. Another new option is a sport rear differential that moves power between the rear wheels in the Quattro system, and comes with sport steering that’s maybe too quick at high speed.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54959" height="109" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-models.jpg" width="200"/>The A4 comes standard with a super smooth 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 190 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque. Called the 2.0 TFSI ultra, it gets an awesome 37 Highway miles per gallon EPA rating, mated to a paddle-shifting 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automated transmission. It’s a superb standard powertrain.</p>, <p>The upgrade engine is a strong 2.0-liter turbo making 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque, using that same 7-speed twin clutch transmission. It accelerates from zero to sixty in 5.6 seconds. With front-wheel-drive, the A4 with this engine rates 25/33 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined, and 1 less mpg with Quattro. This engine is called the 2.0 TFSI, which we find confusing, given the base engine is called 2.0 TFSI ultra.</p>, <p>Rivals to Audi A4 include BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Jaguar XE, Cadillac ATS, and Lexus IS.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the A4 five stars overall, but only four stars for front impact. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has made the A4 a Top Safety Pick Plus, when equipped with active LED headlamps that bend around corners.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54962" height="101" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-final-1.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Audi A4 Premium comes with front-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter TFSI ultra engine ($36,000) or the 2.0 TFSI engine ($40,500). Standard equipment on the Premium includes leather seating surfaces, power front seats, rearview camera, xenon-plus headlamps, sunroof, 17-inch wheels, 10-speaker audio with Bluetooth audio streaming, and smartphone interface.</p>, <p>Premium Plus ($39,200) adds 18-inch wheels, parking sensors, S line exterior trim, and a Bang &amp; Olufsen 755-watt, 19-speaker 3-D audio system. It’s available with the upgrade engine ($43,700).</p>, <p>Prestige ($45,500) models add the virtual cockpit instrument display, head-up display, surround-view cameras, blind-spot monitoring, and navigation with voice control. Prestige models can get the adaptive damping suspension, plus a Driver Assistance Package that includes adaptive cruise control and traffic-sign recognition. The upgrade engine is available ($50,000).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54957" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-s4-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-s4-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-s4-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Quattro all-wheel drive and a choice of manual transmission or 7-speed dual-clutch are available.</p>, <p>For 2018 there is a new Black Optic Plus package with black and red interior and exterior trim. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Safety options include LED headlamps, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-follow capability, and rear-seat side airbags.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54954" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The A4 is aerodynamically clean, while being neither dramatic nor adventuresome. It doesn’t bedazzle, it endures, as it has for 20 years since it was introduced. Its nose is a bit more athletic than it used to be, with a horizontal grille that wraps and flows rearward to a taller and more wedge-shaped tail. A large greenhouse tapers smartly toward the roof.</p>, <p>The S4 is the dramatic one, totally athletic in its looks.</p>, <p>The cabin is fairly roomy, with front seats that are comfortable and supportive, if a bit snug in their firm bolstering. The standard leather and ambient LED lighting are nice. A disciplined instrument panel makes the digital displays stand out. The standard screen is seven inches. The dashboard is low so driver visibility is good, and it wraps around the sides a bit. The steering wheel isn’t too big, and its controls are easy to use. Toggle switches trigger the tri-zone automatic climate control system.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54951" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>There is an available giant 12.3-inch color display for navigation, and a full-color head-up display for speed and other driver data. With the available virtual cockpit, dazzling screens face the driver. Most models have electronic displays that can switch from one view to another. Though the displays are stunning and refresh quickly, the system can be distracting.</p>, <p>Until the 2017 model, rear legroom was tight in the A4, and the seat cushion was low, but no longer. Although it’s on the small side for a midsize car, it’s as roomy as rivals, in particular the BMW 3 Series. A tall passenger can ride comfortably behind a tall driver. In fact, five adults can fit inside.</p>, <p>The latest version of Multi-Media Interface (MMI) accepts inputs from voice, steering-wheel controls, or handwritten letters on a scratchpad. All A4s now include smartphone-app features.</p>, <p>Even the base engine displays gratifying zeal, natural engine sounds while being smooth and well balanced. The paddle-shifting twin-clutch 7-speed transmission is evolved and not jerky like some of them.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54952" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-a4-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The A4 doesn’t have the best handling among midsize sedans, as some of the competitors have the advantage of rear-wheel drive; but it’s better than most and its road manners are impressive. The chassis was stiffened with the recent redesign, while the weight was reduced, and it shows. The adaptive dampers are well worth their cost, as they soften the bumps while giving firmness to the control. A mode in the electric power steering increases the boost and broadens the steering angle at low speeds, easing urban maneuvering. Brake action is progressive, with excellent pedal feel.</p>, <p>Audi Drive Select includes four modes: Auto, Comfort, Dynamic, and Individual. The A4 feels most adept with the active dampers and the steering and transmission in dynamic mode. It responds promptly and takes corners predictably.</p>, <p>Still, handling isn’t quite as sharp and sporty in the front-wheel-drive based A4 as that of some of its rear-wheel-drive rivals. In inclement conditions, however, its legendary Quattro all-wheel drive should give the Audi an advantage.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54956" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-s4-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-s4-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-s4-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>As for the new S4, the turbocharger’s feeding one bank of three cylinders first, and then the other, works as designed to reduce turbo lag. The S4 never gets breathless, and comes on the power briskly and without drama. Almost all of the torque is available early, at a super low 1350 rpm.</p>, <p>The 8-speed automatic transmission rips off confident shifts with the steering-wheel paddles. But it isn’t quick, and, regardless of the drive mode the car is in, it’s eager to upshift to save fuel, unless you’re standing on the gas.</p>, <p>The S4 uses four-wheel independent suspension, with the five-link front setup revised for 2018 to be lighter. The new adaptive dampers lower the ride height by one inch, and even in Dynamic mode they’re not stiff. In fact, all of the modes feel on the side of comfort. The S4 seems meant to be an all-around car, rather than an aggressive sport sedan, despite its aggressive stance.</p>, <p>The available rear differential that moves the torque between the rear wheels in corners enables the S4 to perform well on the track, but the sport steering that comes with it is pretty aggressive. The variable ratio quickens with speed, but it’s unpredictable, not progressively linear, so the S4 can get darty when you don’t want it to be. You have to be careful and sensitive with the steering wheel when you’re pushing it.</p>, <p>Audi A4 comes with a superlative powertrain, with the smoothest 2.0 turbo in the business, and a fully evolved 7-speed dual clutch automated transmission. Clean and conservative styling, satisfying ride, good-enough cornering, and competitive cabin technology. The S4 is redesigned for 2018, with sharper styling, a powerful V6 turbo, new adaptive dampers, and a sophisticated rear differential.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-acura-tlx/
[<p>The Acura TLX is a front-wheel-drive compact/midsize premium sedan that was launched as a 2015 and didn’t change for its first three years. Its merits were often lost in the arguments over whether its grille that looked like a vector-shaped shield was distinctive or ugly.</p>, <p>For 2018, TLX gets rid of that grille, with a cleaner front fascia, new LED self-dimming headlamps, and a subtly bulked-up hood. Inside, there’s ambient lighting piping on the sides of the center console, along with new seat designs.</p>, <p>There’s also a sporty new model with its own grille and fascia called the A-Spec, with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The Acura TLX A-Spec has a firmer suspension and amplified intake noise into the cabin. Heavily bolstered seats and a thick steering wheel are added to complement the suspension. In addition to distinctive exterior trim, there are 19-inch wheels and four-inch wide exhaust outlets in the rear bumper. It’s designed to challenge sporty models from Lexus, BMW, Alfa Romeo and Mercedes-Benz.</p>, <p>Acura TLX competes with near-luxury models from Germany, including the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and Audi A3.</p>, <p>The standard engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder making 206 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque, enough to give the nimble TLX a balanced character. The bigger engine is a 3.5-liter V6 making 290 horsepower and 267 pound-feet of torque, but because it adds 500 pounds to the weight of the TLX, it doesn’t feel that much quicker than the four-cylinder. In addition, its 9-speed automatic transmission isn’t as smooth as the 8-speed dual-clutch automated transmission in the four-cylinder model.</p>, <p>However if you want all-wheel-drive, specifically Acura’s sophisticated Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD), it only comes with the V6.</p>, <p>The TLX earns five stars in crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In one of the tests performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, for small-overlap frontal impact, the TLX ranked only Marginal. Other IIHS tests yielded Good scores (the highest rating). When fitted with optional safety features, the TLX was rated Superior for frontal-crash prevention.</p>, <p>Fuel-efficiency is good on the highway, with a big drop in the city. The four-cylinder TLX is EPA-rated at 24/35 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined. The front-drive V6 model is EPA-rated at 21/34 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. SH-AWD sinks the Highway figure to 31 mpg.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54944" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Acura TLX 2.4L ($33,000) includes 2.4-liter engine, rearview camera, moonroof, power seats, keyless start, Bluetooth, seven-speaker audio with satellite radio, and hill start assist. The Technology Package ($3700) adds navigation, AcuraLink infotainment, perforated leather upholstery, and a premium 10-speaker Acura/ELS Studio audio system. (All prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>TLX 3.5L ($36,200) gets the V6 engine and 18-inch wheels and is available with the Technology Package ($39,900) or Advance Package ($43,750) that adds adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, front/rear parking sensors, and heated/ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>Other optional safety features include forward collision warning, lane-keeping assist, and blind-spot monitoring.</p>, <p>TLX 3.5L SH-AWD ($38,200) includes all-wheel-drive and V6, and is available with the Technology and Advance packages ($45,750).</p>, <p>TLX A-Spec comes with either front-wheel drive ($42,800) or SH-AWD ($44,800).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54947" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Curiously, except for a coupe-like arched silhouette, and the grille they’ve given up on, the TLX has not gone with the flow of Acura’s more edgy designs. There’s little that’s edgy about it. It doesn’t appear to be trying to keep up with sharper designs from Lexus, Infiniti, Audi and Alfa Romeo. Even its lowly cousin the Honda Accord is more eye-catching in some models.</p>, <p>However the changes for the 2018 TLX make it prettier, with a cleaner more muscular look. Its grille is no longer polarizing. By replacing the solid shield with black mesh, and cleaning up the air intakes at the bottom of the front fascia, and raising and shaping the three character lines in the hood, it now looks classy. Even a bit longer, because the eye is no longer drawn to the grille. It’s still not distinctive, however, just clean.</p>, <p>Flared rear fenders and a lip spoiler add spirit. The taillamps have been tweaked a bit. While the V6 model gets boring rectangular exhaust outlets, the A-Spec gets a hot pair of four-inch barrels that are integrated into the bumper.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54943" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The TLX is on the large side of the compact category in overall dimensions, while being the small side of midsize in passenger space. At 106.5 cubic feet, total passenger space doesn’t match the 3 Series or C-Class. Indeed, the TLX is much better for four than five.</p>, <p>The cabin layout is efficient, with simple but premium materials, but it trails its rivals. The seats are comfortable enough. The instrument panel is attractive and easy to read. Twin display screens are mounted on the center stack. Interior storage is good, including door bins, a big central console, and sizable glovebox.</p>, <p>On the passenger side, the view sinks to bleak. That rider sees an awkward expanse of empty black dashboard. The plainness reaches to the rear seats, where legroom is a bit less than European.</p>, <p>The blissfully quiet ride redeems a lot. Wind and road sounds barely exist. It’s serene in the cabin.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54946" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-tlx-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>With either engine, the TLX rides and handles better than average, but the difference between the two is dramatic, so one of them is way better than average, guess which one.</p>, <p>We found the four-cylinder with front-wheel drive to have the crispest cornering, partly because it weighs about 500 pounds less than the V6 model. Excellent suspension tuning complements taut, precise steering. Bumpy roads do not upset it. Nimble low-speed behavior and on-highway stability are helped by Acura’s Precision All-Wheel Steer system, which is standard with the 2.4-liter model.</p>, <p>Not only that, the engine is eager to rev, and the 8-speed dual-clutch automated transmission is brilliant. A torque converter eliminates jerky shifts, so it feels like a conventional automatic. It might be the first twin-clutch with a torque converter.</p>, <p>There is no denying the thrust of the V6 is stronger. Its 290 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque is impressive, and is well contained by the optional Super-Handling All-Wheel-Drive system. The torque peaks at 4500 rpm, so the acceleration will remain strong at higher rpm.</p>, <p>But the 9-speed automatic brings the engine down. We criticized Acura’s implementation of the German ZF transmission in our 2017 review, and Acura says it was improved for 2018, and indeed it’s more willing to engage from a stop. But it’s dynamically inferior to the 8-speed automatic in the BMW 340i, the 7-speed dual-clutch in the Audi A4, and even the 8-speed DCT (dual clutch) in the 4-cylinder Acura TSX. The upshifts are too slow even with the driving mode at its most aggressive, and the downshifts too are in no hurry. Besides, nine gears seem like too many when manually shifting.</p>, <p>The TLX A-Spec uses only the V6. It gets stiffer springs and dampers, and a larger rear anti-roll bar, but you can’t feel that much of a difference, compared to the base TLX with its inline four. We can’t help but imagine an A-Spec with the smaller and lighter four-cylinder, but it doesn’t exist.</p>, <p>Active Sound Control system pumps in a throaty intake song.</p>, <p>The Acura TLX comes at a lower price point than the competition, with a high level of standard equipment. With styling revisions for 2018, its looks befits its capabilities. The 2.4-liter engine is the way to go, with adequate acceleration, nimble handling, a quiet ride, and good fuel economy. The SH-AWD all-wheel drive is exceptional. The available packages cost a lot, and are easy to live without.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff report.</p>]

[<p>The Hyundai Santa Fe Sport is a crossover SUV smaller than the midsize Santa Fe but larger than the compact Tucson.</p>, <p>Introduced as a 2014 model, Santa Fe Sport benefitted from a major freshening for 2017, with new front and rear styling, a better ride, and a cabin sprucing. There are no major changes for 2018.</p>, <p>Rivals include the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Ford Escape, and Chevrolet Equinox.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with direct injection, making 185 horsepower and 178 pound-feet of torque, less than some rivals. With its six-speed automatic transmission, it gets 21/27/24 miles per gallon, less than some rivals. The all-wheel drive gets two less, or 22 mpg combined.</p>, <p>The upgrade engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo making 240 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. The six-speed automatic uses gears more appropriate for the quick takeoffs. It gets one less mile per gallon.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive is available for every Santa Fe Sport. With the 2.0 turbo engine, it can tow 3500 pounds (the regular Santa Fe, with its V6 engine, can tow 5000 pounds).</p>, <p>The crash-test scores are excellent. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Sport five stars, while the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the top scores for its crash tests, including the challenging small-overlap collision, which simulates hitting a pole or tree. Rearview camera is standard. Equipped with optional forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, the Sport rates Top Safety Pick Plus from the IIHS.</p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport ($24,950) comes with the 2.4-liter engine, fabric upholstery, cruise control, remote keyless entry, daytime running lights, LED-accented projector headlights, cargo cover, and 17-inch alloy wheels. Seven airbags are standard, including a driver’s knee airbag. The AM/FM/SiriusXM/CD player has auxiliary and USB ports, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and six speakers.</p>, <p>Santa Fe Sport 2.0T ($31,350) with the 2.0-liter turbo gets heated leather seats, dual-zone automatic climate control; keyless ignition; hands-free liftgate; blind-spot monitors; 7.0-inch touchscreen; Hyundai’s Blue Link telematics; 18-inch wheels; and trailer wiring.</p>, <p>Santa Fe Sport 2.0T Ultimate ($35,650) adds a panoramic sunroof, 8.0-inch touchscreen, premium sound system, heated steering wheel and heated rear seats, 19-inch wheels, and a surround-view camera. An optional Technology package includes lane-departure warnings, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warnings and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive ($1,550) is available on all models. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>For a compact crossover, the Santa Fe Sport has looks that are quite appealing. It represents a successful blend and sharp application of the best modern Hyundai styling themes.</p>, <p>An hexagonal grille is flanked by foglamps and LED-accented headlamps. The side sills span largely from front to rear wheelwell. The rear end looks balanced in the layout of glass and taillamps.</p>, <p>Dual tailpipes exit at the right rear, maybe an attempt to be masculine. The ground clearance is 7.3 inches, more than a sedan but less than a Subaru Outback.</p>, <p>The cabin is roomier than most rivals, especially in front. It’s practical and uses quality materials. The dashboard undulates over controls flanked by large climate vents. Big knobs adjust the audio and fan. The available panoramic sunroof can open the cabin to the sky, but lowers headroom.</p>, <p>The bolstering in the front seat cushions is sufficient, and the backrests are nicely shaped.</p>, <p>The rear seat splits and folds, and slides more than five inches fore and aft, in all models except the base with fabric upholstery. The seatbacks recline, as well.</p>, <p>Behind the rear seat, there’s a solid 35.4 cubic feet of cargo space, and with the seat folded the volume grows to 71.5 cubic feet. There’s a spot under the floor that can contain a laptop. A cargo cover is standard.</p>, <p>Best of all, the front passenger seat folds flat, to open worlds of versatility.</p>, <p>The standard 2.4-liter engine doesn’t cut it for us; it feels breathless and overtaxed, especially when carrying passengers.</p>, <p>It takes the 2.0-liter turbo to get to 60 mph in seven seconds, which is a respectable and more livable performance, while its fuel mileage is just one mpg less. But the main thing is the confidence and safety in passing, with the 2.0t.</p>, <p>The six-speed automatic is programmed with effective shift points, and a manual mode is available to shift at the lever on the console.</p>, <p>Every Santa Fe Sport has Drive Mode with three settings: Sport, Eco, and Normal. Sport mode delivers the most precise handling, but that isn’t really saying a lot, as the steering isn’t very sharp to start with.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive system uses an open center differential to move power from the front wheels to the rears when traction is needed. It’s not an off-road system, but definitely improves driving in snow, ice and mud. Also on dry pavement in corners, since the system torque vectoring to add precision to the grip.</p>, <p>We’ve ruled out the base engine because it’s lame, now the problem is that the better engine, the 2.0t, costs $6400 more, so there goes the bargain. However the 2.0t has many more features, including heated leather seats, but you’re still looking at $34k with freight for an all-wheel drive model, and still not the Ultimate. The fuel mileage and handling are not reasons to buy. There are many worthy contenders, so it’s hard to find a reason to call the Santa Fe Sport the best value.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>Known for value, Santa Fe is the biggest SUV in the Hyundai lineup, 8.5 inches longer than the Santa Fe Sport. All models have three rows of seating, although it’s not the roomiest third row.</p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe isn’t significantly changed from 2017 when it was restyled, so it still looks fairly fresh.

The V6 in the Santa Fe makes a strong 290 horsepower, and is tuned for torque.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive available. The Santa Fe can tow 5000 pounds.</p>, <p>With front-wheel drive, the Santa Fe SE gets an EPA-rated 18 miles per gallon City, 25 mpg Highway, 21 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops the rated mileage by one, same as the fully loaded front-wheel-drive Ultimate.</p>, <p>Santa Fe SE ($30,850) gets stain-resistant fabric upholstery, 12-way power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control, AM/FM/XM/CD audio with USB and Bluetooth connectivity, 7.0-inch touchscreen, power windows and doors, cruise control, rearview camera, automatic headlamps, and 18-inch alloy wheels. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Santa Fe SE Ultimate ($38,850) adds surround-view cameras, parking sensors, heated and ventilated front seats, power passenger seat, 8.0-inch touchscreen, panoramic sunroof, hands-free liftgate, and 19-inch wheels. It also gets standard forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane-departure warnings.</p>, <p>Santa Fe Limited Ultimate ($39,550) includes leather upholstery, heated front seats and steering wheel, second-row captain’s chairs, electro-luminescent gauges, blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-change assist.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive ($1750) is available.</p>, <p>Hyundai’s BlueLink telematics bring in a suite of services such as remote unlock and start. For 2018, Hyundai adds in three years of free BlueLink service.</p>, <p>On its 110-inch wheelbase, Hyundai’s biggest SUV is still smaller than some rivals in its class, yet it has the appearance of bigness. But no less stylish, with its 2017 touch-up keeping it competitive in the looks department. The new bumpers went a long way. On the Limited and Ultimate, LED foglamps flank a slim, wide mouth.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54928" height="159" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-santafe-interior.jpg" width="200"/>An undulating dashboard surface dips and rises for the centerstack and panel for the gauges. Audio and fan adjust with big easy knobs. Just ahead of the shift lever there’s a deep open storage cubby. The materials complement and fit each other well. SE owners have to live with more plastic.</p>, <p>Seats are shapely and supportive, helped by bolstering that’s not too firm. There’s ample legroom in front, but the headroom suffers under the panoramic sunroof that’s standard in the Ultimate. The comfortable headrests are at an ideal angle.</p>, <p>Thanks to the 110-inch wheelbase, the second row gets good legroom to go along with the comfortable bench seat, and even more comfortable captain’s chairs. The third row is for kids. The wheelbase isn’t long enough to make real room back there.</p>, <p>With the third row up, there’s 13.5 cubic feet of storage space in back, about the same as the trunk of a small sedan. But when the third row is folded flat, there’s more than 40 cubic feet behind the second row, and that’s quite healthy. And there’s more in a shallow bin beneath the cargo floor.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54929" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-santafe-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-santafe-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-santafe-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Acceleration with the 3.3-liter V6 engine is reasonable, thanks to the transmission’s willingness (after a brief pause) to kick down when you stomp the gas pedal. The transmission shifts quickly when it’s shifted by the driver in manual mode, using the lever on the console. No paddles.</p>, <p>The Santa Fe offers three driving modes. Normal is fine for most of the time, but Sport presents sharper steering on two-lanes, and Eco limits acceleration, slows the throttle response, and slackens the gear changes to deliver the best fuel mileage.</p>, <p>The electric power steering is taken from the Hyundai Elantra GT, and contributes to predictable handling. The suspension is calmer and the ride quieter than it used to be. Even with the 19-inch wheels on the Limited and Ultimate, the worst surfaces are effectively dampened.</p>, <p>Santa Fe engineers have made a big effort to reduce noise and vibration, and suspension sounds have been toned down, while barely a whir can be heard from the elderly drivetrain under acceleration.</p>, <p>The Santa Fe isn’t the best in its class, but it behaves well, performs respectably, and delivers strong value.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-jeep-cherokee/
[<p>Jeep Cherokee is a mid-size crossover SUV, with available four-wheel drive and superior off-road capability. Cherokee is larger than the Compass, which is larger than the Renegade.</p>, <p>There are no major changes for 2018, though trim levels have been changed, mostly adding equipment. Cherokee was last redesigned for 2014.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cherokee comes as five models: Latitude, Latitude Plus, Limited, Overland, and the off-road oriented Trailhawk. (The Sport, the previous base model, has been discontinued.) Front-wheel drive is standard, but Cherokee makes much more sense with the available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Latitude brings more standard equipment to the entry level, including a rearview camera, high-intensity HID headlamps, roofrails, foglamps, aluminum wheels, and body-colored mirrors and door handles. Latitude Plus is a new model intended to offer more features for the dollar. Limited and Trailhawk models likewise offer more standard equipment for 2018 than previously.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54920" height="154" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cherokee-trailhawk.jpg" width="200"/>The Trailhawk is all-wheel drive, with Active Drive Lock, a locking rear differential; it also gets skid plates and tow hooks, to go with unique front and rear fascia and ground clearance that’s higher by one inch.</p>, <p>The other models come with front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive optional. Active Drive I is the basic setup, for four-cylinder models. Active Drive II adds a dual-range transfer case. Selec-Terrain adds modes for Sport, Snow, Sand/Mud, and Rock.</p>, <p>The standard engine is smooth and quiet, refined but aging, a 2.4 liter four-cylinder making 184 horsepower, which is enough if there aren’t back-seat passengers or heavy cargo.</p>, <p>The 3.2-liter V6 is more like it, making 271 horsepower and 239 pound-feet of torque; with a tow package, it can tow up to 4500 pounds.</p>, <p>A 9-speed automatic transmission is used with both engines.</p>, <p>The front-wheel-drive Latitude with the four-cylinder engine gets an EPA-estimated 21 City, 30 Highway, 25 Combined miles per gallon; it falls to 23 Combined mpg with the Active Drive I all-wheel drive, and the same 23 mpg Combined rating with Active Drive II, but 1 less mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>The front-wheel-drive V6 gets nearly the same, rated at 21/29/24 mpg. With Active Drive I it rates 20/27/23 mpg, and Active Drive II it gets 18/26/21 mpg. The V6 comes with Stop/Start technology, which turns off the engine at stoplights and pauses, intended to save a bit of fuel.</p>, <p>The heavier all-wheel-drive Trailhawk gets 19/25/22 mpg with the I4 engine, and only 1 less mpg with the V6.</p>, <p>Cherokee only gets four stars overall from the NHTSA in crash testing, with five stars for side impact. Active-safety features come on the Overland and Limited models, including lane-departure and frontal-collision warnings, blind-sport monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and parking sensors.</p>, <p>The 2018 Jeep Cherokee Latitude ($24,395) comes with 2.4-liter engine, front-wheel drive, cloth seats, air conditioning, rearview camera, power features, cruise control, keyless entry, 17-inch wheels with all-season tires, and a 5.0-inch touchscreen audio system with a USB port and Bluetooth with audio streaming. The V6 isn’t available on the Latitude.</p>, <p>Latitude Plus ($26,295) adds an 8.4-inch Uconnect radio with touchscreen with smartphone-app connectivity, leather panels in the cloth seats, an eight-way power driver seat, a 115-volt outlet, keyless ignition, and satellite radio, ambient lighting, and 17-inch aluminum wheels.</p>, <p>Cherokee Limited ($29,795) upgrades with leather, 18-inch wheels, satellite radio, remote start, power heated front seats, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Equipment that became standard for 2018 includes blind-spot monitors, rear parking sensors, and a power liftgate. All-wheel drive is available ($1500).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54918" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cherokee-overland.jpg" width="200"/>Overland ($34,095) adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood add-ons, power-adjustable passenger seat, Nappa leather, foglamps dual exhausts.</p>, <p>Trailhawk ($30,995) is equipped like the Latitude Plus, but with a tougher suspension and more ground clearance, tow hooks, transmission and oil coolers, skid plates, new front and rear bumpers for better departure angles, grade-climb control, and 17-inch wheels with all-terrain tires. The features that have been added as standard for 2018 include blind-spot monitors, rear parking sensors with cross-path detection, and dual-zone climate control.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54919" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cherokee-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Cherokee has lovely lines for an SUV, not traditional; even the seven-bar grille is stylized. The headlamps are separated from the LED running lights, giving the front a tiered appearance that’s less than Jeep-like. It’s sure not square, like a Jeep Patriot for example. Even though the design has been around for five years, the Cherokee’s unexpectedness keeps it fresh.</p>, <p>The rear end and sides are more ordinary.</p>, <p>The cabin is handsome and quiet. It’s nicely finished, generally well composed, and quite refined. It’s more sporty than suv-like, blending colorful elements with subtlety. We just wish the controls weren’t hard to find. It would be nice if function matched the form.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54915" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cherokee-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cherokee-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cherokee-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>However, the infotainment system is clearly laid out, and the screen is responsive. In-car data is available by subscription.</p>, <p>The front seats are comfortable, but the cabin is narrow so shoulder room is limited, as wide drivers might rub the door panels or console, and tall ones might have trouble finding a suitable position. The headrests sit somewhat forward.</p>, <p>The rear seat can take a third passenger in the center, without argument, for a short trip. The three of them will feel cramped, although the seat slides back a few inches, and that helps.</p>, <p>There’s plenty of storage spots for small items, around the cabin. For larger items, there’s a decent 24.6 cubic feet behind the rear seat, and a healthy 58.9 cubic feet when the rear seats and front seat are folded. The cargo floor is somewhat high.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54917" height="295" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-cherokee-offroad.jpg" width="200"/>The 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is a Chrysler global engine (called Tigershark), powerful enough for the globe maybe, but with no power to spare. No room for a heavy load. With five occupants and/or a dozen cinderblocks in back, it’s a slug.</p>, <p>For the small fuel cost and extra price, the 3.2-liter V6 with nearly 90 more horsepower is a better call. It’s quick, confident and refined. It does make the Cherokee heavier in front, so it’s less nimble, and that’s a consideration. The V6 might not be the call for rugged duty, like a lot of driving on dirt roads. But it’s the call for sure if we’re talking highway towing.</p>, <p>The 9-speed automatic can be balky, indecisive and late to shift. Sport mode makes it better.</p>, <p>Cherokee behaves okay on the pavement, about average. The steering is crisp and the ride well-damped, but for everyday driving, there are better crossovers.</p>, <p>Off the road, where Jeeps rule, it’s another matter. With an I4 engine and the Active Drive II system, the Cherokee’s backwoods talents are amazing.</p>, <p>A Cherokee Trailhawk can conquer hills like you wouldn’t believe, while continuing safely and very slowly back down, using the hill descent control. With its taller ride height and off-road tires, at low speeds, the Trailhawk absorbs almost everything.</p>, <p>Jeep Cherokee has many faces. We recommend getting all-wheel drive. The V6 is superior for everyday driving, though the four-cylinder offers better handling on unpaved roads. The Trailhawk is best for rugged terrain. The Overland is nicely trimmed, if it’s in the budget. We found the 9-speed automatic unrefined.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-lexus-rx/
[<p>The Lexus RX is a midsize luxury crossover with a soft ride and practical design. The current-generation, introduced for the 2016 model year, added a healthy dose of style to its practical merits. For nearly two decades, the RX has been practically synonymous with midsize luxury crossovers. In its more fashionable current form, the RX retains its fine road manners.</p>, <p>There are no major changes for 2018. Enform Safety Connect and Service Connect are complimentary for 10 years (previously one year) on 2018 Lexus RX models, and the 2018 RX 450h offers more options than before. The 2018 RX lineup is as broad as before.</p>, <p>The RX 350 comes with a 3.5-liter V6 that develops 295 horsepower and 268 pound-feet of torque. Running on a lean combustion cycle for best gas mileage, the V6 mates with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel standard is standard, with all-wheel drive an option.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54910" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rx-f.jpg" width="200"/>RX F Sport models include paddle shifters, as well as remapped steering. Adaptive shock absorbers respond to changing road-surface conditions.</p>, <p>The gas-engine RX isn’t as quiet-running as it used to be because sports appeal has been added. F Sports are louder yet, because intake sounds from the engine are amplified and sent into the cabin, ready to stimulate the aural sense of enthusiastic drivers. A Drive Mode Selector provides Sport and Eco modes.</p>, <p>Lexus continues to produce hybrid versions. The RX 450h blends a lower-power V6 gas engine with batteries and electric motors that power rear wheels, resulting in an all-wheel-drive powertrain. Combined output is 308 horsepower, sent to a smooth-operating continuously variable transmission (CVT).</p>, <p>Every RX includes forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, active lane control, automatic high beams, and a rearview camera. Blind-spot monitoring and surround-view cameras are optional.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the front-drive model four stars overall, while the all-wheel-drive version gets the full five stars. Both got five stars for side impact, but four for frontal crash protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the (identical) 2017 RX its Top Safety Pick Plus designation. The RX earned Good results in each crash-test, meeting the organization’s standards for advanced safety technology and headlight quality. Frontal crash protection was judged Superior.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus RX 350 ($43,220) comes with front-wheel drive, the 3.5-liter V6, synthetic leather upholstery, 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, power front seats, and an 8-inch touchscreen. (Prices are MSRP for 2017 models and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p>All-wheel drive ($1,400) is available. Premium and Luxury option packages are available, each adding leather upholstery. The available navigation system can upgrade to a 12.3-inch screen.</p>, <p>RX 350 F Sport ($49,120) has an adaptive variable suspension, restyled front and rear ends, sport front seats, black mesh grille, 20-inch wheels, and supercar-inspired instrument cluster. All-wheel drive ($1,400) is available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54906" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rx-450h.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rx-450h.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rx-450h-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>RX 450h AWD ($53,035) has the hybrid powertrain and all-wheel drive, and is now available with standalone options and a Premium package.</p>, <p>RX 450h F Sport ($56,645) contains the hybrid powertrain with F Sport equipment.</p>, <p>Options include a panoramic sunroof and Mark Levinson audio.</p>, <p>Compared to its conservative predecessors, the current RX qualifies as daring. Abundant detail work, topped by a roofline that could suggest jet aircraft, imbues the RX with a more forceful personality and sleekly adventurous character.</p>, <p>Like other Lexus models, the RX is dominated by its hourglass-shaped spindle grille. Considered radical when it first appeared, the unusually tall grille is not universally admired.</p>, <p>What has been called a floating canopy roof also gives the RX a more notable appearance than some rivals. Lexus has given the bodysides exuberantly sculpted and flared surfaces.</p>, <p>While the RX body shuns conservatism, its cabin retains a calm, orderly aura with few distractions. Nothing is flashy inside, and nothing feels cluttered or overdone. Although the base RX is upholstered with synthetic leather, other versions are fitted with genuine hides, along with wood trim. Subdued materials with excellent fit and finish remain an RX highlight.</p>, <p>Five adults can fit inside. Front seats are particularly comfortable, with plenty of space all around. Soft cushioning feels fine even after a long drive, and the driving position is excellent. Entry/exit is easy, because seats are at optimum height for step-in access.</p>, <p>Back-seat occupants get relaxing accommodations with abundant space and reclining seatbacks. Split-folding rear seats offer good support. Seats in the RX 450h are an inch higher, due to the location of the hybrid batteries, but headroom isn’t affected much. Cargo space is good, with 18.4 cubic feet of storage volume behind the rear seat, expanding to 56.3 cubic feet with seatbacks folded.</p>, <p>On the horizontal-themed, uncluttered dashboard, controls are split into upper and lower zones. The infotainment setup uses a mouse-style interface and touchpad, which can respond to swiping or zooming gestures. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity are unavailable.</p>, <p>Most road and wind sounds are subdued, but F Sport passengers will hear engine noise that’s sent into the cabin. Visibility is adequate, but broad back pillars obstruct some of the rearward view.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54909" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rx-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rx-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rx-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Though the RX handles with greater sharpness than its predecessors, its primary merits include pampering of passengers and comfort on the highway. Built on a carlike foundation, the RX promises admirably unruffled ride comfort.</p>, <p>Not only is handling composed and confident, the electric power steering delivers greater road feel than expected. In F Sport models, the drive-mode selector adds Customized, Sport S, and Sport S+ modes to the usual Normal, Eco, and Sport settings.</p>, <p>Expect a firm ride from the F Sport, as well as heavier steering. Adaptive dampers stiffen as needed to firm up the ride.</p>, <p>An RX isn’t the quickest-accelerating crossover, but a front-drive model moves out swiftly with considerable authority. The CVT in the RX 450h hybrid tends to restrain performance, compared to the regular model’s conventional automatic.</p>, <p>With the RX 450h, the gasoline engine powers the front wheels, while electric power propels the rear wheels. In addition to making the hybrid all-wheel drive, this setup permits the RX 450h to start off using battery power alone.</p>, <p>Fuel economy ranks around average. With front-drive, the 2017 RX 350 was EPA-rated at 20/27 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops each estimate by 1 mpg. The RX 450h hybrid has been EPA-rated at 31/28 mpg City/Highway, or 30 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Brashly shaped and refreshing compared to past RX models, today’s version may not be quite as refined, but it’s a hard vehicle to ignore. Up front, the brazen grille might either attract or repel one’s eye, but its effect is commanding either way. Performance is a plus for the gas-engine RX 350, though not necessarily stronger in the stiffer-riding F Sport.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-audi-q5/
[<p>The all-new 2018 Audi Q5 five-passenger compact crossover begins its second generation with a new platform, cabin, engine, transmission, grille and side sculpting, and new all-wheel drive, which is now standard.</p>, <p>The 2018 Q5 is slightly longer and a couple inches wider than before. The platform comes from the Audi A4 sedan, and has more structural rigidity, as the chassis uses more aluminum. The all-wheel drive system is lighter and more sophisticated. There’s more sound-deadening material between the chassis and the cabin. The interior speaks a new design language: roomy and beautiful. There are more standard features.</p>, <p>The base 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder gets a needed horsepower increase, from the previous 220 to 258 hp, while torque gets boosted to 273 pound-feet, up from 258. It’s the same engine that’s used in the heavier Q7, so it runs more free in the Q5. It’s mated to a 7-speed automatic and all-wheel drive called Quattro Ultra, which disconnects the driveshaft to the rear wheels to save fuel; and it must work, because the new engine gets two more miles per gallon, to go with its 38 more horsepower. When power to the rear is needed, it comes back in a fraction of a second.</p>, <p>The high-performance Audi SQ5 uses a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 making 354 horsepower, mated to an eight-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Audi Q5’s rivals include BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Jaguar F-Pace, Volvo XC60, Cadillac XT5, and Range Rover Evoque.</p>, <p>Available safety features include adaptive cruise control that drives the car in stop-and-go freeway traffic, and automatic emergency braking. A new 2018 option is a warning when you start to open a passenger door into traffic.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54898" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-q5-final.jpg" width="200"/>Q5 Premium ($41,500) comes with leather upholstery, power front seats, proximity key, Xenon headlamps, roof rack, and automatic emergency braking at low speeds. Premium Plus adds LED headlamps, a panoramic moonroof, memory seats, blind spot monitoring, and automatic braking when backing up. Prestige adds a Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system and 20-inch wheels. Options abound. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54900" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-q5-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The all-new Q5 doesn’t look that much different from the old one, but it’s easier to look at. The grille remains the same basic big-mouth rounded trapezoid, but the chrome bars run horizontally instead of vertically, which is more cohesive with the car’s lines and makes the hood look longer. The headlamps are slimmer and sharper, touching and flying off the top corners of the grille, which also has a thicker border of satin metal. Along the sides, there’s a sharp crease like a high beltline above the door handles, connecting the HID or LED headlamps to the LED taillamps.</p>, <p>The SQ5 has different trim and unique alloy wheels. It’s a sleeper, with no clues that there’s 354 horsepower under the hood.</p>, <p>The Q5 cabin has changed a lot for 2018, adopting the latest Audi design direction. It ranks with the best in the segment. It’s refined, beautifully detailed, and serene, remarkably quiet and free of road noise. The instrumentation is logical. Switchgear is on a panel below the climate control, while infotainment is managed on a big touchpad.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54902" height="153" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-q5-interior.jpg" width="200"/>There’s ample room in front, with comfortable leather seats; some rivals use leatherette upholstery in their base model, and perhaps that’s why Audi calls its base model Premium. Quite a few optional wood trims are available.</p>, <p>The new architecture created more room in the rear, so now the A5 is as comfortable as others back there. Two six-footers can fit, although that third rear passenger might find his or her legs mashed together from the knees to feet, not just because of the four other long legs, but because the middle seat is flat while the outboard seats are deeply scalloped. Four are more comfortable than five.</p>, <p>The rear seats fold easily but not flat.</p>, <p>The cargo area behind the rear seat is nicely finished. It’s about 0.5 cubic feet smaller than before, as the seat was moved back for more legroom. However, when the 60/40 rear seats are down there’s almost three more cubic feet of cargo space than before.</p>, <p>The panoramic moonroof is not a sunroof; that is, the shade doesn’t fully block out the sun, so we couldn’t make the cabin cool and dark like we like it.</p>, <p>The other thing we didn’t like was the display screen fixed at the center top of the dash. It never retracts. It looks like a tablet computer on a clip. Dash top screens are not our favorite Audi feature.</p>, <p>Prestige models replace the standard analog-type instruments with Audi’s Virtual Cockpit with a configurable 12.3-inch LCD screen showing everything from digital gauges to audio controls to Google Earth navigation. The system interfaces using Audi’s MMI that has its own touchpad on the console near the shift lever.</p>, <p>The SQ5 gets sportier seats with red stitching, and available carbon-fiber trim.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54901" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-q5-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-q5-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-q5-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Audi Q5 is poised when cornering, with excellent stability at high speeds on the freeway. Its handling inspires confidence. Steering is light and feedback is limited, however, so it’s no canyon carver. It’s designed for comfort, not sport.</p>, <p>The optional Drive Select system has four modes, Auto, Comfort, Sport, and Individual, which change the steering, transmission, and throttle responses.</p>, <p>While most manufacturers are increasing the number of gears in their automatic transmissions, in pursuit of fuel mileage, the Q5 drops a gear, from eight speeds to seven. Yet efficiency improves by two miles per gallon to an EPA-rated 23 mpg City. It still gets 27 mpg Highway, for an EPA-rated 25 mpg Combined. Bottom line is that fuel economy is improved significantly while power is increased substantially.</p>, <p>We couldn’t feel much difference in the dynamics in a Q5 with the available adaptive dampers. But even set in the firmest mode, and with 20-inch wheels, the cabin was still serene and isolated.</p>, <p>On hard-packed washboard and through deep sand, we found the Q5’s suspension kept the ride surprisingly smooth on the washboard, and the Quattro Ultra all-wheel-drive was unfazed by the sand.</p>, <p>The SQ5 uses a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 making 354 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque, and a quick-shifting 8-speed automatic. It can accelerate from zero to sixty in 5.1 seconds. An available rear mechanical limited slip differential sends power to the outside wheels in corners, which helps the SQ5 feel more nimble, despite its 4400 pounds. The SQ5 comes alive in Dynamic mode.</p>, <p>The standard air suspension lowers the normal ride height of the SQ5 to 7.0 inches, a bit less than the 8.2 inches of the Q5. And it’s adjustable, so the car be raised for rugged terrain (or steep transitions in town) or lowered for freeway. The ride suffers with the optional 21-inch wheels, however. We found the 20-inch wheels offered a much better ride.</p>, <p>The all-new Audi Q5 is better looking, has a beautiful cabin with more room in the rear, a significantly more powerful and responsive four-cylinder engine that gets better fuel mileage, and a new all-wheel drive called Quattro Ultra. The base Premier model is very well equipped. The SQ5 with its turbocharged V6 offers a lot higher performance, although it’s not a canyon-carving crossover.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Toyota RAV4 is roomy and popular, a compact crossover built on the front-wheel-drive Camry platform, with all-wheel drive available.</p>, <p>For 2018, RAV4 Adventure, a new model, joins the line with a very lightly lifted suspension (half an inch). The 2018 Toyota RAV4 marks the sixth year of the current-generation model. The exterior and interior were freshened for 2016.</p>, <p>RAV4 rivals include the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Ford Escape, Subaru Forester, Mazda CX-5, and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. It’s a competitive segment. The RAV4, CR-V, Rogue, and Escape are among the top 12 best-selling vehicles in the U.S.</p>, <p>Every RAV4 except the RAV4 Hybrid is powered by 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 176 horsepower, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission with a sport-shift mode. It’s not quick, as it takes nearly nine seconds to accelerate to 60 miles per hour; and it’s not thrifty, as its EPA fuel rating is a below-average 26 miles per gallon Combined.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive Hybrid, which gets 33 miles per gallon Combined, uses a 154-horsepower version of that 2.5-liter engine; connected to Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive system, it brings 194 total horsepower. All-wheel drive is standard, with a separate electric motor driving the rear wheels. At very low speeds, it can run in electric-only mode.</p>, <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rates the RAV4 a Top Safety Pick Plus, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives it five stars overall, with four stars in frontal-crash and rollover testing.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota RAV4 is available in 16 models. RAV4 LE ($24,410) comes with front-wheel drive, air conditioning, fabric seats, 17-inch steel wheels, and AM/FM/CD audio with a 6.1-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>All-wheel-drive ($1400) is an option on any model. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.</p>, <p>RAV4 SE AWD ($32,185) upgrades with SofTex seats, paddle shifters, firmer suspension, 18-inch alloy wheels, cleaner grille and bumper, black headliner, heated front seats, power driver’s seat, pushbutton start, LED headlamps and taillamps, and a blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>RAV4 Limited adds Entune Premium Audio with navigation and app suite, a 7-inch touchscreen, driver’s memory, and also Forward Collision Warning with automatic braking, Lane Departure Alert, adaptive cruise control, a pedestrian pre-collision system, and automatic high beams. A new four-camera Bird’s Eye View Monitor gives a 360-degree view surrounding the car.</p>, <p>Also available: RAV4 AWD Adventure ($28,400); RAV4 XLE Hybrid AWD ($29,030); Hybrid Limited ($34,030); Platinum AWD ($36,150).</p>, <p>Eight airbags and a rearview camera are standard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54891" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rav4-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rav4-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rav4-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The RAV4 avoids chrome and reaps the benefits. The SE model with all black trim and black spoked wheels, in a dark maroon color, looks striking. The nose with a wide slot for a grille came in 2016, and it’s clean and sleek, with a high bumper like a bridge over a river of black fascia.</p>, <p>The RAV4 rides low for a compact crossover, with 6.3 inches of ground clearance. So the new Adventure with its lifted half-inch isn’t a big deal. But from the side view it’s conspicuous, widening the gap in the wheelwell over the tire. It looks awkward.</p>, <p>The RAV4 cabin is well organized. There’s good interior room, good build quality, and good materials in most models, with lots of soft-touch surfaces, while the entry-level LE uses dreary, hard plastics. We like both the base fabric (optionally heated on the XLE) and the SofTex synthetic leather. The instrument panel holds a digital display, and a 7-inch touchscreen is available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54893" height="179" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rav4-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The driver gets a carlike position on a comfortable seat, though the LE manual seats aren’t as supportive or bolstered as the power seats in the XLE. There more seating space than in the Ford Escape, and about the same as the Honda CR-V. There’s contrast stitching on the fabric seats of the LE, while upper trims use SofTex faux leather.</p>, <p>The rear seats are flat, hard, and unsupportive. The good news is it’s easy for tall people to suffer, as the large rear doors make it easy for them to climb in and out. And the seatbacks recline for them, or fold for cargo space.</p>, <p>Cargo space is cavernous: 38.4 cubic feet with the seats up, and 73.4 cubic feet with them down. And a low floor makes loading cargo easy. There used to be a third row in the RAV4, in the previous generation, but not now.</p>, <p>Four levels of Entune touchscreen audio are available. The top two include a comprehensive app suite, but there’s no provision for Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p>A lot more sound-deadening materials were added in 2016, and the RAV4 remains very quiet inside. But the doors deliver a tinny thud as they close, despite those materials.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54892" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rav4-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rav4-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-rav4-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The RAV4 delivers a quiet cabin, comfortable ride, composed handling, and tepid acceleration. It’s relaxed, not thrilling.</p>, <p>The acceleration is flat, far from breathtaking. Don’t hold your breath waiting to get there. The 2.5-liter engine is smooth and refined until it’s pressed. It lacks the speed (and price) of a turbocharged four-cylinder like in the Ford Escape and Subaru Forester.</p>, <p>The Hybrid’s two-motor Synergy Drive system combines a 2.5-liter gas engine with a 50-kw (67-hp) electric motor that powers the rear wheels when needed for traction. It helps the 194-hp Hybrid scoot to 60 mph in 8.1 seconds, although its engine emits a tortured howl. The howl vanishes with a light-footed driver on his leisurely way to 20 mph on all-electric power, although not for long.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive system on the RAV4 splits power between the front and rear axles at the press of a button, at speeds below 25 mph.</p>, <p>The ride isn’t as smooth as that of the Honda CR-V or Hyundai Tucson. The LE and XLE models, with their 17-inch wheels, actually ride better than the upscale Limited and Platinum that have bigger wheels (and therefore shorter sidewalls). The SE has firmer damping in the shock absorbers, but you can barely feel it, the ride is still good.</p>, <p>The thick three-spoke steering wheel suggest suggests tight cornering, but it’s a big fib. The steering is nicely weighted but light on center, and delivers little road feel. The RAV4 is responsive enough, but far less sporty than a Mazda CX-5 or Ford Escape. Sport mode tightens the steering.</p>, <p>The transmission upshifts early at city speeds, programmed that way to save fuel. Sport mode sharpens the upshift response, and brings a throttle blip to soften hard downshifts. The paddleshifters in the SE are a bit of a fib too, because the engine can’t bring much sport to them.</p>, <p>RAV4 is slow and gets below-average fuel mileage. But it’s roomy, comfortable and good-looking, easy to live with. The fabric upholstery in the base LE is good and it has a rearview camera. A well-equipped all-wheel-drive 33-mpg Hybrid retails for less than $30,000.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-corvette/
[<p>The Chevrolet Corvette is in its seventh generation, or C7, and still comes across young and hot as ever. The 2018 Corvette is in the fifth year of this generation, having been introduced for 2014. There have been steady small changes in the past five model years, but nothing significant from a mechanical standpoint. It’s so dynamically perfect that it hasn’t needed changes to keep up with anyone.</p>, <p>The C7 delivers astonishing acceleration, amazing grip, quick reflexes, and absolute communication through the seat and steering wheel. Even the automatic transmission matches the best of the German twin-clutch automatics.</p>, <p>It comes as an awesome Stingray or mind-shattering Z06. The Stingray uses a 6.2-liter LT1 V8 making 455 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque. The Z06 uses a supercharged LT4 V8 that’s also 6.2 liters, making 650 hp and 650 lb-ft. A 7-speed manual gearbox is standard, with automatic rev-matching downshifts. It’s fantastic. The optional transmission is a GM-built paddle-shifting 8-speed automatic. It’s superb.</p>, <p>There’s a model in the middle, the Grand Sport, which uses the Stingray engine and the Z06 suspension and steering geometry. It makes 5 more horsepower than the Stingray, and is a couple tenths quicker in the quarter mile. There’s also a Z07 handling package that includes carbon-ceramic brakes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54882" height="131" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-convertible.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-convertible.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-convertible-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Convertible doesn’t lose any structural integrity, because the Corvette was designed from the ground up as a roadster; the Convertible isn’t a coupe with the top chopped off afterward, it’s a roadster with a top added.</p>, <p>With a tall final-drive ratio keeping rpm low at freeway speed, and cylinder de-activation technology to cut cylinders when cruising, Corvette gets an EPA-rated 19 miles per gallon Combined. The Z06 rates 16 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>Neither the NHTSA nor the IIHS have crash-tested the C7 Corvette, but its rigid structure, many airbags, and stability control inspire confidence. The best way to stay safe in a Corvette is don’t lose your judgment.</p>, <p>There are 24 different combinations of engine, chassis, and models including the convertible, from Stingray Coupe ($55,495) to full tilt ZO6 convertible ($83,495).</p>, <p>Standard equipment includes dual-zone automatic climate control; an infotainment system with an 8.0-inch color touchscreen; satellite radio; Bluetooth with audio streaming; USB and power ports; a rearview camera; keyless ignition; cruise control; and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel, and OnStar.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54884" height="142" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-gs-1.jpg" width="200"/>Optional are Nappa leather or micro-suede, aluminum or carbon fiber trim, curb-view camera, head-up display, HD radio, 10-speaker Bose audio, competition sport seats, and navigation. But no blind-spot monitors.</p>, <p>The Z06 package also includes Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, adjustable front and rear aero components, and Michelin Pilot Super Sport Cup 2 tires.</p>, <p>The Z51 package includes lighter wheels, bigger brakes, more extreme aerodynamic bits, an electronic limited-slip differential, dry-sump oil system, an oil cooler for the differential and transmission, and stiffer shocks, springs and anti-roll bars.</p>, <p>Adjustable ride control settings are available with the Magnetic Selective Ride Control option, enabling various levels of ride comfort and performance. The magnetic ride suspension is available without the Z51 package and comes bundled with the Z51’s rear spoiler and wheels.</p>, <p>Finally, there’s an available performance data recorder with video. It can be used as a security device to make sure your Corvette isn’t taken for any joy rides by valet car-parkers.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54878" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The C7 is a wild, extroverted scoop addict. More slits and ducts. Wide, low and fast. The long hood, swept windshield, and muscular chopped haunches make the proportions and profile. The curves and creases intersect and warp. The sharp lines, angles, and vents say supercar. The Z06, with fatter fenders and more aerodynamic bits, fairly shouts it.</p>, <p>There’s a lot to look at, in a Corvette. It can be work. Your eyes can get tired.</p>, <p>The standard cabin trim in the Corvette’s is too standard. It needs optional aluminum or carbon-fiber to look correctly Corvette. Actually the carbon fiber makes it feel like a supercar. The suede and rich leather come in designer colors.</p>, <p>Still, the interior doesn’t match that of the Porsche 718, which is tight and low key. The Corvette is sharp and modern.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54885" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The instrument panel is simple and driver-focused.</p>, <p>Of course the materials are good and the touch is generally soft. The Porsche 911 and Mercedes AMG GT, costing much more, have higher quality trim. Some things make the Corvette feel like a grand touring car, for example the passenger climate controls integrated into the outboard vent.</p>, <p>The standard front seats are great, supportive and grippy, with a highly adjustable driver’s seat and a adjustable steering wheel; but the optional seats are greater. You can reach the shift lever without contortions.</p>, <p>The Competition Sport seats have a race-inspired form and function for hard cornering.</p>, <p>The cabin is snug but not tight. There’s good head, hip and legroom in front, even for six-footers. The flat-bottomed steering wheel is a bit small but comfortable.</p>, <p>Storage is good for a sports car. There are a few cubbies and boxes, with a hidden compartment behind the nav screen for your phone, with a jack. The real magic is the large, flat cargo area under the hatch of the coupe. It holds a surprising amount of luggage or stuff, making the Corvette almost practical. Convertibles have a trunk with less space, but it’s still adequate.</p>, <p>The convertible’s tight top seats itself at the top of the windshield, allowing you to raise or lower the top at speeds of up to 30 mph. Wind buffeting is stronger than some touring convertibles, but it’s not bad. The optional dealer-installed wind-blocker makes it better.</p>, <p>Rear visibility is very poor, as with many high-performance cars. The standard rearview camera is useful when backing up, but it isn’t available when you’re trying to see what’s happening behind you on the freeway. Corvette C7 racecars have a video camera on the dash that’s the rearview mirror. Eventually the technology for road cars will go there.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54881" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Mechanically, the Z06 is a benchmark for what a high-performance sports car should be. Sure, a Ferrari might be more exotic, and an Aston-Martin more gorgeous and eye-catching, but nothing matches a Corvette in performance-for-dollar. It has speed, handling, and style equal to cars costing twice as much.</p>, <p>The key to Corvette’s superb handling is its grip. The Z06 and Z51-package cars use an electronic differential to gain grip. Even without that and other electronic traction aids, the chassis is poised and balanced.</p>, <p>The chassis and suspension use a lot of aluminum, which aids handling along with the adjustable dampers and Performance Traction Management system, especially in its Track mode. Flat cornering, over 1g of lateral grip, and accurate electric power steering deliver a control that can be addictive, especially on the track. The handling is astonishingly better than the C6. Driving the C7 is a special and rewarding experience.</p>, <p>The 455-horsepower LT1 engine in the Stingray sounds excellent as it accelerates hard. It can do the quarter-mile in 12 seconds flat. Gearshifts in the seven-speed manual transmission are slick. Shifts from the paddle-shifting eight-speed automatic never hesitate. It’s remarkable, even in automatic mode. GM says it shifts 80 milliseconds faster than the Porsche twin-clutch PDK.</p>, <p>The Grand Sport’s wider rear fenders cover its wider rear tires, and the aerodynamic additions add to the racecar look. But it’s only two-tenths quicker in the quarter mile, as wider tires and aero tweaks aren’t for acceleration. Neither are the big Brembo brakes, but they too make the Grand Sport more capable on a road racing circuit.</p>, <p>Now add the Z07 package, including Michelin Pilot Super Sport Cup 2 tires, carbon-ceramic brakes, Magnetic Selective Ride Control dampers, and a more aggressive aerodynamics. Also add another $8000.</p>, <p>The Z06 brings Corvette to another level. Its supercharged 6.2-liter LT4 makes 650 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque. With the eight-speed automatic, it can accelerate from zero to sixty in 2.95 seconds.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54879" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2018-corvette-carbon65.jpg" width="200"/>Still the champ. Ultimate engineering out of an engine whose V8 design is more than 60 years old but still an unmatched thrill. Cornering second to none. GM aces the paddle-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission, providing on option to the perfect seven-speed manual gearbox. Clean, eye-catching supercar styling. Unheard of, for $55,495. The Corvette remains a bargain for ultra-high performance.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-tundra/
[<p>The 2018 Toyota Tundra is distinguished by last year’s model by its new grille and headlamps. Also the 2018 Tundra comes standard with more safety features than before: automatic emergency braking, automatic high beam headlights, lane departure warnings, and adaptive cruise control, in addition to its eight airbags.</p>, <p>A new Tundra TRD Sport with Bilstein shocks and bigger sway bars has been added to the lineup for 2018, while the regular cab, the simple work truck that started it all, has been unceremoniously dropped.</p>, <p>Introduced for 2007, the current-generation Tundra was revised for 2014. Among full-size pickups, the Toyota Tundra is the oldest product and has fallen behind the much newer Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, and Nissan Titan. The Ram 1500, meanwhile, is almost as dated as the Tundra.</p>, <p>Two Toyota V8s are available: a 4.6-liter V8 making 310 horsepower and 327 pound-feet of torque and a 5.7-liter with 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet.</p>, <p>They’re mated to the same transmission, a smooth six-speed automatic. Rear-wheel drive is standard, four-wheel drive is available and includes a two-speed transfer case.</p>, <p>Fuel mileage is relatively poor for the class. The 4.6-liter V8 with rear-wheel drive gets an EPA-rated 16 Combined miles per gallon, while the 5.7-liter with 4WD rates 15 mpg.</p>, <p>Tundra offers two cabs and bed lengths. Double Cabs offer 8- and 6.5-foot beds and feature rear-hinged rear doors and flip-up back seats. CrewMax models have 5.5-foot beds, four conventional doors, and a rear bench seat suitable for six-footers.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Tundra four stars overall in crash testing. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rates Tundra Good, but only Acceptable in the small-overlap crash test.</p>, <p>Tundra SR Double Cab ($31,120) comes with 4.6-liter V8, fabric upholstery, air conditioning, power windows/locks, rearview camera, 6.1-inch touchscreen, AM/FM/CD, Bluetooth hands-free phone/music streaming, USB connectivity, and 18-inch steel wheels. A Work Truck package substitutes vinyl upholstery and flooring. (Prices are MSRP do not include $1,295 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Tundra SR5 4WD ($32,830) features off-road styling and upgrades with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, satellite and HD radio, foglamps, intermittent wipers, Entune Audio Plus, and chromed bumpers. A Scout navigation function works with a smartphone data connection. Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert is optional. Alloy wheels are optional.</p>, <p>Tundra Limited Double Cab ($40,385) comes standard with the 5.7-liter V8, 20-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, woodgrain trim, dual-zone automatic climate control, and full navigation.</p>, <p>Tundra 1794 Edition CrewMax ($47,080) features a Western look, with special brown leather-trimmed seating with embossed and ultra-suede accents, cooled front seats, a sunroof, and 20-inch wheels. Tundra Platinum CrewMax ($47,080) is subtly upscale in style, with color-matched bumpers and modest badging, perforated leather upholstery, 12-way power driver’s seat with memory, heated/ventilated front seats, 12-speaker Entune Premium JBL Audio with navigation, moonroof.</p>, <p>Tundra TRD Pro ($43,495) comes in Double Cab or CrewMax form, with 5.7-liter V8, four-wheel drive, Bilstein remote-reservoir shocks, thick anti-sway bars, all-terrain tires. Tundra TRD Sport is similar, with sport-tuned Bilstein shocks, TRD anti-sway bars, a hood scoop, 20-inch alloy sport wheels, LED headlights, and a mesh grille.</p>, <p>New for 2018 is the suite of safety equipment: automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high-beams.</p>, <p>The new grille and headlamps make the Tundra look more stylish, but it’s still less stylish than the other trucks. It’s burly, without being clean and crisp like the Ford and GM trucks.</p>, <p>The rest of the sheetmetal looks familiar, while the stamped tailgate is ruggedly understated. The cargo bed lacks the utility of the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500. Tundra offers no lockable storage in the cargo bed, no damped tailgate, no bumper steps.</p>, <p>Each Tundra trim level has a distinct character, stemming from its set of body details, including the grille, wheel type, badging, and headlight finish. Pickup bodies exhibit certain creative touches, and mild design updates help keep the Tundra fresh. Even so, it’s not quite as stylish or attractive as the competition.</p>, <p>Tundra seats are roomy and comfortable.</p>, <p>Partly because of abundant silver-colored plastic elements, the Tundra cabin falls short in attractiveness. Even in upper trim levels, the look isn’t upscale. The 1794 Edition blends luscious brown leather upholstery with plastic components that would suit a work truck.</p>, <p>Controls are large and logically arranged on an effective dashboard that’s symmetrical and wide. The central console can hold a laptop. Infotainment systems are well-executed, and plenty of options are available.</p>, <p>Double Cab models have a front bench seat, with a huge folding armrest. Double Cabs don’t have much second-row space, and the back seats have sternly upright backrests. Relatively small windows on the front-hinged rear doors add to the sense of confinement.</p>, <p>CrewMax offers seating for five, with sufficient leg space for every rider. Seats slide and recline, though the backrest reclining angle isn’t comfortable and cushions are low.</p>, <p>Toyota’s two V8 engines feel similar in city-street driving with an unladen truck. Both are smooth and deliver good low-rpm acceleration, making the Tundra acceptably quick and easygoing in traffic. Both lose oomph as speed rises or weight increases. Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado, and Ram offer more power for accelerating with a substantial load.</p>, <p>Toyota’s 4.6-liter V8 feels anemic when carrying four tons or so. Despite its 310-horsepower rating, the 4.6-liter V8 cannot quite compare with V6 engines from Ford and GM.</p>, <p>If you’re pulling a trailer, spring for the 5.7-liter engine. Tundras are rated to tow as much as 10,300 pounds. Higher-trim models have a 38-gallon fuel tank.</p>, <p>Acceleration is hardier with the 5.7-liter V8. Push the gas pedal to the floor, and a 5.7-liter Tundra accelerates smartly, with a sporty exhaust note, but it doesn’t match the Chevy or Ram V8s.</p>, <p>Toyota’s smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission smoothly handles its task and responds promptly enough.</p>, <p>On the road, Tundras feel suitably solid. Ride quality is reasonably comfortable, though pavement bumps and seams typically produce impacts beyond the normal range. In urban use, the Tundra handles well. Steering is on the light side, and not as quick as that of F-150 or Ram.</p>, <p>TRD models are the choice for enthusiasts. Offered only with four-wheel drive, the TRD Pro, in particular, targets off-road drivers, behaving with a high level of competence after the pavement ends, not stymied by rock-strewn roads or wilderness obstacles.</p>, <p>Toyota’s easy-to-use 4WD system operates via a dashboard-mounted knob. Because it’s a part-time system, it shouldn’t be used on dry pavement.</p>, <p>Fuel economy with the 4.6-liter V8 and rear-wheel drive is EPA-rated at 15/19 mpg City/Highway, or 16 mpg Combined. Four-wheel drive drops the estimate to 14/18/16 mpg.</p>, <p>The 5.7-liter V8 with rear-drive is EPA-rated at 13/18 mpg City/Highway, or 15 mpg Combined. Four-wheel drive brings the estimate to 13/17/15 mpg. Both V8s use Regular 87-octane gasoline.</p>, <p>The Toyota Tundra is a good pickup, but it’s been passed by trucks from Ford, GM, and Nissan. Tundra doesn’t excel by any measure. Tundra’s powertrain choices are more limited than what’s offered by Ford, GM, and Ram. At 10,400 pounds, maximum towing capacity trails the domestic models. Yet, if one of the models fits your needs and the price point is compelling, Tundra can be a contender.</p>, <p>Compiled with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Buick LaCrosse is moving fast in its own reinvention, as a front-wheel-drive flagship four-door sedan. It was totally redesigned for 2017 (and well received).</p>, <p>The new 2018 LaCrosse eAssist uses a hybrid powertrain. The mild hybrid uses a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and one electric motor with a small lithium-ion battery pack. Unlike a full hybrid, for example the Toyota Avalon, the LaCrosse can’t run all-electric. LaCrosse eAssist is EPA-rated at 25/35 mpg City/Highway, or 29 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The available 3.6-liter V6, meanwhile, gets a new 9-speed automatic transmission for 2018, replacing an 8-speed, and the availability of all-wheel drive has been expanded to two models.</p>, <p>LaCrosse isn’t a luxury car, it’s a premium American road car, but it’s good enough to make you wonder if a luxury car is worth it. In its third reborn generation, the Buick LaCrosse has established an identity. Its premium and near-luxury competitors fade into the crowd: Lexus ES 350, Toyota Avalon, Nissan Maxima, Acura TLX, Hyundai Azera. Another competitor, the Chrysler 300, also has an identity, as well as a face that stands out from the crowd.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54864" height="108" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-2.jpg" width="200"/>The relatively long wheelbase of the LaCrosse gives it the stance of a rear-wheel-drive car, even though it is front-wheel drive. The V6 makes an impressive 310 horsepower and 282 pound-feet of torque. The engine was designed with Stop/Start technology, as opposed to that capability being added, and it’s almost invisible. The entry-level model looks and feels nearly as rich as the Premium, with convincing leatherette upholstery.</p>, <p>Fuel economy for the 2018 LaCrosse with the 3.6-liter V6 and new 9-speed transmission is rated at 21/30 mpg City/Highway, 24 mpg Combined. With all-wheel drive, it’s 20/29/23 mpg.</p>, <p>The 2018 Buick LaCrosse is available with a 2.5-liter engine with e-Assist ($30,490) or a 3.6-liter V6. Standard, Preferred, Essence, and Premium models are available. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive is available.</p>, <p>The base comes equipped with leatherette upholstery, 18-inch alloy wheels, power front seats, eight-speaker audio system, 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and 10 airbags.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54867" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-rear.jpg" width="200"/>LaCrosse represents an icon from 1958. The ’58 LaCrosse marked the climax of chrome. Chrome peaked, in the grille and on the body, with the ’58 Buick. It may be a dubious distinction, to be known as the most heavily chrome-laden car in history, but it is a distinction in the history of style.</p>, <p>The current LaCrosse comes from the Avenir concept car that wowed the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It’s sleek and muscular, with character lines from its shoulders to haunches. The standard 18-inch wheels (two designs), HID headlamps and LED taillamps add to the appeal.</p>, <p>The current model doesn’t completely avoid chrome, but it’s a long way from overboard. The proud and daring waterfall grille is split by a small chrome bar. The chrome faux ports on the sides of the front fenders are an acceptable nod to nostalgia.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54866" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Buick cabin is simple and elegant, modern and functional, with a flowing dashboard and floating center console that make it feel airy inside. The Lexus ES 350 and Toyota Avalon are more imaginative, but the LaCrosse mostly hits the mark, although the padded armrest between the front seats is too high.</p>, <p>The leatherette trim on the seats feels like real leather, and the French-stitched vinyl on the dashboard and door panels is fine, but the gray plastic on the center console looks low-rent. Hard plastics are pasted to the lower part of the dash, but rivals do that too.</p>, <p>There’s an eight-inch touchscreen on the dash that is resistant to fingerprints. It uses the latest version of GM’s IntelliLink infotainment, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. On Star with 4G LTE connectivity is standard.</p>, <p>The front seats of this five-seat sedan are good, but only two passengers will be comfortable in the rear. There isn’t enough room for that alleged fifth passenger; they might squeeze in, but not for long. The trunk is 15 cubic feet, a decent size, a bit smaller than the Toyota Avalon.</p>, <p>Buick calls its sound-deadening engineering Quiet Tuning. It uses the latest and most sound-absorbent materials, a quieter engine, acoustic wheelhouse liners, active noise cancellation, triple door seals, and an acoustic-laminated windshield and front side windows. It all works well to create a very quiet cabin.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54865" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-lacrosse-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The eAssist hybrid makes 194 horsepower and 187 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>The 3.6-liter V6 is used in many other GM models, especially Cadillacs and namely the XT5 crossover. With 310 horsepower, 282 pound-feet of torque, and a fit 3600 pounds to move, it accelerates smartly. And it handles well, after its 2017 redesign that made it lighter and stiffer, with a new five-link independent rear suspension that improved both cornering and ride.</p>, <p>The LaCrosse is nimble, with light and accurate steering. It’s no sports sedan, but it’s more poised than might be expected from a big sedan.</p>, <p>The base and Preferred models use a MacPherson strut front suspension and 18-inch wheels, while Essence and Premium models take GM’s HiPer strut front suspension, two-mode adaptive dampers, and 20-inch wheels. The HiPer strut suspension reduces torque steer and increases grip, while the larger wheels might stiffen the ride because the sidewalls are shorter, but that’s what the adaptive dampers are supposed to prevent. Using sport mode for the adaptive dampers tightens the ride and steering a bit.</p>, <p>Since there’s very little torque steer anyhow, we still see the base or Preferred model as a better value. It doesn’t need adaptive dampers to hustle down a winding road.</p>, <p>Buick LaCrosse is a pleasant, enjoyable car to drive and spend time in. A Cadillac powertrain for less-than Cadillac price, stylish looks translated from a popular concept, luxury features, and handling that smacks the rivals. The base model is a very nice car and represents an excellent value.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-malibu/
[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Malibu is on the third year of its generation. It was redesigned for 2016 to bring substantially improved handling and road manners. Malibu is relatively small on the outside but space efficient on the inside.</p>, <p>The 2018 Malibu gets an appearance package called Redline, but otherwise it’s unchanged.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 1.5-liter turbo four making 163 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque, working with a 6-speed automatic. The 1.5-liter gets 30 miles per gallon combined, the 2.0-liter gets 26 mpg, and the hybrid gets 46 mpg.</p>, <p>The stronger engine is a 2.0-liter turbo four that makes 250 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque, and feels like a V6. It’s mated to a 9-speed automatic.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54860" height="139" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-malibu-hybrid.jpg" width="200"/>There’s also a Malibu Hybrid, with a 1.8-liter engine making 182 horsepower, tied or wired to two electric motors with a battery pack.</p>, <p>Malibu gets five stars in crash testing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it a Top Safety Pick award.</p>, <p>There are quite a few active safety features available in the top models. Malibu’s systems work in a manner that might be described as subtle and firm. Not all such systems are the same, some seem to be always snatching at you and scolding you.</p>, <p>A Front Pedestrian Alert can identify pedestrians ahead, and brake automatically. Adaptive cruise control works with front automatic braking. Also offered are blind-spot monitoring with lane-change alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and active lane keep with lane-departure warning. Front and rear parking sensors are available, as is automatic parking assist.</p>, <p>Base L trim level targets fleet buyers. In the showroom, customers can choose a Malibu LS, LT, Premier, or Hybrid, all of which include a rearview camera as standard. All Malibus have 10 airbags.</p>, <p>Malibu L ($21,680) uses the 1.5-liter engine with basic features, six-speaker radio, cruise control, power windows/locks, and 16-inch steel wheels. (All prices are MSRP and do not include $875 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54857" height="104" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-malibu-final.jpg" width="200"/>Malibu LS ($23,225) adds a rearview camera, MyLink radio with 7.0-inch touchscreen and Bluetooth connectivity, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, OnStar with wife capability, 16-inch alloy wheels, and an acoustic windshield. A Teen Driver feature can track misbehavior of young drivers. Malibu LT ($25,125) comes with 17-inch wheels, LED headlights and daytime running lights, satellite radio, heated power mirrors, and power driver’s seat.</p>, <p>Malibu Premier ($30,975) steps up to the 2.0-liter engine, as well as an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Bose nine-speaker premium audio, rear-seat USB charging, power heated/ventilated front seats, leather-wrapped heated steering wheel, LED taillights, and 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Malibu Hybrid ($27,875) features the gasoline/electric powertrain and is similar to LT trim level, with dual-zone automatic air conditioning and hybrid-specific instrument cluster.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54859" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-malibu-rear.jpg" width="200"/>At its last redesign, the Malibu got a bit longer and a lot lighter and more rigid. The nose of the then-new Malibu got dropped and stretched. It looks good, with the same design cues as the larger Impala, but with better proportions. In profile, it looks balanced. As a midsize sedan, Malibu is on the small side.</p>, <p>The doors are wide, the windshield pillars are slim, and the rear window and taillights are narrow. From head-on, the Malibu almost looks bold, at least compared to when it was humdrum.</p>, <p>Despite a relatively short wheelbase, Malibu is one of the most spacious midsize sedans, enhanced by a thoughtful layout and clever packaging. Back-seat legroom reaches 38.1 inches, close to Impala space.</p>, <p>Displaying understated charm, the cabin features a conventionally styled, relatively low dashboard, expanded toward the corners. The center stack contains a 7.0-inch touchscreen (8.0-inch in Premier). Many owners are likely to welcome the use of control buttons. The driver sits a little lower than in some midsize sedans.</p>, <p>Sound-deadening techniques and active noise cancellation help subdue vibrations, whether from the road or powertrain. Base-level cloth upholstery fails to impress, but upper trim levels are pleasing.</p>, <p>Sensible details include knee-height console padding and substantial seat bolstering. Sufficiently long front-seat bottoms promise good support even for all-day driving.</p>, <p>Back-seat passengers also enjoy good leg support, on a flat floor. Less curvy than some rivals, the Malibu roofline doesn’t cut into headroom. Trunks have 15.8 cubic feet of space (11.6 cubic feet in the Hybrid).</p>, <p>Soft-touch surfaces are plentiful, but interior materials suggest some cost-cutting.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54858" height="102" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-malibu-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Even in base trim, the Malibu feels light and nimble, a pleasure to drive, compared to most midsize sedans. It’s impressively agile.</p>, <p>The 1.5-liter turbo gets by fine, even on long freeway jaunts, with its 163 horsepower. The only time it really works hard is on mountain grades. Even when it’s pushed, the engine stays quiet. The 6-speed automatic upshifts at the right time.</p>, <p>The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine is more powerful and refined. It will satisfy your need for a V6. It accelerates with enthusiasm. It doesn’t have or need driving modes, because the standard fixed calibrations deliver fine performance without fuss.</p>, <p>Among the lightest sedans in the midsize group, Malibu feels firm but well-composed, with its suspension tuned for comfort. There’s a minimal amount of engine drone. Most wind and road noises are suppressed, though rough surfaces might transmit some vibration.</p>, <p>The Malibu Hybrid borrows technology from the Volt, and can briefly run on battery power, but it’s intended to be driven in a conventional manner. It’s quite quick, accelerating to 60 mph in 7.8 seconds. And unlike many hybrids, nothing is lost in the sharpness of the handling, from the all-gas model. The steering feels no less vivid.</p>, <p>The Chevy Malibu delivers composed handling, quiet ride, efficient powertrains, comfortable interior, good value, affordable, spacious for a midsize, 30 mpg with the base 1.5-liter turbo having enough horsepower and torque to be there for you. Putting it that way, it sounds pretty darn good.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-cruze/
[<p>Chevrolet Cruze is an affordable high-mileage compact car. It’s easy-going, quiet, comfortable and composed. You’ll find more choices in a Chevrolet showroom than any competitor’s: Cruze comes as a sedan or hatchback, with automatic or manual, gas or diesel.</p>, <p>Both the 2018 Cruz hatch and the sedan are now available with the 1.6-liter turbodiesel engine.</p>, <p>The hatch was new for 2017, after a redesign of the Cruze for 2016. Also new for 2018 is one color, Satin Steel Grey Metallic.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54850" height="146" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-cruze-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>Standard engine in the front-wheel-drive Cruze is a 1.4-liter turbocharged four making 153 horsepower and 177 pound-feet of torque, which comes with a six-speed automatic or manual. It’s EPA-rated at 29/40/33 miles per gallon City/Highway/Combined with the automatic.</p>, <p>The optional 1.6-liter turbodiesel makes less horsepower (137 hp) but way more torque, at 240 lb-ft. It comes with a more sophisticated transmission, as well: a nine-speed automatic.</p>, <p>The turbodiesel mileage competes with the Toyota Prius. The Cruze sedan automatic is rated at 31/47/37, while the manual scores 30/52/37 mpg; that 52 highway could only be explained by a very tall sixth gear in the transmission. That gives the Cruze diesel sedan with the 6-speed manual a 712-mile potential range.</p>, <p>Cruze RS is a sporty appearance package, with special front and rear fascia, spoiler, and 18-inch wheels but no suspension or power changes.</p>, <p>The Cruze earns but four stars from the NHTSA in crash testing, while advanced safety features such as automatic emergency braking aren’t available. But many safety features are available, such as blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert, active lane control, forward collision alert, and automatic headlights. Furthermore, Cruz earned the top Good scores from the insurance industry the two crash tests it performed: side impact and moderate front overlap, which is the difficult test that many cars can’t score a Good on. And the Cruze comes standard with 10 airbags and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>The Cruze is made in Lordstown, Ohio. There was a flap in 2016 when candidate Trump made a misleading statement about Cruzes being built in Mexico. The North American Cruze is made in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>, <p>The Chevy Cruze is available in L, LS, LT, and Premier models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54847" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-cruze-rear-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>Cruze L sedan ($16,975) is the base model with manual transmission, cloth upholstery, and 15-inch steel wheels with plastic hubcaps, 7.0-inch touchscreen with infotainment including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, 60/40 split folding rear seat, and don’t forget the 10 airbags and rearview camera. Cruze LS ($18,525) adds air conditioning and offers an automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Cruze LT sedan ($20,845) and Cruze LT Hatch ($21,240) add a six-speaker sound system with available satellite radio, steering wheel controls, 16-inch wheels, foglamps, and a space-saver spare tire rather than a tire repair kit.</p>, <p>Cruze Premier sedan ($23,475) and Hatch ($23,945) are loaded with leather, heated steering wheel and rear seats, upgraded rear suspension, and 17-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Packages upgrade infotainment and sound, as well as safety features.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54848" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-cruze-rear-hatch.jpg" width="200"/>Hatch and sedan versions of the Cruze have the same wheelbase, but the Hatch is eight inches shorter overall, all of the loss coming behind the rear doors. The roof curves back to a spoiler over the back glass in the fifth-door hatch that’s a bit small, but opens to a roomy cargo area.</p>, <p>The Cruze sedan is toned and crisp, longer and wider than most compacts, with a wedge shape that leads to a short rear deck. It has the same grille as the Chevy Volt, Malibu, and Impala.</p>, <p>The cabin is modern without being too digital. It’s similar to the high-tech Volt, with relatively simple instrumentation in a pod, outlined in chrome, and intuitive controls. The layout is clean and sharp. In the center of the dash there’s a standard 7.0-inch or 8.0-inch touchscreen. The higher models feature two-tone trim. The front seats are comfortable, with better bolstering in the leather seats than in the fabric upholstery.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54852" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-cruze-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-cruze-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-cruze-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>For a compact car, the Cruze sedan is very spacious, its stats matching many midsize cars. It holds four adults as advertised, with more leg and hip room in the rear seat than rivals, namely the Ford Focus or Hyundai Elantra.</p>, <p>The trunk is a large 13.7 cubic feet.</p>, <p>The Hatch has 23.7 cubic feet behind the rear seat, not as much as the Honda Civic or Ford Focus hatchbacks. Even though it’s a compact, the Cruze hatch is slightly smaller than the subcompact Chevrolet Sonic hatchback. It’s all in vertical room, a penalty of the Cruze’s curvy roofing. However, with the rear seat folded, the Hatch holds a competitive 47 cubic feet of cargo.</p>, <p>According to Chevrolet, the Cruze sedan can accelerate from zero to sixty in less than eight seconds, which is adequate. The engine is fairly smooth, but there is a hesitation in the acceleration when you floor it, probably from the automatic transmission. If you had the manual transmission you’d have to shift down; but the shift action will be smooth and the clutch light and easy. We actually got seat time in a bare-bones L model, and it makes good efficient transportation.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54849" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-cruze-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Having lost 250 pounds in that redesign two years ago, the Cruze is now responsive, nimble, and fun to drive. The chassis is planted. The rack-mounted electric power steering isn’t too light at low speeds, and nicely weighted at high speed. It’s no sport sedan, but the Cruze handles better and with more confidence than some of its Japanese and Korean rivals. And a Cruze with the RS or Redline package, with a more sophisticated rear suspension having a Z-link design, brings poise to the cornering.</p>, <p>Still, there’s no denying that Mazda and Hyundai offer more sport than the Cruze.</p>, <p>The Cruze is quiet and comfortable on the highway, with excellent stability. The comfortable ride is one of the best in a compact car, even with the big 18-inch wheels; we’d go so far to say it rides like a little luxury car.</p>, <p>The standard rear suspension is torsion beam, but the Premier gets an improved setup for crisper cornering. The Cruze also comes with four-wheel disc brakes, using long-wearing Duralife rotors.</p>, <p>The 1.6-liter turbodiesel engine is a gem, for the most part. It was added last year for the sedan, and in 2018 becomes available with the hatchback; it comes with either the nine-speed automatic or six-speed manual. It fills a void left by Volkswagen who ran from the market after their diesel emissions fiasco. With only 137 horsepower it’s no cheetah, but that 240 pound-feet of torque compensates by making it a jackrabbit. The engine is nearly silent and the broad torque band endows it with easy acceleration. And the 9-speed automatic shifts with little hesitation.</p>, <p>Shorter overall by eight inches, the hatch fits into small parking spaces easier than does the sedan.</p>, <p>We’ve tested a number of different version of the Cruze, and the one we like is the most expensive: Premier Hatchback with the RS package. It handles the best, while being smooth and compliant.</p>, <p>Chevy Cruze is a solid contender in the crowded compact class, especially the Hatch, which has a stylish shape and looks hot with the RS package. The 1.4-liter turbo could use more power. The interior holds four adults comfortably, while the Hatch with its rear seat folded offers good cargo space. Cruze LS is a good value.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-buick-encore/
[<p>Buick Encore is a subcompact crossover with premium features. When it was introduced for 2013 it was a trailblazer, but the segment has boomed since then. Today the Encore has a lot of serious competitors, for example the Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3, and the new Toyota C-HR.</p>, <p>Encore got a new nose, cabin, and infotainment for 2017, and a new engine before that, but it hasn’t been redesigned since 2013. Changes for 2018 aren’t big. The Premium model gets an ionizer in its cabin air filter, and every model gets a capless fuel intake.</p>, <p>Built on the platform of the subcompact Chevrolet Sonic, Encore is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, for traction in winter, not off-roading.</p>, <p>Encore’s handling is pretty good, and the ride is impressively comfortable, for a tall wagon on a short wheelbase. It’s a narrow car, which makes the cabin snug, although two adults fit comfortably in the rear. It tries to be upscale, because that’s what Buicks are supposed to be.</p>, <p>Encore uses two engines, both of them 1.4-liter and turbocharged, but one has direct fuel injection, which efficiently sprays fuel into the combustion chambers. We recommend that one, which will be more common. It is significantly more responsive, making 153 horsepower and 177 pound-feet of torque, compared to the standard engine’s 138 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. Both use a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Standard features include 10 airbags, a rearview camera, 8.0-inch touchscreen, and OnStar’s 4G LTE data connection that can run smartphone apps via Bluetooth, Apple Car Play, and Android Auto. Options include leather, premium Bose audio, and safety options including lane-departure and forward-collision warnings, as well as blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The engine with direct injection gets and EPA-rated 28 City and 34 Highway miles per gallon with front-wheel drive. The other engine is not only slower, it gets 3 less combined mpg.</p>, <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gives the Encore five stars for crash safety. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives it a Top Safety Pick.</p>, <p>The entry-level Encore ($22,900) comes with front-wheel drive and the standard engine. Standard equipment includes an 8-inch touchscreen, power windows/locks and heated mirrors, cruise control, cloth upholstery with simulated leather trim; power driver’s seat; ambient lighting; rearview camera; OnStar telematics, IntelliLink infotainment, and 18-inch alloy wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>The Convenience package includes dual-zone automatic climate control, remote start, blind-zone and rear cross-traffic alerts, and foglamps. Leather adds a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, and leather-appointed seating. Premium features Bose audio, parking sensors, plus lane-departure and forward-collision warnings.</p>, <p>Upgrading to the Direct Injection engine means stepping up to the Encore Sport Touring ($25,565) model, which includes rear spoiler, stop/start technology, front/rear park assist, and special 18-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Options include navigation and a sunroof.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54841" height="147" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-encore-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Buick Encore’s overall shape is cohesive, not too hippy and not too edgy. Subtle curves in the sheetmetal. It doesn’t shout anything, it just states class.</p>, <p>Encore looks as much like a small hatchback as it does a crossover. It got better looking with a facelift for 2017, although we’re not so sure about the chrome strip like a glider’s wings, added to the waterfall grille. With LED headlamps, the hood looks clean. Small spoiler over the liftgate looks right.</p>, <p>Being tall, the Encore offers good head room. Being narrow, it’s pinched on shoulder and elbow room, even in the front. And the wide center console might squeeze the front occupants’ knees. But the driver gets a fine position, enjoying a commanding view past the short front end. Although not over the shoulder, making that standard rearview camera a wise move. A low dashboard and tall roof bring back a sense of spaciousness.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54840" height="96" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-encore-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The front seats are comfortable, with nicely shaped seatbacks, although the bottom cushions are short on support.</p>, <p>The back seat can easily carry two adults, and there are seatbelts for a third passenger in the rear; but it won’t be three adults. Knee room is livable, helped by slight scoops in the front seatbacks. There’s a folding armrest with cupholders, drops down to better the fill the space than a center passenger would.</p>, <p>Soft-touch surfaces and metal trim give the cabin a premium feel, while it is also versatile and flexible. Both the rear seat and the front passenger seat fold down. Folding the back seat expands cargo capacity from 18.8 to nearly 50 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Active noise cancellation keeps the engine noise down, and while some tire and wind noise comes in, and the info flashes on an 8-inch touchscreen in the center of the dash, the cabin stays surprisingly calm for a subcompact.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54839" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-encore-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-encore-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-encore-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>With the standard 1.4-liter turbo engine, without direction injection, it takes nine seconds to move the 3200-pound Encore up to sixty miles per hour, a lethargic performance. The engine strains to get the Encore underway, the transmission upshifts too soon so has to change its mind and downshift for more acceleration; and it doesn’t bring back such great fuel mileage.</p>, <p>The direct-injection engine gets 31 miles per gallon, while offering quicker performance. Its 153 horsepower provides more appropriate vigor. Passing on two-lane roads and merging onto the expressway is much easier and safer. It makes a worrisome booming noise under hard acceleration, however.</p>, <p>Despite the short wheelbase, even with large wheels, the Encore delivers a surprisingly and impressively comfortable ride. Small potholes and other such spots are still choppy, but less than you expect. Optional all-wheel drive not only improves traction, but improves the ride.</p>, <p>The electric power steering does its job well.</p>, <p>The automatic Stop/Start system is barely noticeable, bravo to Buick, as many manufacturers’ systems are intrusive.</p>, <p>Buick Encore is a comfortable small-family subcompact crossover, with premium equipment and a premium feel, for a fairly low price. The direct-injection engine is a smart upgrade.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Subaru Forester is familiar, as a pioneer compact wagon-like utility vehicle. It was a crossover before crossovers were called crossovers, meaning it’s based on a car platform. It was boxy then and it’s still boxier than the many copycats that have come along over the years.</p>, <p>Forester brings the ride and handling of a car, with all-wheel drive proven over the ages, and nearly nine inches of ground clearance for primitive pursuits. It’s the most popular Subaru, if not the one you see in pictures, and has won an award or two for being one of the best buys on the market.</p>, <p>A year ago, we spent six months with a turbocharged Forester 2.0XT, testing it in a variety of conditions and terrains, confirming the awards are well-earned. It doesn’t have the agility of the Ford Escape or Mazda CX-5, but feels far sportier than the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, or Toyota RAV4. It’s got one of the best continuously variable transmissions in the game, and gets an EPA-rated 28 Combined miles per gallon. Its virtues are impressive: reliability, longevity, good handling, all-weather capability, and interior room with cargo capacity.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54832" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-forester-walk.jpg" width="200"/>The Forester’s styling was updated for 2017 (grille, bumper and headlamps), and for 2018 the changes are in packaging. The EyeSight active-safety package is standard on Touring models, a camera system that sees danger ahead and self-brakes. Along with that system comes self-dimming headlamps that turn with the car, and reverse automatic braking. The Touring models also have blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alerts. A Black Edition Package is a new option for 2018 Forester 2.5i Premium models.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 2.5-liter, horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine making 170 horsepower. This boxer engine is mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox or CVT. Acceleration is adequate.</p>, <p>A quicker option is the turbocharged 2.0-liter that makes 250 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque; it comes only with a paddle-shifting CVT, which can be programmed to feel like a six-speed or eight-speed automatic transmission using Subaru’s SI-Drive system. That 2.0XT model gets 25 Combined miles per gallon on Premium gasoline. Over a few thousand miles during our six-month test with a Forester 2.0XT, we averaged 24.1 miles per gallon.</p>, <p>The federal NHTSA gives the Forester five stars overall for crash safety, and the insurance industry’s IIHS confirms that with top ratings in every crash test including the challenging small overlap frontal crash, making it a Top Safety Pick Plus.</p>, <p>2018 Forester 2.5i models come in base ($23,795), Premium ($26,195), Limited ($29,395), and Touring ($30,090) models. Forester 2.0XT comes in Premium ($29,495) and Touring ($36,090).</p>, <p>Standard equipment in all models includes rearview camera, Bluetooth hands-free calling, audio streaming, and a 6.2-inch touchscreen. Options include perforated leather seats, a 7.0-inch screen with infotainment, eight-speaker, 440-watt sound system, and power rear liftgate.</p>, <p>The Forester is anti-swoopy. It’s uncompromising It’s a tall, short, square wagon with the ride height of an SUV. Its design priorities include easy entrance and exit.</p>, <p>We’re not saying it’s ugly. It does step out a bit, with character lines on the hood and sculpting on the sides. The taillamps come from the edgy Impreza. Not everything is neat. On the turbo models there’s an aggressive airdam that looks like dewlaps on a lizard.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54831" height="150" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-forester-interior.jpg" width="200"/>One of the Forester’s strengths, and one reason it’s so popular, is that it’s simple and intuitive. You can climb in the car and operate everything for the first time, without having to refer to a thick manual. Unlike, say, a German car or two.</p>, <p>The instrument panel, shared with the Legacy sedan and Outback crossover, is clean. The audio and climate controls are logical and easy to use. The information screen is mounted over the center console that flows back over bins and cupholders to an armrest.</p>, <p>The interior materials are a mix of matte and soft-touch surfaces with matte metallic trim, including a handsome Saddle Brown perforated leather with contrasting stitching for the Touring model. The 2017 Forester got more sound insulation in the floor, an acoustic windshield, and thicker glass in the doors, all intended to reduce interior noise while underway.</p>, <p>The driving position is high and the window line low, so there’s an unsurpassed feeling of space in front, for a compact car. The dash is located forward and low, to give front occupants more room. But the front seats have short flat cushions and slim bolstering. Tall drivers will find their knees contacting the center console and door panels, which aren’t soft.</p>, <p>The rear seats have a better contour. There’s ample headroom and legroom, with a low driveshaft tunnel, as well as rear doors that are wide enough for easy entry and exit. Every model but the base has a 60/40 rear seat that folds nearly flat with a one-touch mechanism, creating a generous cargo capacity of 74.7 cubic feet. And there’s still a good 34.4 cubic feet behind the rear seat.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54833" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-forester-driving-snow.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-forester-driving-snow.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-forester-driving-snow-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Forester is sportier than it looks. It’s quicker and better handling than a Honda CR-V or Nissan Rogue. It brings some fun to its utility.</p>, <p>The base 2.5-liter isn’t so quick, but it will have enough acceleration for most people. We prefer the 6-speed manual transmission to the CVT with this engine, because the CVT in the 2.5 isn’t as sophisticated as it is in the 2.0 turbo. The shift linkage isn’t as tight as it might be, and the throws are a bit long and truckish, but still, the six-speed manual gets the most out of the engine’s torque.</p>, <p>In the Forester 2.0XT, Subaru’s SI-Drive system offers Intelligent, Sport, and Sport Sharp modes, to alter throttle and CVT response. Sport Sharp enables the CVT to shift through eight snappy steps, using paddles on the steering wheel. Sport and Intelligent mode are programmed for six steps. This CVT is the least annoying we can think of.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54834" height="152" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-forester-driving.jpg" width="200"/>Forester’s good handling is enhanced by the stout turbo engine. The electric power steering is well tuned and nicely weighted, with a fairly quick ratio. The body scarcely leans, for a tall utility vehicle. The ride is comfortable and not harsh on big bumps.. The 2.0XT Touring adds torque vectoring, which dabs the brakes on the inside rear wheel in corners, helping the car rotate. The Mazda CX-5 might still be better on the pavement, but it can’t match the Forester on unpaved trails, so if you ever go there, you’re ahead with the Subaru.</p>, <p>Forester’s relatively rugged capability on trails is enhanced by 8.7 inches of ground clearance, with approach and departure angles that are quite impressive for a small SUV.</p>, <p>The mechanical all-wheel drive makes the Forester fun and predictable on dirt or snowy roads. For more offroad security, there’s an available X Mode (with hill descent control) that moves the power between the left and right wheels, in addition to the front and rear wheels. This puts the Subaru up there on the sophistication level of Jeep and Land Rover.</p>, <p>Underneath the Forester’s dated skin lies the heart, soul and spirit of a dominant competitor in the field of compact crossovers. The base 2.5-liter engine with a 6-speed manual transmission brings tremendous value, given the Forester’s proven strengths and capabilities. The CVT with the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine is great for a CVT.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-ford-escape/
[<p>The Ford Escape is no frumpy crossover. It’s more like a tall wagon than an SUV, with rakish styling and sporty handling. Competitors include the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, Toyota RAV4 and Mazda CX-5, but the Escape offers the most responsive steering, crispest handling, and best body control (the CX-5 is a close second, along with the Subaru Forester). The Escape has the firmest ride, a consequence of the sporty handling.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54821" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-escape-final.jpg" width="200"/>The styling was freshened for 2017, to give it more of the Ford family look, and two new efficient four-cylinder engines were introduced, a 1.5-liter making 179 horsepower, and 2.0 liter making 245 horsepower. There’s also a 2.5-liter making 168 horsepower, which only comes with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is available with the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter engines.</p>, <p>Escape is essentially unchanged for 2018.</p>, <p>The Escape earns but four stars in crash testing by the federal NHTSA. The 1.5-liter engine gets an EPA-rated 26 Combined miles per gallon, the powerful 2.0 liter rates 25 mpg, and the 2.4 liter rates 24 mpg.</p>, <p>Safety features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning with braking, lane keeping, and active park assist that can steer the car into a parking space. A warning on the dash goes off if the car senses the driver is tired.</p>, <p>2018 Ford Escape S ($23,850), SE ($25,605), SEL ($28,005), and Titanium ($32,045) come standard with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is available for all but the S model ($1350).</p>, <p>Available features include Sync 3 infotainment, navigation, HD and satellite radio, Bluetooth with audio streaming, push-button start, tow package, panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54822" height="145" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-escape-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The design and styling of the Escape is very tidy. Compared to the Honda CR-V, it’s a few inches shorter with a wheelbase that’s nearly three inches longer. Less overhang past the front and rear axles, and a more solid planting on the highway.</p>, <p>The sheetmetal is clean, crisp, pert, stylish, direct and modern. Think outdoorsy millennial.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54825" height="300" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-escape-seats.jpg" width="200"/>The cabin is heavily styled with bold contours, swoopy and finely detailed. It makes other compact crossovers boring. But it’s also plasticky.</p>, <p>The swoopy dash wraps around so much that it takes some knee and legroom away from the front passenger, but that’s still nearly two inches more than the Honda CR-V. Thick A-pillars steal some forward visibility.</p>, <p>The front seats are slim and firm. The electronic parking brake, small as a button, frees up center console space. There’s a horizontal vent under the LCD screen that does a good job of heating and cooling the climate controls and kneecaps. There’s a CD player on the center stack.</p>, <p>The rakish profile steals some airiness out of the cabin, but there’s still enough left. There’s plenty of headroom in the rear, at least without the panoramic sunroof that would make it more airy. The Escape is considered a five-seater but there’s only room for two adults, with one inch less rear legroom than the CR-V.</p>, <p>The rear seatbacks and headrests flip down easily, creating 68 cubic feet of cargo space. There’s an optional two-position load floor, flat or max storage, with an enclosed big square cargo bin that holds 34 cubic feet. The rear hatch can be opened by swinging a foot under the bumper, with the fob in your pocket or purse.</p>, <p>Ford’s Sync Connect enables remote access to the car’s functions via smartphone.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54824" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-escape-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The standard Escape engine is the 2.5-liter making 168 horsepower and 170 pound-feet of torque. It’s neither modern nor exciting, but still smooth and competent. It’s not quick but it has adequate acceleration. It has a bit less horsepower and torque than the new 1.5-liter, and gets two less mpg.</p>, <p>The new 1.5-liter engine makes 179 horsepower and 177 pound-feet of torque. The transmission kicks down as much as with the 2.5 liter. For a little engine it makes booming sounds when you floor it, although its bark is bigger than its bite because it’s not exactly a rocket. But as 1.5-liter engines go, it’s good.</p>, <p>The only engine choice, in our minds, is the EcoBoost 2.0-liter turbo, making 245 horsepower and 275 pound-feet or torque, and zooming to sixty miles per hour in less than seven seconds. It’s a big bargain at an option price of about $1500 more. It separates the Escape from almost every other crossover in its class.</p>, <p>The six-speed automatic is a good match for the EcoBoost engines, with programmed shift points that balance fuel mileage (some transmissions are programmed for fuel mileage, which can make them shift at unnatural times). The 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter get paddle shifters, while the 2.5 has a lame sport mode with a switch on the lever to change gears.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive moves power from the front to rear wheels, up to 100 percent in either direction, where ever the traction is needed.</p>, <p>The Escape’s handling is sharp and engaging, responsive with great body control, much better than your average crossover. The steering is crisp, weighty and fast. What makes it so good might be the electronic torque vectoring, which dabs the inside front brake in a corner to help the car turn. That’s why it’s so sharp.</p>, <p>The ride is tightly damped, and sometimes can feel too firm; and with the 19-inch wheels as on the Titanium, it can feel harsh. The smaller wheels bring a smoother ride.</p>, <p>The Ford Escape is stylish and capable. We prefer the 2.0-liter engine. No flaws in the drivetrain, great handling, but don’t expect a soft ride. Can’t fit five adults, but can fit a lot of cargo with seats that easily drop.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-infiniti-qx30/
[<p>The Infiniti QX30 is an elegant little crossover introduced for 2017. In a stunning alliance between Japanese and German carmakers, it shares its platform and front-wheel-drive powertrain with the Mercedes-Benz GLA250.</p>, <p>Both compete against well-executed rivals such as the rear-wheel-drive BMW X1. The Mazda3 hatchback might be seen as a competitor as well, and in fact the QX30 profile suggests the Mazda3.</p>, <p>Otherwise the QX30 body is a unique blend of scalloped edges and lumps, out of which emerges a serious stance. Its creative styling begins a design direction for Infiniti, so watch for other models taking the shape. In the Nissan-Infiniti vision, it’s an international design, for their international expansion. The QX30 is assembled in England. It is unchanged for 2018.</p>, <p>However, the dramatic exterior and compact dimensions limit space in the cabin. It’s considered a five-seater, but it’s tight for two in the rear, and impossible for three.</p>, <p>The QX30 comes three ways: base QX30, sporty QX30S, and QX30 AWD with a raised ride height and body panels that imagine off-road.</p>, <p>The QX30 crossovers sold around the world get a choice of engines. In North America, there is only one: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 208 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, coupled to an automated 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. It gets an EPA-rated 27 Combined miles per gallon on Premium gasoline. On the AWD model, an intelligent all-wheel-drive system can transmit up to half the power to the rear wheels, whenever sensors detect traction loss.</p>, <p>QX30 models are base, Luxury, Premium and Sport, available with all-wheel-drive in Luxury and Premium.</p>, <p>QX30 comes standard ($29,950) with high-quality black fabric upholstery, manual front seats, and InTouch infotainment with a 7-inch screen, but don’t expect Infiniti dealers to find one out back for you. Much more common will be the QX30 Luxury ($32,600), available with AWD ($34,400)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54812" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-sport.jpg" width="200"/>QX30S Sport ($38,500) comes with front-wheel drive, a lower ride height with 19-inch wheels, its own front and rear fascia, a glossy black grille, leather-wrapped, flat-bottomed steering wheel, and aluminum pedals and footrests. Sport seats with eight-way power adjustment and lumbar support are available.</p>, <p>Nappa leather is available. Optional designer packages for the interior include: City Black that couples black upholstery with purple stitching; Cafe Teak that features black stitching with brown/black upholstery; Gallery White that trims white upholstery with red details.</p>, <p>Safety features include blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning with emergency braking assist, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, self-parking, and a surround-view camera system that detects moving objects like dogs, cats, or children.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54815" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Infiniti’s latest design language speaks sharp angles and sweeping curves, with elements of French design.</p>, <p>From the long and angular nose, the sheetmetal flows back to swollen fenders around large wheel wells. The greenhouse is short and low, flaunting Infiniti’s familiar reverse-crescent C-pillar that supports and steeply sloped rear window and reaches to a chopped rear end. It’s a profile unlike any other luxury compact crossover.</p>, <p>Sharp scalloped character lines begin near the top and bottom of the front doors and narrow as they race toward the rear wheel wells, deliver a striking three-dimensional image and exaggerating the car’s horizontal lines. An elevated stance somehow steals from the hatchback silhouette. That’s not on the QX30S, which is a half-inch lower and shows it.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54814" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>When you enter the cabin your attention is immediately drawn to the asymmetrical sweep of the dashboard. It’s very much unlike the austere and business-like Mercedes crossover (or any German car) that it shares some pieces with, for example much of the switchgear. It’s weird, German knobs in an Infiniti.</p>, <p>The cabin is smartly designed and full of high-quality materials. Even in the base model having an excellent fabric upholstery, there’s a lot of soft-touch materials.</p>, <p>Infiniti designs its seats based on spinal support research, matching the curvature of the human spine, to reduce pressure on the back muscles with better distribution of the load. Maybe as a result, some passengers can expect a snug fit in their seats. Front seats are sufficiently wide with good legroom, though head space is limited. As a road curves leftward, taller drivers might note that the windshield pillar restricts their view. The coupe-like roof dips sharply downward, so average-height, front-seat passengers might feel obliged to duck their heads to see outward.</p>, <p>The long roof provides a greater sense of spaciousness in the rear, but it’s also low, so that takes away headroom. Same with legroom in the 60/40 split-folding rear seat. The cabin volume is rated at 19.2 cubic feet, which is one more cubic foot than the Mercedes GLA250 that it’s based upon.</p>, <p>Voice recognition controls audio and navigation commands. InTouch infotainment features intuitive finger-touch and swipe controls, via a seven-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54816" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-qx30-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Since the QX30 presents a Mercedes powertrain, it delivers Mercedes performance. The engine and transmission are responsive, from a standstill or during passing. (Some other turbocharged four-cylinders with dual-clutch automated transmissions are hesitant at those times.) Acceleration from zero to sixty miles per hour comes in just over seven seconds, which is good performance. There’s a rumble from under the hood, maybe more than you want to hear.</p>, <p>The gas pedal is quick initially, making the power tricky to modulate from a start. The paddle-shifting dual-clutch 7-speed shifts quickly but sometimes gets confused at low speeds.</p>, <p>Intended to conserve fuel, the automatic Stop/Start system is noticeable, but not jolting as in some rivals. It must be the smooth Mercedes system, better than the disruptive BMW system.</p>, <p>The steering feels consistent at any speed, neither heavy at high speeds nor overboosted in parking-lot driving. Of course, it might be argued that the whole point of electronic variable steering is to make it heavier at speed and lighter in tight maneuvers. But no, Infiniti engineers say they intended the QX30 steering to be consistent. It’s also precise.</p>, <p>The QX30 corners with dexterity. In the twisties, the front-wheel-drive feels more alive. The front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive models ride nearly the same, with the awd a bit stiffer because of its thicker rear anti-roll bar. Firmer springs and suspension tuning on the front-wheel-drive QX30S tighten the handling but don’t significantly stiffen the ride on the 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p>The Infiniti QX30 features striking sheetmetal wrapped around a Mercedes engine and transmission. Stylish cabin is best-suited for two, with four only occasionally. Twenty-seven miles per gallon on Premium fuel with responsive acceleration performance.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Audi Q3 is a five-seat crossover with nubile styling that aspires to be elongated, like its big brother the Q5. All-wheel-drive subcompact crossovers have become popular, and the Q3 now competes with the BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz GLA, Mazda CX-3, and Fiat 500X, to name a few. The Q3 is more compact than them, though not as small as the Range Rover Evoque. At 172.6 inches, it’s only a foot longer than a Mini Cooper hatchback.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi Q3 is in the fourth year of its second generation, and continues unchanged.</p>, <p>There is one powertrain, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. It handles well, although its engineering priority is ride and comfort, over crisp cornering. For a compact, its fuel mileage is low, with an EPA-estimated 20/29 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined. Luxury cars get that nowadays.</p>, <p>The Q3 rates top crash-test scores from the IIHS. A rearview camera and parking sensors are standard, while options include blind spot monitor and automatic park assist.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54805" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q3-final.jpg" width="200"/>There are three trim levels: Premium ($32,900), Premium Plus, and Prestige. Front-wheel drive is standard Quattro all-wheel-drive is extra ($2100).</p>, <p>Standard equipment on the Premium includes 12-way power front seats, a panoramic sunroof, and LED running lamps and taillamps. The Premium Plus model adds heated folding mirrors and a power liftgate. The Prestige has an grander audio system, navigation, blind-spot monitors, in-car 4G LTE data services with Audi Connect, and Audi’s Multi-Media Interface.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54807" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q3-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Q3 has a tidy shape that’s not dated, a subtle wedge that’s subtly rounded at the edges. Its stance that’s more muscular than the same-sized A3 Sportback, and two inches lower, if less broad-shouldered, than the Q5. The Q3 looks purposeful.</p>, <p>Narrow headlamps fly like wings from the top corners of the huge grille, but the real beauty is in the black mesh intakes, four of them, off the lower corners of the grille.</p>, <p>The sculpting at the sides climbs to a hatchback roofline that aspires to coupe, and wraps down to a smooth liftgate with LED taillamps that look neat from behind.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54806" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q3-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q3-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q3-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Technically it seats five but the third passenger in rear won’t like it, as there’s not much knee or head room back there. A panoramic sunroof is standard, which is nice but lowers the ceiling. Visibility isn’t great, with thick pillars and a small rear window.</p>, <p>The cabin is tasteful and detailed well, and the trim choices are simple and few. The dash is a broad stretch of soft black plastic trimmed by thin metallic rings. The gauges are big and clear, and on some models with infotainment, a 7.0-inch screen folds out from the dash. On others, it doesn’t stow away, with the MMI knob fixed on the center console. The screen offers a bright high-resolution display, especially vivid with the Google Earth maps.</p>, <p>The driving position is excellent, but the optional sport seats aren’t optional, they’re necessary, for their bolstering. The center console doesn’t crowd the driver’s right knee, as it does in many compacts.</p>, <p>Cargo space is good, with 16.7 cubic feet behind the rear seat, about the size of a big trunk. And with the rear seatbacks flipped, there’s a 48.2 cubic feet, quite healthy for a compact.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54804" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q3-driving.jpg" width="200"/>The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine is exceptionally well-tuned and responsive, and gets the most out of its 200 horsepower. But the Q3 is kind of chubby for a sub compact, at 3500 pounds, so more horsepower would be nice. The Q3 does zero to sixty in 7.8 seconds, or 8.2 seconds with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The good news is that the torque, 207 pound-feet, hits its peak at a low 2000 rpm and stays there over a broad range of rpm, a compensation that helps make the Q3 feel energetic.</p>, <p>The 6-speed automatic transmission’s gears are well spaced, and shifts are confident, but we miss the DSG twin-clutch that Audi builds so well.</p>, <p>The suspension has four links in rear, and struts in front. The ride is well damped. The Q3 isn’t harsh on bumpy streets, like the Mercedes-Benz GLA. It has good road manners, and feels balanced.</p>, <p>The electric-assist power steering is responsive and fairly quick. The handling is tidy, even agile at times, but it can’t match the BMW X1. But overall, the Q3 actually feels sportier than the X1.</p>, <p>The tidy Q3 is fairly nimble and fairly quick. It could be compelling, if only it were nimbler and quicker. Two hundred horsepower, no matter how responsive, lugging 3500 pounds, is a bit of a drag. It’s reflected in 23 miles per gallon.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-volvo-xc60/
[<p>The 2018 Volvo XC60 midsize luxury all-wheel-drive SUV is all new. It shows the recently sleek Volvo design language. It says wagon like no other, but does SUV. It plays in the big time, against rivals like Jaguar F-Pace, Mercedes-Benz GLC, and Audi Q5.</p>, <p>Since the three-row Volvo XC90 has been discontinued by Volvo, the new XC60 appears to inherit that earth. Its wheelbase is 3.6 inches longer than before, while its overall length is just 1.8 inches more, giving it more cabin space. It’s still five inches shorter than the old XC90, and two inches lower.</p>, <p>It comes with three engines: The XC60 T5 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder makes 250 horsepower and earns an EPA-estimated 24 miles per gallon Combined city and highway.</p>, <p>The XC60 T6 2.0-liter turbo and supercharged four-cylinder makes 316 horsepower and earns 23 mpg Combined.</p>, <p>The XC60 T8 Twin Engine Electric Plug-In Hybrid makes 400 horsepower with electric all-wheel drive. It earns 26 mpg Combined or 59 MPGe from the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>, <p>They’re all mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. And with an improved body structure and more sound insulation, there is no four-cylinder thrum to any of the powerplants.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive system is biased toward the front wheels, with most of the power going there until traction is needed in the rear, which can take 50 percent of the power, so it’s evenly balanced. It’s never biased toward the rear.</p>, <p>Volvo is known for equipment. Even the base model comes standard with leather, panoramic moonroof, LED headlamps, Apple Carplay / Android Auto, nine-inch touchscreen, driving modes, 10-speaker sound system, Bluetooth, 4G LTE, power liftgate, rearview camera and Lane Keeping Aid.</p>, <p>Volvo is known for safety. Standard safety equipment includes the Intellisafe City Safety system, which detects a pedestrian, cyclist, vehicle or large animal, and applies emergency braking.</p>, <p>Making its debut on the 2018 XC60 as an option, comes the next step, Oncoming Lane Mitigation. It provides steering input to mitigate a head-on collision. Also in 2018, Volvo’s Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) adds Steer Assist. If you start to turn toward a car in your blind spot, the steering wheel will resist.</p>, <p>The Volvo XC60 comes in T5 ($41,500), T6 ($44,900), T8 ($52,900) versions. There are three trims: Momentum, R-Design, and Inscription.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54797" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-xc60-r.jpg" width="200"/>The R-Design gets sport seats, black mesh grille, hands-free tailgate, 12.3-inch digital display that replaces the standard gauges, 19-inch wheels, navigation, and paddle shift controls (it’s the only model to get them). A notable option is 21-inch wheels with wide summer tires.</p>, <p>Inscription gets a stitched dash, driftwood trim, navigation, and four-zone climate control.</p>, <p>Optional features include soft Nappa Leather seats with ventilation and massage, Bowers &amp; Wilkins Premium Sound, and four-corner air suspension.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54798" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-xc60-walkaround.jpg" width="200"/>The styling is mainstream. It’s not tall and bluff like the XC90, although it tries to look tall with tricks like a high grille, and tall taillamps that reach to the roof. The high shoulder line makes the body look like a rising wedge, like a BMW X3.</p>, <p>The best part are the slim hammer-shaped LEDs used for daytime running lamps called Thor’s Hammer.</p>, <p>The cabin is elegant and serene, while being less minimalist than the Volvo luxury sedans, and cozier than the XC90 SUV. The cabin caters to the senses, it doesn’t assault them. It has a portrait-style touchscreen like few others, McLaren and Tesla to name two. The driftwood-trimmed dashboard soothes the eyes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54796" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-xc60-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-xc60-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-xc60-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Volvo’s colorful Sensus infotainment system is revised with new tiles, and icons moved for better visibility. The 9-inch portrait-style screen makes perfect sense, especially with navigation. It’s the type of screen used in the Tesla Model S and Model X.</p>, <p>The cabin has a cocoon-like quality, with glass that tilts inward and a laid-back center console. The serenity is heightened by the absence of knobs and buttons.</p>, <p>The power front seats are deep, pocketed, and well-padded. Six-footers have room for their knees and heads in the rear, even with the standard panoramic roof. A third adult can briefly fit in the rear, or maybe more comfortably if less likely three car seats.</p>, <p>There’s 29.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat, about twice the size of a trunk. That expands to an almost-vast 68.7 cubic feet when you fold down the rear seat.</p>, <p>We drove a T6 Inscription, with the turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder, eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. With peak horsepower of 316, the acceleration comes evenly and without drama over the rev range. Weighing 4,054 pounds, it can accelerate from 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds, and has a top speed of 140 mph.</p>, <p>In any of the three driving modes, the eight-speed automatic is well matched to the powerband of the T6, which comes on early.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54794" height="142" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-xc60-drivingt8.jpg" width="200"/>The Economy mode slows the transmission response, along with throttle response. Comfort, the default mode, picks up the pace while remaining true to its word. There’s also a Dynamic mode, an off-road mode that engages hill descent control, increases steering assist, and slows throttle and shift response, and a custom mode.</p>, <p>The driving modes also adjust the suspension response in all models but the Momentum. The suspension is double wishbone front, and transverse leaf spring with links in the rear. Our Inscription had the available adaptive dampers and air suspension. It lowers itself at speed and raises itself when ground clearance is needed.</p>, <p>In the Economy mode, less boost goes to the dampers and steering, so the XC60 feels dull and heavy. The Comfort mode makes it all feel creamy. The Dynamic mode is stimulating (it also cuts out the standard Stop/Start system). Our Inscription had optional 20-inch wheels to go with the all-wheel drive; we found the Dynamic mode helped it track better. With the adaptive dampers, the XC60 doesn’t engage the road, it smothers it.</p>, <p>The T5 gets the 250-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo four engine. Measured with a stopwatch, it’s only a bit slower than the T6, with a zero-to-sixty acceleration time of 6.4 seconds, on its way to the same 140-mph top speed.</p>, <p>The T8 plug-in hybrid connects the turbo engine to an electric motor and a 10.4-kw battery pack, to make 400 horsepower. Despite its weight of 4600 pounds, it will accelerate from zero to sixty in 4.9 seconds, says Volvo. T8 plug-in hybrids get their own modes that conserve battery power or set the engine to charge the battery.</p>, <p>The all-new Volvo XC60 brings more interior room on a longer wheelbase, while minimizing overall length. The styling is smooth. The self-steering steps (in times of emergency) are significant. The T6 powertrain, at least, is impressive, with an engine that’s both turbocharged and supercharged.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-hyundai-elantra/
[<p>Following a 2017 revamp of the Elantra lineup, Hyundai has introduced a new Elantra GT Sport hatchback for the 2018 model year. A new Elantra SEL trim level takes the place of the previous SE with a Popular Equipment Package. Otherwise, little has changed for 2018.</p>, <p>Offered in sedan and GT hatchback body styles, Elantra is a serious competitor among compacts, with sharp design, a roomy cabin, and abundant features. Its last major redesign was for the 2014 model year.</p>, <p>Elantra offers three engine choices. Base engine for both body styles is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which develops 147 horsepower in the sedan and 162 hp in the GT hatchback. Torque output is 137 or 150 pound-feet, respectively. A 6-speed manual gearbox is standard, but most Elantras are fitted with a fuel-thrifty 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54782" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-sport.jpg" width="200"/>Sport trim levels in sedan and hatchback body styles share a peppy 1.6-liter turbo four, producing 201 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. As an alternative to manual shift, the turbo can mate with a smooth-shifting 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Finally, the Eco sedan gets a 1.4-liter turbo four, coupled to the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.</p>, <p>Differences between the sedan and the GT hatchbacks are significant, as the two body styles are not really related. Not only does the hatch offer greater cabin space, with more premium-looking finishes, but the GT Sport’s suspension promises greater control.</p>, <p>Crash-test scores are incomplete. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the sedan only a four-star overall rating, with four stars for both frontal and side impacts. The 2017 hatchback got a five-star rating overall, but four stars in the frontal-impact test. No testing has been done on the 2018 GT hatchback.</p>, <p>For its crash-test program, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the Electra sedan a Top Safety Pick+, based upon Good test scores. Unfortunately, that award applies only to the top Limited trim level, when fitted with advanced-safety options.</p>, <p>An optional suite of safety features includes blind-spot monitoring, active lane control, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54781" height="104" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>Elantra 2.0L SE sedan comes with the 2.0-liter engine and manual ($16,950) or automatic ($17,950) transmission, 15-inch wheels, six-speaker audio, cloth upholstery, and a 3.5-inch screen. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $885 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Elantra 2.0L SEL sedan ($18,850) gets an automatic transmission, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, 16-inch alloy wheels, rearview camera, dual-zone climate control, and Bluetooth. Blind-spot detection also is standard. Elantra 2.0L Value Edition sedan ($19,850) comes with an automatic transmission and features from the Limited, including a sunroof an heated front seats.</p>, <p>Elantra 2.0L Limited ($22,100) includes an automatic transmission, chrome trim, leather seating surfaces, BlueLink telematics, and 17-inch wheels. An 8.0-inch infotainment screen with navigation is optional.</p>, <p>Elantra 1.4T Eco sedan ($20,550) is similar to SEL, but with the 1.4-liter turbo engine, dual-clutch transmission, and smaller (15-inch) wheels to improve fuel economy.</p>, <p>Elantra 1.6T Sport comes with a more potent turbo engine and manual ($21,800) or automatic ($22,900) and is trimmed similar to Limited.</p>, <p>Elantra GT hatchback comes is similar in equipment to SEL sedan, with the 2.0-liter engine and 6-speed manual ($19,350) or automatic ($20,350) transmission; an 8.0-inch display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and rearview camera are standard.</p>, <p>Elantra GT Sport hatch gets the 1.6-liter turbo engine with manual ($23,250) or 7-speed dual-clutch transmission ($24,350), along with a multi-link rear suspension and bigger brakes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54783" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Less daring than past Elantra models, the current version is attractive in either body style. With their shapely sheetmetal, sedans are actually more aerodynamic, though the Euro-styled GT hatchback has a lower, wider stance.</p>, <p>The GT gets a tightened-up version of Hyundai’s large trapezoidal grille, with a mesh pattern. Hatchback daytime running lights differ from the sedan’s LED units. Sedans have three taillights flanking an upturned decklid, while the GT rear end is more rounded.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54784" height="184" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Even though the Elantra is considered a compact, interior dimensions approach midsize. Material quality is low-budget, black plastic.</p>, <p>Most controls and the touchscreen angle toward the driver. Front seats are generally good, but the sedan is more comfortable, with better bolstering on the seat cushions. Sport models feature deeper bucket seats, with fabric that maintains a stronger grip.</p>, <p>Back-seat riders get ample head and knee clearance, but seat cushions aren’t as comfortable. Sedan rear seats are on the low side, giving six-footers abundant headroom. Rear legroom is an inch tighter in a GT hatchback.</p>, <p>Sedans boast 14.4 cubic feet of cargo volume, appropriate for a compact. Cargo space in hatchbacks has grown to 24.9 cubic feet, expanding to 55.4 cubic feet with split seatbacks folded.</p>, <p>Upper models contain more sound-deadening material. Fit and finish tends to be better in GT models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54786" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-gt-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-gt-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-elantra-gt-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Ride comfort is a prime attraction. Elantras are quiet, solid, and refined. Non-Sport suspensions absorb quite a few pavement flaws. Only on seriously harsh surfaces does the hatchback’s premium suspension reveal its limitations.</p>, <p>A well-composed ride is the rule, but handing falls around the middle of the pack. Fitted with light, yet precise, steering, the GT hatchback feels firmly planted on the pavement, if a tad heavy in corners and curves. Sport models get a multi-link independent rear suspension, providing greater body-motion control.</p>, <p>Brake behavior in a Sport sedan failed to elicit full confidence, because of a dull pedal feel and significant fading in hard stops.</p>, <p>Sport models are the most enjoyable to drive. Base-engine performance falls short of enthusiastic, but the turbo provides a peppier experience. Sport models should accelerate to 60 mph in about 7.5 seconds. Performance sags in the Eco edition.</p>, <p>Elantras are relatively fuel-efficient, if short of class-leading. Most Elantra sedans with the 2.0-liter engine and 6-speed automatic are EPA-rated at 28/37 mpg City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined. SE models, which contain fewer features, are a tad thriftier at 29/38/33 mpg. The Elantra Eco does even better: EPA-rated at 32/40 mpg City/Highway, or 35 mpg Combined. Sport sedans manage only 22/30/25 mpg.</p>, <p>Hatchbacks with automatic are EPA-rated at 24/32 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined. Manual-shift Sport hatchbacks get a 22/29/25 mpg rating.</p>, <p>The base Elantra is spartan but delivers good value. Upper trim levels aren’t quite as value-focused, but have nicer trim. GT hatchbacks promise greater utility and, in Sport form, driving delight. In addition to good infotainment systems, Elantras have an impressive warranty.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-audi-q7/
[<p>Audi Q7 was all-new for 2017. Audi’s largest luxury SUV, capable of seating seven, reached the U.S. market for the 2007 model year. A second generation debuted for 2017. Therefore, little has changed for the 2018 model year, aside from a proximity key being made standard on all versions. A Bose audio system now is included with Premium Plus trim.</p>, <p>In short, the 2018 Audi Q7 is entering its second year as a completely redesigned model. With its family sized interior space and impressive advanced technology, augmented by glorious ride quality, the Q7 promises just about everything you’d want in a luxury crossover.</p>, <p>In nearly every way, the 2018 Q7 ranks among Audi’s most impressive offerings.</p>, <p>Two engines are available, in three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, rated at 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque, is standard in Premium and Premium Plus.</p>, <p>Choosing Prestige trim brings a supercharged 3.0-liter V6, developing 333 horsepower and 325 pound-feet. The V6 is optional for lesser trim levels. An 8-speed automatic transmission couples with standard Quattro all-wheel-drive.</p>, <p>Even the entry-level Q7 Premium model is amply equipped. Picking the right options can transform that base Q7 into an utterly posh highway cruiser, but those extras come at a hefty price. ,One of those options, the Virtual Cockpit, is a large, configurable high-resolution screen, which takes the place of the conventional gauge cluster. Coupled with Audi’s navigation system, the Virtual Cockpit can display crisply clear Google Earth maps, among other features.</p>, <p>In each element of crash-testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Q7 has earned admirable (Good) marks, except for assessment of its headlight function. All Q7s have a rearview camera, but a lot of the available safety technology is optional rather than standard. A Vision Package adds a surround-view camera, full LED headlights, and the Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch LCD screen. Side airbags for the rear seat are optional. Pre Sense City, Audi’s low-speed automatic emergency braking system, can automatically apply brakes as needed, at speeds up to 52 mph. A full-speed braking system, dubbed Pre Sense Front, is part of the Driver Assistance Package for upper trim levels, which also includes adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54774" height="137" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-2.jpg" width="200"/>Premium 2.0 ($49,900) comes with the four-cylinder engine, leather upholstery, heated power front seats, automatic wipers, three-zone automatic climate control, 7.0-inch infotainment screen, wood inlays, panoramic sunroof, power-folding third-row seat, and rearview camera. Premium Plus 2.0 ($53,900) adds navigation, a power-adjustable steering column, Bose surround-sound audio, and LED interior lights. Driver Assistance and Vision packages are options. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $975 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Premium 3.0 Supercharged V6 ($56,400) is similar to Premium 2.0, but substitutes the 333-horsepower V6 engine, and is available with Premium Plus 3.0 Supercharged V6 ($60,400) equipment. Prestige 3.0 Supercharged V6 ($65,400) includes 20-inch wheels, power soft-close doors, LED headlights, 19-speaker Bose audio, a top-view camera, four-zone climate control, and Vision Package with Virtual Cockpit. A Luxury Package for Prestige trim includes upgraded leather and ventilated front seats with massaging. An air suspension coupled with four-wheel steering is optional.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54773" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>More than some competitors, the Q7 stands apart from the pack of three-row crossover models. Some might consider it a bit dull-looking, but the Q7 fits right into Audi’s overall design pattern.</p>, <p>Few design details could be called excessive or overdone. Viewed from the side, the Q7 bears a greater resemblance to a tall wagon than some of its more boxy-profiled rivals. At the rear is a clamshell-style liftgate.</p>, <p>Wheels come in a selection of styles, from 18 to 20 inches. LED headlights, flanking a wide grille, are standard with Prestige trim and optional for Premium Plus.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54776" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>If the Q7’s exterior leans toward the dull side, the same cannot be said of the stunning cabin. Riders can envelop themselves in its dramatically ravishing textures and upscale mood.</p>, <p>Comfort is another strong point. Even for taller occupants, front and second-row seats are both comfortable and nicely supportive. Upholstered in leather, even in base trim, the front seats offer an abundance of adjustments. Three passengers in row two have ample space.</p>, <p>As expected, the third row is somewhat snug for adults, but the same can be said of competitive crossovers. Youngsters will like it better. Overall space ranks as excellent for five passengers, but less so with seven.</p>, <p>At the rear, the cargo area is spacious and flexible, if not quite as wide as expected. The standard power-folding third row yields a largely flat load floor. Cargo volume is minimal with the third row upright.</p>, <p>Genuine wood trim features either glossy or matte finish. Even the plastic trim elements look good. Ample storage space is available for small items, as well as beverages.</p>, <p>In certain cities, Audi’s MMI Navigation Plus Package can communicate directly with the urban infrastructure.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54772" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-q7-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Every Audi Q7 model rides with impressive comfort and handles capably. Relatively precise steering has a light but direct feel, though short of sporty.</p>, <p>The standard four-cylinder will satisfy many drivers, with its 0-60 mph acceleration time of 7.1 seconds. For some, the strong V6 may be a better choice, making the Q7 an excellent vehicle for long journeys. With V6 power, the Q7 can reach 60 mph in 5.7 seconds. Even with a full load, the V6 model feels energetic.</p>, <p>Although the Q7 looks big and bulky, substantial use of aluminum keeps its weight near 5,000 pounds. As a result, the Q7 feels both agile and responsive.</p>, <p>The suspension absorbs rough pavement, without turning floaty when taking corners. A Q7 feels confident and securely planted, even through curves. Audi’s Drive Select system modifies throttle response, shift points, and steering effort. Optional, larger wheels don’t impair ride quality.</p>, <p>Especially with the V6 engine, Audi’s 8-speed transmission shifts swiftly, with little discernible hesitation. Standard all-wheel drive is most welcome on wet, slick pavement. Off-roading isn’t its forte, even with the height-adjustable air suspension available for the Prestige edition.</p>, <p>Considering its size and weight, Q7 fuel economy isn’t bad. Surprisingly, both the four-cylinder and V6 models are identically EPA-rated, at 19/25 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined. A start/stop system can shut off the engine at stoplights.</p>, <p>On a variety of levels, Audi’s larger crossover stands on par with, or above, most of its competition. Careful attention to details helps make the Q7 a good value, easily worth its relatively high starting price. Total cost rises fast when options are added. Only top trim levels qualify for the most valuable advanced technology.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Audi A7, a luxurious four-door hatch, flaunts a shapely, sloped roofline. Based on the midsize A6 sedan, the A7 echoes a trend of luxury sedans with coupe profiles established by BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Introduced as a 2010 model, Audi’s fashionable four-door A7 and S7 earned a facelift for the 2015 season.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year, the 3.0-liter supercharged V6 engine gains 7 horsepower to 333 hp. A new A7 Competition model boasts some distinct styling touches in black and red, plus a firmer suspension and slight boost in horsepower to 340. For 2018, wheels have been restyled for S7 and RS 7 models, and the RS 7 gets a new exhaust setup.</p>, <p>As before, A7 comes standard with quattro all-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic transmission, in Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels. Audi S7 continues, along with the near-supercar RS 7.</p>, <p>The Audi A7 comes with a supercharged V6 developing 340 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54764" height="120" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-s7.jpg" width="200"/>The S7 gets a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, generating 450 horsepower and 406 pound-feet.</p>, <p>The RS 7 elevates V8 output to 560 horsepower and 518 pound-feet. Topping the scale is the RS 7 Performance edition, with its V8 unleashing a startling 605 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. In standard tune, the RS 7 achieves 0-60 mph acceleration in just 3.7 seconds.</p>, <p>In addition to its dapper profile, the A7 provides an appealing blend of ride and handling. Audi has long been known for adoption of technology. Each trim level is well-equipped, and the hatchback configuration promises valuable utility. Not many cars match the A7 in ability to transport four passengers in congenial comfort, though back-seat space is limited by the roof shape.</p>, <p>A broad range of safety technology is available, much of it optional. Standard equipment includes a rearview camera, front/rear parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, and Bluetooth connectivity. An optional Driver Assistance Plus package includes corner-view cameras, lane keep assist, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop/go, and automatic high-beam headlights. Another option package includes Night Vision assistance that can detect animals and humans.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54760" height="144" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-final.jpg" width="200"/>A7 Premium Plus ($69,700) has a supercharged 3.0-liter V6, all-wheel drive, heated power front seats, leather seat upholstery, four-zone automatic climate control, rearview camera, moonroof, navigation with voice control, power liftgate, and 19-inch alloy wheels (Prices are MSRP and do not include $975 destination charge.) A7 Prestige ($72,400) adds a head-up display, corner-view camera, power door closers, and 630-watt Bose audio.</p>, <p>A7 Competition includes sports suspension, specially tuned rear differential, matte-finish Titanium 20-inch wheels, red brake calipers, four-passenger seating, and distinctive styling touches.</p>, <p>S7 Premium Plus ($81,200) has a 450-horsepower twin-turbo V8, plus adaptive air suspension, Valcona leather seats, four-seat configuration, and 14-speaker Bose surround-sound audio. S7 Prestige ($83,150) is upgraded similarly to A7 Prestige.</p>, <p>RS 7 ($113,900) contains the 560-horsepower V8, an adaptive air suspension, sport differential, honeycomb-stitched Valcona leather, and navigation with voice control. RS 7 Performance ($130,700) raises V8 output to 605 horsepower.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54762" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Even though the A7 design is starting to age, this low, sloping-roof premium hatchback remains as enticing as it was in 2010. Mercedes-Benz might have been first with the basic design principle, but Audi’s version has held up particularly well.</p>, <p>Viewed up front, differences between the A7 and its more conventional A6 companion are modest but noticeable. Naturally, the foremost divergence between the two body styles centers on the roofline. Not only is the roof lower than usual, it tapers into a graceful fastback profile, leading to a sharp back end. A small spoiler is set to rise at higher speeds, ready to enhance downforce.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54761" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Like its still-enchanting exterior, the A7’s cabin has aged comfortably and effortlessly. Up front, as least, the down-to-business interior differs little from that of the A6 sedan.</p>, <p>Front occupants get comfortable seats as well as an upscale aura. Even the base-model A7 is well-equipped and feels elegant, helped by abundant leather and attractive wood trim.</p>, <p>Because of the A7/S7 roofline, back-seat riders can expect to feel a bit constricted. Headroom is greater in the A6 sedan than in the shapely A7 hatchback. Adults fit easily into the outboard rear seats, but only if they’re not especially tall. Scallops cut into the rear of the front seatbacks help with leg space, but getting in and out of the back seat may be a challenging task.</p>, <p>Despite the sloping roof, larger items fit readily into the cargo area. Folding down the rear seats eases loading of longer items.</p>, <p>Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all models. So is an inductive, wireless charging pad. Audi’s MMI infotainment system is easy enough to use and reasonably intuitive, employing a control knob and touchpad rather than a touchscreen. The high-resolution LCD screen rises from the center. Audi’s navigation system ranks among the best.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54763" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Reaching beyond stylish appearance and energetic performance, agile handling and a compliant ride help the A7 maintain its status as a luxury automobile. With its nicely-balanced chassis, the hatchback is a joy to drive, even for everyday duties.</p>, <p>All-wheel-drive traction helps, too, resulting in an exquisitely poised and smooth road machine. A touch of sportiness rounds out the A7 picture, but there’s nothing harsh about the experience. Demanding enthusiasts might yearn for more feedback from the light steering setup, but most A7/S7 drivers should be wholly satisfied.</p>, <p>Emitting mellow sounds, the smooth-running V6 engine mates well with Audi’s quick-shifting 8-speed automatic. Exhibiting a neutral grip on the pavement, the hatchback shows only a hint of the nose-heavy nature of some past Audi models. Even on rough surfaces, the suspension reveals impressive compliance.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54765" height="109" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-a7-rear-s7.jpg" width="200"/>Thunderous performance is the byword for the S7 and its hotter-yet RS 7 offshoot. Although their suspensions are defiantly firm, the ride isn’t punitive.</p>, <p>For a powerful, strong-performance car, the A7 is thriftier than expected. The V6 model is EPA-rated at 20/29 mpg City/Highway, or 23 mpg Combined, using premium gasoline. The 8-speed transmission lets the engine run at low, thriftier speeds much of the time. With its V8 engine, the 2017 S7 was EPA-rated at 17/27 mpg City/Highway, or 21 mpg Combined. The RS 7 managed only 15/25/18 mpg.</p>, <p>An A7 still exudes eye-grabbing beauty, but that’s only the beginning. The stylish premium hatchback does just about everything right, excelling even in utility. In fact, based upon its balance of handling and ride comfort, it’s difficult to envision a more comprehensive midsize luxury car.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection.

---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-cadillac-ats/
[<p>The Cadillac ATS, a rear-wheel-drive sedan or coupe with all-wheel drive available, was introduced for 2013, and immediately won North American Car of the Year. Since then it’s proven itself a worthy challenger to the best of the German sports sedans and coupes, as well as the Lexus IS and others.</p>, <p>The ATS is powered by two excellent engines, a turbocharged four-cylinder or silky powerful V6. The 2.0-turbo makes 272 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, with an 8-speed automatic or 6-speed manual. The 3.6-liter V6 makes 335 hp and 285 lb-ft, mated to an 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54752" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-ats-sedan.jpg" width="200"/>The 2.0 turbo with the 6-speed manual transmission is a sleeper, a serious sports sedan, with more torque than the V6 and the stimulation of changing gears with a slick gearbox and old-school shift lever. It rides on a superb chassis with stiff suspension. It’s like the little brother of the ATS-V.</p>, <p>The ATS-V is the mega-high-performance model. With vigor and enthusiasm, it challenges the BMW M3 and the Mercedes C63 AMG. The ATS-V uses a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V6 making 464 horsepower and 445 pound-feet of torque. It’s mated either a 6-speed manual with rev-matching or an ultra-fast 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p>The ATS with its turbo four gets about 25 miles per gallon Combined EPA city and highway, on Premium gasoline. The ATS-V with its twin-turbo V6 gets about 19 mpg.</p>, <p>The ATS earns five stars from its federal crash tests. Features such as blind-spot monitors and forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking come standard on the upscale models.</p>, <p>For 2018 the only changes are updates to the available infotainment system, and a new color.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54750" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-ats-coupe.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Cadillac ATS comes as coupe or sedan in three trim levels, Luxury, Premium Luxury and Premium Performance. Standard ATS Luxury equipment includes fabric upholstery, rearview camera, 8.0-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and Bluetooth. Options include leather upholstery and head-up display. Premium Performance models have adjustable dampers (shock absorbers) and a limited-slip rear differential.</p>, <p>Cadillac ATS Premium Luxury models come with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts, and a seat that vibrates to warn the driver of something.</p>, <p>ATS-V includes CUE infotainment system, which includes OnStar, WiFi hotspot, Bluetooth, voice recognition, text-to-voice reading, and Apple CarPlay. Options include a Performance Data Recorder, enabling a track-day driver to record video, while gathering data such as acceleration, grip, steering angle, braking pressure, throttle input, and overlay graphs of laps, on the 5.7-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54755" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-ats-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The ATS distinctively Cadillac, with the classiest styling in town. Nobody does edges like Cadillac, and the ATS is beautifully chiseled in the front and rear. With a long hood and athletic stance, it’s crisp and handsome. Its proportions establish a presence.</p>, <p>The ATS Coupe boasts a character line that runs the length of the car, while the ATS-V shouts muscle car, with an aero kit, aggressive front fascia, wider fenders, big alloy wheels, fatter tires, twin pipes, and domed hood.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54751" height="304" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-ats-seats.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-ats-seats.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-ats-seats-197x300.jpg 197w" width="200"/>The ATS cabin is warm, plush and crafted. A noise cancellation system keeps it quiet. It’s relaxed and ergonomic, draped in wood, leather and metal. The centerstack is cool and high-tech, with an 8.0-inch touchscreen. The CUE infotainment system is improved, and shines. The CUE system uses haptic feedback systems that can be frustrating, but it cleans up clutter in the cabin when traveling with a phone or iPod. A wireless charging mat lives in a secret compartment behind the screen.</p>, <p>In front there’s plenty of room and the deep sport buckets are comfortable. In back it’s a tight fit with 33 inches of legroom, well short of the BMW and Benz. There isn’t much trunk space either, well below the Audi and Infiniti.</p>, <p>In the coupe, entry and exit can be tricky.</p>, <p>The ATS-V is available with Recaro seats with suede accents, but standard cabin materials are about right for the price. Some trim details don’t meet the level of the Mercedes C63 AMG. However when compared to the BMW M3 and M4, the ATS-V feels a step ahead in its leather seats and its metal and plastic trim.</p>, <p>The ATS brings the most powerful 2.0-liter turbo in the class, its 272 horsepower more than that in the Mercedes C300 or BMW 328i. The engine is agile, nimble, quick and eager to run with the big boys. The ATS can shoot from zero to sixty in less than six seconds, which is right fast for a four-cylinder in a big car.</p>, <p>The bigger engine, a direct-injection 3.6-liter twin-turbo V6, is super-smooth and powerful. It turns the ATS into a long-legged cruiser. The 8-speed automatic is seamless.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54753" height="102" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-atsv-driving.jpg" width="200"/>With either engine, the chassis offers composure, confidence, and precision. The ZF electric power steering contributes much to that, a nice light touch in Normal mode. Sport makes it firmer but not quicker; we like that the steering ratio isn’t variable, it makes the car more predictable. In the dynamic department, the ATS smokes the field, except for the BMW, which it matches.</p>, <p>The ride with the standard suspension is fairly stiff, but it might change with other available wheel sizes and tires. The suspension enables good cornering, and the ride is good even with the wider 18-inch wheels and tires. Brembo brakes come with the bigger wheels.</p>, <p>The available FE3 sport suspension uses dampers with magnetically charged fluid changing the stiffness depending on the road surface. GM’s Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) came from the Corvette, and continues to flatten the road.</p>, <p>The rear-wheel-drive ATS-V is a monster V6, with 464 horsepower and 445 pound-feet of torque, thanks to twin-turbocharging the 3.6-liter engine. The electronic limited-slip differential keeps the power balanced between the rear wheels. The paddle-shifting 8-speed automatic is poised on the track, thanks to its sophistication. The Performance Traction Management stability and traction control system is adjustable. Huge Brembo brakes, to bring you down from high speeds.</p>, <p>The body is very stiff, braced at the shock towers, rockers, subframe and engine bay. That helps make the ATS-V remarkably easy to drive, with an alive feel that some rivals lack. However it can get a bit squirmy, with 3700 pounds of curb weight pushing on relatively narrow 255 front tires.</p>, <p>The ATS was developed at the challenging Nurburgring, a benchmark circuit that’s a surefire signal that a manufacturer is serious about handling. Proving that Cadillac does not fear to tread into the backyard of Mercedes and BMW.</p>, <p>The Cadillac ATS has it all: distinctive classy styling, a fabulous turbo four engine or long-legged V6, sharp transmission, tight responsive handling, and a quality cabin with great leather. The ATS-V is a perfect monster.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus LC is an all-new line of luxury sport coupes that will serve as sporty new flagships for Toyota’s luxury brand. Lexus LC was launched for the 2018 model year as two models, the LC 500 with a V8 and the LC 500h featuring a hybrid gas-electric powertrain.</p>, <p>The Lexus LC makes a strong styling statement, promising luxury and performance. We found the LC 500’s road manners superb, with fluid steering and a resilient ride.</p>, <p>The opposite of a lightweight, the Lexus LC 500 weighs 4,280 pounds, as much as a Porsche Panamera or 900 pounds more than a 911 Carrera. And it’s a big car, built on the rear-wheel-drive platform of the upcoming Lexus LS flagship luxury sedan, and measuring 187 inches long with a 113-inch wheelbase. And it’s wide. Yet there is almost no back seat. The accommodations for the second and third passengers are literally buckets, as with the Porsche 911. Cargo space is small and gets even smaller with the hybrid.</p>, <p>The rear-wheel-drive LC 500 uses an existing Lexus engine, the 5.0-liter V8 that’s in the RC F and GS F. Without turbochargers or a supercharger, it makes 467 horsepower and 389 pound-feet of torque, mated to a focused 10-speed automatic transmission with an optional Torsen differential. It can accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour in 4.4 seconds, and reach a top speed of 168 mph. It gets 19 miles per gallon Combined EPA city and highway, a few less than the Corvette or Porsche 911.</p>, <p>The LC 500h uses a 3.5-liter V6 with two electric motors driven by a 44-kw lithium-ion battery. It makes a combined 354 horsepower, can hit sixty mph in 4.7 seconds, and reach 155 mph. One motor powers the car at low speeds through three programmable levels of power, while the second motor adds power at higher speeds. It too uses a 10-speed automatic. It can travel four miles on battery power alone, barely far enough for a cruise of a parking lot. It gets 30 combined miles per gallon.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54739" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-final.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Lexus LC is available in two versions: LC 500 ($92,000), LC 500h ($96,510). Standard equipment includes leather, Bluetooth with audio streaming, LED headlamps, a glass roof, and Pioneer audio. Apple CarPlay or Android Audio are not available.</p>, <p>Options include Mark Levinson audio, 915 watts and 13 speakers; a Torsen limited-slip differential, heated steering wheel, 20- or 21-inch wheels; a Sport bundle with the 21-inch wheels and Torsen differential, as well as a carbon-fiber roof and an active rear spoiler that rises at 50 mph, and retracts at 25 mph.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54740" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The LC 500 first appeared as a concept car at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It’s hard to believe that its futuristic styling is more than five years old, but the car industry is like that, designers are dreamers. At that time, Lexus had no plans to build the car, but the raves from spectators changed the manufacturer’s mind. Like a lot of show-goers, we think it’s the most beautiful Lexus ever made, a sculptural tour de force. Though there is that big grille.</p>, <p>It’s hard to call any shape original, but there isn’t anything quite like the LC 500. It has a pinched tail that’s slightly erotic like the Jaguar F-Type, and some retro reflections of the Alpine-Renault GTA in the profile and side glass. The roof rides like the canopy of a fighter jet. The LED taillamps are like jewels leaving the scene of a stolen show.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54742" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The cabin’s trim is handsome, the leather stitched like an unfolding blossom. It’s available in brave colors like Rioja Red, or another one that’s a three-tone blue, white and orange. The seats flow in organic waves, actual ribs that add support for the passengers that get cupped into place. Still, we wonder where all the lumbar support went. Maybe the same place as the small storage cubbies. Not the most comfortable driver’s seat.</p>, <p>The feel of the interior is angular, under a glass roof that startles. The horizontal dashboard forms a tall, wide wall that manages to separate the driver from the front passenger and steal knee room. The instrument panel suggests a desire for ultimate control, with many roller wheels, toggles, stalks, and touchpads that steal from any sense of tranquility.</p>, <p>The infotainment interface is dreadful, from the mouse to the display on the 10.3-inch split screen, while the Remote Touch interface is too remote. It’s difficult to use even at low speeds, so reliance on the steering-wheel controls is inevitable. The system is among the least useful and most distracting systems we’ve ever used.</p>, <p>The optional sound system has awesome clarity, by Mark Levinson, 915 watts and 13 speakers. The standard audio system is crisp but lacks the depth that an audiophile desires.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54738" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-lc500-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Our first impression of the LC 500 on the road is of a large, heavy coupe. It feels heavy while cruising, the 5-liter V8 burbling along, reminding us of a time long ago in a ’71 Mustang with a 351 Cleveland. The throaty bark of the Lexus V8 is amplified and piped into the cabin. The transmission shifts slowly and the drivetrain lacks the crisp responsiveness of a sports car.</p>, <p>The V6/electric LC 500h accelerates nearly as quickly as the V8, but it doesn’t come close to matching the sound, which is artificial, because the hybrid uses a synthetic soundtrack. But it’s unnatural, buzzy and too loud.</p>, <p>The chassis combines steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber to be very stiff, which creates beautifully composed handling. Indeed, the Lexus LC 500 feels taut and precise on curvy roads. The multi-link suspension and adaptive shocks work harmoniously with the electric power steering, the optional staggered-width 21-inch Michelin Pilot Sport tires, and huge disc brakes.</p>, <p>The Lexus LC is no lightweight, weighing 700-800 pounds more than a Chevrolet Corvette or Jaguar F-Type. That substantial mass makes the LC more luxury GT than sports car.</p>, <p>Yet, it’s edginess and sportiness prevents it from being a cushy luxury car. It responds best to an alert, engaged driver.</p>, <p>There are four drive modes, Eco, Comfort, Sport and Sport Plus.</p>, <p>The suspension is supple, although less so with the 21-inch tires. The electric steering gets two degrees of active rear steering, enabling it to rotate in a corner with the fluency of a Cadillac ATS. The brakes seize the moment, stopping hard and quick.</p>, <p>The Lexus LC’s compliant ride allows the powertrains to speak. It can be gentle when it wants to be, and aggressive in corners when you want it to be. It’s fast, smooth, precise. But it’s heavy by sports car standards, edgy by luxury car standards.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report; with NCTD editor Mitch McCullough reporting from New Jersey, and staff reports.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS begins the fifth year of its generation, after being revised for 2017, outside and in, plus tech upgrades. For 2018, CTS gets an available automatic heated steering wheel. Otherwise, it carries over unchanged.</p>, <p>The CTS holds its own, at the least, when compared to German sedans like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6. It blows them out of the water in looks, with its sharp creases and stunning LED lighting. It shares its platform with the smaller Cadillac ATS; the CTS came first, so the ATS is more efficiently packaged. In return, the ATS has shown the CTS how to handle like a smaller car.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder making 268 horsepower; it accelerates from zero to sixty in about six seconds, which is nearly as quick as the bigger engine, a smooth 3.6-liter V6 making 335 horsepower. Whose fuel mileage of 24 miles per gallon Combined city and highway EPA rating is nearly as good as the four-cylinder’s 25 mpg Combined. So the four-cylinder turbo is almost as fast and almost as thirsty as the normally aspirated V6.</p>, <p>The third choice is the CTS V-Sport, with its twin-turbo V6 making 420 horsepower and blasting from zero to sixty in 4.7 seconds. It rates just 18 miles per gallon.</p>, <p>There is one transmission, a paddle-shifting eight-speed automatic. Rear-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive is available.</p>, <p>A separate model is the awesome and other-worldly CTS-V, using the Corvette Z06 engine, a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 making 640 horsepower and 630 concrete-ripping foot pounds of torque. The CTS-V uses a lot of carbon fiber. Zero to sixty is 3.7 seconds. What else do you need to know?</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54730" height="110" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-cts-rear.jpg" width="200"/>CTS ($46,295) comes standard with the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, leatherette (vinyl) upholstery, CUE infotainment with an 8-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, 11-speaker Bose audio, 10-way power front seats, a rearview camera, rear parking assist, and 17-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Rear-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive ($2000) is available for all models. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>CTS Luxury ($51,995) adds leather upholstery, HID headlights, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, and panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>CTS Premium Luxury with V6 engine ($59,495) upgrades with a rearview camera, surround-view cameras, head-up display, 18-inch wheels, parking assist, tri-zone climate control, heated rear seats, and a 12.3-inch gauge cluster.</p>, <p>CTS V-Sport ($60,995) comes with a 420-horsepower turbocharged V6 engine and rear-wheel drive, along with Magnetic Ride Control, Brembo brakes, a limited-slip differential, and 18-inch wheels. Premium ($71,095) upgrades further with 20-way power front seats, reconfigurable gauge cluster, aluminum pedals, adaptive cruise control, and front/rear automatic braking.</p>, <p>CTS-V ($86,000) features a Corvette engine and Nurburgring handling.</p>, <p>The CTS, maybe best if not longest, embodies Cadillac’s iconic design theme called Art and Science. It might just as well be called Angle and Edge, it does those things so well. It isn’t unanimously loved, but who is?</p>, <p>Last year the midsize luxury sedan got a new grille and headlamps that fit into the fenders in a way that visually lowers the nose. At the rear, tall taillamps are stacked on vertical exhaust tips.</p>, <p>There is a Carbon Black appearance package.</p>, <p>Speaking of carbon, the hood and bumpers on the CTS-V are carbon fiber. The fenders are fat, to fit the fat tires.</p>, <p>The CTS cabin is handsome. On the Luxury Premium model, the stitched leather upholstery and real wood trim feel right together. Incongruously, a giant 12.3-inch screen replaces real gauges, making the dashboard look futuristic on this model.</p>, <p>The front seats are exceptionally comfortable; wide, deep and not too soft. Ready for journeys, long hours in the saddle. If you think you’ll need to adjust them 20 ways, and not just 10, that option is available.</p>, <p>The sloping roofline and thick pillars make passengers duck their heads, when climbing into the rear. But there’s comfortable space back and good headroom back there, even with high rear cushions.</p>, <p>The trunk holds 13.7 cubic feet, less than bountiful for a midsize sedan.</p>, <p>Active noise cancellation helps keep the sounds of the engine out of the cabin.</p>, <p>Confidence, poise, and good as the Germans, that’s how the CTS rolls.</p>, <p>The base 2.0 turbo has haste about it. It is possible to make the engine strain, but that’s beating the tar out of it. It’s strong enough that the V6 doesn’t look so great, for the extra cost. The V6 brings 335 horsepower v 268 hp in the turbo four, but 268 is plenty to get you down the freeway with the front-runners.</p>, <p>The V6 might be the choice for long-distance driving, with its longer legs. Its handling and response are progressive and predictable, and it only gets one less mile per gallon.</p>, <p>If that’s not enough, the V-Sport model offers the 420-horsepower twin-turbo V6. Now you know you have an engine under the hood, not an invisible effective powerplant. The v-sport also gets including quicker steering, bigger front brakes, 18-inch wheels with wide Pirelli tires, and of course a track mode.</p>, <p>Cadillac’s eight-speed automatic transmission deserves high praise in any model. In the CTS-V there’s a beefed-up version to handle the massive horsepower. It’s quicker and even smoother than in the other models.</p>, <p>The available Magnetic Ride Control suspension uses dampers filled with magnetically charged fluid; in a matter of milliseconds, the system can stiffen or soften the dampers. GM’s magnetic dampers, used in other models, are correctly hailed for being consistent and effective, forgiving but never soft or floaty.</p>, <p>Last but for sure not least, the CTS-V is the ultimate American hot rod, true blue to its roots, all of them. You can not buy a car like this anywhere else. A beautiful forward-looking Cadillac sedan that handles like it was developed on the Nurburgring which it was, using a Corvette Z06 engine, a 6.2-liter supercharged pushrod V8 pumping out 640 horsepower and 630 pound feet of torque, pushing it from zero to sixty in 3.7 seconds and to a top speed of God only knows.</p>, <p>The CTS is strongest and most special at the bottom and top of its lineup. Great looks, great cabin comfort, perfect eight-speed automatic no matter what, but it’s about the engines. Base 2.0-liter turbo four gives up little to the non-turbo V6. If you must have more, skip to the twin-turbo V6. Top of the line, the strongest and most special: the CTS-V. It’s one of a kind, and a bargain given its performance capabilities.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this review, with staff reports from The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-2-series/
[<p>The thing about the BMW 2 Series is its size. It’s the original size, the correct size, before nimble small cars got big, like about 50 years ago when the truly iconic BMW 2002 ruled the back roads. So that’s what the 2 Series gives you, that the 3 Series doesn’t. More feel, more nimble, more thrill if you care to take it there.</p>, <p>The engines were new for 2017. The BMW 230i gets a beautiful 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo, while the BMW 240i outrageously and wonderfully gets a 3.0-liter six-cylinder turbo.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54724" height="112" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-240i-convertible.jpg" width="200"/>Coupe or Cabriolet, either model.</p>, <p>The 2.0 turbo in the 230i makes 248 horsepower, while the 3.0 turbo in the M240i makes 330 horsepower. Two transmissions are available, an eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual. The xDrive all-wheel drive is available with either engine, mated to the automatic transmission.</p>, <p>There’s also an M2 model that’s pretty extreme in its capabilities, overkill for the street. But if you intend to use it for track days, it’s a winner. It’s still the 3.0 twin-scroll turbo engine, but built with stronger pistons and cylinders, to handle 365 horsepower created by more turbocharger boost pressure. The M2 rockets from zero to sixty in 4.2 seconds with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, or 4.4 seconds with the six-speed manual. Top speed is 155 mph.</p>, <p>One thing BMW does to keep tradition alive and the price low, is offer a base model with fabric seats and few options, to go with the manual transmission. Bare bones, like the original 2002. So, fewer expensive features, but you still get the best of BMW engineering, engine, transmission and handling without having to pay for the luxury you can live without. You’ll have just as much fun with this car.</p>, <p>With rear-wheel drive and the eight-speed automatic, the 230i gets an EPA-rated 24/35 miles per gallon City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined. With all-wheel drive, the M240i xDrive gets 21/31/25 mpg, not bad for 330 horsepower and awd. And the 2 Series aced its IIHS crash tests.</p>, <p>Not much has changed for 2018, different options packages, a couple new colors, some other small things.</p>, <p>The rear-wheel drive 2018 BMW 230i coupe ($33,150) comes with fabric seats with manual adjustment, and no rearview camera. Also available: the 230i Convertible ($38,950).</p>, <p>The high-performance M2 Coupe ( $52,500) comes with the six-speed gearbox, or optional seven-speed dual-clutch with paddle shifters. Standard equipment includes heated seats, navigation, adaptive cruise control, and electronic safety features, but still not a rearview camera. An Executive package adds a heated steering wheel, plus park distance control, automatic high beams, active driving assistant, and that rearview camera. The Drivers Package adds 13 mph to the 155-mph top speed.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54722" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-240i-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The BMW 2 Series, as much as possible, carries the idea of the half-century-old 2002, not unlike the way the Porsche 911 hasn’t totally forgotten the 356 with its bathtub shape. The 230i is modern without being retro. Unlike the 3 Series sedan, whose four doors ride under a long pseudo-coupe, the 2 Series is the right size to fit under a roofline that slopes just right, to the trunk. A lip spoiler helps.</p>, <p>The 2 is clean and taut, with a comfortable greenhouse. It clearly reflects German design thinking.</p>, <p>But it’s actually prettier, definitely classier and more eye-catching, in the convertible. It’s a lovely cloth top that comes in several colors.</p>, <p>The M2 has all the right body clues, without being overstated or in-your-face aggressive. At both ends, between black mesh and big pipes, it looks ready for business.</p>, <p>For a sports coupe, the cabin is spacious in front, with a smaller version of the 3 Series dash panel, and a standard tilt-telescope steering wheel, to give the driver more arm room. There’s something we like about a BMW with cloth upholstery, but it is true that the optional leather is more in keeping with the BMW image.</p>, <p>There is a glove box, two cupholders, and roomy pockets in the doors. There are some hard plastics tucked in low-traffic places.</p>, <p>The rear seat is a long way from being comfortable for everyone, but at least there’s a function that makes climbing in and out easier. It’s particularly useful in the convertibles, whose rear seat is narrower to fit the top and its mechanism.</p>, <p>The convertible’s power top can be dropped or raised at speeds up to 30 mph, in about 20 seconds.</p>, <p>The trunk is 13.8 cubic feet, about average for a compact coupe. It’s not a hatchback (but think of the added versatility if it were). But the rear seat’s ability to split and fold allows room for cargo.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54723" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-240i-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-240i-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-240i-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>In the 2 Series, BMW offers three engines and three transmissions, which can’t be totally mixed and matched, but no matter, it’s all good. As long as you know what you want, because the three engines offer a wide power range, from quick to see-me-on-the-track. Also offered is a choice between rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. Open or closed top. So many choices, all good, as long as you know what you want.</p>, <p>We know what we want, it’s the 230i for its perfect match between the 2.0-liter turbo engine and the car’s size and platform. For its balance; for the engine itself. With direct injection, it makes 248 horsepower and 290 pound-feet of torque. It’s strong and fast all through the powerband, like a moving wall of thrust; and it’s super smooth. It even sounds almost throaty. We don’t need to look any farther. And we’ll take the eight-speed paddle-shifting automatic, since the six-speed manual transmission costs the same, almost unheard-of.</p>, <p>But if you now want to cut one second off the 230i’s zero-to-sixty time, for another $10,000 or so, there is the M240i, with its almost-masterpiece 3.0-liter twin-scroll turbo inline six-cylinder engine making 330 horsepower. Almost all of the torque is available low in the rev range. It’s the perfect engine for the larger 3 Series, but it brings more power than is needed to make the 2 Series an ideal car.</p>, <p>Speaking of more power than needed, we have the M2. If what you want is to get on the track, it’s about right, with 365 horsepower at 6500 rpm and 343 pound-feet of torque between 1400 and 5560 rpm, with overboost to 369 lb-ft.</p>, <p>Back to the real world of the 230i. The electric power steering is extremely precise but a bit numb. The optional limited-slip differential, giving grip to both rear wheels instead of just one, is helpful in cornering and especially in icy conditions; we’d spring for that.</p>, <p>But for real winter, you want the xDrive, even with the convertible. It’s worth it for $2000 and the couple less miles per gallon.</p>, <p>The 2 Series is the BMW to snatch, and the entry-level 230i is the best value. Excepting luxury, it does everything the more expensive models do. The 2.0-liter turbo and eight-speed automatic are flawless, always there for you. Like any coupe this size, the back seat won’t hold adults for very long.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report, with staff reports from The Car Connection.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-highlander/
[<p>The Toyota Highlander is a smooth midsize crossover with a third row for kids, front-wheel drive with all-wheel drive available. It’s bigger than the RAV4 and less rugged than the 4Runner. It can be compared with crossovers such as the Hyundai Santa Fe, Honda Pilot, and Chevrolet Traverse.</p>, <p>Last redesigned for 2014, it got a revision in 2017, including a facelift, more tech, and more power with an eight-speed transmission. It’s unchanged for 2018.</p>, <p>The base Highlander LE uses a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine making 185 horsepower. Mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, it gets 22 combined miles per gallon. The available V6 has more power and gets better fuel mileage.</p>, <p>The 3.5-liter V6 with direct injection makes 295 horsepower. Mated to an eight-speed automatic, it gets 23 combined miles per gallon, helped there by the standard start/stop system. On the highway, it gets 3mpg more than the four-cylinder engine.</p>, <p>There is a sporty Highlander SE, with 19-inch wheels and a firmer suspension.</p>, <p>Also a Highlander Hybrid LE or XLE. It uses an Atkinson-cycle version of the V6 with direct injection. There are two electric motors, one for the front wheels and another for the rears. It makes a combined 306 horsepower and brings 30 City, 28 Highway and 29 Combined miles per gallon. We got seat time in a 2017 Hybrid XLE, all of it relaxed city driving, and it returned considerably less than that. Much the same with our 2016 Highlander Hybrid.</p>, <p>With the forward-collision warning system, the IIHS gives the Highlander its Top Safety Pick+ rating, with top Good ratings in every test. The NHTSA gives it five stars overall, with four stars for frontal crash and rollover.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54715" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-highlander-final.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Toyota Highlander lineup includes SE, LE, LE Plus, XLE, Limited, and Limited Platinum models. The Highlander Hybrid comes as LE, XLE, Limited and Limited Platinum.</p>, <p>Highlander LE includes cloth upholstery, 4.2-inch multi-information display, six-way manually adjustable driver’s seat and four-way passenger seat, 60/40 split-folding and reclining second-row seat, 60/40 split-folding third-row seat, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, five USB ports, LED taillamps, and 18-inch alloy wheels. It also comes with the Toyota’s Entune AM/FM/CD audio system with a 6.1-inch touchscreen, six speakers, an auxiliary input jack, Bluetooth phone connectivity and music streaming, and Siri Eyes Free. Also standard are a rearview camera, hill start assist, and eight airbags, including a driver knee airbag and a front passenger seat cushion airbag.</p>, <p>The sporty SE gets a dark grille, headlamp housings, and roof rails. Inside it gets black leather with silver stitching and patterned inserts.</p>, <p>The fully loaded Limited Platinum gets heated and ventilated front seats, driver’s seat memory, a 12-speaker JBL audio system, a surround-view camera system, heated steering wheel, heated second-row seats, panoramic sunroof, and front park assist. It also gets Toyota’s Safety Connect system, which includes emergency assistance, a stolen vehicle locator, roadside assistance, and automatic collision notification.</p>, <p>Toyota’s upgraded Safety Sense P system is standard, with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, lane departure alert, a pedestrian pre-collision system, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54717" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-highlander-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The grille and headlamps are aggressive although not distinctive. The Highlander looks like other SUVs, bigger than midsize. Its big square lines make it look more like a truck-based SUV than a smooth crossover.</p>, <p>The grille is angular and protruding; it adds 1.3 inches to the Highlander’s already-long length. It’s silver on lower trim models, black on the SE, and platinum on the Limited, with lights that spell Highlander on the ground. Sounds goofy but it’s cool.</p>, <p>The instrument panel has a light touch of truck in it, in the SE model, which goes away as soon as the premium touchscreen comes. Bless those big knobs on the climate control. And big gauges. And no less than five USB ports, and many cubbies, plus an opening storage box on the dash.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54714" height="165" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-highlander-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The cabin is refined and quiet, with acoustic glass and floor insulation. Almost luxurious. The dashboard is flat and rich. The lines and textures mostly mix well, although they can get busy, which makes the cabin feel less calm than it might.</p>, <p>The long wheelbase of 110 inches allows good room inside, but that’s not quite long enough for an adult-sized third row. Most models have a sliding second-row bench that splits 60/40 and seats three, to make eight passengers; but the Limiteds offer captain’s chairs, or seven passengers.</p>, <p>The so-counted three-seat third row is very small, with little headroom or legroom, kids only. However it is possible for two adults to reach the seats and fit into them. But the third row folds flat, so if you don’t need the space for children, there’s 42.3 cubic feet behind the second row; and with that row folded it’s 83.7 behind the front row, enough room for bunk beds.</p>, <p>The front seats are good, but only the Limited model gets power adjustment; it’s an option with the others. Another option is cooled seats, if you don’t mind feeling hardware through the seat.</p>, <p>The optional sunroof takes up headroom, but you can recline the second row and look up at the sky.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54713" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-highlander-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-highlander-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-highlander-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The base engine is 2.7 liters and 185 horsepower with 184 pound-feet of torque. It’s smooth and meaty for a four-cylinder, but it carries too much weight in the Highlander, and the transmission is only a six-speed. Acceleration is reasonable but stressed if pressed. Forget it for towing, rated at a mere 1500 pounds.</p>, <p>The V6 numbers match the best V6 engines in the class, starting with 5000-pound towing. The turbocharged Ford Flex and V8 Dodge Durango are quicker, but that’s not everything.</p>, <p>You can hardly feel the shifts in the eight-speed automatic transmission, although it can be slow to downshift when you accelerate hard.</p>, <p>The Hybrid powers the front wheels mostly with the V6 engine, and the rear wheels solely with the second electric motor. The engine and front motor use a power-split system like Toyota’s other vehicles with Hybrid Synergy Drive. Because this system weighs 350 pounds, the Hybrid is slower, unlike some cars whose hybrid is the quickest.</p>, <p>The handling is pleasant and predictable, with firm electric power steering, but it’s uninspired and vanilla. It’s controlled, but it leans in turns and can be wobbly.</p>, <p>The ride is smooth, not quite cushy, on the standard wheels. The 19-inch wheels allow the jolts to be felt. The soft ride and handling go away in the SE with its firmer suspension.</p>, <p>The Toyota Highlander is smooth and practical. We can only recommend the V6 with eight-speed. We like the Highlander SE for the handling, and the Highlander LE for its value, including good equipment without the stacked-on price.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-honda-odyssey/
[<p>Completely redesigned for 2018, Honda Odyssey is an eight-passenger minivan with class-leading power, space, technology, comfort, handling and fuel efficiency.</p>, <p>The new Odyssey has been thought out extremely well, and can carry a family even better than before, with its standard 60/40 folding third row seat, and many safety features. It was seriously challenged last year by the new Chrysler Pacifica, and has responded by upping its game.</p>, <p>A new 3.5-liter V6 engine makes 280 horsepower, which is 32 hp more than before. So it’s faster, the chassis is stiffer, the steering quicker, cabin quieter, and there are two new automatic transmissions, a nine-speed and ten-speed.</p>, <p>New features include a sliding rear seat with removable middle section and removable outboard seats that slide sideways as well as forward or back. With just the middle seat removed, it’s like captain’s chairs. Four kids with that setup is perfect. Can carry eight when needed. Can carry refrigerator when needed. A canoe will fit on the roof.</p>, <p>There is a new 4G LTE WiFi hotspot that can drive the rear entertainment system, a wireless charging pad for smartphones, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There’s another optional new feature that allows parents to watch their kids like a hawk, in the big screen on the dash, zooming in with infrared vision, so there’s no hiding in the dark, they are doomed.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54705" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-odyssey-final.jpg" width="200"/>Odyssey LX ($29,990) comes with cloth upholstery, power windows, doors and mirrors; a rearview camera, seven-speaker sound system, 18-inch alloy wheels, 8-way power driver seat, 4-way power front passenger seat, keyless ignition, cruise control, tilt/telescoping steering column, Bluetooth, USB port, and automatic climate control. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Odyssey EX ($33,860) features dual power sliding side doors, as well as the Magic Slide second-row seats that slide in four directions. The driver’s seat adjusts 12 ways and front seats are heated. EX also adds three-zone automatic climate control, a display audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability, HD radio, HondaLink apps connectivity, the CabinControl app that lets occupants control the climate system and send songs to the playlist from their smartphones, automatic headlamps, heated door mirrors with turn indicators, foglamps, and remote starting. EX also adds safety features, including blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts and automatic high beams, plus the Honda Sensing package, which includes adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warnings and active lane control, and road departure mitigation.</p>, <p>Odyssey EX-L ($37,360) upgrades to leather upholstery, auto-dimming rearview mirror, garage door opener, sunroof, and power liftgate. Odyssey EX-L with Navi/RES adds navigation with voice recognition, a Blu-Ray rear entertainment system with wireless headphones, 115-volt power outlet, and Honda’s CabinTalk system that allows the driver to talk to all passengers through the speakers or headphones.</p>, <p>Odyssey Touring ($44,510) gets the new 10-speed automatic transmission, stop/start technology, Honda’s CabinWatch feature that points a camera at any seat in the vehicle and lets the driver see the image on the center screen, 4G LTE mobile hotspot capability, an in-vehicle vacuum cleaner, third-row sunshades, a hands-free power tailgate, LED headlights, LED fog lights, and front and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>Odyssey Elite ($46,670) upgrades further with an 11-speaker audio system, wireless phone charging, a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, ambient lighting, gloss black interior trim, rain-sensing wipers, power-folding exterior mirrors, and 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Available safety features include automatic emergency braking and forward-collision warnings, blind-spot monitors, active lane control, and adaptive cruise control. Every model gets two knee airbags in front, as well as a camera for the driver to keep an eye on his or her passengers.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54707" height="111" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-odyssey-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The Odyssey has presence, with its chrome beltline suggesting a bolt of lightning. However, it’s not the prettiest minivan in the parking lot. That would be the Chrysler Pacifica.</p>, <p>The face of the Odyssey shows a family resemblance to the Pilot crossover and Civic sedan. Behind the big chrome grille there are shutters to improve the aerodynamics and increase fuel mileage a bit; at the edges of the grille there are LED running lamps. LED headlamps and foglamps come on the Touring model.</p>, <p>The redesign to styling features a deep swoop carved into the front and side doors. The channels for the sliding rear doors are relocated under the third-row glass, to better conceal them.</p>, <p>A chrome-bar design in the rear matches that in the front, and is framed by LED taillamps.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54704" height="154" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-odyssey-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The new Odyssey brings softer materials into the cabin, including a new stain-resistant leather on EX-L and above. The center console is massive, functional if not pretty, with two main storage areas, one of them deep and the other wide and flat. There’s a digital instrument display and clear touchscreen on the dash.</p>, <p>The new optional CabinWatch appears on the screen, a running video feed of the rear seats, so parents can literally keep an eye on them. Mom and Dad become Big Brother. And get this: it’s infrared, and can zoom in, so Dad can play sniper.</p>, <p>But wait, there’s more. CabinWatch combines with CabinTalk, which plays the driver’s voice over the sound system. The kids haven’t a chance. Sitting quietly back there in the dark, scarcely thinking about being naughty, when suddenly in their headphones: “Stop that! Right now! I see you!”</p>, <p>The rear seat entertainment system is upgraded. The 10-inch screens have 4G LTE, with apps like PBS Kids, iHeart Radio, Spotify, and more. There’s even an app called “How Much Farther,” that maps the van’s path to the destination.</p>, <p>Another app allows passengers to use their smartphones to control their entertainment screens and climate control, and send music to the sound system and destinations to the navigation system.</p>, <p>Honda’s Magic Slide seating system was re-engineered for the new Odyssey. The second row is composed of three sculpted and roomy seats that can be moved separately. The middle seat can be removed to create captain’s chairs, and a path to the third row. The two outboard seats slide up, back, left, right; or they could be pushed together. And they can be moved with a child seat remaining attached.</p>, <p>But what if you sometimes need a flat floor and cargo space? You remove the second-row seats that weigh 70 pounds each, and store them in your garage, or somewhere.</p>, <p>Not quite like the Chrysler Pacifica’s Stow ‘N Go system, whose rear seats fold flat into the floor.</p>, <p>If you do get those seats out of there, the Odyssey has the most cargo space in the class, 144.9 cubic feet. Better than that, it has mucho cargo space behind the second row, 86.6 cubic feet. That’s with the third row folded flat, which it easily does with a tug on a strap and a flop.</p>, <p>Behind the third row there’s still 32.8 cubic feet, which is twice the size of a trunk of a full-sized sedan. And the third row can actually fit an adult.</p>, <p>With its many configurations, you can custom tune your family minivan to be what you need for each trip, project or adventure.</p>, <p>The new Odyssey has been silenced, by acoustic foam sprayed into 14 spots were noise might leak through, then a barrier carpet, thicker glass all around, triple door seals, and noise cancellation under the hood.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54706" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-odyssey-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-odyssey-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2018-odyssey-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Quick and controlled, Odyssey is the best-driving minivan. The changes for 2018 hammer it home.</p>, <p>Torsional stiffness of the chassis has been increased by 44 percent. It sounds esoteric but its intuitive. Do you want your chassis to twist, or not twist, when you’re going around a corner? Now it twists 44 percent less.</p>, <p>The platform design takes from the Honda Pilot and Acura MDX, and comes away losing 75 pounds. The electric power steering is quicker, which it can be thanks to the stiffer chassis. The rear suspension adds a stabilizer bar, to keep up with the steering and chassis improvements.</p>, <p>The Odyssey handles with control and confidence. The suspension is more stable than a minivan has a right to be. The Odyssey sometimes feels like a crossover, not a minivan. The ride is smooth, although not as smooth as the Pacifica.</p>, <p>The new 3.5-liter V-6 makes 280 horsepower. Honda brags that its zero-to-sixty time is one second faster than any other minivan. Maybe it is quicker than the Pacifica, but Honda’s nine-speed automatic is nowhere near as good as the 10-speed automatic that shifts smoothly and responsively, and uses all 10 gears seamlessly. Unfortunately, only the Touring and Elite models get the 10-speed.</p>, <p>The Honda Odyssey leads the minivan class. If you don’t spend the big bucks for the Touring or Elite models, you’ll miss the sharp transmission, but you’ll still have the oomph, out of the new V6. CabinWatch might be fun if you have kids.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>Redesigned for 2018, Volkswagen Tiguan is a bit larger for its second generation. The all-new 2018 Tiguan is a tall compact crossover that stretches toward midsize in interior space, and is well equipped for its price.</p>, <p>Volkswagen Tiguan competitors include Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4, each of which can beat the Tiguan at one thing or another (maybe handling, fuel mileage, popularity), but overall the Tiguan does it all well.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54682" height="119" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-final.jpg" width="200"/>It comes as front-wheel drive with a small third row, or all-wheel-drive with an optional third row that’s even smaller.</p>, <p>Cargo space is improved over the previous model, and ride quality remains outstanding.</p>, <p>The new styling is a change for Volkswagen. It’s sharp, chiseled and intimidating. Volkswagen is now copying instead of leading, as if they’ve decided that the world doesn’t want soft edges any more. Tiguan has struggled to establish an identity, so maybe the new styling is intended to address that.</p>, <p>Its third row is small like the Nissan Rogue, so it’s not known for that convenience. The Tiguan does come with an excellent warranty, six years or 72,000 miles, that is transferable. Maybe the Tiguan will become known for that. It worked for Chrysler, many years ago, when they came out with the 5/50, totally unheard-of at the time.</p>, <p>All models of Tiguan are powered by a new 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. Volkswagen has a long superlative history with its 2.0 turbo engine, it’s been around and flawless for 25 years. This new one actually makes less horsepower than the previous, only 184 hp as opposed to 200. But it makes more torque, from 207 pound-feet to 221 lb-ft. That means the acceleration around town will be stronger, but out on the freeway at 70 mph it will be working harder.</p>, <p>Mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, Tiguan returns an EPA-rated 24 Combined miles per gallon city and highway. That doesn’t sound like much to us, for a so-called compact with a four-cylinder engine, especially in 2018. We drove the Tiguan in Colorado, not gently, and got 23.7 mpg, so at least those numbers will hold up and probably then some.</p>, <p>The Tiguan isn’t light, at about 3800 pounds. And that mileage is about average for a compact crossover. Honda uses a smaller 1.5-liter turbo in the CR-V to get 30 mpg, and you have to go to a hybrid like in the Toyota RAV4 to get 32 mpg.</p>, <p>2018 Volkswagen Tiguan models are the S, SE, SEL and SEL Premium. Front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive are available. All models come with a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and eight-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Tiguan S ($25,345) has rugged fabric upholstery, six-speaker audio, rearview camera, USB port, Bluetooth, 6.5-inch touchscreen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come standard on all models along with VW’s telematics services. Tiguan SE adds leatherette seats, 8.0-inch touchscreen, power-adjustable driver’s seat, keyless ignition, dual-zone climate control, three USB ports, and option like the panoramic roof.</p>, <p>Tiguan SEL adds remote start, power liftgate, adaptive cruise control, and navigation. Tiguan SEL Premium upgrades with leather seats, Fender audio, advanced safety features, hands-free liftgate.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54686" height="154" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Even though the new Tiguan is extremely angular and the nose is intimidating, a character line running back from the front fender is the only modern touch.</p>, <p>The front (grille, bumpers, fascia) is the same as the full-sized VW Atlas crossover, the only difference being small creases in the hood.</p>, <p>Unlike the Atlas, the Tiguan doesn’t have blocky wheel arches to pose as a tough guy in profile. The window line is low and the rear doors wide. Most crossovers today have a high window line, so the Tiguan clings to some separation here.</p>, <p>Designers got the rear end right. More glass in the liftgate avoids the wedgy look most crossovers have.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54685" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Tiguan cabin is simple, clean and functional, presented in subdued hues. Comfort in both rows is near the top of the class, firm and supportive, although the padding in the front seats is thin.</p>, <p>The rear seats have exceptional legroom when the sliding rear seat is back. The Tiguan may be larger than before, but three adults in the rear seat will still be a squeeze.</p>, <p>An 8.0-inch center touchscreen dominates attention in SE models and higher. SEL Premium models swap out the center gauges for a 12.3-inch driver information display that’s sharp.</p>, <p>Tiguan S comes with a six-speaker stereo, good for listening to the news. SEL Premium models have a wonderful Fender audio system.</p>, <p>There’s nothing wrong with the durable fabric upholstery in the Tiguan S, but the Tiguan SE adds a synthetic leather that could pass for real, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen that draws attention away from some hard black plastic.</p>, <p>The third row, standard with fwd models and available with awd, isn’t suitable for adults.</p>, <p>The rear liftgate is wide, making loading easier, into a cargo space of 37.6 cubic feet with the rear seats down. That’s a couple of cubic feet less than the Honda CR-V.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54683" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-tiguan-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Turbo or not, the power-to-weight ratio of the Tiguan is not high, and the eight-speed automatic transmission can’t help it feel faster. The power is smooth at lower revs when accelerating, as torque is strong as early as 1600 rpm. The Tiguan takes off like a rocket, but at higher revs it runs out of breath.</p>, <p>The eight-speed automatic is tentative about downshifting for acceleration, and in fact seems a bit dull about most needs. The upshifts are crisp, although it’s programmed to short shift a lot (meaning it upshifts early at low revs), to gain fuel mileage.</p>, <p>The ride is easy and the handling competent. It feels softer than before. So does the steering, which is light, and doesn’t seem to get tighter or quicker in Sport mode.</p>, <p>The Volkswagen Tiguan offers convenience in a compact crossover with nice ride and handling. We like the entry-level Tiguan S, though the sound system is lackluster. The fabric upholstery is just fine, and the instrumentation is clean and adequate. But we’re still disappointed in the fuel mileage.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-audi-a5/
[<p>Redesigned, the 2018 Audi A5 and S5 models get new platforms, engines, styling, technology, and safety features. And there is a new model, a sexy Sportback that’s been available in Europe for some time. Actually, make that two models, because the Sportback comes as a high-performance S5 as well.</p>, <p>That makes three body styles available: two-door Coupe, four-door Sportback hatch, and sporty two-door Cabriolet convertible. Each comes in A5 and S5 tune.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54672" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-coupe.jpg" width="200"/>The A5 improves on all levels, especially power, handling, and looks. It’s the best A5 ever, as any redesigned model should be. It presents a comfortable ride, balanced handling, and a strong engine having a subdued note.</p>, <p>The A5 is built on platforms and running gear of the A4 sedan and Q5 crossover. Every A5 has the bombproof and totally refined Quattro all-wheel drive, with the coupe getting Quattro Ultra that improves fuel mileage by cutting drive to the rear wheels.</p>, <p>The A5 uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo making 252 horsepower teamed with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, or a six-speed manual in coupes. It hits zero to sixty in 5.7 seconds and gets an EPA Combined 27 miles per gallon. Every A5 has a Drive Select system with modes to relax the dynamics or sharpen the edge.</p>, <p>The S5 with its 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 accelerates from zero to 60 in 4.4 seconds, and gets 24 miles per gallon Combined. It uses an eight-speed twin-clutch transmission.</p>, <p>The redesigned platform has moved the engine farther back in the chassis to improve the balance, and lost some weight to improve the handling. It’s sportier than before, although the true sports sedan and hatch is the S5. Or take the big leap to the track-ready RS 5.</p>, <p>For 2018 Audi A5 adds safety technology, with forward collision warnings, automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alerts, and active lane control.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54671" height="127" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-cabrio.jpg" width="200"/>Audi A5 comes as a coupe, convertible and the new Sportback. Standard equipment includes leather seats, automatic climate control, MMI infotainment system, and ambient interior lighting. Options include navigation, a Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system, Audi’s high-tech virtual cockpit digital instrument cluster, adaptive dampers, and 4G LTE data services with WiFi hotspot.</p>, <p>The S5 comes in the same models, in Premium Plus and Prestige trim. Premium Plus includes S sport seats with a diamond-quilted pattern, front seat massagers, automatic climate control, Bluetooth connectivity, 18-inch wheels with summer 245/40 summer tires, LED headlights, leather seating with Alcantara inserts on the doors, a 7.0-inch driver information screen, and 7.0-inch infotainment screen.</p>, <p>Eight airbags are standard, along with a rearview camera and parking sensors. Also standard is Audi’s active safety suite called Pre sense city, which can slow or stop the car if a head-on crash is imminent.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54674" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-s5-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The A5 coupe styling is elegant, understated and sleek, with muscular haunches. It sets the styling benchmark for coupes. The 2018 redesign doesn’t change its looks much at all, maybe just sharpens the edges.</p>, <p>The devastating lines of the new Sportback flow like those of the gorgeous A7. Its wheelbase is a bit longer than the coupe or convertible. The roof is low like the coupe’s, but stretched into a hatchback, sleeker than the BMW 3 Series GT. The Sportback skips the chrome frame around the windows, a plus in our book.</p>, <p>The S5 fastback sedan has been restyled and sharpened from nose to tail, on the same measurements. The nose is lower and the headlamps higher, creating a look like a furrowed brow. The hood gets more demonstrative creases. The character line along the side of the car gets some starch. In direct light, it casts a shadow that makes the body look longer.</p>, <p>The classy A5 cabin has horizontal lines and uses low-gloss black plastics with the wood or metal trim. Paddle-shifters for the transmission are standard, but they’re small and disappointingly made of plastic. One competitor for the S5 Sportback might be the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio, which has big beautiful metal paddles.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54676" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The tech features are added in a cohesive manner, not confusing or futuristic. The rotary dial for MMI interface with center screen is something Audi owners are used to, blessed buttons instead of a touchscreen. The MMI is fairly easy to use, but connecting an iPhone is more difficult without a touchscreen.</p>, <p>There’s an optional 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster Audi calls a virtual cockpit. It gives the cabin a look of state of the art.</p>, <p>In the S5 coupe, one of our tall testers couldn’t get his head low enough for comfortable visibility, given the tall driver’s seat and low roof; rearward visibility was worse, with the thick C-pillars creating big blind spots. Blind-spot monitors are optional but would be useful in all models.</p>, <p>We haven’t had a chance for seat time in the A5 sedan, but in the coupe at least, the rear passengers will be squeezed with only 32.7 inches of legroom.</p>, <p>The coupe has an adequate 11.6 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk, less in the convertible of course because of mechanism: 9.3 cubic feet with the roof down. If it’s cargo space you need, the Sportback brings you 17 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54673" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine is new, making 252 horsepower which is 30 more than before. It’s mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic manual transmission that’s the best in the business, with shifts that are smooth and quick. With the coupe, a six-speed manual is available.</p>, <p>The engine has sharp throttle response, being absent of turbo lag or drama, and accelerates from zero to sixty in a satisfying 5.7 seconds.</p>, <p>The A5’s Drive Select offers Comfort, Normal, Dynamic, and Individual (custom) modes for the for the steering, suspension, transmission, and throttle. In the appropriate mode, the steering is sharp and direct, and the handling is balanced. The ride is comfortable and composed. It’s sporty and fun to drive, although its mission is meant to be more sedate than that; the adrenaline is saved for the S5, which adds torque vectoring to help the car rotate in turns.</p>, <p>The turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 in the S5 makes a whumping 354 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque, to drive the car to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. It’s a twin-scroll turbo designed to reduce lag and deliver a broad torque band. The torque comes on strong at 1350 stays there to 4500 rpm. It’s a fantastic passing machine on two-lanes.</p>, <p>The eight-speed automatic is quick and tight, and the Quattro all-wheel drive splits the torque 60/40 rear/front. New in 2018 is an available rear differential that moves the torque from side to side, as needed in cornering.</p>, <p>Some of the weight loss in the 2018 comes from the use of aluminum components in the five-link rear suspension.</p>, <p>A sport package lowers the car by nearly one inch. It includes adjustable dampers, the new rear differential, and red brake calibers. It can be set from Comfort to Dynamic, with an Auto mode making it easy for the driver. Even in Dynamic mode, the S5 doesn’t feel harsh or high-strung.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54677" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-final.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-final.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-a5-final-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2018 A5 succeeds as redesigns are supposed to, with better looks, more power, and sharper handling. The new Sportback model is a very welcome addition; it brings the line alive. The S5, with its powerful twin-scroll V6 turbo, succeeds as a grand touring machine all the way.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-lexus-rc/
[<p>The Lexus RC is a rear- or all-wheel-drive luxury sport coupe whose competitors include the Audi A5, Cadillac ATS coupe, and some BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class models.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus RC is unchanged over 2017, except the former RC 200t, with the four-cylinder turbo engine, gets its name changed to RC 300. That’s with rear-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive RC 300 is, as before, powered by the V6. Only the names have changed here.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54662" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-f.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-f.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-f-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The RC is the right size for swift runs on back roads. It’s nearly three inches shorter than the IS, the smallest Lexus sedan, but more than one inch wider.</p>, <p>The RC comes with a choice of four engines. The rear-wheel-drive RC 300 with its 241-horsepower turbo four and its modest acceleration of zero to sixty in 7.3 seconds, gets the best fuel mileage, an EPA Combined 26 mpg rating.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive RC 300 cuts that acceleration time to less than 6.3 seconds by using a 3.5-liter V6, which gains 5 horsepower over the 2017 RC 300, for 260 horsepower.</p>, <p>The RC 350 takes that V6 and pumps it up to 311 horsepower, five more than 2017, for a zero-to-sixty time of 5.8 seconds.</p>, <p>The RC F goes after the BMW M4 and Audi S4, with its 5.0-liter V8 bulging with 467 horsepower, and blasting the RC F to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds and beyond, to 170 mph. It still earns 19 miles per gallon Combined.</p>, <p>The 2017 RC earned a Top Safety Pick Plus rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54665" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-2.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 RC 300 comes standard with rear-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. Equipment includes leatherette upholstery, automatic climate control, LED headlamps and taillights, satellite radio, and Bluetooth audio streaming. A Luxury Package includes perforated leather seats and other interior features. Navigation and 17-speaker Mark Levinson audio are optional.</p>, <p>RC 300 is also available with a V6 and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>RC 350 increases the horsepower and comes with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>RC F features the 467-hp 5.0-liter V8 with rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54663" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The RC coupe is sure graceful. In the beauty department, it blows the Germans away. It takes the best from other Lexus models, including some that overall are less exciting; some GS in the nose, some IS C in the profile, and IS in the tail. Or maybe it’s the other way around, those other models take from the RC. If your imagination wanders you might even see some Scion FR-S, but we didn’t say that.</p>, <p>The body surfaces are curvy and subtle. The roofline is handsomely thick, leading down to a sweet kick where the shoulders meet the rear fenders.</p>, <p>The spindle grille looks a bit sinister, which is only appropriate given the car’s intents. The RC F gets rid of the chrome and brings black mesh, to cheers from the crowd on the sidewalk. The F flaunts aggression, with finned vents, stacked exhausts, and a wing that raises at 50 mph, or 80 mph when the car is in Track mode.</p>, <p>The cabin is somewhat less graceful than the exterior. It’s put together well, and the finishes are lovely, but it flaunts chaos the way the RC F flaunts speed. The horizontally divided dashboard sports off-center controls and strangely stacked components. The top half is gauges and 7.0-inch nav screen with touchpad below. The centerstack rides lumpy on the curved console. We don’t get the offset of the LCD and sound system, but we do like the elliptical steering wheel, and the padded center console.</p>, <p>The supple leather seats are low and wide, and use high-density foam for excellent contour up the high backs. The leather is conspicuously and beautifully stitched.</p>, <p>Don’t count on a rear seat. It’s basically just a bench, which folds to access the trunk (not the RC F), which is small, at 10.4 cubic feet, about the size of two golf bags.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54664" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rc-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine in the rear-wheel-drive RC 300 suffers from turbo lag, so the power sometimes isn’t instantaneous when you want it to be. When you get there it’s strong enough, with 241 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. So when you’re driving hard and keeping the revs up, it’s not a problem; just when you’re cruising and suddenly floor it, like passing on a two-lane. But in that situation you’d probably be in Sport mode, which brings the transmission in to help by kicking down quicker.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive RC 300 has a 30/70 rear bias, mated to an older six-speed automatic transmission. Its 3.5-liter V6 makes a mild 260 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque, focused on all-weather grip, not sport.</p>, <p>Sport is more what the RC 350 is about, with its 311 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. It’s standard rear-wheel drive, but all-wheel drive is available if you want traction and horsepower both. Rear-wheel drive can reach a top speed of 143 mph while all-wheel drive will go 130. That’s electronically limited; the acceleration is pretty much the same, although the all-wheel drive is naturally heavier.</p>, <p>But it’s not as simple as traction and horsepower both, with the RC 350 and its available all-wheel drive. Because it’s fitted with high-performance tires, it won’t get the same traction as the RC 300 with all-wheel drive. However it does improve stability on slippery roads, while still allowing some wheelspin.</p>, <p>The 3.5-liter V6 in the RC 350 makes a nice growl, a bit coarse, not unlike some Nissan, Ford, and Mercedes V6 engines.</p>, <p>The paddle-shifting eight-speed transmission has normal, sport, and manual modes, and blips the throttle for downshifts. There are also normal, sport, and eco driving modes, that set the throttle response and steering quickness.</p>, <p>Like the Lexus IS and GS sedans, the RC rides on a traditional double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension tuned on the firm side, but still compliant enough to be comfortable when the driving is relaxed. The electric power steering is settled and quick in sport mode. The suspension/steering isn’t as aggressive as some, however offers the right balance between ride and handling for its class.</p>, <p>An option for the rear-wheel drive RC 350 is variable-ratio steering and rear-wheel steering in Sport+ mode. That quickens the car’s response and stability in a situation like a high-speed swerve. The place you might really feel it is if you make the mistake of moving into the lane of a car in your blind spot, and jerk the steering wheel back in alarm.</p>, <p>If you want to go after the BMW M4 and Audi S4 on the track, the RC F is your weapon. It’s not light, at 3958 pounds, but we can report that it’s happy and composed on the track, although it doesn’t make the earth shudder like a Cadillac ATS-V does.</p>, <p>The eight-speed transmission with paddle shifters is programmed well, with Eco, Normal, Sport and Sport+ modes, as well as a manual mode that holds it in gears longer and quickens the shifts. Even at redline it won’t upshift; of course it won’t over-rev either, with the engine protected by an electronic rev limiter.</p>, <p>The RC F comes standard with a Torsen limited-slip differential, Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, and stability control with a track mode that shuts it off. An optional torque-vectoring differential splits the torque between the rear wheels in corners, based on yaw and steering input. This helps the car pivot in corners, and brings a bit of nimbleness to the weight. It has three modes of its own: Standard, Slalom or Track.</p>, <p>The torque-vectoring differential adds 70 pounds of its own, however, and the standard Torsen differential does a good job, its limited slip setup keeping solid control over the rear end.</p>, <p>The RC F suspension is double-wishbone suspension at all four corners, using adaptive dampers and stabilizer bars with ball joints. The bars, bushings and lower control arms are beefier than those on the RC 350, and the F also uses 19-inch wheels with Brembo calipers and rotors, 15 inches in front and 13.6 inches in rear.</p>, <p>The Lexus RC works for us. It’s good looking, the ride is compliant and it handles well. We think the best value might be the detuned V6 with all-wheel drive. The cabin feels a bit archaic and disorganized, but look around inside and decide for yourself before you take our word for it. The hot-rod RC F might not run with the BMW M4, Audi S4 or Mercedes C63 AMG on the track, but this isn’t a race. Beauty counts.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-volkswagen-golf/
[<p>The Volkswagen Golf, redesigned for 2015, offers multiple personalities, whether the traditional hatch in two-door or four-door versions, the sporty GTI, the Golf R, the electric e-Golf, the all-wheel-drive Golf SportWagen, and the Golf Alltrack wagon. There’s also a four-door sedan, but that’s called a Jetta.</p>, <p>Much of what makes the Golf so good is the sweetest powertrain of its kind in the business. Its 1.8-liter turbocharged and direct-injected four-cylinder makes 170 horsepower and 199 pound-feet of torque, mated to a seamless six-speed automatic. (The base S model comes with a five-speed manual, and its engine makes less torque.) The Alltrack and all-wheel-drive SportWagen take either a six-speed manual or six-speed dual-clutch automatic.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54658" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-alltrack.jpg" width="200"/>Most of the changes for 2018 are in the packaging, the mixing of available equipment for each model, and it can be hard to follow. One thing you can see is new LED taillamps, and new infotainment available; one thing you can feel is 10 more horsepower in the front-wheel-drive GTI. Last year that 10 hp was available as an option called the Performance Package, but for 2018 GTI is already packaged with that performance. It comes with a six-speed manual or dual-clutch automatic manual that’s precise and crisp, the best in the business. VW invented the dual clutch, years ago, and hasn’t lost the lead. They call it the DSG, for direct shift gearbox. Mechanically and internally, it’s a manual transmission; but to the driver it’s a super-sharp automatic.</p>, <p>Then there is the one and only Golf R, using the beefy Haldex all-wheel drive system to plant on the pavement a heady 292 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque. Standard transmission is a six-speed manual, but for 2018 a new seven-speed dual-clutch is available. The Golf R is rival to the Ford Focus RS and Subaru WRX STI.</p>, <p>The Golf S gets an EPA estimate of 25/36 City/Highway, or 29 Combined miles per gallon. Wagons with the six-speed dual-clutch automatic get the same 29 mpg. The GTI gets just a bit less, while the Golf R with its horsepower drops down to 22/31 mpg.</p>, <p>Last year the Golf was named a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, when equipped with advanced safety features.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54654" height="130" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-line.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-line.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-line-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Golf hatchback comes as S, SE, and SEL; the GTI as S, SE, and Autobahn; and then there’s the Golf R, the SportWagen and Alltrack.</p>, <p>Standard equipment on the Golf S includes power windows and locks, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, power-reclining front seats, a 6.5-inch infotainment screen, and 16-inch steel wheels. Golf SE adds an 8.0-inch screen, leatherette upholstery, and 16-inch alloy wheels. Golf SEL adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, and ambient cabin lighting.</p>, <p>Golf SportWagen comes with VW’s 4Motion all-wheel drive available in a package including 16-inch alloy wheels and heated seats. Golf Alltrack adds leatherette upholstery, and on the full-tile Alltrack SEL there’s a Fender sound system and 18-inch alloy wheels, along with the extra half-inch of ground clearance.</p>, <p>Golf GTI S is equipped like the regular Golf. The GTI SE adds LED headlamps, 8.0-inch infotainment screen, a blind spot monitor, and automatic emergency braking. The GTI Autobahn has leather, moonroof, and active dampers.</p>, <p>The Golf R has Volkswagen’s Digital Cockpit, a high-resolution LCD screen that replaces conventional gauges. It’s a system that came from Audi where it’s been praised. Like the GTI, the adaptive suspension with active dampers is optional.</p>, <p>Available safety features include automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, park distance control, and automatic headlamps.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54653" height="125" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Volkswagen is stubborn in its clinging to pure rather than trendy styling, and bless their hearts for it. The Golf is clean, especially the SportWagen, and it’s a great relief. It’s not edgy, it’s smooth. No attitude. It mirrors the engineering.</p>, <p>That said, the GTI does bring some sport and maybe attitude. Its stance is lower, on the sport suspension, while the red brake calipers show between the spokes of the 17-inch alloy wheels. There are side skirts and a rear diffuser, as well. And you can’t have a diffuser without showing your attitude.</p>, <p>The Alltrack has some exterior elements that the cleaner SportWagen doesn’t have: cladding on its lower sides, foglamps, a honeycomb grille, and its own bumpers.</p>, <p>The cabin is as clean as the body, functional and spacious. The materials are not expensive but don’t feel cheap. The instrumentation is intuitive and easy to read and operate. The driver doesn’t have to work to understand his car, unlike so many German cars. The centerstack is oriented toward the driver, and the gauges are hooded so there’s no glare. Some thinking has clearly gone into the design.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54655" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-final.jpg" width="200"/>The GTI and Golf R have a sport steering wheel and shift knob, stainless steel pedals, and an instrument panel with no-nonsense gauges. The sport seats are a plaid fabric, with a black headliner and red ambient lighting.</p>, <p>We got great seat time during one week in a 4Motion SportWagen, a long road trip, and we found the cabin to totally easy, comfortable, relaxing, and very quiet. The powertrain and suspension had much to do with that, of course.</p>, <p>The front seats are the best, perfectly supportive and easy to adjust for all body sizes. The leatherette feels a bit rubbery, while the less expensive but rugged plaid upholstery feels just fine.</p>, <p>There three touchscreens: base 5.0 inch, upper trim 6.5 inch, and top option 8.0 inch. This big screen gets its own new infotainment system.</p>, <p>It might be a bit tight in the back seat for three passengers, but it’s easy to climb in and out. In the hatchback, there are 22.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat, that’s quite a lot. The seatbacks lower with a quick pull release, to open things up for 52.7 cubic feet. Bring in the SportWagen, and you have 30.4 cubic feet behind the rear seat, and 66.5 with it folded, although unfortunately it doesn’t fold completely flat.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54657" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>We put more than 700 miles on a 4Motion SportWagen in one week, and didn’t want to leave it. We averaged 30 mpg, most of it on a 70-mph interstate, and the 1.8-liter turbo and paddle-shifting six-speed DSG transmission were flawlessly smooth. They achieved that kind of perfection you want in a car like this: you didn’t know they were there, but they always were there for whatever you needed or wanted. Seamless acceleration with no turbo lag. We can’t remember the last time we drove a four-cylinder that was this smooth and effortless at 75 mph.</p>, <p>The ride, the clear and intuitive instrumentation, there’s nothing we would even nitpick. The SportWagen was an S model with no options, and there was nothing we missed. The infotainment, with satellite radio, was just fine. It lacked navigation, but we had our cellphone with mobile apps.</p>, <p>With any Golf, the handling and drivability match the merits of the powertrain. Maybe the S hatchback won’t corner like a Mazda3, but the GTI will, and the R goes beyond that.</p>, <p>We also got seat time in a Golf with the five-speed manual transmission, whose throws of the lever are rather long. The six-speed manual is stronger than the five-speed, and that sixth gear has a taller ratio, so the revs at freeway speed are lower and the car quieter. But still, the six-speed DSG automatic is so good that it’s our choice.</p>, <p>The sporty GTI is perfectly drivable to the grocery store, even with its firmer suspension and quicker steering. So it’s more fun and satisfying out in the twisties, if you like to play. And again you get those crisp DSG shifts with paddles.</p>, <p>Golf R is for serious players, with its 292 horsepower as opposed to the GTI’s 220 hp, and its aggressive suspension tuning. There are four driving modes (Comfort, Normal, Race, and Individual) that adjust the throttle, transmission and steering response, and the firmness of the ride. The Individual mode allows separate setting of these things. Most people don’t and can’t get that specific, and even if they did, things change with each section of the road. So it seems like Individual mode would really only make sense on the track, and changed with each track.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54658" height="140" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-golf-alltrack.jpg" width="200"/>Smooth and refined, all the Golf models are more than contenders in their respective classes. The 30-mpg 4Motion SportWagen with the DSG offers a lot of value: Smooth ride and silent, clean cabin. It offers everything the Alltrack does except big wheels and cladding. The Golf R comes out favorably in many areas when compared to the Ford Focus RS and Subaru WRX STI. For years the STI was the star of the pocket-rocket class, now the Focus RS is, but the Golf R deserves more attention.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-toyota-c-hr/
[<p>A totally new vehicle, the 2018 Toyota C-HR stands apart from other small crossover utilities with trendy looks and a high-riding stance.</p>, <p>C-HR stands for Coupe, High Riding. Conceived for Toyota’s youth-oriented Scion brand, which disappeared during 2016, it looks smaller than its dimensions suggest. Indisputably, the C-HR is one of the most audacious new models in recent memory, especially startling because it comes from a manufacturer long known for conservative products.</p>, <p>Although all-wheel drive is unavailable, Toyota calls the C-HR a crossover. We see it more as a small five-door hatchback that’s taller than most. That translates to a higher seating position.</p>, <p>Visually intricate yet enticing, the C-HR’s exterior is its most notable feature by far. Inside, the C-HR looks interesting enough, but mainly functional. Performance, in contrast, is sluggish.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54643" height="123" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-chr-final.jpg" width="200"/>Only two trim levels are offered: XLE and XLE Premium.</p>, <p>In each C-HR, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 144 horsepower and 139 pound-feet of torque, coupled to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Front-wheel drive is the sole configuration.</p>, <p>Three drive modes are available: normal, fuel-efficient Eco, and Sport. The latter re-programs the CVT to provide seven simulated gear ratios. Steering gets a tad firmer, too.</p>, <p>Manufactured in Turkey, the C-HR competes against the joyful Mazda CX-3, fuel-efficient Honda HR-V, and comparably conspicuous Nissan Juke. All-wheel drive is available on those models.</p>, <p>Ten airbags and a rearview camera are standard along with the Toyota Safety Sense-P group of active-safety features. They include forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert with steering assist, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>A lockout for the touchscreen blocks functions that cannot be used unless the vehicle is stationary. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are standard with XLE Premium trim.</p>, <p>Visibility to the rear side is constricted. Back-seat headrests don’t block much of the view through the sharply-angled rear window, but it’s limited nonetheless. Thick pillars don’t help.</p>, <p>Toyota C-HR XLE ($22,500) has fabric seat upholstery, power windows/locks, 18-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, 7.0-inch touchscreen audio, leather-wrapped steering wheel, cargo cover, and rearview camera. Power mirrors contain turn-signal indicators. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>C-HR XLE Premium ($24,350) adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, pushbutton start, foglamps, and puddle lights.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54644" height="118" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-chr-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Considerably bigger than it appears, the C-HR is dominated by a collection of expressive body lines, joined by swooping curves, slits, and accents. Working together, complemented by a high stance, they form an extroverted design that’s far more noticeable than most smaller crossovers and hatchbacks. Not everyone will applaud the design, but it is distinctive. Toyota isn’t known for risky design, but over the years, distinctive designs that excite some and offend others are often more successful than bland designs that no one notices.</p>, <p>Viewed from the side, the overall effect has even been described as skeletal. Rear door handles are concealed within the pillars, which turn upward at the tall back end. A rising window line, below the sloping roof, emulates the look of a two-door coupe.</p>, <p>What might be termed cat-eye headlights flow into front fenders, wrapping snugly into each wheel well. Standard 18-inch wheels actually look a bit small. Dubbed R-Code, the white-roof option is offered only for certain body colors.</p>, <p>Compared to other small crossovers and hatchbacks, the C-HR’s cabin scores highly. Quite spacious inside, front and back, Toyota’s C-HR is wider than might be expected.</p>, <p>Suggesting its appeal to youthful buyers, Toyota calls the central control pod the MeZone. Controls for the 7.0-inch touchscreen blend with stylish-looking knobs and switches. Qualifying as a design theme, diamond shapes turn up in various locations, including the headliner fabric. Diamond patterns are even molded into the plastic lower door panels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54646" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-chr-interior.jpg" width="200"/>One feature that’s absent is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.</p>, <p>Occupants get ample headroom all around, due partly to the C-HR’s high-riding stance. Six-footers shouldn’t have a problem with head clearance. Sitting rather high, rear riders can expect abundant foot space, a wide bench, and comfortably upright position. Unlike many smaller crossovers and hatchbacks, three adults can actually fit on the back seat without undue discomfort.</p>, <p>Though well-bolstered and comfortable, front seats are lower than expected in a relatively tall compact vehicle. A long-legged driver might consider the front cushions a bit short.</p>, <p>Storage bins and trays are plentiful, but cargo space doesn’t match the passenger roominess. Split back seats fold to form a flat load floor, but it’s curiously high, impeding easy loading. Cargo volume is a so-so 19 cubic feet with the rear seatback upright, growing to a modest 32.4 cubic feet when it’s folded.</p>, <p>The materials in the all-black cabin are of average quality. Soft-touch surfaces are scattered around, but hard plastic remains in a number of areas. The nylon cargo cover seems quite flimsy, compared to the vinyl covers installed in rival models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54645" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-chr-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-chr-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-chr-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Toyota has given the C-HR respectable handling and roadholding capabilities, significantly beyond the limits of prior small-size Toyota models.</p>, <p>Even when cornering briskly, the C-HR feels secure and well-planted on the pavement. Steering isn’t as numb as that of typical Toyotas, and the ride is smooth, but this crossover/hatchback is no match for Mazda products in terms of handling and precise responses.</p>, <p>Acceleration is a sadder tale. Toyota’s 144-horsepower engine simply cannot provide anything approaching lively performance, pulling a relatively heavy, 3,300 pound-vehicle. At every level of performance, the C-HR can be deemed sluggish, even in Sport mode.</p>, <p>Fuel economy doesn’t compensate for lackluster performance, either. The C-HR is EPA-rated at 27/31 mpg City/Highway, or 29 mpg Combined. Though adequate, those figures hardly constitute thrifty fuel-efficiency in a smaller car. A Honda Fit, for instance, manages an estimated 36 mpg in Combined driving. As measured by its high coefficient of drag (0.34), the C-HR’s body doesn’t come across as particularly aerodynamic.</p>, <p>Engine noise is noticeable, but not trouble. Most howls that emanate from beneath the hood when accelerating are restrained by sound-deadening material.</p>, <p>By unleashing such an expressive design into the compact crossover/hatchback arena, Toyota reveals its core goal: to attract younger buyers. Some prospects will doubtless be turned off by the love-it/hate-it look, but Toyota hopes enough others will be swayed in its direction. Prices are a bit high for a compact, but both trim levels are well-equipped. Only one factory option is offered, but dealers can install plenty of personalization extras.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by John Voelcker, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-chevrolet-equinox/
[<p>Completely redesigned, the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox compact crossover SUV has shrunk and lost weight when compared with the first-generation Equinox. Despite losing 5.2 inches in wheelbase and 4.7 inches in overall length, interior space is only slightly smaller. The 2018 Equinox weighs about 400 pounds less than its predecessor.</p>, <p>While the previous-generation model was aging and outmoded, the 2018 Equinox is updated in just about every way. In addition to bolder styling, the latest version is better-equipped. Equinox has turned into a more solid, stylish, and capable vehicle. Stylish denim-like seat upholstery is an option.</p>, <p>Four trim levels are offered for 2018: Equinox L, LS, LT, and Premier. Chevrolet first offered only the 1.5-liter four-cylinder base engine. A 2.0-liter gasoline engine then became optional, to be joined by a 1.6-liter diesel. All three engines are turbocharged.</p>, <p>The 1.5-liter engine develops 170 horsepower and 203 pound-feet of torque, versus 182 hp and 174 pound-feet for the 2.4-liter unit that it replaces. Peak torque starts at 2000 rpm. A 6-speed automatic transmission is used.</p>, <p>Available for Equinox LT and Equinox Premier, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder produces 252 horsepower and 260 pound-feet, driving GM’s 9-speed automatic transmission. The 1.6-liter turbodiesel delivers 137 horsepower and 240 pound-feet to a 6-speed automatic, promising fuel economy near 40 mpg in combined city/highway driving.</p>, <p>In its new form, Chevrolet Equinox competes against such compact crossovers as the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4.</p>, <p>Active-safety features and comfort options are available, but mostly limited to top trim levels. All Equinox models include a rearview camera. HID headlights are standard on LT trim, while the Premier edition gets Intellibeam bending headlights. Standard Teen Driver technology can report on behavior of a young driver, while preventing deactivation of safety features.</p>, <p>An optional package for LT trim includes rear parking sensors, plus blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Picking a Premier edition with the Confidence and Convenience II Package is the only way to obtain forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>Equinox L ($23,580), offered only with front-wheel drive, comes with a rearview camera, remote keyless entry, pushbutton start, MyLink 7.0-inch infotainment screen, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity, 4G LTE wi-fi, active noise cancellation, and 17-inch alloy wheels. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $945 destination charge.)</p>, <p>Equinox LS ($25,510) adds a compact spare tire, carpeted rear mats, and a compass. All-wheel drive is available ($1,750).</p>, <p>Equinox LT ($26,750) includes a power driver’s seat with lumbar adjustment, heated power mirrors, HID headlights, and second-row seat release levers. All-wheel drive is available ($1,750). A Confidence and Convenience Package for LT ($1,945) includes blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, rear park assist, and a power liftgate.</p>, <p>Equinox Premier ($30,790) comes with heated leather front seats, driver’s memory, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control, an 8.0-inch touchscreen, auto-dimming mirrors, luggage rack, LED headlights and taillights, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, and a hands-free power liftgate. All-wheel drive ($3,645) is available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54616" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-equinox-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Slimmed down in its 2018 form, the Equinox has adopted a more assertive aura. Up front, however, the fascia is likely to draw both favorable and negative responses. The minivan-like back end might not please everyone, either.</p>, <p>A chromed lower surround splits the integrated, one-piece grille. A subtle line extends rearward from the arch of the front wheel well, dividing within the front door. One branch melds into the rear wheel’s arch, while the other reaches back to the taillights. Rear pillars angle forward aggressively, while rear side windows wrap into the back glass.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54618" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-equinox-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The Equinox cabin comes across as clean-looking and attractive, but it lags behind major competitors in both style and quality of materials. Front seats are better than before, though snug.</p>, <p>Back-seat riders can expect spacious comfort, with ample room for heads and legs. Two adult occupants shouldn’t feel crowded, and three can fit – preferably for shorter journeys. Entry/exit isn’t difficult, because rear doors open sufficiently wide.</p>, <p>Both hard and soft-touch plastics abound, except in top Premium trim. That version expands its standard leather upholstery onto inserts within the dashboard and doors.</p>, <p>Available denim-style fabric upholstery delivers surprising comfort, if snugger than seats trimmed in leather. In size and heft, the leather-wrapped steering wheel is especially satisfying.</p>, <p>Despite the tall, expansive opening for loading cargo, available space is smaller than the previous Equinox provided. With seatbacks upright, volume is 29.9 cubic feet, versus 63.5 cubic feet when they’re folded flat.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54617" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-equinox-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-equinox-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-equinox-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Performance of the 1.5-liter base engine is solid and efficient, helped by turbocharging. Clearly, it’s more impressive than the 2.4-liter engine in the previous Equinox. The 1.5-liter is quieter, too, emitting a refined exhaust sound and a touch of turbo whistling when pushed. Because peak engine torque is readily available, a base-engine Equinox can take on upgrades with little hesitation.</p>, <p>Chevrolet’s 6-speed automatic transmission is less appealing, especially when shifting manually. Even if the additional power from the optional 2.0-liter engine isn’t essential, it gets a slicker 9-speed automatic rather than the older 6-speed. Upshifts occur smoothly, while little gear-hunting occurs during downshifting.</p>, <p>Passengers can anticipate a quiet, comfortable ride, remaining composed even on undulating pavement.</p>, <p>Feedback from pavement surfaces is minimal, but that’s hardly uncommon among crossovers. Body motions are more noticeable than a Mazda CX-5 would transmit, but handling capability of the Equinox ranks as adequate. Standard 17-inch tires may yield an uneasy driving experience at times.</p>, <p>Pavement rumble and roar are mostly muted, regardless of tire choice. Wind noise, in contrast, can be a problem. Though pleasing to some ears, the sound of the 1.5-liter engine might be considered intrusive by others.</p>, <p>Base-engine fuel economy isn’t class-leading, but tolerable. The 1.5-liter version is EPA-rated at 26/32 mpg City/Highway, or 28 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops the estimate to 24/30/26 mpg.</p>, <p>Fuel-efficiency sinks with the optional 2.0-liter engine, which is EPA-rated at 22/29 mpg City/Highway, or 25 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops that estimate to 22/28/24 mpg. Chevrolet claims the front-drive Equinox Diesel should achieve 40 mpg in highway driving.</p>, <p>In addition to welcome reductions in dimensions and weight, without sacrificing cabin space, the 2018 Equinox has gained standard equipment. Altogether, it’s now a more satisfying and capable crossover. As is often the case, active-safety features are limited to top trim levels. Best bet might be an Equinox LT with the Confidence and Convenience Package.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Brandon Turkus, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-lexus-gs/
[<p>The Lexus GS is a rear-wheel-drive sports sedan, not to be confused with the Lexus ES front-wheel-drive near-luxury family sedan. It competes with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Audi A6, and Infiniti Q70. It was last redesigned in 2013. Changes for 2018 are minimal.</p>, <p>However the newest model, the 2.0-liter turbo introduced for 2017, gets its name changed from GS 200t to GS 300. And the GS 350, with a V6, gets five more horsepower. Also the Enform safety connect and service connect features come free for ten years.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus GS 300 2.0 turbo makes 241 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, and is mated to a paddle-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission. It can accelerate from zero to 60 in 7.2 seconds, which isn’t so quick for a sports sedan, but the paddle-shifters help the kickdown response. It gets good fuel mileage, which is the reason it was introduced into the lineup: an EPA-estimated 29/34 mpg City/Highway, 31 mpg Combined. But GS 300 requires Premium fuel, so there goes the savings. So do all the other GS models, including the hybrid.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54604" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gsf.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 Lexus GS 350 feels more like a sports sedan, with its 3.5-liter V6 having direct injection, variable valve timing, and making 311 horsepower; it too uses the paddle-shifting eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is available with the GS 350, but that uses an older six-speed automatic. The GS 350 shortens the zero-to-sixty time to 5.7 seconds, but sucks the fuel consumption down to 23 Combined miles per gallon.</p>, <p>The GS 450h hybrid with rear-wheel drive is two-tenths quicker to 60 mph than the GS 350, while getting the same 29/34/31 mpg as the GS 300. Its speed comes from an Atkinson-cycle version of the V6, mated to a 147-kilowatt motor and 30-kilowatt nickel-metal-hydride battery pack, for a total of 338 horsepower, with and 257-pound feet of torque. The downside is it doesn’t have sporty handling, and any other sportiness it might have is stolen by its continuously variable transmission.</p>, <p>The GS F Sport brings the sporty. The F Sport package is available with every model, and features a sports suspension along with sportier exterior and interior trim, and upgraded features. A GS F Sport might compete with the Acura RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD.</p>, <p>If the F Sport isn’t enough, there is the GS F that competes with the BMW M5, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, Cadillac CTS-V, and Audi RS 7. It uses a 5.0-liter V8 making a 467-horsepower and 389 pound-feet of torque, to accelerate from zero to sixty in a fairly blistering 4.5 seconds. With both direct injection and port injection, and using both the Otto and Atkinson cycles, it gets 19 miles per gallon Combined. That might not sound like much, but for 467 horsepower it’s impressive.</p>, <p>The 2018 GS 300 comes with the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, 8-speed automatic, and rear-wheel drive. includes 10-way power seats, leather in soft hues, 10 airbags, rearview camera, satellite radio, iPod, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and Remote Touch, the mouse-like controller. Options include active cruise control with emergency braking, a head-up display, and night vision.</p>, <p>GS 350 comes with a V6 engine and is available with rear-wheel drive and the eight-speed transmission, or all-wheel drive and the six-speed.</p>, <p>The GS 450h features the hybrid gas-electric powertrain, CVT, and rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>GS F features the high-performance 5.0-liter V8 engine, eight-speed automatic with Sport Direct-Shift, and rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54601" height="121" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gs-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The large spindle grille announces Lexus. It’s drawn like an hourglass with boomerang shapes on each side. The L-shaped headlamps bristle with LED lighting including turn signals and daytime running lights, while the taillamps are LED as well.</p>, <p>Naturally the F Sport model is more aggressive, with a bolder spindle at the grille, air intakes for the transmission and oil coolers, and aerodynamic tweaks. The wide front fenders have vents that draw hot air out from under the hood. Big rocker panels lower the sides, while a carbon-fiber spoiler and quadruple exhaust outlets coming from a diffuser make the car look mean from the rear.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54603" height="134" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gs-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Compared to most other Lexuses, the cabin of the GS, especially the instrument panel, seems Spartan. But the fit and finish is excellent, with one exception: the haptic joystick on the console fits with a gap at its side. Overall the cabin is elegant, warm and inviting, thanks a lot to soft ambient lighting around the edges. And the materials are a cut above those in the German luxury sedans, with padded leather panels and wood trim in rich shades. The leather seams are carefully stitched, but it might be overkill, there are so many.</p>, <p>The instrument panel features big gauges that are crisp and clear, along with a huge 12.3-inch high-resolution display. The plastics are of a high quality, with metallic trim around the analog clock that has become almost a Lexus affectation, stubbornly present despite being hard to read. The glovebox is deep, the center console has a sliding cover, and the door pockets are useful, so small storage is adequate.</p>, <p>The 10-way power seats are comfortable and supportive, while the available 18-way power seats have heating and ventilation. The F Sport seats have more bolstering for hard cornering. The GS F seats are exceptionally comfortable and supportive, in perforated leather to match the steering wheel, with other Alcantara leather bits elsewhere. Also aluminum pedals and carbon fiber trim.</p>, <p>The rear has good head room, but only enough knee room for small children, so it’s not much consolation that the rear doors are wide. That makes it easier to climb into a place where you won’t want to be, but at least it’s also easier to make a quick getaway which you’ll want to do. Heated seats and climate control in the rear are available, to be enjoyed by pampered small children.</p>, <p>The trunk is shallow but the opening is wide and there’s a pass-through for long objects like skis.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54602" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gs-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gs-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gs-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The Lexus GS models have different driving dynamics.</p>, <p>The GS 300 is afflicted with turbo lag, a frustrating pause when you floor it. Even the Sport Plus mode can’t fix it. The eight-speed transmission can be fussy going uphill, too quick to upshift and downshift; sometimes you have to switch to Manual mode and shift yourself with the paddles, just to get it to stop shifting too much in the Normal mode.</p>, <p>In the GS 350, the 311-horsepower V6 solves the acceleration issue, especially above 3000 rpm. Sport mode is clearly sporty, in the manner it works the eight-speed transmission. The all-wheel-drive GS 350 with its older six-speed transmission is a bit less quick.</p>, <p>The GS 450h hybrid is fast, comfortable and quiet, with a semi-active suspension. It offers less driving feel than the other GS models, but then hybrids aren’t known for their feeling of connectedness to the road. An F Sport package helps, but it can’t bring much soul to the CVT transmission; although Lexus has helped some, by programming eight steps into the transmission so it feels more like an automatic.</p>, <p>Driving modes of Eco, Sport, Sport+, and EV each further re-program the CVT and the light-touch electric power steering. The brakes have regenerative rigidity with not much braking sensation.</p>, <p>All GS models have electric power steering that’s nimble and communicative, and a lightweight multi-link suspension front and rear that provides a tight ride but low tolerance for bumps. With its stiff chassis, the GS handles well on standard 17-inch, 50-series tires, while the ride is more composed than most of its rivals. An adaptive suspension and active steering are available, and they do set a new benchmark on the F Sports, but we don’t think the GS needs it. The GS actually feels capable on the track.</p>, <p>Active rear steering is available; it turns the rear wheels a tiny bit, in the opposite direction of the fronts, to pivot the car, adding stability in quick moves.</p>, <p>The 5.0-liter V8 in the GS F revs to 7300 rpm with a sweet howl, piped into the cabin and heard like background music through two speakers, one front, one rear. It’s normally aspirated, so it’s not as fast as the supercharged Cadillac CTS-V or turbocharged BMW M5 and Mercedes E63 AMG. But at 4034 pounds, the GS F weighs 111 pounds less than the Cadillac, and 356 pounds less than the fat German M5.</p>, <p>You can feel that relative lightness in the handling. Its dynamic personality is small, thanks also to torque-vectoring that makes the car respond better in turns. In Normal mode, the steering is light and delightfully quick. If you push it past the grip of the sticky Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, the stability control will save you. If you switch to Sport S or Sport S+ mode, and put the differential in Slalom or Track mode, the F is happy to grip and rotate for you.</p>, <p>And it stops quickly like a lighter car, with big Brembo brakes using 15-inch front rotors and 13.5-inch rears. The eight-speed automatic transmission is crisp, smooth and responsive, although not as sharp as a good dual-clutch like the BMW.</p>, <p>The suspension is double-wishbone front and multi-link rear. Two front arms and two rear links are aluminum, reducing unsprung weight. The chassis is stiffened with four underbody braces, while the shocks, springs and bushings are firmer, and the steering geometry both front and rear is changed. The ride is reasonable, so it’s a fairly comfortable cruiser.</p>, <p>The GS 300 suffers from lazy acceleration and turbo lag, but gets good mileage. The GS 350 has the speed but gets much less mileage. The GS 450h hybrid has both speed and mileage but suffers from soft handling and a CVT transmission. The GS F is a worthy super-sport sedan, but very expensive. All of the GS sedans have a rear seat that’s too small, and require Premium fuel.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Acura RDX is a compact crossover now in the sixth year of its generation. It was a trailbreaker when it was introduced, a daring step into the uncharted territory of compact sport SUV. It’s long in the tooth now.</p>, <p>Available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, RDX comes with a 3.5-liter V6 that makes 276 horsepower and 252 pound-feet of torque. It’s mated to a slick paddle-shifting six-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Over the years its mission has grown to near-luxury, to the point where a fully loaded RDX can match the starting price of rivals like the BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. But its entry-level model is still quite a lot less, bringing the value of affordability to the RDX.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54595" height="135" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-final.jpg" width="200"/>Acura RDX comes standard with 3.6-liter V6 and front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive available ($1500).</p>, <p>The 2018 Acura RDX ($36,775) comes with dual-zone automatic climate control, moonroof, power liftgate, keyless ignition, LED headlamps, rearview camera, and heated front leatherette seats, power adjustable. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>RDX with the Technology package ($40,475) has real leather upholstery, higher infotainment on 8.0-inch screen, upgraded audio and 18-inch alloy wheels. AcuraWatch includes adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, forward collision warnings, lane departure warnings, and lane keep assist ($1300).</p>, <p>RDX with Advance package the ($43,475) brings ventilated front seats, foglamps, auto-dimming exterior mirrors, remote start, and parking sensors, and AcuraWatch.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54594" height="124" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The busy RDX features a beak nose on a two-box shape. It’s reasonably harmonious. The five-square LED headlamps blend smoothly. The nose is neither aggressive nor flashy. You don’t do a double-take.</p>, <p>The base 17-inch alloy wheels could stand to be a bit more flashy, like the machine-finished 18-inch alloys that come with the Technology package.</p>, <p>The busy cabin shows its age, especially in gray, and struggles to meet that near-luxury tag. For example some matte silver painted plastic trim looks like it came off the modest CR-V. But close your eyes and the RDX feels like a crossover costing much more. It’s solid and quiet. Open them and you’ll see that the large center console has lots of storage space. The thick-rimmed three-spoke steering wheel suggests cornering tenacity that’s not quite there.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54593" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Front occupants will find it spacious and comfortable, with power adjustment on both seats, even the base model, with especially good lumbar support.</p>, <p>The rear passengers face a low bench seat, in an attempt to improve headroom which remains limited. It supposedly can fit three adults but we don’t recommend it. It folds almost flat, to create a good-sized 61.3 cubic feet of cargo space. And then there’s the bonus of another 15.6 cubic feet under the cargo floor.</p>, <p>The infotainment on the Technology and Advance RDX isn’t user-friendly. The menus are complicated, and a second screen in the process doesn’t help. Another drawback to the system is Apple CarPlay or Android Auto aren’t available.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54592" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-rdx-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 3.6-liter V6 engine is powerful and refined, and brings a lot of grunt with its torque. It makes 279 hp with 252 lb-ft.</p>, <p>The electric power steering is direct, better than that the Lexus RX. And the handling is accurate, if not entirely sports-car-like. Out on the wide-open road, at high speed, it’s rock steady. The suspension takes the bumps in stride.</p>, <p>We’ll stick to the base model, in avoidance of the frustrating infotainment on the upscale models. We’re fine with the good leatherette, and we still get the great V6 and slick six-speed paddle-shifting automatic. Comfortable supportive seats. The rear passengers will be a bit tight, but when they’re gone there’s tons of room for cargo. Sharp direct handling at all times. Cheaper than a BMW. So what if the trim isn’t fancy.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Camry is a redesign of the midsize sedan, beginning the next generation of the Kentucky-built car that’s been a best seller for 15 years.</p>, <p>The looks are expressive and the suspension is sophisticated, enough of each to leave behind the Camry’s hum-ho past. Naturally it’s more fuel efficient than before.</p>, <p>The all-new Camry has to have something special to stay ahead of the pack, now including the popular crossovers. Its competitors are impressive, including its arch-rival Honda Accord and the new Hyundai Sonata, along with Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Kia Optima, and Nissan Altima.</p>, <p>The base Camry L comes with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder now making 206 horsepower, hasn’t changed. It’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, the same transmission used with the bigger engine, a 3.5-liter V6 making a full 301 horsepower. Few competitors offer a V6. There’s also a Camry Hybrid with continuously variable transmission.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54586" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-xse.jpg" width="200"/>Camry SE and XSE each get sporty styling.</p>, <p>Camry L gets an EPA-rated 34 miles per gallon Combined city and highway, while Camry models with more equipment and the same four-cylinder engine rate 32 mpg. The V6 gets 26 mpg Combined. The Hybrid LE is EPA-rated at 52 miles per gallon, the first midsize sedan to break the 50-mpg barrier.</p>, <p>The Camry Hybrid uses Toyota’s latest system with two motors, which made its first appearance on the 2016 Prius. It’s a 176-horsepower 2.5-liter engine tuned for the two electric motors that power the car under light conditions. The battery pack is under the rear seat, like in the Prius, which allows the hybrid’s trunk to be as big as the sedan’s. There are two types of battery pack, depending on the model; the 52-mpg LE uses lithium-ion batteries, while the more costly SE and XLE hybrids use the older and heavier nickel-metal-hydride batteries to achieve 46 mpg.</p>, <p>So far we’ve only driven pre-production models of the new Camry. We’d rate its performance as average, even with a new chassis. But it looks better, and there are improvements in safety and other features. We can’t comment on comfort and quality until we drive the production models, but we expect the build quality to be high.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54585" height="122" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-se.jpg" width="200"/>Five models are available with the standard 2.5-liter engine: Camry L ($23,495); Camry LE ($24,000); Camry XLE ($28,450); Camry SE ($25,200); Camry XSE ($29,000). Also available is the Camry XLE V6 ($34,400) and XSE V6 ($34,950). Camry Hybrid has three versions: LE ($27,800); SE ($29,500); and XLE ($32,250).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54583" height="132" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-rear.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-rear.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-rear-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>On its new chassis, the 2018 Camry is one inch lower, and a bit longer and wider. It’s sleeker and has a firm stance, but there might be differences of opinion about whether or not it looks more sporty and/or upscale than before. Toyota’s goal was to make it more expressive, and it is that. It’s crisp and racy. It makes the handsome Ford Fusion look a bit pudgy.</p>, <p>Many of the design elements aren’t new, having been introduced on the 2014 Camry when its styling was tweaked. The grille has thin wings that are spread like a gliding hawk, with a Toyota badge where the face of the hawk would be; it’s colored blue on Hybrid models. The sides and rear end have a lot more sculpting.</p>, <p>The sporty SE and XSE get a special nose and rear bumper, along with a small spoiler on the rear deck and shaped sills along the sides.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54588" height="133" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-interior.jpg" width="91"/>Like the exterior, the interior feels more stylish and premium, even on the lower models, thanks to a mix of soft materials and colors. The front seat bottoms have been redesigned, and the touchscreen on the dashboard is bigger.</p>, <p>The new Camry handles better than before, although it’s still average. We expected more, since the latest Prius improved its handing by so much.</p>, <p>The engine is no quicker than before, but it does get better fuel mileage. The 206-horsepower four-cylinder engine isn’t especially powerful. It pauses when you floor it, and sometimes takes two or three downshifts to get with the program, something that’s unfortunately not uncommon in cars with eight-speed transmissions and not much power. The Camry is far from the worst.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54584" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The speed of the 301-horsepower V6 with the same eight-speed, and even the Hybrid SE with its step-programmed CVT makes those powertrains more rewarding. The Hybrid SE sport model programs six simulated gears into the CVT to remove the big rubber band feeling of one-speed CVTs. The V6 gives the driver smooth speed at any time, without the need for the transmission to downshift so much.</p>, <p>The LE Hybrid offered as much enjoyment as the V6, if not the same kind of pleasure. It was quiet except when it was pinned, and in that situation it revs with a machinery-like noise. we drove proved as enjoyable as the V-6, in a different way. The strong lithium-iron batteries allow the car to run in electric-only mode quite frequently if the road is flat, even at medium speeds. When the gas engine comes on, its imperceptible; so too is the transition regenerative and friction braking subtle. The Hybrid isn’t fast and doesn’t inspire you to try, it’s just smooth, quiet, and comfortable.</p>, <p>The previous Camry was pretty soft, so this one is inevitably better, but even the firmer SE and XSE models don’t feel so sporty. Meanwhile the feel of the electric power steering is much improved over the previous numbness. The Camry grips the road as well as most midsize sedans, although the tall tires on the LE can squirm on winding rural roads if the pace moves up. The XLE’s bigger wheels and tires are better.</p>, <p>The fully loaded XSE V6 handled best of all the Camrys we drove. It had strong acceleration, looked sporty, and was tightest in the corners.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54582" height="113" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-camry-final.jpg" width="200"/>The redesigned Camry seems lacking. It’s clearly an improvement, but we expected to have our socks blown off. However it’s good enough, in an evolutionary and incremental way, to maintain its No. 1 position as best-selling midsize sedan. And it’s unquestionably more stylish. The Hybrid LE gets 52 mpg with its lithium-iron battery pack yet with an MSRP of just $27,800. That’s only about $3400 more than the original 2001 Prius that took 13 seconds to go from zero to sixty.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-bmw-3-series/
[<p>The BMW 3 Series is aging. Rivals such as the Audi A4 and Mercedes C-Class are newer. The only thing new for 2018 for the 3 Series are some changed packages and new colors.</p>, <p>The performance in many configurations still stands out, with three bodies, six engines, two transmissions, and rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive creating no less than 15 models, counting the almighty high-performance M3 (which rates its own review) to the 330e iPerformance plug-in hybrid sedan.</p>, <p>Engines include the high-mileage 328d diesel, 2.0-liter turbo four in the 330 making 248 horsepower, and scorching 3.0-liter turbo six in the 340i making 320 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque. All the engines need premium (or diesel) fuel, even the lowly 180-horsepower engine in the 320i.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54577" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-3gt.jpg" width="200"/>When you mix in the different trims, the definition of the 3 Series blurs. For example there’s Sport Line for the 328i, 328d, and 340i. There’s also an M Sport package, and a Track Handling package with big blue brake calipers.</p>, <p>The all-wheel-drive Gran Turismo is a five-door hatchback that’s nearly eight inches longer than the sedan, on a wheelbase that’s four inches longer and three inches taller. Creatively, it leads the way in styling, as part crossover, part fastback, and part wagon.</p>, <p>BMW 3 Series models include 320i, 320i xDrive all-wheel drive, 328d, 328d xDrive, 330i, 330i xDrive, 340i, 340i xDrive sedan; also the 330e iPerformance plug-in hybrid sedan, 330i xDrive Gran Turismo, 340i xDrive Gran Turismo, 330i and 328d xDrive wagon, and the M3.</p>, <p>The entry-level 320i gets manual front seats in leatherette upholstery, dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth, 6.5-inch display, and iDrive. Options include wheels, infotainment, heated seats, carbon-fiber rear spoiler, wireless Apple CarPlay, and rearview camera.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54576" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-340i-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The lines are classic and elegant, sharp and expressive, with large headlamps and air intakes and a distinctive rear end. BMW doesn’t copy the aero wedge that seems too popular nowadays.</p>, <p>The striking Gran Turismo pushes design in an original direction, as a big hatchback fastback coupe, with a rising beltline that gives it visual rake at the hood. Smoothly, it blends crossover, coupe and wagon.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54575" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-340i-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-340i-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-340i-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>In the cabin, the 3 Series suffers from its age, when it’s compared to high-tech wonders like the Audi A4 and Mercedes C-Class. Depending on the model and trim, the materials will be rich and luxurious or muddled and budget. The standard front seats have decent bolstering and nice leg support, even without being leather; while the flat dashboard features a standing screen that needs new materials.</p>, <p>The 3 Series is as big as it’s ever been, but it’s still considered a compact car. The back seat squeezes adults, but there’s good headroom. There’s also good cargo space, with a big trunk of 15.8 cubic feet.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54574" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-3wagon-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-3wagon-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-3wagon-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>BMWs are known for good handling, so it’s no surprise that you get a sharp turn-in, nicely weighted steering, and flat cornering in every type of 3 Series. The old hydraulic power steering gave more feedback than the current electric power steering, but that’s true with almost every car, and you can’t hold back progress.</p>, <p>The 3 Series also offers a smooth ride, with a suspension that’s tuned for run-flat, high-mileage tires. If there are any sharp edges over bumps, it’s probably from the tires.</p>, <p>Acceleration-wise, the 320i with its 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo making 180 horsepower and 200 pound-feet of torque feels weak compared to the others, running from zero to sixty in 7.1 seconds.</p>, <p>The 330i uses the same engine tuned to make much more horsepower and torque, 248hp and 258 lb-ft. And it shows, as the 330i will make the same sprint in 5.5 seconds, and sound better doing it.</p>, <p>The 340i with its 3.0-liter turbo six is way fast and talented, with big torque available at a wide range. We love that it’s a classic inline six, not a V6.</p>, <p>The most common transmission in these three models will be a smooth eight-speed automatic, but lo and behold, a six-speed manual remains available. BMW knows its buyers are drivers, and isn’t about to let them down, at least not yet. We like to think of ourselves as drivers, but still … the eight-speed automatic is pretty desirable. Its shifts are quick, precise, confident, and correctly timed.</p>, <p>The 328d makes 180 horsepower and another ton of smooth torque, with the standard eight-speed automatic. With its high mileage, its best fit seems to us to be as a family wagon.</p>, <p>The 330e iPerformance plug-in hybrid makes 248 combined horsepower from a 7.6-kwh hour lithium-ion battery and turbo four engine.</p>, <p>The Driving Dynamics Control modes are Eco Pro, Comfort, Sport, and Sport Plus. Sport mode sharpens the steering and transmission, while Sport Plus loosens up the stability control.</p>, <p>There’s an optional variable sport steering system that mechanically alters the steering ratio depending on the immediate task, making parking easier and high-speed cornering tighter.</p>, <p>Finally, for more aggressive cornering, the M Sport package lowers the chassis by 0.4 inches, stiffens the springs and shocks, fattens the anti-roll bars, and uses 18- or 19-inch alloys with fat tires. And for the most aggressive cornering, the Track Handling package adds the variable sport steering, adaptive suspension, and bigger brakes with blue calipers.</p>, <p>The BMW 3 Series brings crisp handling and a tight ride. Distinguishing among them, you get adequate acceleration in the base 320i, happier get-up in the 330i, now-we’re-talkin’ boost in the 340i twin-turbo inline six. These sedans are somewhat dated, but the newer Gran Turismo offers distinctive styling. There’s also the options of diesel and plug-in hybrid. So many characters in just one car.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>Some say the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio is Fiat Chrysler’s moment. Some say it’s do or die. If they can pull it off, to bring crossover SUV and sexy Italian together, they can do anything.</p>, <p>Sexy Italian v focused German, like Audi, Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, competing in your mind until they all look alike.</p>, <p>The Stelvio is gorgeous, hot, charming, tight and agile. Out of the box it’s capable, dynamic, and thrilling. It’s a dancer. The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine accelerates with the Jaguar F-Pace and Porsche Macan.</p>, <p>Stelvio’s mission to be the world’s first sexy crossover is made easier by the Alfa Romeo Giulia sedan. Consider the Stelvio a jacked-up Giulia, as the sedan and crossover share engines, transmissions, suspensions, brakes, steering systems, interiors and last but not least styling.</p>, <p>Now imagine, a 505-horsepower Quadrifoglio model. Coming early 2018.</p>, <p>The Alfa Romeo Stelvio is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission (paddle shifters extra). It’s all-wheel drive, with a lightened system that’s rear-wheel biased, sending power to the fronts only when needed, up to 60 percent. It rates 22/28 miles per gallon City/Highway, or 24 mpg Combined, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>A totally new model, Stelvio is named after the serpentine road that leads over Stelvio Pass in the Italian Alps.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54566" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-final.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-final.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-final-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Alfa Romeo Stelvio ($41,995) is powered by a 280-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and comes with leather seats, rearview camera, 18-inch wheels, LED taillamps, dual-zone climate control, 7.0-inch display in the instrument cluster, 6.5-inch infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 8-speaker sound system, and power liftgate.</p>, <p>Stelvio Ti ($$43,995) adds wood trim, heated leather seats, 8.8-inch infotainment, satellite radio, 19-inch wheels, and front parking sensors.</p>, <p>Stelvio Quadrifoglio features a 505-hp 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6.</p>, <p>Options packages include Sport package, Lusso package, Driver Assistance Static package, Driver Assistance Dynamic Plus package, Cold Weather Package, Ti Performance package. Plus standalone options, like navigation and bigger infotainment on bigger screen.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54568" height="141" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-rear.jpg" width="200"/>The nose of the Stelvio is striking and beautiful. It’s a mirror image of the Giulia. The classic trilobo grille looks even better on the Stelvio, higher off the ground.</p>, <p>The sleek roofline makes the profile look more like a sedan than a crossover, and nowadays sedans look like coupes. On some models there’s a lip over the sloped and pinched rear greenhouse, which sort of says crossover, but otherwise it looks like a sedan with cladding and more ground clearance. The wheels are too beautiful for off road, for sure.</p>, <p>There are a couple of etched character lines in the side, the edginess that crossovers have been chasing for years. But Italian designers do voluptuous better than they copy edgy, so the carving into sheetmetal on the sides of the Stelvio steals some from its identity. Between the front and rear wheels, on the side of the car, it doesn’t say Alfa Romeo.</p>, <p>The rear hatch tries to be voluptuous, and may be about as voluptuous as a rear hatch can get. There’s an interesting shallow canyon carved into the liftgate, so you’re pretty sure it’s not a Lexus, but you never know.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54567" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-interior.jpg" width="200"/>The cabin in a perfectly equipped Stelvio is a wonderful place to be on a long drive. The standard leather seats have the elegance of a restored classic. In the upscale models, the trim is wood and aluminum, with a minimum of plastic around. The flat-bottomed steering wheel has grips. It’s hard to imagine it without the paddle-shifters that come on the Sport, along with seats.</p>, <p>The stop-start button has an inspired and purposeful location. But the infotainment controls seem out of place. And there is an overarching sense of cheapness in the cabin. The plastic bits are firm, never mind that they’re technically called soft touch. The plastic is hard and black on the center console.</p>, <p>The Ti seats have more bolstering than the base seats. The Sport seats are super supportive, the only seats to have if you drive your Stelvio the way any Alfa likes to be driven.</p>, <p>The back seat is tiny. Pushing it even for kids. There’s just 32 inches of legroom, which is 4.5 inches less than the smallest European, the BMW X3. The headroom is about average for the class, more than the Mercedes-Benz GLC but less than the Audi Q5.</p>, <p>The cargo space is average, 18.5 cubic feet in back and 56.6 with the rear seat folded. That’s about the same as the Mercedes-Benz GLC. Compare to Audi Q5 (26.8 rear, 60.4 total) and BMW X3 (27.6 rear, 63.3 total).</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54565" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-stelvio-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>The 2.0-liter turbo makes 280 horsepower and 306 pound-feet of torque, which might be keeping Mercedes, BMW and Audi engineers up at night to catch up. Those numbers match some of the V6 engines from those makers.</p>, <p>The acceleration will keep you nicely pinned to the seat, from zero to redline. The broad torque kicks the two-ton Stelvio in the butt when necessary. Its zero-to-sixty time of 5.4 seconds is quickest in the class. It’ll go 144 miles per hour.</p>, <p>The eight-speed ZF automatic is fantastic. There is a DNA drive mode selector. In Natural, the transmission is unobtrusive, downshifting at the right places and upshifting at the correct time. In Advanced Efficiency, it upshifts early to use less gas. In Dynamic mode the shifts are fast and brutal at high rpm, unlike no crossover on earth. And downshifting with the brilliant big paddles on the Sport is smooth and quick. It’s a blast to shift manually.</p>, <p>The steering is fast and the suspension tight and agile. The ballerina-like handling easily matches the sublime handling of the Jaguar F-Pace. Its balance is perfect, a 50/50 weight distribution, so the handling is neutral and responsive. We haven’t had a chance to test the Stelvio with the Ti Performance package, with adaptive suspension and mechanical limited-slip differential. In any case, we find the base suspension very good.</p>, <p>The super-quick steering ratio of 11.8:1 means precision cornering. The steering feels natural and builds weight well. You can feel the car in the seat of your pants; there you have it, that’s what almost all Alfas have. It wanders a bit at freeway speeds, and can get tiring, but in the twisties it doesn’t matter.</p>, <p>The brakes need more development. It’s a new system, all-electric pedal with sensors sending to a computer that controls the brake calipers. In dynamic situations (the twisties), it’s fantastic. But in traffic, especially around town, it’s almost impossible to stop the Stelvio smoothly.</p>, <p>Stelvio is a dream come true. It’s a true-blue Alfa Romeo SUV. Striking face that announces Alfa. Italian acceleration from the 2.0 turbo (beats the Brits and Germans), spot-on eight-speed automatic, quick precise steering, tight and agile ride, Sport model with paddle shifters and snug seat. Cabin layout and materials are so-so, depending on model and package. If this is what you want in an SUV, Stelvio is the only one.</p>, <p>Sam Moses contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA SUV gets a moderate reworking, led by a fresh front-end appearance and more prominent bumpers. Slight aerodynamic touch-ups have been applied, to help smooth the body contours. Several new safety and convenience features have been added, including a rearview camera as standard. A new GLA250 Ice Edition is available.</p>, <p>Also new for the 2018 AMG GLA45 is an optional AMG Performance Studio Package, LED headlights as standard and a new front air dam and air intakes.</p>, <p>A year after launching the CLA four-door coupe, Mercedes-Benz followed with a GLA crossover as a 2015 model. For the first time in a generation, the German automaker had a pair of small cars on sale. They were also the first front-wheel-drive models offered to American buyers.</p>, <p>The 2018 lineup continues with the GLA250 with front- or all-wheel drive and the performance-oriented AMG GLA45 with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The GLA250 holds a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 208 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. Sole transmission is a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. With front-wheel drive, the GLA250 can reach 0-60 mph in 7.2 seconds. All-wheel drive is an option for the GLA250.</p>, <p>In the AMG GLA45, a retuned variant of the 2.0-liter turbo whips up a boisterous 375 horsepower and 350 pound-feet. That’s enough to slash the 0-60 mph acceleration time to a rapid 4.3 seconds. All-wheel drive is standard. Dynamic Select can alter several settings, include engine sound.</p>, <p>With either powertrain, the compact GLA promises the practical virtues of both a crossover and a hatchback, combined with appealing gas mileage. Counteracting its merits is a relatively stiff ride.</p>, <p>Plenty of options are available, which translates to standard-equipment lists that aren’t quite as extensive as those on some competitors. Available extra-cost features include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability, a panoramic sunroof, hands-free tailgate, and leather upholstery.</p>, <p>In addition to start/stop technology to shut off the engine at stoplights, each GLA has forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, along with a rearview camera. A surround-view camera is newly optional, joining lane keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and an automatic parking assistant.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54559" height="128" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla250.jpg" width="200"/>GLA250 ($33,400) comes with a rearview camera, power liftgate, power front seats, keyless start, an 8.0-inch infotainment screen, Bluetooth, MB-Tex synthetic leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth, HD radio, adaptive braking, and 18-inch wheels. GLA250 is front-wheel drive with a 2.0-liter turbo inline-4.</p>, <p>The GLA 250 4MATIC SUV ($35,400) includes all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>AMG GLA45 ($50,600) substitutes the 375-horsepower engine and 19-inch wheels, adding standard LED headlights and revised gear ratios. Options include Recaro seats, a panoramic sunroof, and 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio. (All prices are MSRP and do not include $995 destination charge.)</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54560" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Closely related to the Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan, the GLA has a taller hatchback body and sits higher off the ground. Emphasizing its practical nature, the German automaker’s smallest utility vehicle looks relatively stubby, below a short roofline with sharply angled pillars.</p>, <p>Boldly sculpted, the GLA relies on prominent detail work to attract notice. LED headlights and taillights are standard on the AMG GLA45, but optional for the GLA250. Sitting 3 inches lower than its mate, the performance-focused AMG GLA45 gets additional front-end trim elements and rolls on 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54558" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla-interior.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla-interior.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla-interior-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Basically, the GLA ranks as more snug hatchback than spacious crossover SUV. Abundantly bolstered front seats, augmented by firm seat cushions, promise fine support for the driver and passenger. Power adjustments help each rider attain a comfortable seating position.</p>, <p>Rear seats, in contrast, fall short on leg space, especially for adults who exceed average size.</p>, <p>Compared to its CLA sedan sibling, which features a dramatically low roofline, the GLA provides greater rear headroom. Even so, the compact profile translates to constricted comfort when carrying more than front-seat occupants. Folding down the back seat yields a sizable cargo area out back, expanding from 17 cubic feet of storage space to a useful 43.6 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Soft-touch plastic covers the dashboard, which retains an appealing, aero-inspired design. For a premium-level small crossover, the GLA seems to have quite a few plastic elements. Some trim panels feel harder than expected, including a large portion of the dashboard. MB-Tex synthetic leather is standard, and leather seat upholstery costs extra. So do trim components made of wood, aluminum, or carbon-fiber.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54557" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-gla-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Quick turbo-engine responses are the rule in a GLA, whether it’s the GLA250 base model or the fiery AMG GLA45. In terms of performance, practically nothing about either GLA resembles a typical crossover or SUV. When the dual-clutch transmission is in Sport mode, reactions are especially brisk.</p>, <p>Even in base GLA250 form, this compact crossover rides quite stiffly with the standard firm suspension. Larger optional tires make the ride harsher yet, unless the optional adaptive suspension is ordered. Handling talents are more satisfying. Despite an 8-inch ground clearance, a GLA doesn’t feel like an SUV.</p>, <p>All-wheel-drive models have an off-road mode that can help provide controlled traction, but are best limited to gravel roads and milder trails. On the highway, the GLA is solid and quiet, with little engine noise heard and transmission shifts effectively isolated. Optional tires, however, produce considerable road noise.</p>, <p>Although its price is considerably higher, the AMG GLA45 is the choice for tenacious, forceful driving. In addition to a stronger suspension and 19-inch tires, the GLA45 engine emits a stirring exhaust note. An AMG GLA45 breezes through curves and corners with little fuss but abundant energy. A limited-slip front differential and sport suspension with Race mode can be added.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is comparable to other compact crossovers and hatchbacks, and the gas-mileage penalty for the 375-horsepower version isn’t startling. With front-drive, the GLA250 is EPA-rated at 24/33 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive drops the EPA estimated to 23/31 mpg City/Highway, or 26 mpg Combined. The AMG GLA45 earns an estimate of 22/28/25 mpg: not great, but hardly horrific considering its performance potential.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz GLA feels refined, but it is undeniably a compact crossover based on front-wheel drive made for a particular price level. Features expected in a luxury vehicle, even a compact one, are absent from the GLA250. The GLA tends to ride roughly for a vehicle in this class, unless the adaptive suspension is optioned. Although the potent GLA45 adds some luxury touches, its option list is extensive.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Marty Padgett, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
---------https://www.newcartestdrive.com/reviews/2018-mercedes-benz-cla/
[<p>Introduced for the 2014 model year, the compact Mercedes-Benz CLA joined the larger CLS, which had given the brand a new, rebellious variety of passenger car. Dubbed four-door coupes, the CLS and the far less costly CLA flaunt a roofline that’s audaciously low and sensually curvaceous.</p>, <p>Little-changed for the 2018 model year, the Mercedes-Benz CLA250 is now available in an Ice Edition, while the performance-oriented AMG CLA45 gains an optional $4,000 AMG Performance Studio Package.</p>, <p>Undeniably, the striking, indeed, daring, profile of the original CLS served as a milestone in design. Now, in CLA form, it’s a lush example of the possibilities for entry-level premium automobiles.</p>, <p>Rivals have adopted the four-door coupe theme, but the sleek profile of the CLA, helped by frameless window glass, has aged well. Mercedes-Benz itself has adopted the basic concept for other models.</p>, <p>Beneath the hood of the CLA250, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder develops 208 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. That’s sufficient to reach 60 mph in 6.9 seconds, while yielding 30-mpg fuel economy in combined driving. The 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission mates with standard front-drive or optional ($2,000) all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Seekers of all-out performance can move up to the AMG CLA45. This version of the 2.0-liter turbo cranks out 375 horsepower and 350 pound-feet, cutting 0-60 mph acceleration time to a sizzling 4.1 seconds. In addition to altered ride height, the CLA45 benefits from modified steering and braking. Its three-link front suspension uses stiffer bearings.</p>, <p>Despite its significantly heftier price, standard equipment even on the CLA45 lacks several features that buyers in its category are likely to want. Plenty of options are available, but each raises the total price further yet. Both CLAs also suffer from lack of back-seat space. Largely because of the dramatically low coupe-style roofline, four adults cannot ride comfortably, facing limited head clearance.</p>, <p>No testing agency has crash-tested the CLA. Standard safety features include a rearview camera, adaptive braking, and driver-attention monitoring. Everything else is optional: adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, LED headlights, and parking sensors.</p>, <p>Also available are a panoramic sunroof and Harman Kardon audio. The adaptive suspension is a particularly desirable choice.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54551" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-cla-250.jpg" width="200"/>The 2018 CLA250 ($32,700) comes with front-wheel drive, 208-horsepower engine, power driver’s seat, MB-Tex vinyl upholstery, rearview camera, 17-inch wheels, adaptive braking, drowsy-driver warning, dual-zone climate control, start/stop technology, Bluetooth connectivity, and an 8.0-inch infotainment screen. (Prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>CLA 250 4MATIC ($34,700) includes all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>AMG CLA45 ($50,400) gets the 375-horsepower engine, AMG sport suspension and exhaust, LED headlights and taillights, and sport front seats with adjustable cushion length. The new $4,000 Performance Studio Package adds 19-inch black/yellow wheels, unique styling and cockpit, top-stitched dashboard trim, and Recaro front seats.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54550" height="115" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-cla45-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Like its larger CLS forerunner, which pioneered the four-door coupe concept, the scaled-down CLA stands apart because of its sleek profile. Audacious when introduced, the shapely roofline is still attractive to the eye, causing some premium competitors to appear conservative by comparison.</p>, <p>Even the base CLA250 model conveys a sporty aura. Large taillights help align the CLA with Mercedes-Benz sedans. More visually impertinent than its CLA250 sibling, the performance-oriented AMG CLA45 comes across as an urbane roughneck. Oversize front air intakes blend with a grille that contains twin silver blades, rather than the CLA250’s mesh pattern.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54548" height="133" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-cla-interior.jpg" width="115"/>Visual drama continues into the cockpit, which resembles a modestly shrunken offshoot of typical Mercedes-Benz cabins. Only in a few areas does anything look less than premium level, including soft-touch plastic on the dashboard and an 8.0-inch infotainment screen that appears almost like an aftermarket add-on. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity is optional.</p>, <p>Though handsome, the low roofline contributes to a lack of space within the CLA. Rear-seat headroom, in particular, is constricted. Leg space also is at a premium. Entry/exit through narrowed door openings is a challenge, helping to make the back seat look and feel less than welcoming.</p>, <p>Being realistic, the ideal passenger capacity would be two adults, not four. Rearward visibility is nothing to boast about, either.</p>, <p>Front seats are comfortable and nicely supportive, with helpful adjustments. In the CLA45, optional Recaro seats are firmly cushioned and provide even greater support.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54552" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-cla45-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-cla45-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-cla45-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Even the moderately powered CLA250 produces responsive performance, though power reaches the wheels somewhat fitfully, rather than in a smooth flow. These agitated reactions can be disconcerting in daily drives.</p>, <p>Takeoffs are sufficiently smooth. Although the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission strives to restrain the nervous engine, shifts into upper gears occur too quickly. At least, paddle shifters let the driver shift manually, if desired, using steering-wheel actuators.</p>, <p>Helped by sharp, agreeably responsive steering, the CLA250 handles with respectable prowess. Steering demands some effort, but the result is a surefooted road experience, with tires effectively planted on the pavement. Lifting one’s foot off the gas pedal primes the brake system, helping to bring the CLA250 to a quick, positive halt. All-wheel drive, dubbed 4Matic and optional on the CLA250, can transfer up to half of power output to the back wheels when needed.</p>, <p>Unless it’s equipped with the optional adjustable suspension, the ride is less than comfortable. In fact, it can be stiff, even punitive. The adjustable suspension is standard on the AMG CLA45 version.</p>, <p>As expected, the AMG CLA45 edition raises the performance quotient sharply. Because power output from a relatively small engine is so strong, acceleration approaches fierce levels. Larger-diameter anti-roll bars help boost the top model’s handling talents. As a result, the CLA45 is fully track-ready, for drivers who lean in the motorsports direction.</p>, <p>Fuel economy ranks close to smaller luxury-car competitors. With front-drive, the CLA250 is EPA-rated at 24/37 mpg City/Highway, or 29 mpg Combined. All-wheel drive lowers the estimate to 24/32 mpg City/Highway, or 27 mpg Combined. The CLA45 earns a rating of 23/30/26 mpg. A stop-start system is standard, but shutting off the engine is accompanied by a modest shudder, and it sometimes restarts at stoplights with a longer red light.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz CLA offers sleek styling, and the CLA250 is the brand’s least expensive model. The rear seat is tight, the CLA250 drivetrain needs some refinement and ride quality can be stiff. Tempting options are available but raise the price swiftly, while competitors offer more features standard.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Aaron Cole, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>With a history dating back nearly half a century, the Toyota Corolla has been almost synonymous with the term compact car. Little has changed on the sedan for the 2018 model year, except for cancellation of last year’s 50th-anniversary special edition. All 2018 Corolla models get lighted vanity mirrors, while 2018 Corolla XLE and 2018 Corolla SE gain a leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>, <p>Corolla added a new model for 2017: the Corolla iM hatchback. Sharing little more than the model name, Corolla iM began life in 2016 as a member of the Scion family. When Toyota’s Scion division disappeared, prior to the 2017 model year, the iM became part of the regular Toyota lineup. Basically, the iM is a five-door hatchback, developed for European sale, with its own interior layout and a more sophisticated suspension. As a hatch, the iM represents a small fraction of Corolla sales in the U.S. (To learn more about the iM, see our 2016 Scion iM review.) In the iM hatchback, Toyota’s 1.8-liter engine produces 137 horsepower and 126 pound-feet. A single trim level is offered, with the choice of CVT or 6-speed manual shift.</p>, <p>Corolla sedans come in six trim levels: L, LE, LE Eco, XLE, SE, and XSE. Each holds a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. The LE Eco is an exception. Tuned for fuel-efficiency, with special valve timing, its engine is rated higher than the regular version, at 140 horsepower. Like other current Toyota products, the Corolla gets an impressive collection of safety features as standard equipment.</p>, <p>Most Corolla sedans are fitted with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). A 6-speed manual gearbox is available only for the SE sedan.</p>, <p>Corollas might be short on personality, ranking as average all around. But they’re refined in demeanor and fully capable of delivering common-sense satisfaction.</p>, <p>Not only do both body styles earn high scores for efficiency and comfort, they’ve earned admirable crash-test scores. Strong crashworthiness and superior standard safety equipment combine to make a compelling case for Corolla ownership.</p>, <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the 2017 sedan a Top Safety Pick+. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave it five stars overall, with a four-star rating for frontal collision and four stars for rollover (a calculated score).</p>, <p>Every Corolla comes with LED headlights, automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and automatic high beams. Sedans also contain adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>All Corolla models are sedans except the iM five-door hatch. All come with front-wheel drive. All come with 1.8-liter four-cylinder engines, though tuning varies. Most come with a continuously variable transmission, though a manual is available for the Corolla SE and iM hatch.</p>, <p>Corolla L ($18,500) includes the CVT, 6.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system, rearview camera, air conditioning, adaptive cruise control, power windows/locks, and Bluetooth. (All prices are MSRP and do not include destination charge.)</p>, <p>Corolla LE ($18,935) adds automatic climate control, an integrated rear armrest, 3.5-inch TFT screen, and keyless entry. Options include a moonroof and a navigation app or smartphones.</p>, <p>Corolla LE Eco ($19,335) has a specially tuned engine and low-rolling-resistance tires.</p>, <p>Corolla SE ($20,445) comes with a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leatherette/fabric seat upholstery, and alloy wheels. Corolla SE is also available with a manual gearbox and 7.0-inch infotainment screen ($21,665).</p>, <p>Corolla XLE sedan ($21,825) includes a power driver’s seat, heated front seats, and proximity key.</p>, <p>Corolla XSE sedan ($22,680) differs from XLE in exterior design and upholstery.</p>, <p>A full, integrated navigation system is optional on XLE and XSE.</p>, <p>iM hatchback comes with manual gearbox ($18,750) or CVT ($19,490) and includes a 7.0-inch screen, Pioneer-branded audio, rearview camera, and 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54537" height="137" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-rear.jpg" width="200"/>To many eyes, Corollas have a long history of uninspired appearance. That hasn’t kept tens of millions of motorists from driving one home. A bit awkward-looking overall, sedans have an uncommonly high ride height, with 6.7-inch ground clearance.</p>, <p>Corolla L and LE trim levels possess few decorative elements, and plastic hubcaps cover their steel wheels. Corolla SE and XSE models step up to alloy wheels.</p>, <p>More expressive styling is the province of the newer iM hatchback. In addition to a rather long roofline atop a bigger greenhouse, the iM benefits from details that impact a Eurostyle aura.</p>, <p>Comfortable seats, front and rear, highlight the Corolla sedan’s spacious cabin. Moderately bolstered, the front seats provide good support.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54536" height="133" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-interior.jpg" width="90"/>Legroom is good in the rear seat. Three passengers fit back there, but they’ll probably start to feel squeezed on a longer journey.</p>, <p>Despite a generally pleasing ambiance, nothing can be called luxurious within a Corolla, which contains an abundance of shiny plastic trim. Still, seat materials in most Corollas are attractive. Each Corolla has a height-adjustable driver’s seat, which is power-adjustable on top models. Synthetic leather used in upper models doesn’t feel real, but it doesn’t have to and should wear well.</p>, <p>All controls on the nearly-vertical dashboard are logical and easy to use. Contrasting stitching crosses the dashboard’s edges.</p>, <p>Though its dashboard is almost identical to the one in Corolla sedans, the iM’s infotainment system isn’t as neatly integrated into its surroundings.</p>, <p>Like its appearance, the performance of a Corolla ranks as average in every area. Handling with confidence, the Corolla provides a safe and sufficient road experience.</p>, <p>Steering feels light, providing minimal feedback from the pavement, but that’s hardly uncommon in family-friendly compact sedans. Body lean can become evident when taking corners energetically. The ride is smooth and easygoing, though not remarkably soft or lavish. Sedan suspensions permit considerable wheel travel, which helps absorb bumps and pot holes.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54538" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>Corolla engines exhibit a refined nature. For most owners, that’s more important than brisk responses to the gas pedal. Toyota’s continuously variable transmission tends to keep the engine at higher speeds much of the time, but acceleration is wholly adequate. Sufficient sound-deadening tones down most engine rumbling.</p>, <p>Expect a firmer ride from the iM hatchback, but few trouble spots on the road will jar Corolla passengers.</p>, <p>Fuel economy doesn’t lead the compact-sedan pack, but Corollas qualify as thrifty. EPA estimates for 2018 have not yet been issued, but 2017 figures hover around 30 mpg in combined driving. L and LE sedans with the CVT are EPA-rated at 28/36 mpg City/Highway, or 32 mpg Combined. Upper trim levels are a hair less frugal, due to bigger wheels. Manual shift in the SE earns an EPA rating of 27/35 mpg City/Highway, or 30 mpg Combined. The LE Eco is EPA-rated as high as 30/40/34 mpg.</p>, <p>The Corolla iM is EPA-rated at 27/35 mpg City/Highway, or 30 mpg Combined, with 6-speed manual, rising to 28/36/31 mpg with the CVT.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54534" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-final.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-final.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-corolla-final-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>All Corollas are capable and well-equipped, but no sedan qualifies as a stunning value. Plenty of competitors can match the Corolla’s practical virtues, while offering more character. Even so, a Corolla does it job competently. Only those who crave driving excitement even in a family car are likely to be displeased. Those folks would be advised to look at a Mazda 3 or Honda Civic.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]

[<p>The Volkswagen Atlas, launched as a 2018 model, is a midsize three-row crossover SUV aimed at families and can carry up to seven occupants. Volkswagen has moved into another vehicle category with its new Atlas.</p>, <p>Nearly 200 inches in length, the Volkswagen Atlas is comparatively large for its class. Competitors include the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, and Toyota Highlander. Built in Tennessee, alongside the Passat sedan, the Atlas focuses on the American market. (Volkswagen’s Tiguan and Touareg crossovers are more international in scope.)</p>, <p>We found the Volkswagen Atlas drives beautifully, among the best in its class, with smooth acceleration, stable braking that’s easy to modulate, solid stability at high speeds, comfortable ride, composed, responsive handling.</p>, <p>Three basic trim levels are offered for Atlas: S, SE, and SEL, along with several option packages.</p>, <p>Either a four-cylinder engine or a V6 may be installed. Base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, producing 235 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. The optional 3.6-liter V6 generates 276 horsepower and 266 pound-feet. Those figures fall a bit short of competitive models.</p>, <p>Both engines mate with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, but Volkswagen’s 4Motion all-wheel drive is an option for V6 models. Four-cylinder versions, whose powertrain is used in other Volkswagen vehicles, are front-wheel drive only.</p>, <p>Because of Volkswagen’s scandalous admission to flagrantly modifying turbodiesel-engine software, in order to cheat on emissions testing, diesel power is not part of the Atlas picture.</p>, <p>Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has crash-tested an Atlas as yet. Each Atlas includes six airbags and a rearview camera. A standard after-collision braking system applies and holds the brakes automatically, to prevent the vehicle from moving if it’s hit by another vehicle while stationary. All trim levels above base level feature an upgrade rearview camera, which incorporates dynamic guidelines to ease parking.</p>, <p>Additional safety technology is available for all but the base S model. For an additional $2,100, the SE edition may be equipped with a Technology Package that adds automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, and an automatic-dimming mirror. Those safety features are standard with SEL trim.</p>, <p>The Stop/Start system, standard, can shut off the engine at traffic lights, to save a bit of fuel and reduce emissions.</p>, <p>Comparatively slim roof pillars help provide good visibility, whether over-the-shoulder or rearward. Headrests may be positioned low when not in use, so they don’t impede the view.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54526" height="114" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-atlas-final.jpg" width="200"/>Atlas 2.0T S ($30,500), the base model, has the four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. Cloth-upholstered seats, a rearview camera, 6.5-inch touchscreen, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity are standard. So are six-speaker audio, LED headlights, and power windows/locks.</p>, <p>Atlas 3.6L V6 S ($31,900) substitutes the 3.6-liter V6 engine. (Prices are MSRP and do not include $925 destination charge.)</p>, <p>4Motion all-wheel drive ($1,800) is available for all V6 versions.</p>, <p>Atlas 2.0T SE ($33,590) adds leatherette upholstery, an 8.0-inch screen, automatic headlights, rain-sensing wipers, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, and a power driver’s seat. Atlas 3.6L V6 SE ($34,900) contains the V6.</p>, <p>Atlas 3.6L V6 Launch Edition ($33,500) adds a panoramic moonroof, satellite radio, and footwell lighting.</p>, <p>Atlas 2.0T SE w/Technology Package ($35,690) includes automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and auto-dimming mirror. Atlas 3.6L V6 SE w/Technology ($37,090) substitutes V6 engine.</p>, <p>Atlas 2.0T SEL ($39,160) gets a panoramic moonroof, power tailgate, power passenger seat, driver’s seat memory, front/rear park-distance control, and automatic emergency braking. Atlas 3.6L V6 SEL ($40,890) substitutes V6 power.</p>, <p>Atlas 3.6L V6 SEL Premium ($48,490) has V6 and all-wheel drive, along with leather upholstery, navigation, power-folding mirrors, heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, Fender audio, surround-view camera, and 20-inch wheels. A 12.3-inch screen replaces the regular instrument cluster.</p>, <p>Optional captain’s chairs can replace the three-seat rear bench in SE and SEL models.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54528" height="116" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-atlas-rear.jpg" width="200"/>Wide, flared fenders and modestly angular design elements might suggest the top Jeep SUV. With its overall conservative appearance, however, the Atlas is closer to Volkswagen’s two-row Touareg model, despite the latter’s more European look.</p>, <p>Some muscular details are evident, coupled with a wide stance, yet the Atlas tends to look a little smaller than its actual dimensions would imply. Every Atlas has full LED headlights flanking a wide grille, while LED taillights are optional.</p>, <p>Conservative design extends into the cabin, which combines clean lines with logical layout. The driver’s compartment might lack pizzazz, but everything is easy to use and intuitive. The cabin is impressively spacious and versatile, functional and easy to use.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54530" height="117" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-atlas-interior.jpg" width="200"/>Compared to nearly every rival, the Atlas cabin seems low-budget, however. Even the top model (SEL Premium) gets curious-looking simulated wood, while its leather upholstery looks more like vinyl. Some of the plastic trim looks mediocre. Volkswagen interior used to be among the best, but cost-cutting to make pricing more competitive is evident.</p>, <p>Standing out on the dashboard, Volkswagen’s Car-Net infotainment system works with an 8.0-inch screen. Unfortunately, its glass tends to highlight fingerprints. SEL Premium trim gets a full LCD instrument cluster, shunning conventional gauges.</p>, <p>All three seating rows promise stretch-out space. Large front seats give the driver and passenger good leg support, helped by an uncommonly long cushion.</p>, <p>Even the third row is relatively roomy. Capable of transporting average-size adults, that rearmost seat warrants best-in-class honors, though its cushion sits rather low.</p>, <p>The second-row bench slides fore/aft, to ease access to the rear compartment. Optional captain’s chairs can replace the three-place bench, reducing capacity from seven passengers to six.</p>, <p>Road noise is apparent, but cargo space excels.</p>, <p><img alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-54529" height="133" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" src="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-atlas-driving.jpg" srcset="https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-atlas-driving.jpg 200w, https://images.newcartestdrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018-atlas-driving-145x95.jpg 145w" width="200"/>On the road, an Atlas feels lighter than expected for a vehicle of its size and weight. Even with optional 20-inch tires mounted, occupants can anticipate a soft ride. Untroubled by undulating pavement, the fully independent suspension absorbs bumps capably and confidently.</p>, <p>Feeling like a smaller vehicle, the Atlas ranks among class leaders for roadgoing behavior. When pushed assertively into a curve or corner, this crossover remains composed and refined.</p>, <p>Though far from frugal by today’s fuel-efficiency standards, the smooth, near-silent V6 is both muscular and refined. With several passengers aboard a 4,500-pound vehicle, acceptable acceleration even with the V6 may require hearty stabs at the gas pedal.</p>, <p>Steering can be adjusted for a heavier feel, while the transmission may be altered to downshift quicker. Despite 8-inch ground clearance, the Atlas is not intended for more than the mildest off-road treks. Also, the tires don’t grip well in slippery mud on unpaved roads. With a factory towing package, an Atlas is rated to haul 5,000 pounds.</p>, <p>Fuel economy with V6 power ranks with the worst-in-class. The all-wheel-drive Atlas EPA-rated at 17/23 mpg City/Highway, or 19 mpg Combined. Front-drive raises that estimate to 18/25/20 mpg. Estimates are not yet available for the four-cylinder engine.</p>, <p>The Volkswagen Atlas drives very well and is long on utility. The interior appears low-budget, however. Though costly, Atlas excels in available technology. Best choice may be the Atlas SE with Technology Package, which includes several valuable safety features. Buyers also get an excellent warranty.</p>, <p>Driving impressions by Andrew Ganz, The Car Connection. James M. Flammang contributed to this report.</p>]
