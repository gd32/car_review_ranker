[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Surprisingly hospitable rear seat; competitive pricing; good range of available luxury and safety features; improved quietness; nice ride/handling balance</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Only one powertrain available; cabin ambiance and materials a bit drab for the class; engine occasionally feels coarse to some testers</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Acura ILX gains a Special Edition package that includes 18-inch wheels and special trim. The ILX is a premium compact sedan that is positioned between regular compact cars and the majority of premium compacts. A 201-horsepower 2.4-liter cylinder engine paired with an 8-speed automated-manual transmission is the sole powertrain. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot alert, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and rear cross-traffic alert. The numerous improvements for 2016 made ILX a more credible contender in its segment. This junior Acura still doesn’t quite match the premium ambiance of some of its class rivals, but competitive pricing and a long list of desirable available features make it a worthwhile choice.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After last year’s refresh, the Acura MDX is little changed for 2018. The touchscreen control system has been revised and has a 30% faster response time. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard. The Acura MDX is a premium midsize crossover SUV with three rows of seating. The 3.5-liter V6 has a fuel-saving automatic start/stop feature in topline Advance models and is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive are available. The Sport Hybrid is powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automated-manual transmission with an integrated electric motor powering the front wheels; a Twin Motor Unit with two electric motors powers the rear wheels. Total horsepower output is 321, an increase of 31 hp over the regular MDX. Available features include lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control with low-speed-follow functionality, and a collision-mitigating automatic emergency braking system. The MDX is an exceptionally well-balanced premium midsize SUV. The cabin is quiet and refined, and the driving character is surprisingly sporty for a vehicle of this size. Rear-seat room and comfort are not outstanding. Still, this Acura deserves a top spot on your shopping list. Topline versions are quite pricey, but the Base and Technology models deliver lots of safety, convenience, and luxury features at reasonable-for-the-class prices. The Sport Hybrid model offers a real improvement in fuel economy.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Acura RDX is unchanged. Acura RDX is a premium compact crossover SUV powered by a 279-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning and mitigation, LED headlights, and surround-view cameras. The RDX might not lead the premium-compact SUV class in any one area, but this is a vehicle that does just about everything well. A refined drivetrain, tossable handling, and a roomy, well-appointed cabin are its biggest strengths. Weaknesses include mediocre fuel economy, and a control interface that could do with less button clutter. RDX more than makes up for these shortcomings by offering lots of comfort, convenience, and safety features at reasonable-for-the-class prices. Value-conscious luxury buyers would do well to put this Acura at the top of their shopping lists.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Acura TLX has freshened styling with a new grille. Newly standard features include Apple Carplay/Android Auto and the AcuraWatch suite of safety and convenience features that include forward collision warning and mitigation, lane-departure warning and mitigation, lane-keep assist, and adaptive cruise control. A-Spec is a new model with unique interior and exterior trim. The TLX is a sporty midsize sedan that’s available with 4-cylinder or V6 power. The 206-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder comes standard with an 8-speed dual-clutch automated manual transmission, while the 290-hp 3.5-liter V6 uses a 9-speed automatic (a manual gearbox is not offered). All-wheel drive is available on V6 models. Highlights of the TLX’s available features include forward collision warning, lane-keep assist, remote engine start, adaptive cruise control, heated rear seats, wireless cell-phone charging, 360-degree Surround View camera system, and Acura’s Precision All-Wheel Steer system (P-AWS), which is standard on front-drive TLXs. The TLX’s compact-yet-spacious dimensions, athletic driving character, convincingly luxurious ambiance, competitive prices, and impressive array of available tech and safety features make it a compelling premium-midsize-car choice.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/alfa-romeo/giulia/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> High performance; Italian style; wide range of available safety features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Control-interface quirks; reliability not yet established; few dealers</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia gains newly available Apple CarPlay and Android capability. Forward collision warning is now standard on Quadrifoglio. The Alfa Romeo Giulia sedan is a BMW 3-Series challenger, that’s available in high-performance Quadrifoglio trim with a 505-hp turbo V6 or in tamer turbocharged 4-cylinder models. The premium compact sedan has standard rear-wheel drive, but also offers all-wheel drive. Quadrifoglio packs a Ferrari-derived twin-turbo 2.9-liter V6 engine that is paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Alfa Romeo claims a 0-60 time of 3.8 seconds and a top speed of 191 mph. Cylinder deactivation and engine start/stop help fuel economy. The turbo four is a 2.0-liter unit that develops 280 horsepower and is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Available high-performance features include an active-aero front splitter, which adjusts the carbon-fiber front spoiler for optimal aerodynamics and downforce; adaptive damping suspension; a torque vectoring differential that optimizes torque to each wheel separately; Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes; and Alfa DNA Pro drive mode selector, which modifies dynamic behavior among Dynamic, Natural. Advanced Efficiency, and Race settings. Available safety features include forward-collision warning, automatic braking, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and bi-xenon headlamps with adaptive cornering and washers. The Alfa Romeo Giulia brings Italian style and performance into the highly competitive premium compact market.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/alfa-romeo/stelvio/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sporty character, crisp handling; cargo versatility; competitive pricing</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Non-linear throttle response; complicated control layout; so-so passenger room; unproven reliability of Alfa Romeo brand</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a new-for-2018 premium compact crossover SUV that shares a platform with the Alfa Romeo Giulia sedan. Initially, the Stelvio’s sole powertrain is a 280-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A Quadrifoglio model with a 505-hp turbo V6 is expected later in the model year. The Stelvio’s available safety features include adaptive forward collision warning and mitigation with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. Other available features include a hands-free power liftgate, bi-xenon headlights, 360-degree camera, and adaptive cruise control. With its agile handling and quick steering, the Stelvio is one of the sportier premium compact SUVs on the market. The interior is nicely finished in upscale materials, and the cargo area is competitive with most premium compact SUV rivals. And even when extra-cost options are added, Stelvio pricing compares favorably to its primary competitors. The Alfa Romeo brand doesn’t have an established reputation for quality and reliability in the U.S., but the Stelvio’s distinctive Italian character and other assets should attract shoppers looking for a performance-focused luxury SUV that’s a bit off the beaten path.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/audi/allroad/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unique, compelling mix of passenger-car and SUV traits; high-quality materials and assembly inside and out; nicely balanced steering and handling</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Some testers find Audi’s MMI system complicated and frustrating to use</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After its redesign last year, the 2018 Audi allroad is essentially unchanged with only some equipment changes. Adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist are now standard on the topline Prestige model. Audi’s SUV-esque all-wheel-drive compact station wagon is based on Audi’s A4 compact sedan, which was also redesigned last year. Audi markets the allroad as an SUV, but we categorize it as a premium compact car because it is essentially an A4 wagon with a raised ride height and rugged-looking body cladding. The sole powertrain is a 252-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed automated-manual transmission. Available features include xenon headlights, head-up instrument display, “virtual cockpit” instrument panel, tri-zone automatic climate controls, and adaptive cruise control. Available safety features include forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, and a 360-degree camera system. In a market that favors crossovers and SUVs, the Audi allroad wagon has little direct competition in the premium-compact-car category. It’s an intriguing fusion of SUV/crossover attributes applied to a traditional passenger-car-based station wagon. The allroad has satisfying acceleration, athletic handling, and a comfortable, classy interior. Add to that all-weather versatility and a bit of mild off-roading ability, and Audi’s genre-bending compact wagon becomes a nice alternative to a premium-compact SUV.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/audi/tt/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Invigorating performance and all-wheel-drive handling; good fuel economy for a high-end sporty car; impressive cabin design and assembly quality</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Traditional manual transmission is unavailable; no rear seat in convertible and cramped rear seat in coupe; limited cargo room; stiff ride</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Audi TT gains a new model. The high-performance TT RS is the most powerful of the TT series with a 400-horsepower turbocharged 2.5-liter 5-cylinder engine paired with a 7-speed automated-manual transmission. The base 2.0T TT gains standard parking sensors. There is also a new S line package that includes sport suspension and unique exterior and interior trim. TT comes as a 2+2 hatchback coupe or a 2-seat convertible. The stylish interior is highlighted by a “virtual cockpit” gauge cluster; it packs speedometer, tachometer, infotainment, navigation, vital stats, etc. into one 12.3-inch configurable screen. Standard features include heated mirrors, an adaptive rear spoiler, keyless entry and ignition, and parking sensors. An optional Technology package adds features such as a navigation system, Apple CarPlay interface, blind-spot monitor, and rearview camera. The Audi 2.0T TT coupe and roadster are powered by a 220-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder; the higher-performance TTS model comes only as a coupe and boasts 292 hp from its turbo 2.0 four. 2.0T and TTS use a 6-speed automated manual transmission; a traditional manual is not offered. The Audi TT continues to offer one-of-a-kind looks while upping the level of technology and refinement. Though base models aren’t quite as quick or agile as a Porsche Cayman or Boxster, they offer true sports-car satisfaction for significantly less money than those rivals.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/buick/cascada/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Competitive pricing; distinctive styling; generous list of standard features; quiet cabin; stout-for-a-convertible body structure provides smooth ride and capable handling</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Stingy back-seat space; poor rear visibility when top is up; limited trunk capacity when top is down; might not be quick enough for some convertible shoppers</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Buick Cascada is unchanged. Cascada is a compact-sized 2-door convertible that we include in our Sporty/Performance Car category. The Cascada is based on a model from GM’s former European Opel division and offers seating for four (though it’s billed as “2+2” seating, as the back seat area is pretty tight for adults). The sole engine offering is a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 200 horsepower and is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Cascada’s convertible top comes only as a soft top; a retractable hardtop is not available. Available safety features include forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning. The stylish Cascada capably fills an important niche in the droptop marketplace. It’s not as overtly sporty as a Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro convertible, and it’s significantly cheaper than an Audi A3 or BMW 228i. It may not be as quick and agile as those rivals (or as refined as the Audi and BMW), but Cascada nonetheless delivers a compelling mix of fun-in-the-sun style, practicality, and affordability.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/buick/enclave/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Quiet cabin offers more room than most class competitors; smooth ride quality with good driving dynamics for such a large vehicle</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Interior materials not as luxurious as the best in the premium midsize SUV class; some testers dislike unconventional operation of gearshift lever; tilt-and-slide second-row seat is offered only on passenger side of vehicle; optioned-up top-line models are pricey</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Buick’s seven-passenger midsize SUV is redesigned for 2018, gaining new styling, improved interior space, and a host of new comfort and technology features. Base 1SV, Essence, Premium, and top-line Avenir trim levels are available; all have a 302-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 that is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. The base model is front-wheel drive only; the others offer a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Maximum towing capacity is 5000 pounds.</p>, <p>Standard equipment includes a rearview camera, rear park assist, keyless entry and starting, six USB ports, hands-free power liftgate, universal home remote, OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot capability, and tri-zone automatic climate control. A frameless touchscreen infotainment system comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, GM’s Teen Driver monitoring system, and a Rear Seat Reminder feature that reminds the driver to check the back seats when exiting the vehicle. Forward collision alert, rear cross traffic alert, lane keep assist with lane departure warning, safety alert seat, following distance indicator, and front park assist are among the available safety features. Available comfort and convenience features include a 10-speaker Bose Premium sound system, power-folding third-row seat, and a second-row SmartSlide seat that tilts and slides forward (even with an empty child seat installed) for easier access to the third row. Like its less-luxurious cousin, the Chevrolet Traverse, the Buick Enclave is one of the largest midsize three-row SUVs around, and it offers outstanding passenger and cargo room as a result. Even in top-line Avenir trim, the Enclave isn’t as luxurious inside or as polished to drive as the top European and Japanese rivals, but it’s more spacious than most everything else in its class.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/buick/encore/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unique upscale character; close-quarters maneuverability; ride quality and noise levels are impressive considering the small size</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Cramped rear-seat space; limited cargo room; so-so acceleration with base engine</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Buick Encore gains an ionizing interior air filter, HD radio , and a capless fuel filler. Encore is a subcompact crossover SUV with seating for five. Two turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engines are offered. The base engine has 138 horsepower, while the optional motor has 154 hp. Both are paired with a six-automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. Available convenience features include heated steering wheel, keyless access and starting, and rain-sensing wipers. Available safety features include forward-collision warning, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-departure warning. Encore delivers surprisingly good ride quality and Buick’s characteristic hushed cabin. For some shoppers, the vehicle’s small size and tall driving position will be real strengths. However, the small dimensions limit Encore’s cargo versatility and rear seat space, especially among similarly priced competitors. Encore is an unusual vehicle that’s quite compelling–if the benefits of its small size are more important to you than the compromises that are also part of the package.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/buick/envision/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Spacious-for-the-class interior; comfortable ride; quiet cabin</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some rivals are sportier; top-line trim levels are pricey; rear headroom tight with optional panoramic sunroof</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Buick Envision is unchanged. Envision is Buick’s built-in-China, premium-compact-crossover SUV. Premium models come standard with a 252-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder; the others are powered by a 197-horsepower 2.5-liter four. Both engines come standard with a 6-speed automatic transmission and fuel-saving auto stop/start technology. The base 1SV model is front-wheel drive only, while the Preferred and Essence are available with front-wheel drive or AWD. Premium models are exclusively AWD. Regardless of trim level, the Envision seats five and has a roomy interior for its class, with a sliding rear seat for greater passenger/cargo room flexibility. A panoramic moonroof, head-up display, heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, heated outboard rear seats, and a hands-free liftgate are among the available features. Available safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alert, lane-keep assist, forward-collision alert with front automatic braking, and a surround-view camera. We wish the peppy turbocharged engine wasn’t restricted to the top trim levels and all-wheel drive. Still, if you’re in the market for an upscale SUV with an understated look and a relaxed driving demeanor, it’s worth your time to check out the Envision.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Buick LaCrosse gains a new base powertrain. Standard power for LaCrosse is GM’s eAssist system that combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine with a compact electric motor for a total of 194 horsepower. The 3.6-liter V6 engine returns with horsepower increased slightly to 310. The V6 is paired with a new nine-speed automatic transmission that replaces an eight-speed auto. All-wheel drive is newly available with Essence trim. The model lineup ascends through Base, Preferred, Essence, and Premium trim levels. Available features include an adaptive suspension system, massaging front seats, wireless phone charging, and power-adjustable steering wheel. Available safety features include forward collision warning and intervention with pedestrian detection, blind-spot alert, lane-departure warning, lane-change alert, lane-keep assist, and rear cross-path detection. The recently redesigned Buick LaCrosse improves on its predecessor in pretty much every way, offering more interior and cargo room, desirable new technology features, and handsome new styling. When properly equipped, it also delivers a surprisingly nimble driving character that’s sportier than you’d expect from a big Buick sedan. The new LaCrosse has moved upmarket from its predecessor, and the prices have risen accordingly—but this classy, comfortable, and confident big sedan justifies its cost.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/buick/regal/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cargo versatility of hatchback-sedan body style; satisfying acceleration, especially with GS model; available all-wheel drive</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Base engine’s eight-speed transmission occasionally feels clunky; some so-so interior materials</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Buick redesigns—and repositions—its midsize-car lineup for 2018. The Regal’s traditional four-door-sedan body style is dropped; in its place are an SUV-flavored four-door wagon named Regal TourX (reviewed separately) and a four-door hatchback sedan called Regal Sportback—both are slightly larger than the outgoing sedan. The hatchback design provides a bit more cargo versatility than a traditional four-door sedan—with the split-folding rear seats in place, the Regal Sportback offers 31.5 cubic feet of cargo space (more than double the capacity of the outgoing Regal sedan), and that number grows to 60.7 cu. ft. with the rear seats folded. Base, Preferred, Preferred II, and Essence trim levels are available, all of which are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that makes 250 horsepower and is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The base and Preferred models are offered solely with front-wheel drive; Preferred II and Essence are available with FWD or AWD. A performance-oriented GS model is also available; it comes standard with AWD and a 310-hp 3.6-liter V6 paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Unique body-styling elements, Continuous Damping Control adaptive sport suspension, Brembo brakes, and a flat-bottomed steering wheel are other GS-exclusive touches, as are sport front seats with adjustable bolsters and heating/cooling/massage functions. Standard features on all Regal Sportbacks include heated mirrors, keyless entry and starting, and a touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity. Available features include a navigation system, dual-zone climate control, and heated front seats and steering wheel. Available safety features include front and rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning and intervention, and blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alert. The 2018 Buick Regal Sportback is one of a growing number of hatchback sedan offerings in the premium compact and midsize car segments; it joins the Audi A5 Sportback, Audi A7, BMW 4-Series Gran Coupe, and Kia Stinger. The Regal Sportback is notably cheaper than those rivals, but at any of its price points it offers commendable levels of performance and luxury, and a generous roster of standard and available features.</p>]

The traditional station wagon lives on in the Buick Regal TourX—sort of. The TourX is similar in concept to SUV-styled passenger-car wagons such as the Subaru Outback, Audi A4 allroad, and Volvo V60 Cross Country. Though some of its add-on trim pieces seem a bit contrived, the Regal TourX nevertheless offers better cargo versatility than the typical midsize car, and a more-engaging driving personality than the typical midsize SUV.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Cadillac ATS has a new generation of Cadillac’s Cue operating system that is said to be more intuitive. There is also an available heated front seat and steering wheel combination that can automatically turn on and off the heat based on interior temperature. ATS is a premium compact car offered in sedan and coupe bodystyles. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot alert, wireless cell-phone charging, power tilt/telescopic steering wheel, and Magnetic Ride Control. The ATS is a dynamically impressive car that stacks up very well against its main rivals—namely the BMW 3-Series and 4-Series. It has excellent steering feel, plenty of grip, and pleasing power from the turbocharged 4-cylinder and V6 engines. The ATS-V is a ferocious, race-track-ready machine that packs a twin-turbocharged, 464-horsepower 3.6 V6, performance suspension and brakes, and functional styling touches inside and out. We’re not so impressed with the small rear seat. We also wish the excellent Magnetic Ride Control suspension wasn’t only available on the pricey Premium Performance and ATS-V models. The ATS-V costs a pretty penny, but it can run with some of the best high-performance cars in the world.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Cadillac CTS has the next generation of Cadillac’s CUE control system that is said to be faster and more intuitive. CTS is a premium midsize sedan that seats five. A 268-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four cylinder is the base engine. Two 3.6-liter V6s are available: a 335-hp naturally-aspirated engine and a twin-turbo version with 420 hp in V-Sports. The high-performance CTS-V has a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that’s rated at 640 hp. All engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The four cylinder and naturally-aspirated V6 have automatic engine start/stop. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available for all models except V-Sport and CTS-V. Safety features include forward-collision warning, front and rear automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, blind-spot alert, camera rearview mirror, and surround-view camera. Available luxury features include tri-zone automatic climate controls, adaptive cruise control, heated/ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, heated steering wheel, and rear sunshades. In terms of dynamics, performance, luxury, and feature availability, the CTS is a strong competitor to more established upper-line models in the premium-midsize segment, with a bold design character that stands apart from its European rivals.</p>]

The Escalade is a regally trimmed full-size SUV that comes in regular or extended-length ESV models. All are powered by a 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 and come standard with luxurious features such as a leather-wrapped heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, heated second-row seats, and a power third-row seat that folds flat into the floor. Power-retracting side steps, a rear entertainment system, massaging front seats, and a cooled front center console are among the optional features. Available safety features include lane-departure warning and mitigation, front and rear automatic braking, a camera rearview mirror, and a front-center air bag located in between the driver and front-seat passenger. The Escalade shares its basic design with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon. Properly equipped, the Chevy and GMC cousins are a much better value than the Escalade: They match it in terms of functionality, but not in unabashed luxury and street “presence.” If those two qualities are high on your shopping list, then the Escalade is a must-see.</p>]

Also, there are now extendable sun visors that provide better coverage when the visors are swung to the side. Chevrolet introduced its first mass-market pure-electric car last year. The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV is a subcompact-sized 4-door, 5-passenger hatchback that has an estimated driving range of 238 miles—more than double the range of some electric cars. The only other pure-electric vehicle that currently boasts that kind of range and is similarly priced to the Bolt is the Tesla Model 3. Though supply of more affordable Model 3s is likely to be limited for the foreseeable future. The Bolt EV’s base price is around $30,000 when the maximum federal tax incentive is deducted. The Bolt EV’s 60 kWh lithium-ion battery pack provides the power for a 200-horsepower electric motor. Charging the battery from empty takes roughly nine hours on a Level 2 charger, and more than 60 hours on a Level 1 charger. Chevrolet says that charging via the Bolt’s optional Level 3 charging port can replenish 90 miles of range in about 30 minutes. Base LT and top-line Premier trim levels are offered. The nicely equipped LT comes standard with Chevrolet’s MyLink touchscreen infotainment system, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto functionality, a 4G LTE WiFi hotspot, rearview camera, keyless access and starting, and GM’s Teen Driver Mode monitoring system. LT options include heated front seats and steering wheel, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear obstacle detection. The Premier comes standard with most of the above and adds automatic high-beam headlights, heated rear seats, wireless device charging, lane-departure warning with lane-keep assist, forward collision alert with automatic braking, forward pedestrian detection, and a novel rearview-camera mirror. The Chevrolet Bolt EV’s segment-topping driving range and accessible price point are its headline-grabbing features, but its virtues don’t end there. It’s also surprisingly quick, space-efficient, and available with a fine selection of state-of-the-art technology features. The Bolt EV is a big step in electric-vehicle technology, and for some, it may be the first truly practical electric car.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Surprisingly peppy base engines; strong performance of V8 models; decent ride quality for the class</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Tight rear leg room; small trunk opening with high liftover; poor visibility</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Chevrolet Camaro has few changes. The 1LE package is now available for the super-performance ZL1 model. For the ZL1, the 1LE package includes a carbon-fiber rear wing, suspension upgrades, and other performance mods. Chevy’s sporty/performance coupe and convertible were redesigned for 2016. With its impressive roster of engine choices–a 275-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged four, 335-hp 3.6-liter V6, 455-hp 6.2-liter V8, or 640-hp supercharged 6.2-liter V8–the Camaro can be tailored to a range of sporty-car tastes and budgets. The new-generation Chevrolet Camaro is smaller, lighter, and more technologically advanced than its predecessor, and the addition of the ZL1 bolsters its already sterling performance credentials. Some testers grumble about the Camaro’s low, visibility-impeding roofline (a design characteristic carried over from the previous-gen Camaro) and stingy backseat/trunk space, but those quirks aren’t uncommon in this class. Camaro offers a compelling blend of technology, performance, style, and refinement–in any of its forms, it’s a worthy competitor to the arch-rival Ford Mustang, and a must-see when shopping sporty two-doors.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Chevrolet Colorado gains an available Active Tow feature that uses the rearview camera to help align trailer hook up. Also, the base touchscreen grows from 4.2 inches to seven. Both the Chevrolet Colorado and its upscale cousin, the GMC Canyon, are really more midsize than compact. However, they are notably smaller than the typical full-size pickup, which makes them a bit easier to manage in tight quarters. Gasoline 4-cylinder and V6 engines, and a diesel engine are available, as are extended-cab and crew-cab body styles. A standard cab is not offered. The ZR2 model offers greater off-road capabilities and is the only 4×4 Colorado with full-time four-wheel drive. Available features include forward collision alert, lane-departure warning, locking rear differential, and hill-descent control. The Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon are a shot in the arm to the dwindling compact-pickup segment. They offer up-to-date technology features and all-around refinement. Though pricing on top-line Colorados reaches into the realm of some lesser-equipped full-size pickups, the smaller, more-tractable dimensions should make Colorado a practical alternative for many big-truck intenders.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Chevrolet Corvette is little changed for 2018. Nineteen-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels are now standard, which replace the previously standard18-inch/19-inch wheels. An available Z30 Carbon 65 Edition package celebrates Corvette’s 65<sup>th</sup> anniversary. HD digital radio is newly standard. Chevrolet’s iconic 2-seat sports car comes in coupe and convertible form, in Stingray, Stingray Z51, Grand Sport, and Z06 models. Stingrays are powered by a 455-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 (which has 460 hp with the available dual-mode exhaust system). Grand Sport has the 460-hp version of the base engine. The super-performance Z06 model boasts a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 with 650 horsepower, an upgraded suspension, and lots of exclusive high-performance hardware. Although there are a handful of cars that are quicker than the Corvette, most cost multiples as much. As such, the Corvette makes its mark as a performance bargain. But it’s really much more than that. It’s also a comfortable touring car with luxurious interior, decent cargo space, and all the latest infotainment gizmos.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/chevrolet/cruze/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Roomy front-row accommodations; quiet cabin; comfortable and refined ride; availability of economical diesel engine</p>, <p><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Cons: </strong>Limited rear-seat space; disappointing real-world fuel economy with gasoline engine</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, a diesel engine is available in the Chevrolet Cuze hatchback. Last year, the diesel was only offered in the Cruze sedan. Cruze is a compact car that is sold in sedan and 4-door hatchback bodystyles. The base engine is a turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder that develops 153 horsepower and has engine stop/start. Also available is a thrifty 137-hp turbodiesel 1.6-liter four-cylinder with an EPA-estimated highway mileage of up to 52 mpg. Both engines are offered with a 6-speed manual transmission. The gasoline engine can be paired with a 6-speed automatic trasnmission, while the diesel can be mated to a 9-speed automatic. Available features include forward collision warning, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist, keyless access and starting, heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, wireless cell-phone charging, and automatic high-beam headlights. The Cruze earns praise for being especially refined and comfortable. Though not sporty in any way, Cruze rewards drivers and passengers with a smooth ride, quiet cabin, and plenty of interior room. Sadly, we got nowhere near the fuel economy Cruze’s EPA estimates (gasoline engine) suggest we should have. A shame, as this is otherwise a very compelling compact offering.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/chevrolet/equinox/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generous passenger room for the class; large, versatile cargo space with good small-items storage; good selection of available comfort and safety features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Base engine has only adequate power; some middling interior materials; so-so rearward visibility</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Chevrolet Equinox is redesigned and downsized for 2018, as Chevrolet updates the positioning of its SUV lineup. (The Equinox’s larger sibling, the Chevrolet Traverse, gets a bit larger for 2018, and a new Chevrolet SUV that slots between the Equinox and Traverse will likely be introduced in the near future.) The new Equinox is about four inches shorter and around 400 pounds lighter than the previous generation, which moves it from our midsize SUV class to the compact SUV category—where it now competes more directly against rivals such as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV-4. Initially, the Equinox’s lone powertrain choice is a 170-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Expected later in the model year are a 252-hp 2.0-liter turbo four and a 136-hp 1.6-liter turbodiesel four, both of which are paired with a nine-speed automatic. All Equinoxes are available with front-wheel drive, and all models but the base L are offered with all-wheel drive. Available safety features include forward-collision alert, low-speed automatic braking, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, rear cross traffic alert, and GM’s Teen Driver monitoring feature. A hands-free power liftgate, 360-degree camera display, heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, and automatic high beams are among the available comfort and convenience features. The previous-generation Equinox straddled the line between the compact and midsize SUV classes. The new Equinox’s downsized dimensions and smaller engines provide better fuel economy and a bit more tractability, and passenger and cargo room aren’t seriously compromised. The base 4-cylinder engine delivers only mediocre off-the-line acceleration, but the forthcoming engines should satisfy buyers who want a bit more pep.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Chevrolet Impala has few changes for 2018. All models now have standard keyless access/starting and rearview camera. LT gains standard remote engine start. Impala is a large front-wheel-drive car. The base engine is a 196-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and a 305-hp 3.6-liter V6 is available. Available features include forward-collision warning, rear-cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, and heated/ventilated front seats. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Impala strong points include one of the most powerful V6 engines in the class, good passenger room, a pleasing ride, and a high level of quiet. The availability of a naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine is a class exclusive for shoppers more interested in fuel economy than power. The best value probably comes from the mid-level LT, which, when optioned to the gunwales, still comes in a few hundred dollars below the starting price (with delivery) of a Premier.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/chevrolet/malibu/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Ample power from turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder powertrain; good rear-seat space; nice ride and handling balance</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Steering lacks feel; some high-tech features only available on top trim levels</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Chevrolet Malibu is essentially unchanged for 2018. A 15.8-gallon fuel tank replaces a 13-gallon tank in models with a 1.5-liter turbo engine. The Malibu midsize sedan was redesigned for 2016. Three powertrains are offered, all using 4-cylinder engines. The base engine is a 1.5-liter turbo rated at 163 horsepower, and it’s mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. It includes a stop/start system that aids city fuel economy. Topline Premier has a 2.0-liter turbo rated at 250 horsepower mated to a 9-speed automatic. The Hybrid model has a total system horsepower (gas and electric) of 182, and it carries impressive EPA figures of 49 city/43 highway/46 combined. Available safety features include low-speed automatic braking, front pedestrian braking, lane-keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear seat reminder. Wireless cell-phone charging is available. Ride quality is quite good. Handling is fine, though the steering is very light and almost devoid of feel. Malibu is a strong competitor in the fiercely competitive midsized-sedan market.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, the Chevrolet Silverado’s eAssist hybrid system has wider availability. Sometimes called a “mild” hybrid, eAssist provides additional torque during acceleration via a motor/alternator/generator located on the gasoline engine itself. The eAssist system will not propel the vehicle on electric power alone, but it does provide automatic stop/start capability–and some extra power. Previously only LT models in California were available with eAssist. Now eAssist is available nationwide on both LT and LTZ models. All models now have a standard rearview camera and the tire-pressure monitor now has an audible tire-fill alert. The Silverado is a full size pickup with a choice of three engines: a 285-horsepower 4.3-liter V6, a 355-hp 5.3-liter V8, or a 420-hp 6.2-liter V8. The V6 and most 5.3-liter V8s have a 6-speed automatic transmission. In LTZ Z71 and High Country trims, the 5.3-liter gets an 8-speed automatic. The 5.3-liter with eAssist and 6.2-liter V8s also have the 8-speed automatic. Rear-wheel drive is standard and full-time 4-wheel drive is available. Available features include forward collision alert, low-speed emergency automatic braking, lane-keep assist, hill-descent control, locking rear differential, rear-seat entertainment system, and heated steering wheel. The Silverado benefits from refined, efficient-for-the-class powertrains; lots of in-cab storage areas; and comfortable, quiet crew-cab interiors. It rides well and we like that it doesn’t feel as lumbering as some of its competitors do on the road. Overall, it’s a really nice truck that does most everything pretty well. Silverado lags the Ram 1500 in handling and ride quality (as do all other full-size pickups), but it’s still a Best Buy in this class.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/chevrolet/sonic/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Crisp steering and handling makes for a fun-to-drive character; solid body structure contributes to good ride quality; some rare-for-the-class convenience and technology features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Rear visibility is compromised in hatchback models; so-so fuel economy for the class; tight rear seat, particularly in sedan models</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Chevrolet Sonic is essentially unchanged. The subcompact Sonic is available in sedan and 4-door hatchback bodystyles. The base engine is a 138-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder that is paired with either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. Also available is a turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder that is also rated at 138 hp, but has better EPA fuel-economy numbers and more torque (148 vs. 125). The turbo engine is mated to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. Available features include forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, keyless access and starting, heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and rear park assist. Today’s subcompact cars have come a long way from the cheap-feeling underpowered “econoboxes” of yore, and the Sonic is a great case in point. It boasts a solid, high-quality feel, is fun to drive, and offers many unexpected features. Unimpressive-for-the-class fuel economy is the only significant downfall of this otherwise stellar small car. The subcompact-car class is plenty competitive, but the Sonic has the chops to merit a top place on your shopping list.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> City-friendly minicar dimensions; maneuverability; connectivity/infotainment features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited cargo room</p>]

The petite 4-door hatchback has seating for four. Two versions are offered: conventional LS and LT models and SUV-flavored Activ which adds a 0.4 inch raised ride height, roof rails, and unique trim. An Ecotec 1.4-liter 4-cylinder with 98 horsepower is the sole engine, and is available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT automatic transmission. The EPA estimates the Spark will achieve up to 39 mpg in highway driving. Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning, Side Blind Spot Alert, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot are available features. The Spark is a solid competitor in its segment.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Chevrolet Suburban gains an RST Edition package for LT and Premier models that includes 22-inch wheels and unique trim. The Chevrolet Tahoe offers a 6.2-liter V8 option with RST Edition, but the larger engine is not available for Suburban. LED daytime running lights are now standard on all models. Suburban is Chevrolet’s largest SUV with three rows of seating that can hold up to nine passengers with available front- and second-row bench seats. The 3rd-row seatbacks fold flat into the floor. Designers had to raise the cargo floor to accomplish this, which makes for a higher liftover, but also allows for some handy under-floor storage bins. Suburban shares its basic design with the Chevrolet Tahoe. Suburban is 14 inches longer than the Tahoe in wheelbase and 20 inches longer overall. The extended length gives the Suburban notably better rear cargo room and 3rd-row seat space than its Tahoe sibling. GMC sells versions of the Tahoe and Suburban named Yukon and Yukon XL, respectively. The sole engine is a 5.3-liter V8 with 355 horsepower. Safety features include forward collision alert, low-speed automatic braking, lane-departure warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Some of the new safety features use GM’s Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates to warn the driver of potential obstructions. Interior materials are of high quality, especially on higher-end models. Enhancing the upscale feel are available features such as adaptive cruise control, a power-folding 3rd-row seat, and keyless entry and starting. The very notion of a hulking, V8-powered full-size SUV seems anachronistic to many shoppers these days, but for those who need the power, interior room, and towing capacity that only a large SUV offers, the all-new Suburban is an excellent choice.</p>]

There is also a new Custom Package that can reduce the price of the LS model by deleting the 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seat and substituting less expensive wheels. Tahoe is a large SUV with three rows of seating that can hold up to nine passengers with available front- and second-row bench seats. The 3rd-row seatbacks fold flat into the floor.

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Chevrolet’s midsize crossover SUV is redesigned for 2018. The new Chevrolet Traverse has a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous generation for increased passenger and cargo room, and it is about 400 pounds lighter than before. Traverse has three rows of seats and can carry up to eight passengers. Newly available features include autonomous emergency braking, rearview camera mirror, LED headlights with automatic high beams, and hands-free power liftgate. Other available features include a 360-degree surround-vision camera, lane-keep assist with lane-departure warning, front pedestrian braking, GM’s Teen Driver monitoring system, and a rear-seat reminder feature. The 3.6-liter V6 is now rated at 310 horsepower (up from 281 or 288 hp in the previous-generation Traverse). A 257-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is newly available, but only in the sporty RS model—another new addition for 2018. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission (the V6 previously had a 6-speed automatic). In addition to the exclusive turbo-four engine, the RS has blacked out trim, black 20-inch wheels, and other unique features. The Traverse lineup also gets a new topline model for 2018 named High Country; it has standard all-wheel drive, leather and suede upholstery, power-folding 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seats, and other upscale features. The new Traverse is among the biggest of the midsize crossover SUVs—it offers interior room that rivals some large SUVs. For buyers looking for a roomy SUV with a comprehensive list of safety and convenience features, the Chevrolet Traverse is a must-see.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Chevrolet Trax gains a new Redline Edition for the LT model with 18-inch wheels and unique exterior trim. The Premier trim gains a standard sunroof. The Trax is about 10 inches shorter and 2 inches narrower than the Ford Escape compact SUV. Trax shares its basic design with the Buick Encore, but it has less-luxurious trimmings and a more mainstream feel. The sole powertrain is a 138-horsepower turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine paired with a 6-speed automatic. Trax is offered with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Available safety features include: forward-collision alert, blind-spot alert, lane-departure warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Other available features include keyless access with pushbutton start, along with Apple CarPlay and Andoid Auto compatibility. Trax’s ultra-compact dimensions make for tight rear-seat space and limited cargo versatility compared to larger vehicles. However, Trax also boasts outstanding close-quarters maneuverability and usefully tall driving position that makes it exceptionally easy to drive and park. The subcompact SUV segment is growing fast, and Chevrolet has a compelling entry in the class.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Chevrolet Volt with base LT trim loses its standard leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, but gains optional blind-spot alert and rear cross-traffic alert. Previously, these options were only available on the topline Premier model. A leather-wrapped steering and shift knob are also optional on the LT. Volt is an extended-range electric, compact 4-door hatchback. Electric-only range is 53 miles. With its range-extending gas engine, Volt can go up to 420 miles, thus eliminating the “range anxiety” associated with typical pure-electric cars. Volt has a 149-horsepower electric motor and a 1.5-liter gas engine to support the electric-drive system. Available features include low-speed automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, LED headlights, automatic parking assist, and adaptive cruise control. A center seatbelt in the back seat makes the Volt a 5-passenger car. However, that center seat has no leg room and should be considered emergency seating for short trips. Volt’s combination of electric efficiency combined with the “safety net” of a gasoline-engine backup make it the best answer for folks looking to go green without being constrained by range limitations.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, all Chrysler Pacificas have a standard SafetyTec Group that includes rear parking sensors with automatic stop, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. There is a new base L model that is around $1500 less expensive than last year’s lowest-priced Pacifica. There is also a new Hybrid Touring Plus trim that is about $2000 cheaper than the previous entry-level Hybrid. A new 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot is available and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility is now standard. The rear-seat enterainment system can now stream from Android devices. Chrysler replaced its aged Town &amp; Country minivan with the all-new Pacifica for 2017. (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also sells the Dodge Caravan, which is of the previous-generation minivan design.) Conventional Pacificas are powered by a 287-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission.  A plug-in hybrid model that combines the V6 with two electric motors for a total of 260 horsepower; Chrysler estimates a 30-mile all-electric driving range and up 80 MPGe in city driving. Pacifica’s class-exclusive Stow ‘n Go stowable second-row seats feature an Easy Tilt feature that makes third-row access easier. Max cargo volume checks in at a generous 140.5 cubic feet. Pacifica’s available features include a tri-pane panoramic sunroof; Stow ‘n Vac integrated vacuum cleaner; and a dual-screen rear-seat Bluray/DVD entertainment system complete with a touchpad remote control and aux, USB, and HDMI jacks for each screen. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country had aged to the point of being an also-ran in the minivan segment, but the Pacifica put Chrysler back at the head of the minivan class. Pacifica is surprisingly stylish inside and out, its all-around dynamic performance is class-competitive, and its passenger and cargo versatility is unmatched. Also, the hybrid model delivers a new level of fuel-efficiency to the minivan class. If you’re shopping for a family hauler, the Pacifica should be on your list.</p>]

Dodge also claims a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of 2.3 seconds. Demon is powered by an 840-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter V8. Production is limited to 3000 units for the U.S. and another 300 for Canada. All Challenger models now have standard rearview camera and rear parking sensors. Challenger is an interesting player in the sporty/performance car segment. The big coupe is too big and heavy to be truly agile, but this is still a more-than-capable performance machine. That size does pay dividends in the form of a surprisingly smooth ride and excellent passenger and cargo room. Admittedly, these might not be the first things buyers of these cars put on their wish lists, but this is a good choice if you want something fun that you can also take on a cross-country road trip. Safety features include forward-collision warning, blind-spot alert, and adaptive cruise control. The base engine is a 3.6-liter V6. A 5.7-liter HEMI V8 is the next step up. A 6.4-liter V8 is in “392” models. The ferocious Hellcat model has a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that puts out a jaw-dropping 707 horsepower. Now, Demon ups the performance ante with an 840-hp version of the Hellcat engine and world-beating performance. The 5.7-liter and 6.4-liter V8s, along with Hellcat offer a choice of 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmissions. The Demon and V6 models are only offered with the 8-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is available with the V6. The Demon and Hellcat aren’t cheap, but they’re actually bargains when measured against other ultra-performance cars. There are plenty of sporty coupes that feel more modern and nimble than the Challenger lineup, but few that can match its retro-muscle-car attitude and broad range of performance and appearance options.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/dodge/charger/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Brash muscle-car styling and attitude; lots of unique trim options; value for the dollar; sporty handling for the class; ludicrous performance of SRT Hellcat model</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>V8 fuel economy; acceleration with V6 might not satisfy some buyers attracted by Charger’s muscular looks</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Dodge Charger has a reshuffled model lineup for 2018. The base model is now SXT and all-wheel-drive models are badged GT and GT Plus. All models now have standard rearview camera and rear parking sensors. Charger is a large, rear-wheel drive sedan with seating for five. The standard engine is a 3.6-liter V6 rated at 292 or 300 horsepower. Three V8s are available: a 370-hp 5.7-liter, a 485-hp 6.4liter, and supercharged 6.2-liter in the SRT Hellcat. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic. All-wheel is only available with the V6. Vast passenger room, available all-wheel drive, and solid construction make the Dodge Charger a reasonable choice for buyers who need the room of a large car but don’t want to give up power or performance in the process. Safety features include blind-spot alert, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. The standard V6 engine and smooth 8-speed automatic transmission are a fine team that we think will satisfy the majority of buyers both in terms of acceleration and, surprisingly, fuel economy. Those with the need for speed will find the R/T and SRT models with 5.7-liter or 6.4-liter V8s quite invigorating, though they have a copious thirst for fuel. For high-performance fanatics, Dodge also offers the outrageous SRT Hellcat, a supercar version of the Charger boasting 707 horsepower from a supercharged 6.2-liter V8. Hellcats have an even greater thirst.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Dodge Durango adds a high-performance SRT model with a 475-horsepower 6.4-liter V8 and sport suspension. Dodge says the SRT is capable of accelerating 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds. All models now have a standard rearview camera and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Durango is a large crossover SUV that is available with three rows of seating. The base engine is a 290-hp 3.7-liter V6 and a 360-hp 5.7-liter is also available. All engines, including the SRT 6.4-liter V8, are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive are available on models, except SRT where all-wheel drive is standard. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, blind-spot alert, adaptive cruise control, Wi-Fi hotspot, heated/ventilated front seats, and tri-zone automatic climate controls. The Durango has something for just about every type of large-SUV shopper. The base SXT has a lot of features for the money, while GT and Citadel add worthwhile luxury and convenience items. We’re not especially high on the sporty R/T, but we can see its appeal for those who crave brawny style and high performance. The SRT adds even more performance and useful suspension upgrades.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/dodge/grand-caravan/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Passenger and cargo versatility; affordable base prices</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lackluster handling and road holding; interior trimmings aren’t as upscale as competitive minivans; large turning radius hampers close-quarter maneuverability</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan is unchanged. With the introduction of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, FCA dropped the Chrysler Town &amp; Country. However, Caravan production continues as a low-cost alternative to the more modern and luxurious Pacifica. The Grand Caravan minvan has three rows of seats for up to seven passengers. A 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission is the sole powertrain. Grand Caravan’s durable interior materials and low pricing are appealing in their own rights. Grand Caravan still has excellent cargo flexibility. It might not have the outstanding ride/handling combination of the Honda Odyssey or the Toyota Sienna’s available all-wheel drive, but Grand Caravan might have the best overall balance of the primary attributes that are most attractive to minivan shoppers. Its overall excellence and low price should earn it a spot on your shopping list.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/dodge/journey/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Bargain pricing; peppy, refined V6 powertrain; generous equipment levels; clever, family-friendly storage features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Weak acceleration from 4-cylinder engine; available 19-inch wheels and sport suspension diminish ride quality; thick door and roof pillars compromise rear visibility</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Dodge Journey now has standard 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seats in all models. The Crossroad Plus model has been dropped; otherwise Journey is unchanged. Journey is a midsize crossover SUV. The base engine is a 173-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that is paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. (This is one of the last 4-speed automatics available as manufactures add more speeds to their transmissions for increased efficiency.) A 283-hp 3.6-liter V6 mated to a 6-speed automatic is standard on GTs and all-wheel drive models and is optional on most front-wheel drive models. Journey might not have the overall space and refinement of some of its competitors, but Journey excels in other key areas. Among its strengths are outstanding cargo flexibility, optional built-in child-booster seats, and a quiet cabin. Combine this with aggressive pricing, and Journey is a compelling package for families of most any size.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/c-max/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Nicely finished interior; outstanding headroom; easy entry/exit and good visibility thanks to elevated seating position; surprisingly sporty, nimble handling</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Large turning radius for the size; real-world mpg doesn’t match Toyota Prius; hybrid battery pack cuts into rear cargo space; non-linear brake-pedal feel</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Ford C-Max drops its Energi plug-in version. This small-for-the-class midsize car offers better-than-average passenger room because of its “tall-wagon” body style. The C-Max is a conventional hybrid with 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gas/electric powertrain that puts out 188 horsepower in total. C-Max is front-wheel drive and has a continuously variable transmission. Available features include active park assist, fixed panoramic sunroof, keyless access and starting, and remote engine start. The C-Max is aimed squarely at Toyota’s wildly successful Prius family, and it comes closer than many other hybrids to hitting the mark. Part of its appeal stems from the fact it offers a usefully cubic cargo area along with some neat features such as Ford’s hands-free power tailgate, all at Prius-competitive prices.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/ecosport/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Available connectivity features; multiple configurations for cargo area</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some modern safety features are not available; side-opening tailgate may not suit all buyers; 3-cylinder engine is noisy and somewhat underpowered</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Ford enters the subcompact crossover market with the 2018 EcoSport (pronounced “Echo Sport”). Although the EcoSport is new to the American market, Ford has sold similar versions in global markets for a number of years. The EcoSport is Ford’s smallest SUV, with an overall length that’s 17 inches shorter than the Ford Escape’s. It is unique in its class by having a side-hinged tailgate instead of the typical top-hinged liftgate. Front-wheel-drive EcoSports are powered by a 123-horsepower turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine, while all-wheel-drive versions have a naturally aspirated (non-turbo) 166-hp 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. Both engines have fuel-saving auto start/stop and are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Models ascend through base S, SE, sporty SES, and luxury Titanium; all can be had in all-wheel-drive form. SES comes standard with the 2.0-liter four, all-wheel drive, and sport suspension. Titanium comes with leather upholstery, navigation, and premium sound system. Available technology features include Ford’s SYNC3 infotainment system, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto functionality, and connectivity features via the FordPass mobile app. Blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alert is standard, but forward collision warning/mitigation, lane-departure warning/mitigation, and adaptive cruise control are unavailable. The EcoSport is something of a “placeholder” for Ford; it’s a foreign-market vehicle pressed into service in America until Ford can field a subcompact-SUV competitor that’s been designed from the ground up for U.S. buyers. This pint-sized crossover is not without its charms, but it is missing some safety features, the side-hinged cargo door can be a liability in close quarters, and the 3-cylinder engine is noisy as it strains to provide adequate acceleration. An all-wheel-drive EcoSport is probably your best bet.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/edge/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, spacious cabin; classy interior materials; pleasant road manners; broad selection of excellent powertrains and technology features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Rear visibility hurt by thick roof pillars; higher trim levels get expensive as options are added</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Ford Edge is relatively unchanged. A new Sport Appearance Package with unique trim and 19-inch wheels is available on SEL. Edge is a midsize crossover SUV with seating for five. Trim levels ascend through SE, SEL, Titanium, and performance-oriented Sport models. The base engine is a 2.0-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder with “twin scroll” turbocharger rated at 245 horsepower. Front-wheel-drive models with this engine have automatic start/stop to conserve fuel. Optional is a 3.5-liter V6, rated at 280 horsepower. Sport has a standard 315-hp, 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6. All are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is optional across the board; except Sport where it is standard. Technology features include forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist, active park assist, and a hands-free opening liftgate which opens with a swipe of a foot under the rear bumper. The previous-generation Edge was beginning to feel a bit long in the tooth, but the 2015 redesign brought it fully up to date. Though the “traditional” 5-passenger crossover SUV has been somewhat marginalized by three-row midsize SUVs and a new wave of upsized compact SUVs, the new Ford Edge offers plenty of “just right” appeal.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/escape/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good acceleration with 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine; hands-free power liftgate is a super-handy option; nicely finished interior</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Top-line Titanium models can get quite expensive; disappointing acceleration from 1.5-liter turbo engine</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After its refresh last year, Ford Escape is little changed for 2018. A new SEL model with leather upholstery and power liftgate has been added, while SE and Titanium gain standard equipment. Three engines are offered: a base 168-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, a turbocharged 1.5-liter 4-cylinder with 179 hp, and the topline engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 245 hp. All engines use a 6-speed automatic transmission, and both turbocharged engines offer all-wheel drive and have a fuel-saving automatic stop/start feature. The Sync 3 infotainment system offers a Sync Connect smartphone app, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality. Available safety features include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and brake support, lane-departure mitigation, and driver-fatigue monitor. Escape is smooth, refined, and surprisingly engaging to drive for an SUV. Interiors are comfortable and nicely finished, and cargo space isn’t bad. On the whole, there is a lot about the Escape that’s impressive. Top-line Titanium models can get quite expensive, but we think a modestly equipped SEL hits the sweet spot for performance, features, and value.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/expedition/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent road manners for such a large vehicle, satisfying acceleration, cavernous cabin space for passengers and cargo, 9200-lb towing capacity</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy, maneuverability in tight quarters</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Ford’s full-size SUV is redesigned from the ground up for 2018, gaining an aluminum body structure on a new high-strength-steel frame, a new 10-speed automatic transmission, and a host of new features. As before, regular- and extended-length models are available, but the latter is now called MAX instead of XL. The lone engine is still a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6, but in addition to the 10-speed transmission in place of the previous 6-speed, it gets a bump from 365 horsepower to 375 hp—or 400 hp on the line-topping Platinum model. The second-row seats now tilt and slide forward for easier access to the third row. Available features include a dual-headrest rear-seat entertainment system, panoramic sunroof, hands-free foot-activated liftgate, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, active park assist, wireless device charging, Wi-Fi hotspot, and remote start. Like other full-size SUVs, the Ford Expedition isn’t cheap to buy or cheap operate. However, its excellent redesign for 2018 brings a higher level of all-around refinement and welcome new features, while also improving upon the already-impressive cabin space. If you need the capabilities of a true three-row, body-on-frame SUV, the Ford Expedition should be on your test-drive list.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/explorer/
[<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Broad range of available safety features; impressively quiet cabin; good fuel economy with EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Tight second-row seat; feels a bit cumbersome in close quarters; prices rise quickly as options are added</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Ford Explorer has freshened styling for 2018. Also, a Wi-Fi hotspot is newly available. Ford Explorer is a midsize crossover SUV with three rows of seating. Three engines are offered: a 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, a 280-hp turbocharged 2.3-liter 4-cylinder, and a 365-hp turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Base, XLT, and Limited offer a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Sport and Platinum are exclusively all-wheel drive. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, hill-descent control, hands-free power liftgate, park assist, and automatic high-beam headlights. Explorer is a very nice 7-passenger crossover that unfortunately competes with several other very nice 7-passenger crossovers. This Ford does a good job balancing the rugged attributes of an SUV with the more car-like dynamics expected of today’s crossover vehicles. The same is true for most of its rivals though, and they often cost less.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/fiesta/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Invigorating performance of ST model; good ride quality for a subcompact; all versions have a nimble, fun-to-drive character</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Limited passenger and cargo room; unconventional control layout; occasionally clunky performance from automated-manual transmission</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Ford Fiesta gains a standard rearview camera for all models and drops its optional turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine. Otherwise, Fiesta is unchanged. The Fiesta is a front-wheel-drive subcompact offered in both sedan and four-door hatchback bodystyles. Fiesta’s standard engine is a 120-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder that mates to a five-speed manual or six-speed automated-manual transmission. Standard on the sporty ST model is a 197-hp turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder with a six-speed manual transmission. Ford touts Fiesta as sporty, upscale subcompact, and we mostly agree. Fuel economy with the base engine has been terrific in our tests, but we prefer the slick 5-speed manual to the PowerShift 6-speed automated manual. The delightful ST model delivers high-performance driving thrills with little compromise in day-to-day practicality, save for a stiffer ride and confining front bucket seats. Fiesta’s greatest weakness has been its relatively cramped passenger and cargo accommodations. While it isn’t our favorite subcompact, Fiesta is worthy of consideration.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/flex/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Robust acceleration with available EcoBoost engine; Impressive passenger and cargo room, especially in the 3rd row</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Middling fuel economy; polarizing styling; prices get steep on higher-end models</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says: </strong>The 2018 Ford Flex is relatively unchanged. The two-tone roof and rear-seat entertainment options have been dropped. Ford Flex is a midsize crossover SUV with three rows of seats that can seat up to seven passengers. The base engine is a 3.5-liter V6 with 287 horsepower. A 365-hp turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 is available. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available on all trims except base SE. Available features include adaptive cruise control, collision warning and mitigation, heated/cooled front seats, blind-spot alert, and park assist. A spacious interior and generous cargo hold are some of this crossover SUV’s best features. We also like Flex’s refined nature and good handling. A downside is that some desirable features are only offered on the most expensive models. While Flex’s boxy styling may not appeal to everyone, this large, comfortable people mover deserves consideration.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/focus/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Acceleration in ST and RS models; sporty driving character; high-quality interior trim; impressive fuel economy</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Tight rear-seat space; higher-end models get quite pricey; not all drivers like behavior of automated-manual transmission</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Ford Focus is unchanged for 2018. The Focus is available as either a four-door sedan or a four-door hatchback, in trims ranging from base S to well-equipped Titanium. There is also a sporty ST model and a high-performance RS–both of which are hatchback only. All Focuses are front-wheel drive except the all-wheel-drive RS. The base engine is a 160-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder that is paired with a five-speed manual or six-speed automated-manual transmission. Also available is a fuel-efficient 123-hp turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine that mates to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. The ST has a 252-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and the RS packs a 350-horsepower 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. A six-speed manual is the only transmission choice for both ST and RS. (Ford also sells an electric version of the Focus at select dealers, see separate report.) Available equipment includes active park assist, heated steering wheel, blind-spot alert, lane-departure mitigation, and cross-traffic alert. Focus is a sporty, fun-to-drive compact that can be ordered with some unexpected high-end equipment. We like the manual transmission more than the automated manual. Focus prices range from class-competitive to surprisingly expensive for loaded Titanium models. The ST promises lots of muscle, but we were a bit disappointed in the front-drive car’s ability to get it to the road. The AWD RS is a ferocious performance machine with formidable capabilities, but its uncompromising nature and steep price tag make it a vehicle for serious enthusiasts. In any of its forms, the Focus doesn’t quite top its class, but it is still worth your consideration.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/focus-electric/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Surprisingly fun to drive; positive traits of comparable gas-engine Focuses carry over intact; capable of relatively fast Level 2 charging</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Cargo area compromised by battery pack; cramped rear-seat space; high price premium over conventional gas-engine counterparts</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Ford Focus Electric is unchanged for 2018. Ford Focus is a compact electric car with seating for five. The front-wheel-drive car is powered by a 143-horsepower electric motor. The EPA-estimated driving range is 115 miles and Ford claims that a DC fast charger can deliver 75 miles of range in half an hour. Focus Electric is among the more rewarding pure-electric vehicles to drive. And, for the most part, it feels like a conventional Focus. Prices are high compared to the gas-engine Focuses, but competitive with both the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt. If your goal is to be green and drive a car no one will suspect is electric, the Focus Electric is a fine choice. Note that Focus Electric is available only in select Ford dealerships.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/fusion/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Broad range of powertrains and trim choices, including well-designed Hybrid and Energi plug-in-hybrid models; one of the quieter cars in the class; crisp-for-the-class handling; invigorating performance of new Sport model</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Top-line trim levels are expensive; swoopy styling intrudes a bit on rear visibility</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After last year’s refresh, Ford Fusion is unchanged for 2018. Sport and Platinum are the top trim levels. Sport comes standard with all-wheel drive and an adaptive suspension system with pothole-detection technology; it’s powered by a 325-horsepower turbocharged 2.7-liter V6. Platinum is fully loaded with luxury features, including a leather interior with cowhide trim extended to the dash and door panels. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid Energi are powered by a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and electric motor with a combined output of 188 horsepower. EPA estimates for Hybrid are 43 mpg city and 41 highway. Energi is EPA-estimated to travel 19 miles on electric power alone and get a combined 97 MPGe or a combined 42 on gasoline. Technology features include pedestrian detection and hands-free perpendicular and parallel parking. Ford’s Sync3 multimedia system, which is available in most Fusion models, replaced the finicky MyFord Touch setup. All Fusions have push-button starting, and a rotary dial gear-shift knob that replaces a traditional shift lever. The basic Fusion platform debuted as a 2013 model, and the extensive updates for 2017 help keep it competitive against a strong class of midsize-sedan rivals. We’re especially fond of the gutsy Fusion Sport model, which delivers real driving excitement while giving up little in everyday practicality.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Ford Mustang is refreshed for 2018 with revised styling front and rear. The base V6 engine has been dropped. The EcoBoost turbocharged 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine continues and has more torque. Horsepower of the 5.0-liter V8 rises from 435 to 460. The Shelby GT350 5.2-liter V8 has a slight horsepower increase from 526 to 529. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard with all engines and a new 10-speed automatic that replaces the previous 6-speed auto is optional with 2.3-liter and 5.0-liter engines. The Mustang is a sporty/performance car that is available in coupe and convertible bodystyles. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alert, cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist, Wi-Fi hotspot, limited-slip differential, electronic line-lock, and an exhaust system with controllable volume. Mustang’s 2015 redesign brought some key improvements—such as an independent rear suspension and a peppy turbocharged 4-cylinder engine option—that brought it up to date with most other sporty/performance 2-doors. Mustang offers an excellent lineup of powertrain choices and optional performance, technology, and convenience equipment, so it can be tailored to a broad range of tastes and budgets. In whatever form it takes, the Mustang makes a fine case for itself against a wide variety of competitive vehicles.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/taurus/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Acceleration with SHO model; unique technology features; good ride quality; large trunk</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Disappointing rear-seat room; thick roof pillars and high door sills inhibit visibility and cause a closed-in feel</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Ford Taurus drops its turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. Taurus is a large sedan with seating for five. A 288-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine is standard. The sporty SHO has a 365-hp turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. Available features include heated-cooled front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic high-beam headlights, blind-spot alert, cross-traffic alert, power-adjustable pedals, and keyless access and starting. Overall, the Taurus is smooth, refined, and quite enjoyable to drive. We’ve been impressed with the standard V6 engine. The Taurus’ weakest link is disappointing rear-seat space. Overall it’s worth a look, but we think anyone looking at large sedans needs to shop the Chevrolet Impala, Buick LaCrosse, and Toyota Avalon before making a decision.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/ford/transit-connect/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressive passenger and cargo hauling capabilities in a relatively small, economical package; spectacular headroom for all occupants; competitive array of comfort and convenience features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Acceleration is rather sluggish; cargo van origins are apparent, both in looks and cargo flexibility</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Ford Transit Connect shuffles some equipment. Automatic headlights are now standard on XLT and Titanium. A new option package for XLT and Titanium includes a SYNC3 control system and a rearview camera. Previous-generation Transit Connects were typically intended primarily for light commercial use; they were usually sold as 2-passenger cargo vans with no side windows. The 2014 redesign brought a much more “civilian-friendly” Transit Connect that included a long-wheelbase 7-passenger version with side windows along with a host of convenience features, such as a panoramic sunroof, navigation system, and heated leather seats. There is also a short-wheelbase version with seating for five passengers. Available safety features include blind-spot alert and rear cross-traffic alert. A 2.5-liter four-cylinder with a 6-speed automatic transmission is the sole drivetrain. All Transit Connects are front-wheel drive. For some off-the-beaten-path shoppers, this unconventional, space-efficient people mover could be a compelling alternative to the traditional minivan or compact/midsize SUV.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/gmc/acadia/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> New generation Acadia has improved maneuverability and fuel economy; good selection of available technology and safety features, availability of well-trimmed Denali model</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>New generation Acadia also has reduced cargo room; 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seats are cramped; some safety features restricted to higher-line trim levels</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After its redesign and downsizing last year, the 2018 GMC Acadia has few changes. Acadias with the All Terrain package are now available with a 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seat. A tire-fill alert that provides an audible signal when inflating a tire is a new feature. Acadia is a crossover midsize SUV that offers 5-, 6-, and 7-passenger seating configurations. A 193-horsepower 2.5-liter four cylinder with fuel-saving automatic start/stop technology is the base engine. Also available is a 310-hp 3.6-liter V-6 with cylinder deactivation. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive are available. An All Terrain package includes a more sophisticated all-wheel drive system than other AWD Acadias. Available safety features include a surround-view camera, a “Rear Seat Reminder” that sounds an alert to check the backseat for passengers before leaving the vehicle, and a forward collision mitigation system with low-speed automatic braking and pedestrian detection. Other available features include OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto functionality, heated/ventilated front seats, and power tilt/telescopic steering. Compared to the first generation Acadia, the current version gives up some passenger room and cargo space, but gains maneuverability, fuel economy, and a host of up-to-date technology features. Acadia’s tidier size puts it direct competition with the leaders of the midsize crossover segment, where it stacks up very well.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 GMC Canyon has few changes for 2018. Leather seats are now available on the All Terrain model and a washer-fluid sensor is standard on all models. The Canyon and its slightly less-ritzy cousin, the Chevrolet Colorado, are GM’s “compact” pickups–though they are really more midsize. They share a basic extended-cab or crew-cab platform. Both are available with 4-cylinder, V6, and diesel engines, but the GMC offers a more sophisticated full-time 4-wheel-system that is only available on Chevy’s off-road-oriented ZR2 (other 4×4 Chevys have part-time 4WD). Available features include forward collision alert, lane-departure warning, locking rear differential, hill-descent control, heated steering wheel, and heated/ventilated front seats. These GM pickups offer technology and all-around refinement. The smaller, more-tractable dimensions should make Canyon a practical alternative for many big-truck intenders.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, the GMC Sierra’s eAssist hybrid system is available nationwide. Previously, eAssist was only available in California. Sometimes called a “mild” hybrid, eAssist provides additional torque during acceleration via a motor/alternator/generator located on the gasoline engine itself. The eAssist system will not propel the vehicle on electric power alone, but it does provide automatic stop/start capability–and some extra power. All Sierra models now have a standard rearview camera and the tire-pressure monitor now has an audible tire-fill alert. The Sierra is a full size pickup with a choice of three engines: a 285-horsepower 4.3-liter V6, a 355-hp 5.3-liter V8, or a 420-hp 6.2-liter V8. The V6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 5.3-liter V8 has a 6-speed automatic or an 8-speed automatic, depending on model. eAssist is added to the 5.3-liter V8 and has an 8-speed automatic. The 6.2-liter V8 also is paired with the 8-speed automatic. Rear-wheel drive is standard and full-time 4-wheel drive is available. Available features include forward collision alert, low-speed emergency automatic braking, lane-keep assist, adjustable Magnetic Ride Control System, hill-descent control, locking rear differential, rear-seat entertainment system, wireless charging pad, heated/ventilated front seats, and heated steering wheel. The GMC Sierra stacks up well against class rivals, and—like its Chevrolet Silverado sibling—offers strong, refined engines, good on-road behavior, plenty of handy in-cabin storage, and an impressively quiet driving environment; top-line models such as the Denali add a healthy dose of luxury to the mix. Sierra lags the Ram 1500 in handling and ride quality (as do all other full-size pickups), but it’s still a Best Buy in this class.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/gmc/terrain/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good selection of available comfort and safety features; lively performance with 2.0-liter turbo engine</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> So-so acceleration with base engine; price premium of optioned-up versions, especially topline Denali model</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The GMC Terrain is redesigned and downsized for 2018. The new Terrain is about three inches shorter and up to 400 pounds lighter than the previous generation, which bumps it from the smaller side of our midsize SUV class to our compact SUV category. The Terrain shares its basic platform and powertrains with the Chevrolet Equinox, which is also redesigned this year. The base engine is a turbocharged 170-horsepower 1.5-liter 4-cylinder. The most powerful engine is a 252-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cyliner, while the most fuel-efficient engine is a 137-hp 1.6-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder. The two gas engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission and the diesel is mated to a 6-speed auto. Front-wheel drive is standard and all models except the base SL are available with all-wheel drive. Available safety features include forward-collision alert, low-speed automatic braking, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. Other available features include a surround-view camera, automatic parking assist, 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, heated and ventilated front seats, and hands-free power liftgate. The redesigned GMC Terrain now competes more directly with the likes of the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, and it boasts a slightly more upscale look and feel than the other vehicles in its class. You’ll pay a bit of a premium for that ambiance, but the Terrain’s pleasant road manners, user-friendly infotainment system, and generous passenger room also satisfy.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/gmc/yukon/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Ample passenger and cargo space, especially in Yukon XL models; quiet interior; tractable and easy to drive for the size; 3rd-row seats now fold flat with the cargo floor as do 2nd-row seats; towing capability</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Fuel economy; tight-quarters maneuverability; cramped legroom in 3rd-row seats on regular-length Yukons; jittery ride with available 20-inch wheels; high-end models get very expensive</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Denali versions of GMC Yukon and Yukon XL gain a 10-speed automatic transmission in place of the previous 6-speed automatic. Denali also offers a new Ultimate Black Edition package with 22-inch wheels and unique exterior trim. The Yukon is a large SUV that shares its basic design with the Chevrolet Tahoe. The Yukon XL, which is 14 inches longer in wheelbase and 20 inches longer overall, is kin to the Chevrolet Suburban. Yukon and Yukon XL have three rows of seating that can hold up to nine passengers with available front- and second-row bench seats. The 3rd-row seatbacks fold flat into the floor. Designers had to raise the cargo floor to accomplish this, which makes for a higher liftover, but also allows for some handy under-floor storage bins. The base engine in Yukon and Yukon XL is a 5.3-liter V8 with 355 horsepower that is paired with a 6-speed automatic. The topline Denali models get a 420-hp 6.2-liter V8 mated to the previously mentioned 10-speed automatic. Safety features include low-speed automatic braking, forward collision alert, lane-departure warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Some of the safety features use GM’s Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates to warn the driver of potential obstructions. Interior materials are of high quality, especially on higher-end models. Enhancing the upscale feel are available features such as adaptive cruise control, heated/ventilated front seats, a power-folding 3rd-row seat, and keyless entry and starting. Denali models get exclusive features such as windshield heads-up display, configurable instrument panel, and unique interior/exterior trim. The very notion of a hulking, V8-powered full-size SUV seems anachronistic to many shoppers these days, but for those who need the power, interior room, and towing capacity that only a large SUV offers, the all-new Yukons are a fine choice. Yukon Denalis are especially pricey, but they offer a luxurious feel that approaches the Cadillac Escalade.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Honda’s long-running midsize sedan is redesigned for 2018. The Accord lineup loses its available V6 engine and 2-door coupe body style, but gains two new 4-cylinder engines and a host of new comfort and technology features. The new car is roughly the same size overall as the car it replaces, but the wheelbase has been stretched more than two inches for better rear-seat legroom. The base engine is a 192-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter 4-cylinder, and the step-up choice is a 252-hp turbo 2.0-liter four. The Accord Hybrid model returns with a non-turbo 2.0-liter four combined with two electric motors that produce a total of 212 hp. The 1.5 turbo and Hybrid are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 2.0 turbo gets a new 10-speed automatic. Both gas engines are also available with a 6-speed manual transmission—an unusual option for the midsize-car class. Available safety features include forward-collision warning and mitigation, lane-departure warning and mitigation, driver-attention monitor, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, and cross-traffic alert. Other available features include head-up instrument display, adaptive cruise control, automatic brake-hold, automatic high-beam headlights, and heated/ventilated front seats. The Accord is roomy, comfortable, and has a comprehensive list of safety features. It is also quite engaging to drive for a mainstream midsize sedan. The 2.0 turbo’s satisfying acceleration and the truly luxurious feel of the top-line Touring model also deserve special mention. The previous-generation Accord was among the best in the class, and the new design is better than its predecessor in every way.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Honda Civic is unchanged. Civic is a compact car available as a 4-door sedan, 4-door hatchback, and 2-door coupe. Civic offers the choice of a 158-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder or a turbocharged 1.5-liter four in most models. The 1.5-liter engine develops 174 hp, 180 hp, or 205 hp in performance Si. (See engine chart below.) The low-production Type R is powered by a 305-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. Among Civic’s available features are remote engine start, rain-sensing wipers, heated rear seats, dual-zone climate control, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto functionality for the infotainment system. A “Honda Sensing” suite of safety equipment includes lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, forward collision warning and mitigation, and adaptive cruise control. Civic’s 2016 redesign put Honda back at the top of the incredibly competitive compact-car class. Some of its rivals are quieter, and some offer more features for the money, but the Civic’s spaciousness, available tech features, engaging driving personality, efficiency, and all-around refinement—not to mention its model lineup—make it a compact-car must-see.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/honda/cr-v/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generous cargo space; spacious back seat; comfortable ride; nicely finished cabin</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Minor turbo lag with new 1.5-liter engine; no stand-alone factory options means stepping up to expensive high-end models to get desired features</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After its redesign last year, the Honda CR-V is unchanged for 2018. CR-V is a compact crossover SUV. The base LX model has a 184-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder. All other models have a 190-hp turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. Both engines are mated to a CVT automatic transmission, and all models are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Available features include remote engine start, rain-sensing wipers, a hands-free power liftgate, dual-zone automatic climate controls, LED headlights with automatic high-beam, adaptive cruise control, keyless entry and starting, and a 180-degree rear camera. Available safety features include rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot alert, driver-attention monitor, forward-collision warning and mitigation, and lane-keep assist. The CR-V’s well-executed redesign brought welcome improvements in passenger and cargo space, several desirable new features, and impressive all-around refinement. In terms of both handling and acceleration, the CR-V isn’t as sporty as some compact-crossover competitors, but it’s still one of the best in its class.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/honda/fit/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Outstanding interior cargo space and versatility in a small package; agile, fun-to-drive character; availability of upscale features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Engine is noisy during acceleration; touchscreen system absorbs virtually all audio functions and complicates many of them; ride is rather stiff</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Honda Fit is refreshed for 2018. Styling has been tweaked, suspension retuned, and there is more sound insulation for a quieter interior. There is a new Sport model with a unique front-end design and 16-inch alloy wheels. The Honda Sensing package of safety features is now available on all models. There is also a new 7-inch touchscreen that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Fit is a subcompact four-door hatchback. The lone engine on all Fits is a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder with 130 horsepower. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is available on all Fits, and a six-speed manual is offered on entry-level LX, Sport, and midlevel EX models. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, road-departure mitigation, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alert, and cross-traffic alert. The Fit is most space-efficient, cargo-versatile vehicle in its class. Fit’s compact size, responsive steering, and sporty suspension tuning make it very nimble, but the ride is a bit stiff. Still, Fit remains one of the most compelling vehicles in the subcompact class.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Honda HR-V gets a new wheel design for EX and EX-L models. The subcompact-sized SUV slots below the compact Honda CR-V in size and price. The HR-V is based on the platform of the Honda Fit subcompact car. A 141-horsepower, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder is the HR-V’s lone powertrain; front-wheel drive models offer the choice of a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a 6-speed manual transmission, while all-wheel drive versions come exclusively with the CVT. HR-V trim levels ascend through Honda’s traditional LX, EX, and EX-L monikers. Standard features on all include a rearview camera, electronic parking brake, alloy wheels, tilt-telescopic steering wheel with audio and cruise-control buttons, Bluetooth connectivity, and Pandora internet radio. Higher trim levels can be equipped with a 7-inch touchscreen interface, keyless entry and starting, Honda’s LaneWatch side-view camera, Honda Digital Traffic, leather trim, power sunroof, and heated front seats. The HR-V is a solid entry in a fast-growing segment. It offers fine passenger and cargo room for its size, the promise of excellent fuel economy, and a sporty driving personality. A somewhat bland cabin and some tedious touchscreen controls disappoint, however.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/honda/odyssey/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Well-balanced driving dynamics; versatile Magic Slide seating system; quiet cabin; comprehensive list of available high-tech and family-friendly features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lack of stand-alone options means that many desirable features are available only on the most expensive trim levels; some testers dislike push-button gear selector</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Honda Odyssey is redesigned for 2018, gaining several new convenience and technology features on an all-new platform that’s roughly the same size as the previous-generation Odyssey. “Magic Slide” second-row seats are the new Odyssey’s key innovation—they slide laterally as well as fore and aft, which enables several convenient seating configurations and greatly eases access to the third-row seats. Other newly available features include CabinWatch, a ceiling-mounted wide-angle infrared camera to monitor rear-seat passengers (even in the dark); CabinTalk, an in-car P.A. system that enables the driver to talk to rear-seat passengers through the available entertainment system’s headphones or rear speakers; and CabinControl, a smartphone app that allows rear-seat passengers to control rear climate and entertainment-system functions. The sole engine is a 3.5-liter V6 that puts out 280 horsepower—32 more than the previous-generation model. Two automatic transmissions are offered—a new 10-speed for the line-topping Touring and Elite models, and a nine-speed for LX, EX, and EX-L models. Among the available features are forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, blind-spot alert, keyless access and starting, 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity, LED headlights, a built-in vacuum, heated/ventilated front seats, and hands-free power liftgate. The all-new Odyssey delivers a refined, quiet cabin; a capable, responsive powertrain; and surprisingly crisp handling for a large front-wheel-drive vehicle. However, its clever Magic Slide seats and other technology innovations are what make it a real standout. If the passenger-hauling convenience of the Odyssey’s Magic Slide seats is more important to you than the cargo versatility of the Chrysler Pacifica’s handy Stow n’ Go seats, then Honda’s latest minivan should be at the top of your shopping list.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Honda Pilot is unchanged. Honda’s midsize crossover SUV has three rows of seats and can seat up to eight passengers. Power is provide by a 280-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, which is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission in LX, EX, and EX-L models and a 9-speed automatic in the high-end Touring and Elite models. All trims levels are available with front- or all-wheel drive except the line-topping Elite model, which is AWD only. A “Honda Sensing” option group of safety technology features includes adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, Collision Mitigation Braking System, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, and Road Departure Mitigation. If you need to move a lot of people and stuff and aren’t interested in a minivan, the Pilot is one of the best family haulers around.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Honda Ridgeline is essentially unchanged after its redesign last year. The RTS models and the all-wheel-drive version of RT have been dropped. Unlike other compact pickups that have body-on-frame construction, the redesigned Ridgeline retains the four-door, five-passenger configuration and carlike unibody construction of its previous generation. A 280-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 with a six-speed automatic transmission is the sole drivetrain, and front-wheel drive is available in addition to full-time all-wheel drive. The cargo bed is five feet four inches long and five feet wide; a four-foot-wide sheet of plywood will fit between the wheel arches. There is also a lockable storage well under the bed floor and the two-way tailgate can be opened either down (like a traditional pickup) or to the side. A novel “truck-bed audio” feature available on top-line models uses small electronic units mounted inside the bedliner that essentially turn the entire pickup bed into a speaker. Other available features include keyless access/starting, a navigation system, tri-zone automatic climate control, heated mirrors, heated front seats, and leather upholstery. Available safety features include forward-collision mitigation, lane-keep assist, road-departure mitigation, multi-view rearview camera, and Honda’s LaneWatch right-side camera. Honda’s new Ridgeline looks more like a traditional pickup truck than its predecessor, but it continues to offer SUV-like on-road ride and handling characteristics that are a bit more refined than its GM and Toyota rivals. Ridgeline also offers some clever interior and exterior cargo solutions that aren’t matched by its competitors. Unless you’re looking to do serious off-roading or towing, the Ridgeline will likely provide all the hauling versatility you’ll need, along with everyday driving manners and all-around sophistication that are a cut above its class competition.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Value for the money; straightforward control layout; good ride/handling balance</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Cramped rear-seat space, hatchback body style no longer offered; engine is noisy when accelerating</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Hyundai Accent is redesigned for 2018, growing slightly longer and wider than the previous-generation model and gaining new technology and safety features. The new Accent also loses something—a hatchback is no longer available, leaving a four-door sedan as the lone body style. The straightforward model lineup ascends through SE, SEL and Limited models; there are no options or option packages other than accessories such as floor mats. The sole engine on all Accents is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that is rated at 130 horsepower. The SE model offers a choice of a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission; the automatic is standard on the SEL and Limited. The line-topping Limited includes features such as forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking, keyless entry and starting, power sunroof, hands-free trunklid release, 17-inch alloy wheels, and Hyundai’s Blue Link remote connectivity services.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Hyundai Elantra GT is redesigned for 2018. Elantra GT is the hatchback stablemate of the Elantra compact sedan that was redesigned for 2017. The Elantra sedan is unchanged except for the addition of a new SEL model. Hyundai claims better NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) levels, improved structural rigidity, lower weight and improved ride quality and handling for both sedan and GT. Both Elantra sedan and GT offer a Sport model that is powered by a 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed automated-manual transmission. Sport has unique styling and sport suspension. The Elantra sedan offers a choice of three engines. A 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 147-horsepower is in all trims except the previously mentioned Sport and fuel-miser Eco, which is powered by a new turbocharged 128-horsepower 1.4-liter four. The Elantra GT’s base engine is a 162-hp version of the 2.0-liter engine. The 2.0-liter is available with 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmissions; the 1.4-liter comes only with a 7-speed automated-manual transmission. Elantra offers many safety and convenience features that are unusual for the class. Among the available features are steering-linked xenon headlights, hands-free trunk opening, heated rear seats, wireless cell-phone charging, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, driver-attention-alert system, blind-spot alert, lane-keep assist, and cross-traffic alert. The Elantra sedan doesn’t stand out in any one area. However, it has generous amount of features for the dollar and offers wide range of available equipment. The same can also be said for the Elantra GT, which also has a large cargo capacity that rivals some compact SUVs.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Hyundai Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport are essentially unchanged for 2018. Hyundai’s Blue Link telematics system now includes three years of free service. The Hyundai Santa Fe midsize crossover SUV was redesigned for 2013, and in the process gained two versions: the 2-row, 5-passenger, 4-cylinder-powered Santa Fe Sport and the 3-row, 7-passenger, V6 Santa Fe. Santa Fe Sport has a choice of two 4-cylinder engines: a 190-horsepower 2.4-liter and a 264-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter. A 290-hp 3.3-liter V6 is sole engine for Santa Fe. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission and all models offer a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning, blind-spot alert, cross-traffic alert, panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, and adaptive cruise control. Good power from both the 4-cylinder and V6 engines; agreeable ride quality; and a comfortable, practical interior are some of the highlights of the Santa Fe family. We also like how refined these crossovers feel and how quiet they are on the road. However, pricing is a bit on the steep side–at least for the Sport–particularly when you add costly option packages. Still, if you’re looking at crossovers or SUVs, be sure to drive the Santa Fe that best approximates your passenger-hauling needs.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/hyundai/sonata/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Broad range of available comfort, convenience, and safety features; spacious rear seat; tight-for-the-class turning radius makes for good close-quarters maneuverability</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Off-the-line acceleration is a bit sluggish with base engine; ride quality and suspension composure, though both improved, still trail midsize-car class leaders</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Hyundai Sonata gets a mid-cycle refresh. Styling is revised and steering and suspension are retuned for a more sporting feel. An 8-speed automatic replaces a 6-speed automatic on cars with a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine. Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid models are expected later in the model year. SE, SEL, Sport 2.4, Sport 2.0T, Limited 2.4, and Limited 2.0T comprise Sonata’s non-hybrid lineup, each sporting unique styling features. Engine choices are 2.4-liter- and turbocharged 2.0-liter fours. The 2.4-liter is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the turbo 2.0-liter is mated to the new 8-speed auto. A Sonata Eco model with a 177-horsepower 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder hooked to a 7-speed automatic manual transmission is also offered. Available features include LED headlights, High Beam Assist, adaptive cruise control, next-generation Blue Link telematics/connectivity, and an 8.0-inch navigation system that offers the ability to record preset Sirius/XM channels. (This feature allows you to “rewind” up to 22 minutes, so you can hear all of the song that was playing when you switched channels or catch up on the sports broadcast you caught midway through.) Safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Lane Keep Assist, and driver attention alert. A hands-free “smart” automatic-opening trunklid feature makes it easier to place groceries or luggage in the trunk when hands are full. Sonata maintains a strong value-for-the-money quotient while delivering a formidable list of cutting-edge new features. Sonata is a must-see in the competitive midsize-car class.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Hyundai Tucson has a larger, 7-inch touchscreen. Tucson shuffles its equipment and options, but is otherwise unchanged. Hyundai redesigned it s compact crossover SUV for 2016. This generation Tucson is 3 inches longer overall and 1.1 inches wider than the previous model, which translates to improved rear-seat-passenger and cargo room. A 175-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automated manual transmission is standard in Value and Limited models. Base SE, SEL, and SEL Plus models get a 164-hp 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic. Available features include a hands-free power liftgate, panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, lane-departure warning, rear-park assist, and a forward collision mitigation system. The Hyundai Tucson is a compelling choice in its very competitive class. Some class competitors offer crisper handling, and others offer better cargo room, but the Tucson is nonetheless a well-rounded compact SUV.</p>]

Though its name might suggest that the E-Pace is an electric vehicle, it’s not. (However, Jaguar is introducing its first pure EV for 2019—the I-Pace compact crossover.) The E-Pace shares a platform with the Range Rover Evoque built by Jaguar’s corporate partner Land Rover. The sole engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that is available in two states of tune: a standard 246-horsepower unit or a 296-hp version in R-Dynamic and First Edition form. All E-Paces have a 9-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. The all-wheel-drive system can direct all power to the front wheels during steady-state cruising for increased fuel economy. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, traffic-sign recognition, driver-condition monitor, forward-traffic detection, and blind-spot alert. Other available features include parking assist, a hands-free power liftgate, adaptive cruise control, head-up instrument display, and LED headlights. Also available is Jaguar’s Activity Key, a waterproof wristband that can lock and unlock the vehicle and allow the key to be left securely inside while the driver participates in water sports. The traditional luxury-vehicle market has certainly been transformed by the continued popularity of crossover SUVs, and the E-Pace shows that Jaguar is ably keeping up with the times. Despite a few downsides (such as steep pricing and a stiff ride in some trim levels), the E-Pace is a compelling new entry into the category; it offers surprisingly decent space inside for its small overall dimensions, high-class cabin trimmings, athletic handling, and zippy performance from its turbo-four engines.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong acceleration (V6): athletic driving personality; availability of economical diesel engine; generous cargo room for the class</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Mediocre fuel-economy ratings with V6; firm ride, especially with optional upsized wheels</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, the Jaguar F-Pace gains a new 4-cylinder engine. A 247-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder is the new base engine. There is also a 300-hp version of the new turbo four. Newly available are Forward Traffic Detection that warns if something crosses the vehicle’s path and Forward Vehicle Guidance that helps direct the driver in low speed maneuvers. Introduced for 2017, F-Pace was Jaguar’s first SUV. The F-Pace is a 5-passenger premium crossover that aims to blend the Jaguar brand’s sporty dynamic character with the cargo versatility and rough-terrain/all-weather capabilities of an SUV. The new gasoline turbo 4-cylinder joins the existing engine lineup that consists of a supercharged 380-hp 3.0-liter V6 and a 180-hp turbodiesel 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. (A 340-hp version of the V6 has been dropped.) All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The standard all-wheel drive sends all power to the rear wheels unless extra traction is needed, then power is also directed to the front wheels. Like other Jaguars, F-Pace uses aluminum-intensive construction to reduce weight for better fuel economy and driving dynamics. Tech and safety features include Autonomous Emergency Braking, lane-departure mitigation, traffic-sign recognition, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alert, and Wi-Fi hotspot. Also available, is Jaguar’s Activity Key, an optional waterproof wristband that can lock and unlock the vehicle and allow the key to be left securely inside while the driver participates in water sports. With the F-Pace, Jaguar brings a stylish-yet-practical vehicle to the premium compact SUV segment that also delivers impressive performance in V6 form. If you’re shopping the Porsche Macan, Audi SQ5, or Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG, be sure to check out the F-Pace S, and if you’re interested in economy as much as athleticism, check out the F-Pace 20d.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jaguar/f-type/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Striking styling; impressive performance from V6 and V8 models; truly upscale character</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Stingy trunk space; weighs a bit more than some competitors; adding optional equipment pumps up the already steep base prices</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Jaguar F-Type gains a 296-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder as its new base engine. The supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is still available in 340-hp and 380-hp variants, but gains a 400-hp version in the new 400 Sport model. The supercharged 5.0-liter V8 is unchanged and develops 550-hp in R trim and 575-hp in the SVR. Jaguar claims the high-performance SVR has a top speed of 200 mph and is capable of accelerating 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A 6-speed manual transmission is available with the V6 engine. Jaguar has revised the F-Type’s frontal styling and added full LED headlights. Autonomous emergency braking is expected to be available later in the model year. There is also a new infotainment control system. The F-Type is a front-engine, rear- or all-wheel drive 2-passenger coupe and convertible. Available features include lane-departure warning, blind-spot alert, rear-traffic monitor, ceramic brakes, heated/cooled seats, and parallel-parking assist. Competitive vehicles of the F-Type include the Chevrolet Corvette, Porsche 718 Boxster, and Porsche 718 Cayman. The F-Type is a true sports car that revives the spirit of the classic Jaguar coupes and roadsters of the 1960s. The R-Dynamic is probably the best value, with most of the performance of the R and similar handling. Those shopping for an upscale sports car should add the F-Type to their list.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jaguar/xe/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent balance of ride quality and handling prowess; wide selection of upholstery and trim choices; spirited acceleration with supercharged V6</p>, <p><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Cons:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5"> Rear-seat room is tight; limited trunk space and small-items storage; so-so rear visibility</span></p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Jaguar XE gets a new 4-cylinder gas engine and more horsepower in its V6 for 2018. The base 240-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder has been replaced by a new turbo 2.0-liter four available in 247-hp and a 300-hp versions. The supercharged 3.0-liter V6 is now rated at 380 hp—a gain of 40 hp. The 180-horsepower turbodiesel 2.0-liter four is unchanged. The base engine is now available with all-wheel drive and a hands-free power trunklid is a newly available. Jaguar re-entered the premium-compact car field for 2017 with the XE sport sedan. The XE comes in rear- and all-wheel drive form, and all engines use an 8-speed automatic transmission. XE uses Jaguar’s aluminum-intensive body structure to save weight for better fuel economy and driving dynamics. Available safety and technology features include adaptive shock absorbers, autonomous emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, traffic-sign recognition, and a head-up display that shows both speed and navigation readings on the lower part of the windshield. The XE was Jaguar’s first compact car in almost a decade, and it’s a compelling entry in the segment. The XE offers a distinctive luxury/performance character, a good selection of available powertrains and trim options, and a suitably athletic driving personality—all at prices that are very competitive with its primary rivals, the BMW 3-Series and Audi A4.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jaguar/xf/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fine mix of ride comfort and handling prowess; classy interior trimmings; distinctive luxury character; all-wheel drive available on all models; cavernous trunk; available fuel-efficient diesel engine</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some visibility issues; some testers find the exhaust note almost too subdued, given the athletic overall character</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Jaguar XF gains a new bodystyle and engine. A station wagon badged “Sportbrake” has been added and a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with 427 horsepower in 20t trim or 296-hp in 25t trim is also new to the XF line. The other engine choices are a turbodiesel 180-hp 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 that puts out 380 horsepower in the S and First Edition trim levels and 340 in the 35t models. An 8-speed automatic is standard on all, and all sedan trim levels are available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The Sportbrake is only offered with all-wheel drive and the 380-hp supercharged V6. In addition to the expected luxury trimmings, available features include heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, power-closing doors, hands-free power trunk lid, faux suede headliner, parking assist, and an adaptive damping suspension. Safety features include autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. The new Jaguar XF makes a fine case for itself as an alternative to the usual German midsize luxury/sport sedans. Its lightweight aluminum construction makes it feel lithe and athletic from the driver’s seat, and also contributes to respectable fuel economy numbers, given the power on hand.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jeep/cherokee/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressive off-road capabilities when properly equipped; better on-road handling and composure than other Jeeps; broad range of optional equipment and high-tech features; standard 9-speed automatic transmission</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Cramped rear-seat space; radical front-end styling is off-putting to Jeep traditionalists; other compact SUVs have better cargo volume</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, the Jeep Cherokee’s model lineup is shuffled. The Sport and Altitude trims have been dropped; Latitude is now the base model, and there is a new Latitude Plus model. Trailhawk and Limited gain standard equipment. Cherokee is a compact crossover SUV that is slightly larger than Jeep’s Compass, which in turn, is larger than the subcompact Jeep Renegade. Two engines are offered: a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 184 horsepower and a 271-hp 3.2-liter V6. Both engines are mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive are available. Available features include heated/ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel, keyless entry and starting, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. For most of its trim levels, the Cherokee’s closest competitors are the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, and Mazda CX-5. The exception is the range-topping, off-road-ready Cherokee Trailhawk model, which has few direct rivals in the compact-SUV class. The only other vehicles in its class that come close to–or match–its level of off-road equipment are the other compact Jeeps, namely the Compass, and, for buyers interested in extreme off-roading, the 4-door Wrangler Unlimited.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jeep/compass/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable ride; roomy cabin within the compact exterior dimensions; off-road ability in Trailhawk trim</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Powertrain isn’t quite as refined as some class competitors; thick rear roof pillars impede visibility; so-so fuel economy</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Jeep Compass adds a front-wheel-drive version of its topline Limited trim. Previously, Limited was only available with 4WD. Compass is a compact crossover SUV that slots between Jeep’s subcompact Renegade and compact Cherokee in size and price. Four trim levels are offered: Sport, Latitude, Limited, and off-road-oriented Trailhawk. The sole engine is a 180-horsepower 2.4-liter four cylinder. Front-wheel-drive Compasses have a 6-speed automatic transmission, while 4WD models have a 9-speed automatic. A six-speed manual is available with both front-wheel drive and 4WD. A two-speed transfer case with a low-ratio for off-road use is standard on Trailhawk. Available features include forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning and mitigation, blind-spot alert, rear cross-path detection, hill-descent control, and panoramic sunroof. In Trailhawk trim, Compass boasts off-road capabilities that can top most any class competitor (that isn’t another Jeep). The Compass’s drivetrain doesn’t quite measure up to some rivals in terms of power, fuel economy, and transmission refinement. However, competitive pricing, decent interior space for the size, a pleasing on-road driving personality, and up-to-date available features make the Compass a worthwhile contender.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jeep/grand-cherokee/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Availability of unique diesel and SRT/Trackhawk high-performance models; tough-to-match off-road prowess; classy, upscale interiors in higher-end models</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not as good a value as many class competitors; rear legroom can grow cramped; poor fuel economy in SRT and Trackhawk models</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Jeep Grand Cherokee gains a new 707-horsepower Trackhawk model that is capable of accelerating 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds. Another new model is the Sterling Edition that commemorates Grand Cherokee’s 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary. All Grand Cherokees now have standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The base touchscreen grows from five inches to seven. The available 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen now has pinch and zoom capability and higher resolution. Grand Cherokee is a crossover midsize SUV. Jeep offers a wide choice of engines with horsepower ranging from 240 to 707. The base engine is a 295-hp 3.6-liter V6. A thrifty 240-hp 3.0-liter diesel V6 is optional. Three V8s are available: a 360-hp 5.7-liter, a 475-hp 6.4-liter, and a 707-hp supercharged 6.2-liter. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. SRT and Trackhawk have standard all-wheel drive, while other models are available with rear-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive—except the off-road oriented Trailhawk which is 4WD only. A 2-speed transfer case is optional. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, parallel parking assist, trailer-hitch camera, panoramic sunroof, and power tilt/telescoping steering wheel. Grand Cherokee has evolved into sort of a poor-man’s Range Rover, and that’s not a bad thing. It can be equipped for severe off-road use or country club luxury–or both–and that helps set it apart from its 5-passenger rivals in this class. So do its higher towing limits. But most buyers who want a midsize SUV for more normal driving will likely find others in this class to be a better value from a features-per-dollar standpoint.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jeep/renegade/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good passenger space (save for rear legroom) and cargo room in a tidy package; solid body structure contributes to good ride quality for the class; distinctive styling; broad range of available technology features and unique equipment</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Road, wind, and engine noise intrude a bit in highway driving; thick roof pillars compromise visibility; automatic transmission is often slow to downshift for more power</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Jeep Renegade now has a standard rearview camera on all models. All trims, except the base Sport, have a 7-inch display screen, along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Introduced for 2015, Renegade is a subcompact-sized crossover SUV that revived a model name from Jeep’s past. The Renegade is based on the same basic platform as the Fiat 500X from Jeep’s parent company, but it has more-rugged, “Jeep-esque” styling, higher ground clearance, and the availability of an off-road-capable 4-wheel-drive system. Like its Fiat 500X cousin, the Renegade is built in Italy. The base engine is a 160-horsepower turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder that is only available with a 6-speed manual transmission. Also available is a 180-hp 2.4-liter four that is paired with a 9-speed automatic. Both engines are offered with front- or 4-wheel drive. Among the available features are heated mirrors, a heated steering wheel, and unique “My Sky” dual removable sunroofs (the forward one being available with a power-sliding feature). Available safety features include blind-spot monitoring, rear-obstacle detection, rear cross-path detection, rearview camera with dynamic grid lines, forward collision warning, and lane-departure warning. The Renegade stands out in the fast-growing category of pint-sized SUVs by offering rugged-but-cute Jeep styling and legitimate off-road capabilities (when properly equipped).</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jeep/wrangler/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Outstanding off-road prowess; unmistakable Jeep character and rugged personality</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Poor value for money; noisier and less refined than most every class competitor; subpar on-road handling</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Jeep’s iconic off-roader is redesigned for 2018 on an all-new body-on-frame platform, gaining fresh-but-familiar styling, an available turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, and a host of new features. The standard 285-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 carries over from the previous-generation Wrangler (which continues for the 2018 model year as the “Wrangler JK”), but it gets a fuel-saving start/stop feature and is now paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission in place of the previous 5-speed (a 6-speed manual transmission is available). The newly available turbo 2.0-liter 4-cylinder puts out 270 hp and comes only with the 8-speed automatic; it features 48-volt “eTorque” mild-hybrid technology that includes regenerative braking, intelligent battery charging, electric power assist, and auto start/stop. A 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6 is slated to join the lineup for 2019, with a plug-in hybrid model scheduled to follow for 2020. Full-time 4-wheel-drive is newly available for 2018; previous Wranglers only offered a part-time system that needed to be engaged by the driver. Other newly available features include a blind-spot monitor with rear cross-path alert, rearview camera, push-button starting, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto functionality, and a Sky One-Touch power-folding canvas roof. The redesigned 2018 Jeep Wrangler delivers better all-around comfort, refinement, and economy than its predecessor while sacrificing none of its renowned rugged-terrain capabilities. You’ll pay for those improvements though; base prices are up roughly $3000 across the board from the 2017 Wrangler, which wasn’t exactly bargain-priced itself. Most any other compact-SUV competitor is a better dollar value and is more refined in everyday driving, but the Wrangler’s one-of-a-kind personality and off-road prowess make it a must-have for large numbers of adventure-seeking buyers.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/jeep/wrangler-jk/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Virtually unmatched off-road prowess; unmistakable Jeep character and rugged personality; four-door model retains desirable traits of original Wrangler but adds much needed versatility</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Noisier and less refined that most every class competitor; subpar on-road handling and fuel economy; lack of creature comforts</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> In addition to the all-new redesigned 2018 Jeep Wrangler (see separate report), the previous-generation Wrangler continues for 2018 as the Wrangler JK. The Wrangler JK is an off-road oriented compact SUV that comes in two lengths. The base Wrangler JK has two doors and seats four, while the longer  version has four doors and seats five. A folding fabric top is standard and a removable hardtop is optional. A 285-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine mates to either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive is standard. In addition to some of the usual comfort and convenience features, the Wrangler JK also offers off-road aids such as locking differentials, disconnecting sway bars, and 32-inch tires. Despite major improvements to its interior over the years, this Jeep remains a limited-purpose machine. Off road, it’s a finely honed tool. On road, it’s best considered a fun-in-the-sun runabout. The four-door’s design provides additional passenger and cargo room, albeit at a stiff price premium over the smaller 2-door Wrangler. A judiciously equipped Sport is the best value in this lineup. The top-line Rubicon can get very expensive.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/cadenza/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Roomy and comfortable cabin; pleasant ride; refined drivetrain; generous level of features for the money</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Uninspired handling; trunk space not outstanding for a large sedan; no stand-alone options available</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After its redesign last year, the 2018 Kia Cadenza is essentially unchanged. The base model has been dropped and a panoramic sunroof is now part of the Luxury Package. The Cadenza is a large sedan offered in Premium, Technology, and Limited trims. All Cadenzas are front-wheel drive; the sole powertrain is a 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 engine mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Available safety features include adaptive cruise control with stop/start functionality, forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking, and a “smart’ blind-spot detection system that can sense unintentional drifting toward an adjacent vehicle and automatically apply braking to the opposite-side front wheel to maintain the Cadenza’s intended course. A hands-free smart-opening trunk, head-up display, surround-view monitor, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto functionality, and wireless smartphone charger are other available features. The Cadenza is a pleasant-enough large sedan that offers a number of selling points, such as competitive pricing; a spacious, nicely trimmed cabin; well-rounded everyday performance; and some interesting styling flourishes. However, the Cadenza doesn’t break any new ground in terms of safety, comfort, or technology features. We also wish that Kia offered stand-alone options that would make it easier to tailor a Cadenza to your individual tastes. Still, this is a big, comfortable sedan that will satisfy many buyers.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/forte/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Well-designed infotainment features; decent ride and handling balance; Forte5 delivers enhanced cargo versatility with a unique sporty character</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Middling acceleration in non-SX models; some desirable options are available only in expensive packages</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Kia Forte is essentially unchanged after last year’s refresh. Forte is a front-wheel-drive compact car that is available as a sedan or a four-door hatchback badged Forte5. In addition to the sedan’s base 147-hp 2.0-liter four cylinder, is a 164-hp direct-injection 2.0-liter that is available for the sedan, but standard for the hatchback. Available on the hatchback is a 201-hp turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. The 147-hp 2.0-liter is available with six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. A six-speed automatic is the only transmission offered with 164-hp 2.0-liter. The turbo 1.6-liter offers a six-speed manual or a seven-speed automated-manual transmission. The Forte features excellent passenger and cargo accommodations and plenty of features for the money—including some rare-for-the-class options such as a heated steering wheel, ventilated driver’s seat, and heated rear seats. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, forward collision alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and steering-linked headlights. The Forte lineup is competitive with most rivals for refinement, ride/handling balance, and interior quality, while still outpointing some competitors for features-per-dollar value. The LX trim level is attractively priced and comes with most everything you need. Still, we suspect most buyers will opt for the EX despite its hefty price premium, if only to access available features like a sunroof, leather trim, heated seats, and the UVO eServices info/assistance app. Forte rates as a solid, practical compact car that’s certainly compelling, enhanced by Kia’s long warranty</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/niro/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Hybrid fuel efficiency; crossover versatility; less expensive than Prius v</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> All-wheel-drive is not available; fuel economy of Touring models is significantly lower than base models</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> A Kia Niro plug-in hybrid with an estimated 26-miles of all-electric range is expected during the 2018 model year. Autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and adaptive cruise control are now standard on the topline Touring model. The 2018 Kia Niro is a compact crossover SUV that comes solely in gas/electric hybrid form. Unlike most SUVs, the Niro is offered only with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is not available. The lone powertrain is a 1.6-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an electric motor for a combined 139 horsepower. A six-speed automated-manual is the only transmission. Available safety features include blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision warning, and adaptive cruise control. Keyless access and starting, heated/ventilated front seats, and heated steering wheel are among the available comfort features. An Eco-DAS (Driver Assistance System) helps achieve maximum fuel economy. A coasting guide tells the driver the best times to coast and brake, while Predictive Energy Control anticipates topographical changes to road ahead to optimize hybrid efficiency. The Kia Niro offers hybrid fuel efficiency and SUV practicality in a stylish package. It should appeal to environmentally conscious buyers who want good fuel economy in a vehicle with good interior room that doesn’t scream “hybrid.”</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/optima/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Quiet cabin; well-designed infotainment features; good mix of fuel economy and power from 1.6-liter turbo engine; stiffer body structure makes for improved ride and handling over previous Optima; competitive pricing</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Numb steering feel, even in “Sport” setting; 1.6-liter engine exhibits some low-speed turbo lag; some lackluster interior materials in lower-end models; sloping roofline compromises rear-seat headroom</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> All 2018 Kia Optimas now have standard blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking sensors. The topline SXL model has been dropped, but with options, the SX has similar equipment. There is also a new S model that slots between LX and EX. Kia’s popular midsize sedan was redesigned for 2016, on a platform that was slightly longer, taller, and wider than its predecessor. Three conventional and two hybrid powerplants are offered. The base engine is a 185-horsepower 2.4-liter four cylinder. Also available are a 178-hp turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and a 245-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four. The Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid pair a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine with an electric motor. The combined horsepower for the Hybrid is 192, while the Plug-In Hybrid develops 202. The Plug-In Hybrid can travel 29 miles on electric power alone. All engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission—except the 1.6-liter turbo which is mated to a seven-speed automated-manual transmission. All Optimas are front-wheel drive. Available safety features include a 360-degree around view monitor, blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, and an autonomous emergency braking system. The Kia UVO infotainment system includes enhanced smartphone connectivity and new eServices features aimed at teen drivers: GeoFencing, Speed Alert, Curfew Alert, and Driving Score. The Kia Optima has handsome styling, while offering several performance, technology, and safety features that make it competitive with midsize-sedan class leaders.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/rio/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Pleasant ride and engaging handling; decent power for a subcompact car; availability of forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Cramped rear-seat space; rear seatbacks don’t fold completely flat in hatchback model; so-so rear visibility</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Kia Rio is redesigned for 2018, gaining some new technology features and an available forward collision warning system with autonomous emergency braking. The new Rio is fractionally longer and wider than its predecessor and has more interior and cargo room. As before, 4-door-sedan and 4-door-hatchback body styles are offered (Kia calls the hatchback a “5-Door”). The trim levels on both ascend through LX, S, and EX models. The sole engine choice is a 130-horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission; a 6-speed manual is also available, but only on the entry-level LX model. The line-topping EX comes standard with Kia’s UVO infotainment system with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity, 15-inch alloy wheels, and forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking (a rare feature in the subcompact-car class). The redesigned Kia Rio is one of the best cars in the subcompact-car segment; it delivers impressive levels of comfort and refinement at attractive prices. It also has good power for the class and comes with a generous warranty.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/sedona/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Spacious third row, versatile second-row seats on higher-end models, broad range of available comfort and convenience features, crossover-like styling is a bit more dynamic than some minivans</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not as much maximum cargo volume as class rivals, third-row seat is a bit cumbersome to fold into the floor, middling fuel-economy numbers</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Kia Sedona is unchanged. Kia’s minivan seats seven or eight passengers. Highlights of the Sedona include a peppy 276-horsepower 3.3-liter V6, nicely finished interior, and available second-row seats that flip and fold forward to maximize cargo room. Available safety features include blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning, and lane-departure warning. The top line SX Limited model has optional reclining “First Class Lounge” second-row seats. The Sedona doesn’t outshine its more-established class rivals in any one area, but it is still a classy, well-executed contender that’s worth a look.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/sorento/
[<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Well-designed control layout and infotainment features; quiet cabin; good 2nd-row room; comfortable ride</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Cramped, hard-to-access 3rd-row seats; pricey option packages drive up prices in a hurry; base 4-cylinder engine strains to provide adequate performance</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says: </strong>The 2018 Kia Sorento has only minor changes. All models get upgraded headlights and improved headrests. The base L 2.4 now has a standard rearview camera. Kia’s crossover midsize SUV seats five or seven when equipped with the available 3rd-row seat. The base engine is a 185-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder. A 240-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine powers 2.0T models. A 290-hp 3.3-liter V6 tops the engine range. All engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive is offered for all models. Available safety features include forward-collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, blind-spot- and cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and a surround-view camera. Sorento is refined SUV with a spacious 2nd-row seat. It also has several well-executed available technology features, such as an excellent 360-degree camera system. However, choosing lots of options and/or higher trim levels pushes up the bottom line to sobering levels.

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Kia Soul has few changes. Adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and LED headlights are now available on the midline Soul Plus. Soul is a subcompact wagon with seating for five. Soul offers three gas engines and is also available as the all-electric Soul EV. The base engine is a 130-hp 1.6-liter four-cylinder that is paired with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The midrange Plus is powered by a 164-hp 2.0-liter four that is mated to a 6-speed automatic. The Exclaim has a 201-hp turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder with a 7-speed automated-manual transmission. Meanwhile, the all-electric Soul EV is powered by a 109-hp electric motor. Navigation, forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot alert, heated/ventilated front seats, and heated rear seats are available. The Soul’s tall, boxy body proportions mean that it packs a surprising amount of passenger and cargo room in a small overall package. In optioned-up form, the Soul also packs a surprising number of comfort and convenience features and a convincingly upscale feel for its class. The expressive, funky-box styling might turn off some shoppers, but the Soul’s handling is a bit more nimble that its looks might suggest. The ride quality is quite pleasant for a subcompact as well. The competitively priced Soul is a very compelling mix of personality and practicality.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/sportage/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent all-around ride and handling refinement; broad selection of available comfort, safety, and technology features; peppy acceleration with turbocharged engine</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Styling is a bit too radical for some tastes; less cargo room than some class competitors</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After its redesign last year, the 2018 Sportage is essentially unchanged. Blind-spot alert and rear cross-traffic alert are newly standard on EX models. Those features, along with autonomous emergency braking and lane-departure warning, are now optional on the base LX. The Kia Sportage was redesigned for 2017 on a slightly larger platform, gaining more interior room, new styling, and an expanded selection of safety and connectivity features. The Sportage lineup ascends through LX, EX, and SX models, all of which are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. LX and EX are powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine. The SX has a 240-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Available safety equipment includes autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-departure warning. Tech features include Kia’s new UVO3 infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality; telematics services; and Wi-Fi tethering capability. The Sportage’s aggressive front-end styling may not be for everyone, but this is a thoroughly impressive compact SUV that stacks up very well against the best in the class.  Base prices (at least in top-line trim) have crept up noticeably, but even if a Sportage is no longer the value proposition it once was, it’s still in line with the competition.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/kia/stinger/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Potent powertrains, competitive pricing, agile handling, striking styling, high-end trimmings on top-line models, cargo versatility of hatchback body style</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Tight rear-seat space (due in part to sloping roofline), rear visibility, some testers disliked unconventional gearshift lever, Kia brand doesn’t have the same cachet as established luxury-make rivals</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Kia steps into the sporty premium-midsize-car segment for 2018 with the introduction of an all-new 4-door hatchback sedan. The Kia Stinger is a performance-focused, fastback-styled “gran touring” sedan that is available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and a choice of two turbocharged engines: a 255-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, or a 365-hp 3.3-liter V6. With either powerplant, an 8-speed automatic (with steering-wheel paddle shifters) is the sole transmission. Available with the AWD system is a Dynamic Torque Vectoring Control feature that improves cornering performance. Other available features include an adjustable Dynamic Stability Damping Control suspension, Nappa leather upholstery, a head-up display, and a premium Harman/Kardon audio system. Available safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and driver-attention alert. The all-new Kia Stinger is an audacious new model from a brand that hasn’t previously offered a high-end, high-performance vehicle. Though it doesn’t yet have the name recognition or reputation of established sport sedans like the BMW 5-Series or Audi A6, the Stinger backs up its rakish looks with invigorating acceleration and handling, and is also priced comfortably below its European rivals.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/land-rover/discovery/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Off-road ability; available 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seat; upscale interior</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy is improved, but still not great; top trim levels are pricey</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Following its redesign last year, the Land Rover Discovery adds a new model and revises its infotainment control system. A new SVX model with added off-road capability, supercharged 5.0-liter V8, and Hydraulic Active Roll Control is expected to join the range either for the 2018 or 2019 model year. All models now have the larger InControl Touch Pro touchscreen that previously was standard only on upper trims. 4G Wi-Fi is a new feature, along with an available interactive instrument cluster on a TFT display screen. The optional head-up instrument display has been upgraded with larger size and more features. The Land Rover Discovery is a midsize crossover SUV that replaced LR4 in Land Rover’s product roster and slots above the compact Discovery Sport. While the LR4 used truck-like, body-on-frame construction, the Discovery uses aluminum-intensive unibody construction for reduced weight. The Discovery is 5.5 inches longer than the LR4, yet Land Rover claims Discovery is up 1000 pounds lighter. Styling is less boxy than before, and Land Rover’s traditional two-piece tailgate has been replaced by a conventional one-piece liftgate. For those who still want to sit on tailgate at outdoor events, an optional power inner tailgate folds down when the liftgate is open. An optional third-row seat enables the Discovery to seat up to seven passengers. A 340-hp supercharged 3.0-liter V6 is standard, and a 254-horsepower 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel is available; both engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard, and a two-speed transfer case for better off-road performance is optional. As expected of a Land Rover, there is an extensive range of available off-road features: height-adjustable air suspension, All-Terrain Progress Control, automatic terrain response, and hill-descent control. Available luxury features include heated seats for all three rows, heated/cooled/massaging front seats, power-folding second- and third-row seats with smartphone remote control, and park assist. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, driver-condition monitor, lane-departure warning and mitigation, and blind-spot alert. Discovery has the genuine off-road ability expected of a Land Rover, and thanks to a substantial weight reduction, it has improved on-road performance and better fuel economy than the previous LR4. For SUV buyers who really want to venture off the beaten path without giving up modern-day comfort/technology features and on-road civility, the new Discovery is tough to beat.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/land-rover/discovery-sport/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Outstanding off-road capabilities; available third-row seat a rarity in the premium compact SUV class; straightforward control layout; stately cabin materials</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Optional third-row seat is pricey and best suited for children; stingy cargo room behind third row</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport gets a new turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that is offered with two horsepower ratings: 237 and 286. The previous engine was also a 2.0-liter turbo, but rated at 240 hp.  The seat foam composition has been changed for greater comfort and the available power front seats now include 4-way power lumbar adjustment. Also, the available Wi-Fi has been upgraded to 4G.The Discovery Sport is a premium-compact crossover SUV that occupies the spot vacated by the LR2 in Land Rover’s lineup. The Discovery Sport offers an optional third-row seat, though it’s sized for small children and/or occasional use. The second-row seats are mounted “stadium-style”—they are two inches higher than the front seats, so rear passengers have better forward visibility. The second row also slides fore and aft 6 inches to favor passenger or cargo room, and ease to entry to third row. The sole powertrain is the 2.0-liter turbo paired with a 9-speed automatic that is also found in the Range Rover Evoque. All-wheel drive is standard. Available features include a large panoramic sunroof, Autonomous Emergency Braking, blind-spot alert, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and park assist. The Discovery Sport is a compelling entry into the premium compact SUV segment, offering a comfortable, luxuriously appointed interior; Land Rover’s characteristic off-road prowess; and decent cargo room, all at prices that are highly competitive for the class.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/land-rover/range-rover/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Ferocious acceleration in supercharged V8 models; impeccably luxurious cabin; fantastic off-road capabilities, good on-road driving dynamics</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Stratospheric prices, especially in Autobiography models; some complex controls; seating for five only—no 3rd-row is available</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover has revised exterior and interior styling. The infotainment control system is revamped and now has two screens. Horsepower for the supercharged 5.0-liter V8 increases from 510 to 518 in Supercharged and Autobiography models and from 550 to 557 in the topline SVAutobiography Dynamic. Range Rover is a premium large SUV with seating for five. The base engine is a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 that is rated at 340 horsepower. Besides the supercharged V8, a 254-hp 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel is also available. All engines mate to an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive is standard. Available features include massaging seats, heated/cooled seats, power rear seats, hands-free tailgate, adaptive cruise control, surround-view cameras, parking assist, and power door closing. Available safety features include lane-keep assist and autonomous emergency braking. Few SUVs can come close to matching the Range Rover’s combination of good driving dynamics, luxurious accommodations, superb off-road ability, and country-club curb appeal. None of that comes cheap, however, as this is one of the most expensive SUVs around. Most buyers probably don’t need all the Range Rover has to offer, and as such, will likely find better value elsewhere.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/land-rover/range-rover-evoque/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Head-turning, concept-vehicle styling; premium interior trimmings; still boasts impressive off-road capabilities; available convertible</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Stiff pricing, especially considering the 4-cyl. powertrain; cramped back-seat area; impracticality of 2-door convertible</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque gets a new turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that is offered with two horsepower ratings: 237 and 286. The previous engine was also a 2.0-liter turbo that was rated at 240 hp. Evoque’s available Wi-Fi has been upgraded to 4G, while the Evoque 2-door wagon has been discontinued. Ranger Rover Evoque is a premium compact crossover SUV available as a 4-door wagon or 2-door convertible. The only other convertible SUV is the Jeep Wrangler. As expected of a Land Rover, all-wheel drive is standard. Available features include blind-spot alert, lane-keep assist, surround-view camera, adaptive cruise control, heated/cooled front seats, park assist, and hill-descent control. Evoque was created to expand the Range Rover brand’s market reach with a blend of more-affordable pricing, head-turning looks, city-friendly size, zippy performance, reasonable fuel economy, and Land Rover off-road cachet. It succeeds on all those fronts, but it is still too expensive compared to most of its similarly luxurious class rivals. Evoque appeals most to shoppers who place a premium on style and designer-label cachet over value and cargo functionality… and that goes double for the panache-over-practicality Convertible model.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/land-rover/range-rover-sport/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fantastic off-road capabilities; acceleration is gutsy with base V6 and blistering with supercharged V8; improved fuel economy; classy interior; delivers much of the upscale appeal of the original Range Rover at a much lower price</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Even though its pricing significantly undercuts a regular Range Rover, Range Rover Sport is still really expensive; some complicated controls; legroom could be better in both the front and rear; small-item storage in the cabin is only so-so</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport has revised styling inside and out. The available high-performance supercharged 5.0-liter V8 is now rated 518 or 575 horsepower, up from 510 and 550 hp. Range Rover Sport is a premium midsize crossover SUV that seats up to seven passengers with optional third-row seat. Although it shares a name with Land Rover’s topline Range Rover, Range Rover Sport is actually built on a smaller platform and is less expense. The base engine is a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 that produces 340 or 380 horsepower. Better fuel economy is offered by a turbodiesel 3.0-liter V6 with 254 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard and a two-speed transfer case is optional. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, Driver Condition Monitor, Intelligent Speed Limiter, blind-spot alert, lane-keep assist, park assist, Advanced Tow Assist, surround-view camera, hands-free liftgate, height-adjustable suspension, and head-up instrument display. There are other premium SUVs that offer more value for mainstream shoppers, but none of them can match the Range Rover Sport’s blend of on- and off-road handling, invigorating acceleration, regal cabin appointments, high-tech features, and high-end personality. The SVR model is incredibly expensive, but it should provide an interesting alternative to high-performance luxury SUVs such as the BMW X5 M and X6 M.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/land-rover/range-rover-velar/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Exotic, high-end styling inside and out; off-road ability; comprehensive array of safety and convenience features; lots of options for personalization</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Steep pricing; not quite as practical as many class rivals, so-so ride quality</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Land Rover introduces the Range Rover Velar for 2018, an all-new SUV that blends the brands’ trademark off-road prowess with exceptionally sleek, urban styling. We categorize the Velar as a premium compact crossover SUV, though it is on the large end of that class; it slots between the Range Rover Evoque and Range Rover Sport in size. Velar shares an aluminum-intensive basic platform with its corporate cousin, the Jaguar F-Pace. Three engine choices are offered: a 247-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, a 380-hp supercharged 3.0-liter V6, and a 180-hp turbodiesel 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, driver-condition monitor, and blind-spot alert. Other available features include a head-up instrument display, panoramic sunroof, adaptive and height-adjustable air suspension, the Land Rover Terrain Response system, and a locking rear differential. Its sexy, luxurious looks seem more suited for Beverly Hills than a rugged backwoods trail, but the Range Rover Velar is well equipped to handle either environ. Land Rover offers a good range of engine choices and other options to tailor a Velar to your tastes and budget, but this is a pricey-for-its-class SUV in any of its forms.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Lexus ES is unchanged for 2018. ES is a premium midsize car with a choice of a 268-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine in the ES 350 or a hybrid powerplant that combines a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a total of 200 hp in the ES 300h. The V6 has a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid has a CVT. Both models have front-wheel drive. Standard safety features include autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, and adaptive cruise control. Other available features include panoramic sunroof, heated/ventilated front seats, power tilt/telescopic steering wheel, and power rear sunshade. The ES has always been about a serene ride and coddling comfort more than sports-sedan agility. Though the ES’s driving dynamics are athletic enough for most consumers, enthusiast drivers will be better served by the rear-drive Lexus GS, or most premium-midsize class competitors. Still, for buyers who place a high value on comfort, fuel economy, and the Lexus ownership experience, an ES 350 or ES 300h is an excellent choice.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lexus/gs/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong, refined drivetrains in both regular and hybrid form; surprisingly nimble handling, particularly with the F Sport package</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Back seat is more cramped than exterior size would suggest; some drivers dislike interface of Lexus Remote Touch system; steep price premium for hybrid model</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Lexus GS now includes 10 years of complimentary Lexus Enform and Service Connect. The 4-cylinder GS 200t is renamed GS 300. The Lexus GS is comfortable, reasonably sporty, and tastefully finished sedan. GS powertrain choices range from a 241-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder up to a 467-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8. The mid-range GS 350’s 311-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 is smooth and strong. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission—except for the all-wheel drive GS 350, which uses a 6-speed automatic. Standard safety features include the Lexus Safety System +, which includes pre-collision braking, pedestrian detection, and lane-departure mitigation. Prices are steep, particularly as options are added, but overall the GS 350 holds its own well in the premium-midsize class. It strikes a decent balance between the sporty character of the BMW 5-Series and coddling of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, but the fact that it doesn’t really stand out in any one area might put the GS at a disadvantage among discerning luxury-car buyers. The GS F is a high-performance version of the GS sedan designed to compete with BMW M5, Mercedes-Benz AMG E63, and Cadillac CTS-V. The GS 450h hybrid is smooth, quiet, surprisingly fun to drive, and returns excellent fuel economy (more than 30 mpg in our testing). The 450h pairs a 3.5-liter V6 engine with an electric motor for a combined 338 horsepower. The 450h has a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The notion of being luxuriously green comes at a cost: more than $10,000 over the conventional Lexus GS 350, and it’s a chasm that grows wider as you add costly stand-alone and packaged options.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lexus/gx/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressive build quality; off-road and towing capabilities; absorbent ride; luxurious interior</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy; handling and on-road driving dynamics don’t match crossover-SUV competitors; high step-in height complicates entry and exit for shorter occupants</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Lexus GX is little changed with second-row captain’s chairs moving to the options list on the top-trim Luxury model. The Lexus GX is a premium midsize SUV with seating for up to seven passengers. A 301-horsepower 4.6-liter V8 paired with a 6-speed automatic and all-wheel drive is the sole powertrain. Available features include autonomous automatic braking, driver-attention monitor, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure alert, heated/ventilated front seats, power-folding 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seats, adaptive cruise control, and downhill assist control. Car-type crossovers are more popular than traditional body-on-frame SUVs today, so this V8-powered Lexus with serious off-roading hardware really goes against the grain. If you need to tow a trailer or will use the off-road capability of this SUV, the GX 460 deserves consideration. If you’re mainly looking to commute, you’d probably appreciate the more car-like driving experience–and better potential fuel economy–of the Acura MDX, Buick Enclave, or Lexus’s own RX 350.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lexus/is/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Athletic handling; numerous options and option packages; Cabin trim astutely blends luxury and sport</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interior room; V6 fuel economy not outstanding</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, the Lexus IS changes the name of its base model from IS 200t to IS 300. The rear-wheel drive IS 300 retains its 241-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. However, the all-wheel-drive IS 300 is powered by a 260-hp 3.5-liter V6. The IS 350 offers both rear- and all-wheel drive and both have a 311-hp 3.5-liter V6. The V6 engines have slight horsepower gains: the AWD IS 300 increases from 255 to 260 and the IS 350 rises from 306 to 311. Rear-wheel-drive cars have an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a six-speed automatic. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, blind-spot alert, and cross-traffic alert. Other available features include park assist, heated steering wheel, heated/ventilated front seats, power rear sunshade, and power tilt/telescopic steering wheel. The IS’s nimble handling is a highlight, but its aging V6 mean it doesn’t trounce any of its competitors in terms of performance. If you’re in the market for an athletic compact sedan with a convincingly luxurious feel, check out the IS that suits you best, but be sure to scope the Cadillac ATS, BMW 3-Series Sedan, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class as well.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lexus/ls/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Smooth, quiet ride; quality cabin materials; ample rear legroom</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Automatic transmission is slow to downshift; some drivers dislike joystick interface of the infotainment system</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Lexus’s flagship large sedan is redesigned for 2018. The all-new, fifth-generation LS is slightly lower and wider than the previous model. It’s significantly longer, too: The LS line previously offered both standard- and long-wheelbase versions, but the new LS is only available on a 123-inch wheelbase—it’s 1.3 inches longer in wheelbase and 2.1 inches longer overall than the previous long-wheelbase model. A host of new safety features are available, including pedestrian detection with both brake and steering intervention; Lane Trace Assist, a lane-keep-assist feature that can trace the path of a preceding vehicle rather than solely relying on road markings for guidance; front and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking; and Road Sign Assist, which reads stop, speed limit, and yield signs and displays them on a screen. The Executive Package includes reclining and massaging rear seats and an ottoman that can be extended to support the legs of the right-side rear-seat passenger. Powertrains are all-new; the 386-horsepower 4.6-liter V8 is replaced by a 416-hp twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 that is paired with a new 10-speed automatic transmission in LS 500 and sporty LS 500 F Sport models. The LS 500h hybrid is powered by a non-turbo version of the V6 paired with two electric motors, for a total of 354 hp. The LS 500h’s transmission is also a “hybrid,” in that it combines a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with a conventional 4-speed-automatic gear set. All models offer a choice of rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive except for the LS 500 F Sport, which is RWD only. The redesigned 2018 LS brings voluptuous new styling, a long list of cutting-edge technology features, and an impeccably luxurious cabin that can be personalized via an impressive array of trim options. It’s not without its shortcomings—the infotainment interface is complicated and doesn’t include Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and some argue that the twin-turbo V6 doesn’t feel quite as smooth as the old V8 despite the new engine’s superior power. Still, the LS continues its tradition of splendid isolation from noise and road irregularities, and it now feels more agile than before. It’s still a compelling alternative to its European rivals.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lexus/lx/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Smooth, muscular V8 power; impressive off-road capability; near library-quiet cabin; soft yet reasonably composed ride</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy; steep starting price; doesn’t offer significantly more than similar Toyota Land Cruiser</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Lexus LX now offers a “two-row” version that eliminates the third-row seats. Lexus claims that the two-row LX has almost five cubic feet more cargo capacity behind the middle-row seat than the existing three-row version. The Lexus LX 570 is a premium large SUV that is based on the same trucklike body-on-frame platform as the Toyota Land Cruiser. The two-row LX seats five and the three-row version seats eight. A 383-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 mated to an 8-speed automatic is the sole powertrain. Four-wheel drive and a two-speed transfer case are standard. Available features include autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high-beam headlights, and Panoramic View Monitor. This “Lexus Land Cruiser” doesn’t have quite the cachet of the Audi Q7 or Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class. Nor does it have the in-your-face style of the Cadillac Escalade. However, LX 570 offers plenty of room, refinement, and luxury; laudable safety and performance features; and is highly capable off-road. The only reason to pay more for LX 570 over Toyota’s own Land Cruiser is Lexus’ reputation for kid-gloves customer treatment.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Lexus NX has revised styling for 2018. The Lexus Safety System + (pre-collsion w/pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, high-beam assist, lane-keep assist) is now standard on all models. NX is a premium compact crossover SUV that is loosely based on the Toyota RAV4. This five-passenger SUV is available in two versions: the NX 300 (formerly NX 200t), which is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 235 horsepower, and the NX 300h, a hybrid with a 195-hp 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gas/electric powertrain. NX 300 has a six-speed automatic transmission and is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The NX 300h has a CVT transmission and is exclusively all-wheel drive with a system that uses a separate electric motor to drive the rear wheels when necessary. Offered only on 300 models is an F Sport package that adds unique interior and exterior trim and a firmed-up sport suspension. Optional features include a navigation system, park-assist system, heated steering wheel, power-folding and reclining rear seats, power rear liftgate, wireless phone/device charger, sunroof, and blind-spot monitor. The NX is a thoroughly impressive entry into a competitive, growing market segment. Its radical styling may be off-putting to some, but NX backs up its ostentatious looks with compelling powertrains, an athletic driving character, and a truly luxurious feel. Pricing is competitive as well.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Lexus RC is relatively unchanged. The 4-cylinder RC 2.0t and RC 2.0t F Sport models are now badged RC 300 and RC 300 F Sport. The V6 engines each get a 5-horsepower bump in power. The RC is a sporty, low-slung two-door coupe with a performance-oriented “grand tourer” personality. A 241-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder powers the rear-wheel-drive RC 300. The all-wheel-drive RC 300 is powered by a 260-hp 3.5-liter V6. The RC 350 is available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and has a 311-hp 3.5-liter V6. The F Sport models up the sportiness level of the RC 300/350 via adaptive variable suspension and rear-wheel steering (the latter on the rear-drive RC 350 model only), along with unique interior and exterior trim. A limited-slip differential is optional on RC 300 and rear-drive 350 F Sports. The high-performance RC F is rear-wheel drive only and is powered by a 467-hp 5.0-liter V8. All rear-wheel-drive RCs have an 8-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have a 6-speed automatic. Standard features on the RC include keyless access and starting, rear-obstacle detection, Lexus Enform Remote (which allows remote viewing and control of some functions), Siri Eyes Free for iPhone users, and Lexus Enform App Suite which includes apps such as Pandora, Bing, Yelp, and iHeartRadio. Options include leather upholstery, navigation system, heated and ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alert, and memory driver seat. In addition to its muscular V8 engine, the RC F boasts high-performance features such as a sport-tuned suspension, Brembo-brand brakes, and distinctive bodywork, plus an available torque-vectoring rear differential and active rear spoiler (which deploys at around 50 mph). Though they’re not the most ferocious performers in their class, the RC 350 and RC F offer an intriguing blend of performance and luxury with unforgettable styling.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Impressive all-around refinement; exceptionally quiet cabin; F Sport model offers good balance of ride and handling; generous selection of available comfort and safety features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Middling acceleration for the class; so-so cargo capacity; finicky Remote Touch infotainment interface; polarizing styling</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Lexus RX has long been a leader in the premium-midsize-crossover field, but it only offered seating for five. For 2018, an RX L version with three rows of seats and room for up to seven passengers has been added. The new RX L is 4.3 inches longer than the standard-length RX and mimics the RX in terms of powertrains and features. All 2018 Lexus RX/RX Ls now have complimentary Enform Safety Connect and Service Connect for 10 years. Sunroof and blind-spot alert are newly available on base models. Both RX and RX L offer 350 and 450h hybrid models; the 350’s 3.5-liter V6 develops 295 horsepower and the 450h’s gas/electric powertrain puts out 308 hp. The 350 has an eight-speed automatic transmission, while the 450h uses a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Front-wheel drive is standard on 350. All-wheel drive is available on 350 and is standard on 450h. Among the available features are a head-up display, panoramic sunroof, adaptive cruise control, a hands-free power liftgate, power-folding second-row and third-row seats, and an extra-large 12.3-inch infotainment-system screen. Available safety features include includes pre-collision braking, pedestrian detection, 360-degree surround-view cameras, lane-departure warning and mitigation, blind-spot monitor, and rear cross-traffic alert. The radically styled bodywork of the Lexus RX certainly isn’t for everyone, but it cloaks an impressive vehicle. The RX boasts a cabin that is impeccably finished in high-quality materials and it has an engaging driving personality—especially in F Sport models. The RX remains supremely comfortable in any of its forms. If you like its in-your-face styling, the RX should be on your premium midsize SUV shopping list.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Lincoln MKC gains standard Lincoln Connect WiFi. Lincoln entered the premium-compact-SUV segment with the MKC, a new-for-2015 model that shared some of its basic design with the Ford Escape. Front- or all-wheel drive is available, and the base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder that produces 240 horsepower. Offered on all-wheel drive models only is a 285-hp, 2.3-liter version of the base engine. Available upscale features include an electronically adjustable suspension, panoramic sunroof, lane-keep assist, an automatic parallel parking system, and a hands-free tailgate that opens with a swipe of the driver’s foot underneath the rear bumper. MKC’s unique styling and high-class accouterments help justify its price premium over a Ford Escape, and give it a distinctive upscale character. In terms of driving personality, the MKC isn’t quite as sporty as many of its rivals in the premium-compact-SUV class, but since it delivers well on its luxury aspirations, most of its target audience won’t mind.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lincoln/mkt/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong acceleration from turbocharged V6 engine; lots of standard features; classy interior with excellent passenger space in 1st and 2nd rows</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Swoopy styling restricts rear-seat headroom compared to similar Ford Flex; ride quality isn’t particularly luxurious with available 20-inch wheels</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Lincoln MKT is essentially unchanged. Lincoln’s premium midsize crossover SUV has three rows of seats for up to seven passengers. The base MKT has a 300-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 and front-wheel drive. The 3.5L GTDI has a 365-hp turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 and all-wheel drive. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Available features include forward-collision warning, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, cross-traffic alert, inflatable second-row seat belts, adaptive cruise control, panoramic sunroof, refrigerated console, and power-folding third-row seat. MKT has distinctive styling and a comfortable interior. Both it and the Ford Flex on which it is based have a form-follows-function flair, with the Lincoln sacrificing third-row room for rakish lines. The turbocharged engine boasts strong performance for a vehicle this size. The available 20-inch wheels, though, have a rather detrimental impact on ride quality. We’re glad Lincoln has decided to make them optional, rather than standard. While MKT is a competent SUV, there’s very little about it that stands out from the pack. Ultimately, nearly all of its rivals offer more compelling combinations of performance, luxury, and value for the money.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lincoln/mkx/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Spacious, quiet cabin; classy interior materials; cushy ride quality; fine acceleration from Ecoboost V6; good selection of available comfort and safety features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Ecoboost engine’s real-world fuel economy is disappointing; so-so rear visibility; some testers find the push-button gear selector awkward; fully optioned models are a questionable value</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Lincoln MKX is essentially unchanged. MKX is a premium midsize crossover SUV that shares its basic platform with Ford Edge. MKX was redesigned for the 2016 model year. A 303-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 engine is standard and a 335-hp turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 is optional on all models. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. Available features include panoramic sunroof, hands-free liftgate, a 180-degree forward-view camera, blind-spot monitor with rear cross traffic alert, heated and ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel, heated rear seats, and a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system. The current Lincoln MKX does a better job of distancing itself from its mainstream Ford Edge cousin than the first-generation MKX did. The available Ecoboost V6 turbo supplies smooth, ready power, and the supple ride and generous list of available luxury features make the MKX feel like a true premium-class vehicle. The MKX’s primary competitor, the Lexus RX, might outclass it in terms of interior materials and all-around refinement, but the MKX is a credible alternative—particularly if you’re turned off by the RX’s radical styling.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lincoln/mkz/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Well-designed Hybrid model; striking styling, availability of all-wheel drive</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong><span class="s1">Swoopy styling intrudes a bit on rear visibility and compromises rear headroom</span></p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After last year’s refresh, the 2018 Lincoln MKZ is unchanged. The premium midsize MKZ is powered by a 245-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder or a new, Lincoln-exclusive twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 that develops 400 horsepower in all-wheel drive cars or 350 horsepower with front-wheel drive. There is also Hybrid that pairs a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with an electric motor for a combined 188 horsepower. Available safety and technology features include Pre-Collision Assist with pedestrian detection; Auto Hold, which can automatically keep the brakes applied after the vehicle is stopped; continuously-controlled suspension damping; and Dynamic Torque Vectoring, which enhances cornering ability. The Lincoln MKZ has been something of an also-ran among most premium midsize rivals, but the available 400-horsepower engine and new refinements should make it a more compelling proposition.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/lincoln/navigator/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lavishly appointed cabin, cavernous space for people and cargo, crisp acceleration, confident-yet-understated styling</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy, steep pricing, close-quarters maneuverability</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Like its Ford Expedition counterpart, the Lincoln Navigator full-size SUV is redesigned from the ground up for 2018. Chief among the improvements are weight-saving aluminum alloy body panels, a revised engine that puts out significantly more horsepower, a 10-speed automatic transmission in place of the previous 6-speed, a dazzling new interior, and a host of new technology features. As before, standard-length models and extended-length “L” models are available. The model lineup ascends through Premiere, Select, Reserve, and Black Label (the base Premiere model is standard-length only). The sole engine on all is a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that puts out 450 horsepower, a gain of 70 over the outgoing model. As mentioned, a 10-speed automatic is now standard; the line-topping Black Label comes standard with all-wheel drive, and the others offer AWD or rear-wheel drive. Available features include 30-way adjustable “Perfect Position” heated/cooled/massaging front seats, panoramic sunroof, wireless device charging, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, and specially-themed interiors in the Black Label edition. The 2018 Lincoln Navigator is a lot more expensive than its predecessor (base prices rise from about $9000–$16,000 over the previous generation), but it’s also markedly more powerful, luxurious, and cutting-edge than before—and a much more compelling choice when compared against its similarly extravagant class rivals.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mercedes-benz/c-class/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Overall refinement; unique safety features; broad selection of engines; fine ride quality; quietness; thrilling performance of C63 AMG models</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Cozy rear seat; limited trunk space; base model could use some more standard features</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class gains available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. C300 models get a 9-speed automatic transmission in place of the previous 7-speed automatic. C-Class is a premium compact car that was redesigned for 2015. C-Class is more expensive and slightly larger than Mercedes’ entry-level CLA-Class cars. The CLA-Class has standard front-wheel drive, while the C-Class is rear-wheel drive. Base engine for the C-Class is the C300’s 241-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. There is also a C350e plug-in hybrid that pairs the turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gas engine with an electric motor for a total of 275 hp. The C43 AMG is powered by a 362-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter V6. The high-performance C63 has a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that develops 469 hp in the base C63 and 503 hp in C63 S. All engines mate to a 9-speed automatic transmission except C350e and C63 models, which have a 7-speed automatic. C300 is available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. C350e and C63 models are rear-wheel drive only. The C43 has standard all-wheel drive. Safety features include collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian alert, drowsiness alert, and steering assist that keeps the car centered between lane markings. Available comfort and convenience features include ventilated front seats, self parking, panoramic sunroof, hands-free trunklid, and a fragrance atomizer for the ventilation system. The redesigned C-Class moved a bit upscale in size and prestige. Its strong points include regal cabin appointments and an impressive array of comfort, safety, and technology features. Prices are steep, but the C-Class is a compelling premium-compact car choice.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mercedes-benz/e-class/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> All-around refinement; ride quality and composure; innovative safety and technology features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Steep prices; control interface is complicated to use; stingy cargo room in coupes and convertibles</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mercedes-Benz E-Class line gains redesigned coupe and convertible models that are newly available with all-wheel drive. The E-Class sedan and station wagon were redesigned last year and now the 2-door models join them on the new platform. Also new is an AMG E63 S with a 603-horsepower turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 and standard all-wheel drive. A new E400 sedan with a 329-hp twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 joins the E400 wagon. E300 models have a 241-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. A high-performance AMG E43 model packs a 396-hp version of the E400’s V6. A 9-speed automatic transmission is standard with all  engines. The E-Class offers a host of safety and autonomous-driving technology. Mercedes-Benz says the E-Class’s automatic-braking system is effective in avoiding accidents at speeds up to 43 mph and can apply brakes to avoid accidents involving cross traffic at intersections. If the car senses an imminent side collision, it can inflate bolsters to move front-seat passengers away from the doors. Also in case of an imminent accident, the stereo will emit a loud sound to trigger a natural reflex in the ears that will protect the passengers’ hearing from the loud sounds of a crash. The E-Class offers other cutting-edge technological features as well. “Car-to-X” communication uses cell-phone technology to exchange information about the road ahead and warn drivers of possible hazards. Drive Pilot is an autonomous driving aid that steers, brakes, and accelerates to follow traffic at speeds up to 130 mph. Remote Parking Pilot allows the vehicle to be moved into and out of garages and parking spaces remotely using a smartphone app. The E-Class wagon has a hands-free-opening tailgate, along with most of the innovations offered on the sedan. The E-Class is a technological tour de force, offering groundbreaking features that aren’t matched by its class rivals. Helping to justify its steep pricing are exceptional build quality and smooth powertrains.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mercedes-benz/gla-class/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Invigorating driving personality, particularly in AMG model; classy cabin trimmings; good-for-the-class fuel economy</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited cargo capacity compared to most class competitors; firm ride, especially in AMG model; back seat is tight for large adults; swoopy roofline makes for subpar visibility; louder than many rivals</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class has few changes. The bumpers have been revised and a rearview camera is now standard. LED headlights and Android Auto are newly available. With its unique bob-tailed body shape, the GLA-Class is one of the more car-like vehicles in the premium compact SUV class. The GLA is based on the European-market Mercedes-Benz A-Class hatchback, but has a raised ride height and beefier styling features. The entry-level GLA250 has a 208-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The performance-oriented GLA45 AMG comes only with all-wheel drive and packs a muscled-up, 355-hp version of the base model’s engine. Both engines mate to a seven-speed automated-manual transmission. GLA shares its platform and 208-hp engine with Infiniti QX30, but has unique styling and suspension settings. Though the GLA sports a rather “urban” feel overall, it does offer hill-descent control and an off-road transmission mode for off-the-beaten-path use. Available safety features include Collision Prevention Assist, lane-departure warning, and blind-spot alert. The GLA favors agile handling and swoopy styling over a smooth ride and passenger/cargo functionality. It’s exciting on a twisty road, but other class competitors are more livable and practical in the daily grind.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC gains new high-performance AMG models and a plug-in hybrid. The AMG GLC63 and AMG GLC63 Coupe are powered by a 469-horsepower turbocharged 4.0-liter V8, while  an AMG GLC63 S Coupe has a 503-hp version of that engine. The GLC 350e plug-in hybrid has a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine combined with an electric motor for a total of 320 hp. In 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC replaced Mercedes’ GLK premium compact SUV. The GLC is based on the C-Class sedan platform and is available as a conventional SUV or a “Coupe” variation with a sloping rear roofline. GLC300 is powered by a 241-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine, while GLC43 has a by a 362-horsepowwer turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine. All engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission—except the 350e hybdrid that has a 7-speed automatic. All GLCs are all-wheel drive except the base GLC 300 which is available with rear-wheel drive. Standard safety features include collision mitigation, driver-fatigue monitor, and Crosswind Assist. Available features include LED headlights, cabin fragrance system, adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian recognition, Steering Assist, lane-keep assist, and Cross-Traffic Assist. The GLC is a refined SUV with firm, but well-controlled, suspension. The interior has a solidly upscale look and feel, although leather upholstery is optional. The GLC has ample interior room, although rear-seat legroom is adequate rather than generous. With the GLC, Mercedes-Benz has made an attractive and useful luxury SUV for what starts out as an enticing price that can quickly blossom.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mercedes-benz/gle-class/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good range of engine choices; classy, well-finished cabin; quietness; blistering acceleration in high-performance GLE63 models</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Thirsty for premium gasoline, especially GLE63; high prices on upper trim levels; some complicated controls</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class sees a horsepower gain for its GLE43 model. The GLE43’s turbocharged V6 is now rated at 385 hp— an increase of 23. Otherwise, GLE is essentially unchanged. GLE-Class is a premium midsize crossover SUV that occupies a place in the Mercedes’ lineup that was held by the M-Class through 2015. GLE is offered as a conventional wagon and in a “coupe” bodystyle. The coupe is a 4-door fastback version that sacrifices rear headroom and cargo space for style. The base GLE350 has a 302-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine. The AMG GLE43 has 385-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter V6. A turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 is rated at 550 hp in AMG GLE63 and 577 in AMG GLE63 S. There is also a plug-in hybrid GLE550e model that has a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine and an electric motor with a combined horsepower of 436. All engines are paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission—except the AMG GLE43 turbo 3.0-liter V6 which has a new nine-speed automatic. GLE350 offers both rear- and all-wheel drive, while all other models have standard all-wheel drive. Available features include park assist, surround-view cameras, LED headlights, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, drowsiness monitor, and cross-traffic alert. GLE-Class is very refined, solidly built, and pleasant to drive. High points include the comfortable, well-finished interior and excellent powertrains. Think of the high-performance GLE63 S as a suede- and leather-lined cruise missile. It commands a significant price premium, but it is arguably the most well rounded high-power luxury SUV on the market with its admirable blend of performance, comfort, and refinement. The long list of available options can quickly raise the sticker’s bottom line, but GLE-Class is a fine premium midsize SUV that deserves serious consideration.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mercedes-benz/gls-class/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent build quality; broad range of engine choices; quiet cabin</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Second and 3rd-row seats aren’t as spacious as many premium-large SUVs’; steep price premium of AMG GLS63 model</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is essentially unchanged. In 2017, Mercedes changed the name of its largest crossover SUV from GL to GLS to better sync up with the naming structure of its passenger cars. Three engines are offered. GLS450 is powered by a 362-horsepower turbocharged 3.0-liter V6. The GLS550 has a turbocharged 4.7-liter V8 with 449 hp and the high-performance AMG GLS63 has a 577-hp turbocharged 5.5-liter V8. GLS450 and GLS550 have a 9-speed automatic transmission, while AMG GLS63 has a 7-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is standard. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, driver-attention monitor, adaptive cruise control, adaptive headlight high beams, lane-keep assist, and blind-spot alert. Other available features include park assist, surround-view camera, panoramic sunroof, and power-folding third-row seats. The 7-passenger GLS-Class doesn’t have the sheer interior volume of some premium large SUVs, but its accommodations are more than adequate for the majority of buyers. Relatively trim exterior dimensions ease parking and maneuverability, too. Any GLS offers impressive power and high levels of refinement. Note that prices climb quickly as you add options, particularly the Designo interior packages and Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. The AMG GLS63 model is for high rollers only.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mini/cooper-countryman/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Mini style and unique character; sporty driving personality; addition of plug-in-hybrid model</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Pricey compared to many class competitors; base engine might not have enough power for many buyers; quirky controls</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, the Mini Copper Countryman gets Mini’s first plug-in hybrid model—the Cooper S E ALL4. The new Cooper S E ALL4 plug-in hybrid pairs a 1.5-liter three-cylinder turbo engine with an electric motor for a combined 221 hp—it comes exclusively with a six-speed automatic transmission. Apple CarPlay compatibility is newly available on all models. The Mini Countryman was redesigned for 2017 and it shares a basic platform with BMW’s X1 SUV (BMW is Mini’s parent company). With the redesign, Countryman gained significantly more passenger and cargo room. The Countryman is a subcompact SUV with seating for five. The base Cooper engine is a 134-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder. Cooper S models have a 189-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The same engine is tuned to produce 228 hp in the performance-oriented John Cooper Works model. All of the above engines have a standard six-speed manual transmission. A six-speed automatic transmission is optional for the base Cooper, while an eight-speed automatic is optional for Cooper S and John Cooper Works models. The base Cooper and Cooper S have standard front-wheel drive and are available with all-wheel drive, while the John Cooper Works and S E ALL4 are AWD only. Standard on all models are panoramic sunroof, rearview camera, Bluetooth, keyless access and starting, rain-sensing wipers, and rear parking sensors. Available features include a hands-free power liftgate, adaptive cruise control, and head-up instrument display. The new Countryman continues Mini’s tradition of spunky, expressive styling and engaging driving dynamics while adding welcome space for both cargo and people. You’ll still pay a premium for the trademark Mini personality, but the Countryman’s upsized dimensions make it a more practical entry in the subcompact SUV category. Plus, the S E ALL4 plug-in hybrid  is a fine addition to the range.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mini/cooper-hardtop/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Agile handling; impressive fuel economy; peppy acceleration in S model; long list of options and personalization features; good all-around visibility</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Control layout favors whimsical design over ergonomics; taut ride, especially on S model; cramped rear seat space and cargo room; difficult entry and exit on 4-door model; pricey options add up quickly; premium fuel required</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mini Copper Hardtop is relatively unchanged. Rearview camera and rear parking sensors are now standard. Windshield wiper and turn signal stalks no long return to center, but stay in position. Also, Apple CarPlay capability is now available. Mini Cooper Hardtops are front-wheel drive, subcompact hatchbacks available in two- and four-door versions. Because of the Mini’s handling and performance we include it our Sporty/Performance Car group. Base Coopers have a 134-horsepower turbocharged 3-cylinder engine; the sporty S model gets a 189-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder (which is hopped up to 228 hp in the John Cooper Works model). Both engines offer the choice of either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. A broad range of optional technology features is available, including some rare-for-the-class features such as a self-parking system, heads-up display, and adaptive cruise control. The 2014 revamp brought slightly bigger dimensions that give this third-generation Mini Cooper a bit more space inside than its predecessor, but the car’s quirky personality and nimble, caffeinated driving character carry over intact. The 4-Door offers the passenger- and cargo versatility of two extra doors, but its stingy door openings make for tricky entry and exit. Mini Coopers are a bit pricey compared to some of the subcompact hatchbacks they’re often shopped against, especially when the optional equipment is added. However, if you want a little enthusiast attitude in your commuter hatchback–along with the ability to personalize it to your tastes–a Mini Cooper is worth checking out.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mitsubishi/eclipse-cross/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Crisp handling; well-equipped for the price; good cargo capacity</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Awkward control layout; forward collision warning and mitigation only available on top model; poor rear visibility</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Mitsubishi introduces a boldly styled new compact crossover. The Eclipse Cross slots between the subcompact Outlander Sport and compact Outlander in Mitsubishi’s SUV lineup. While the Outlander offers three-row seating and is one of the largest compact crossovers, the 5-passenger Eclipse Cross is on the small side of the compact-SUV class. The sole powertrain is a 152-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter 4-cylinder paired with a CVT automatic transmission. The base ES model has front-wheel drive, but offers all-wheel drive as an option. All other models have standard all-wheel drive. Available safety features include forward-collision warning and mitigation, pedestrian detection, blind-spot alert, lane-departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control. Available comfort and convenience features include a head-up instrument display, heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, panoramic sunroof, keyless access and starting, automatic high-beam headlights, and 360-degree camera display. The new Eclipse Cross has a sporty nature thanks to its aggressive looks, compact dimensions, and good handling, and it stands out in its class by offering generous levels of equipment at a reasonable price. Mitsubishi isn’t the first name to come to mind when compact SUVs are discussed, but the Eclipse Cross might offer enough off-the-beaten-path appeal to make it a fine alternative for some shoppers.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/mitsubishi/outlander/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Peppy acceleration with V6 engine; versatile all-wheel-system; some rare-for-the-class features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Weak acceleration with 4-cylinder engine; third-row seat is cramped and uncomfortable for most adults; overly sensitive lane-departure warning system</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander gains new plug-in hybrid models. Otherwise Outlander is little changed—except for some shuffling of equipment. A multi-view camera and heated steering wheel are now standard on topline GT. SEL gains standard blind-spot alert and rear cross-traffic alert, while the base ES gets a standard 7-inch touchscreen and Bluetooth. Outlander is a compact crossover SUV with three rows of seating for up to seven passengers. The base powertrain is a 166-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder mated to a CVT transmission. GT has a 224-hp 3.0-liter V6 engine paired with a six-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive. All other conventional gas models offer a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The PHEV plug-in hybrid combines a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with twin electric motors for a combined 197 hp. The PHEV is capable of up to 22 miles on electric power only. All PHEVs are all-wheel drive. Available safety features include forward-collision warning and mitigation, pedestrian detection, and lane-departure warning. Multi-view rearview camera, adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights, keyless access and starting, and LED headlights are among the other available features. Though its overall refinement doesn’t match some class competitors, the Outlander is nevertheless a worthwhile entry in the compact SUV segment. The GT, with its standard V6 power and exceptional handling, is surprisingly fun to drive. Outlander should appeal to three types of shoppers: those who want a sporty SUV at a reasonable price; those who covet 3-row seating but don’t want to drive a larger vehicle; and those who place heavy emphasis on crash-preventative safety technology.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Mitsubishi Outland Sport has revised styling for 2018. Forward-collision mitigation and lane-departure warning are newly available as part of an option package for the topline SEL model. A 7-inch control screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability is now standard on all models. Plus, there is a new-generation CVT automatic transmission with the 2.4-liter engine. The GT model has been dropped. Outlander Sport is a crossover subcompact SUV with seating for five. The engine in base ES trim is a 148-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder that mates to a five-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission. All other models have a 168-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a CVT automatic transmission. All trims offer a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Available features include panoramic glass roof panel, keyless access and starting, automatic high-beam headlights, and rain-sensing wipers. Outlander Sport’s bobtail styling gives it a unique personality, and for the most part, its driving character lives up to the sporty looks. However, its drivetrain behavior isn’t as refined as most class competitors, and its pricing can get rather steep as you add options. Fortunately, most of the factory packages are little more than window dressing and can be easily skipped. If you’re looking for a versatile urban runabout, a modestly equipped Outlander Sport might make some sense.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/altima/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple, user-friendly control layout; comfortable, absorbent ride with composed, predictable handling; decent back-seat space; good fuel economy with 4-cylinder engine</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Rather noisy when accelerating, especially with 4-cylinder engine</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Altima gains standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Altima is a front-wheel drive, midsize sedan. The topline 3.5 SL is powered by a 270-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine. All other Altimas have a 179-hp 2.5-liter 4-cylinder. Both engines are paired with a CVT automatic transmission. Safety features include blind-spot alert and cross-traffic alert. The Altima does exactly what most shoppers expect from a midsize sedan. It has a nicely appointed cabin, rides well, and, at least in 4-cylinder form, delivers excellent fuel economy. It’s noisier than the class norm, and the rear seating area is a bit short on headroom, but these negatives are fairly minor. Despite these shortcomings, Altima remains a solid choice that offers good value for your money.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/armada/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong engine; quiet, classy interior; straightforward infotainment controls; tight turning radius for a large SUV</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy; some visibility issues; front-seat legroom is less than generous for the class; high step-in height makes entry and exit challenging for some occupants</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After last year’s redesign, the Nissan Armada is relatively unchanged for 2018. A rearview camera mirror is available and NissanConnect Services are now standard. Armada shares its basic platform with the Nissan Patrol (a large SUV sold in various global markets) and the luxury-grade Infiniti QX80 SUV. A direct-injection 5.6-liter V8 engine puts out 390 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. A 7-speed automatic with adaptive shift control and downshift rev matching is the lone transmission. The Armada offers rear-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive and seat seven or eight passengers (depending on whether captain’s chairs or a bench seat are selected for the second row). Among the available comfort and convenience features are heated/cooled front seats, power rear liftgate, front/rear park assist system, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with dual screens built into the front-seat headrests. Available safety features include LED headlights, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, forward emergency braking, lane-keep assist, lane departure warning, blind-spot monitor with warning, and a surround-view monitor. The traditional truck-type SUV market has been losing ground to smaller, more-efficient crossover SUVs in recent years, but there is still a place for “real” SUVs that can haul eight people, tow a trailer, and/or handle challenging off-road terrain that a crossover SUV can’t quite hack. The Nissan Armada is a credible entry in this segment, providing a worthwhile alternative to the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Ford Expedition, and Toyota Sequoia.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/frontier/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong V6; comfortable ride for a truck; great off-road capability in PRO-4X models; extensive selection of models and optional equipment</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Interior materials not as refined as class competitors; cramped, uncomfortable back seat in “King Cab” extended-cab models; tall step-in height on 4WD models</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Frontier gains a standard rearview camera for all models. Base S models now have standard air conditioning, cruise control, Bluetooth connectivity, and Siri voice recognition. There is also a new Midnight Edition package with unique trim. Nissan’s compact pickup is available in “King Cab” extended cab and crew cab versions that seat five passengers. The extended cab has a 6-ft bed, while crew cabs offer both 5-ft and 6-ft beds. The base engine is a 2.5-liter four cylinder with 152 horsepower. A 261-hp 4.0-liter V6 is available on extended-cab trucks and is standard on crew cabs. The 4-cylinder can be ordered with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the V6 is available with a 6-speed manual. Both engines mate to a 5-speed automatic. The redesigned Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, and Toyota Tacoma easily trump the long-running Frontier simply by the virtue of being new designs. Still, Nissan’s compact pickup is laudable for its controlled handling, powerful V6, and off-road-oriented PRO-4X model. The interior offers easy-to-use controls but disappoints with too much plastic and too little rear-seat room, even in the Crew Cab. Check out the competition first, but the Frontier remains a decent choice for those who don’t need or want the bulk of a full-size pickup.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/kicks/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Automatic emergency braking is standard; projected fuel economy; good cargo room for the size; smooth, quiet ride</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> AWD is not available; some so-so interior materials; folded rear seat backs don’t rest flat with the cargo floor</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Kicks is a new subcompact crossover SUV that slots below the Nissan Rogue Sport in size and price. The Kicks essentially replaces the discontinued Nissan Juke. It is three inches shorter than Rogue Sport and, unlike most other SUVs, is front-wheel drive only; AWD is not available. The sole powertrain is a 125-horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). A forward-collision warning system with automatic emergency braking is standard. Available features include blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, 360-degree Intelligent Around-View Monitor with moving-object detection, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and LED headlights. The lack of available all-wheel drive is a demerit for buyers in Northern climes, but the Nissan Kicks’s affordable pricing, respectable passenger and cargo room for its size, pleasant driving manners, and surprisingly low noise levels make it a fine value in its class.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/leaf/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Satisfying acceleration, smooth ride, nicely finished cabin in top-line trim, competitive pricing for a pure-electric vehicle</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Estimated driving range of 150 miles is better than previous-generation Leaf, but is still topped by the Chevrolet Bolt EV</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Nissan’s pure-electric 5-passenger compact hatchback is redesigned for 2018, gaining new safety and technology features, increased driving range, and a sportier look and feel. The 2018 Nissan LEAF has an estimated driving range of 150 miles, compared to 107 for last year’s model; Nissan says that a larger-battery version of the LEAF that offers about 200 miles of range will join the lineup in the near future. (For comparison, the Chevrolet Bolt EV boasts an estimated 238-mile driving range, but it costs around $5000-$6000 more than the LEAF.) In addition to the greater driving range, the new powertrain makes 147 horsepower, compared to the previous generation’s 107. The LEAF’s newly standard “ePedal” switch can enable “one-pedal” driving—it increases regenerative braking to the point that using the physical brake pedal is virtually unnecessary. Newly available features include heated front seats and steering wheel, a 360-degree surround-view camera display, and Nissan’s ProPILOT Assist feature, which pairs adaptive cruise control with automatic lane-centering steering assistance. The all-new Nissan LEAF can’t claim a class-leading driving range, but it offers peppy acceleration, an engaging driving personality, a fairly spacious cabin for its size, and a host of desirable high-tech features… all at prices that comfortably undercut the Chevrolet Bolt EV.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/maxima/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Delivers an extra dose of style and performance while maintaining mainstream 4-door-sedan practicality and affordability; classy interior trimmings; good selection of trim levels and available features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Rear-seat space and trunk room are stingy compared to many midsize-sedan competitors; stiff ride with SR model’s sport suspension and 19-inch wheels; non-SR models aren’t quite as agile as the “4-door sports car” moniker promises</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Maxima is little changed. Maxima gains standard Android Auto capatability , in addition to the already standard Apple CarPlay. Nissan’s “4-door sports car” midsize sedan was redesigned from the ground up for 2016. It has dramatic styling, a 3.5-liter V6 that puts out 300 horsepower, and a host of safety and technology features. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is the lone gearbox available, but it’s a performance-oriented “XTronic” unit with Nissan’s D-Step shifting logic for a more-responsive feel. Among the Maxima’s features are remote engine start, a Drive Mode Selector that offers Normal and Sport settings, and a standard navigation system. Available safety features include Predictive Forward Collision Warning, Forward Emergency Braking, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Blind Spot Warning, and Driver Attention Alert. The Maxima’s aggressive styling, 300-hp V6, and various tech features help it stand out from all the Altimas, Honda Accords, and Toyota Camrys. However, it’s not as spacious inside as the top midsize sedans, and it’s not as prestigious or athletic as luxury-brand sport sedans. As such, the Nissan Maxima is a fine choice for buyers who are looking for a bit more spice in their mainstream midsize sedan, but don’t want to step up to the higher costs of a luxury-brand sport sedan.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/murano/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Smooth continuously-variable transmission (CVT) contributes to excellent throttle response; straightforward control layout; flat-folding second-row seats offer improved cargo hauling capability</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Love-it-or-hate-it styling; lackluster handling dynamics; swoopy styling cuts into cargo capacity somewhat; some mediocre interior materials</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Murano gains standard automatic emergency braking and forward-collision alert. Trim levels of this midsize crossover SUV ascend through Nissan’s typical S, SV, SL, and Platinum levels; all are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The lone drivetrain choice is a 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Available features include a 360-degree “Around View” camera system, panoramic sunroof, heated/cooled front seats and heated back seats, power liftgate, adaptive cruise control, and rear cross-traffic alert. Murano’s driving personality isn’t as dynamic or polished as its swoopy look would suggest, and the interior’s execution falls a bit short of Murano’s upscale aspirations. Still, this is a comfortable, likable crossover that offers an excellent blend of passenger-car and SUV attributes.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/pathfinder/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Competitive pricing; user-friendly audio and climate controls; comfortable ride, especially in highway cruising</p>, <p><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Cons: </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">Disappointing fuel economy; higher noise levels than many class competitors; 3rd-row seating is sized for kids</span></p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Pathfinder has few changes after its significant updates last year. Automatic emergency braking is now standard. A new Rear Door Alert reminds drivers to check the backseat for passengers before leaving the vehicle. Pathfinder is a crossover midsize SUV with three rows of seating. The sole powertrain is a 284-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 paired with a CVT transmission. Front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive are available on all models. Available features include surround-view camera with moving-object detection, hands-free liftgate, and adaptive cruise control. Nissan’s 7-passenger midsize SUV offers smooth power and excellent cargo flexibility, along with fine driving manners and a good selection of features at reasonable prices. The Pathfinder’s primary demerit is real-world fuel economy that doesn’t live up to many class competitors.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/rogue/
[<p><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-26764" height="80" src="http://consumerguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cgbb18_160.png" width="80"/>Pros:</strong> Availability of Hybrid version; respectable fuel-economy; broad range of standard and available equipment; generously sized, versatile rear cargo area</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Mediocre acceleration; transmission isn’t as responsive as some class competitors; engine is noisy during acceleration</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Rogue gains available ProPILOT Assist, a “semi-autonomous” driver-assist system that pairs adaptive cruise control functionality with automatic lane-centering steering assist (the driver must keep their hands on the steering wheel). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility is now standard on all Rogues. A third-row seat is no longer available. The Rogue Hybrid combines an electric motor with a 2.0-liter engine to produce a total of 176 horsepower; non-hybrid models have a 170-horsepower 2.5-liter four. All Rogues have a CVT transmission and are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Available safety features include forward-collision warning and mitigation with pedestrian detection, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure mitigation, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high-beam headlights. Other available features include heated steering wheel and hands-free power liftgate. The Nissan Rogue’s numerous enhancements for 2017 made it an even more compelling choice in its highly competitive segment, and the addition of Apple CarPlay/Android Auto capability and Nissan’s ProPILOT system for 2018 make it that much more appealing. Rogue’s acceleration is a bit sluggish, but its classy interior trimmings and outstanding cargo versatility rank among the best in its class. The Rogue Hybrid is a fine alternative to the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid and Kia Niro.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/rogue-sport/
[<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Leisurely acceleration; so-so EPA fuel-economy ratings</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> After its introduction last year, the 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport sees only a shuffling of optional equipment. The Rogue Sport is a subcompact crossover that slots between Nissan’s Rogue and the new subcompact crossover Kicks; it’s a foot shorter than Rogue and 3 inches longer than Kicks. (Kicks is expected to be in dealers this summer.) Though it’s new to the American market, the Rogue Sport has been sold in several other countries since 2014 as the Qashqai. And though it shares a first name and some styling cues with the Rogue, the Rogue Sport is not just a shorter version of its big brother—it has a unique platform and a smaller engine. A 141-horsepower 2.0-liter four cylinder paired with a CVT automatic transmission is the sole powertrain. S, SV, and SL trim levels are available, all with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Available safety features include a blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision warning and emergency braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, and pedestrian detection. Other available features include keyless access and starting, heated steering wheel, surround-view cameras, LED headlights, and adaptive cruise control. The Rogue Sport is on the large side for a subcompact SUV and therefore has good interior and cargo room for the class. The available Divide-N-Hide Cargo System makes the most of the cargo area. Acceleration is only adequate, but Rogue Sport has a well-controlled ride and fine handling. It’s definitely worth a look if you’re in the market for a small SUV.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/sentra/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Competitive pricing; absorbent ride; rear seat and trunk space rank among the best in the class; good fuel economy; simple control layout</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Subpar acceleration on non-sport models; one of the noisiest cars in the compact class; non-sport models have lackluster handling, with noticeable body lean in turns and limited cornering grip</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Sentra gains standard automatic emergency braking for all models except manual-transmission equipped cars and NISMO. All models now have a rearview camera and 5-inch control screen. Sentra is a compact sedan. The standard engine is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with 124 horsepower when paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or 130 hp with a six-speed manual transmission. The SR Turbo and NISMO models have a turbocharged 188-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. SR Turbo has uprated brakes and sport suspension, while  NISMO adds performance suspension and unique exterior trim. Available safety features include blind-spot alert and rear cross-traffic alert. Adaptive cruise control, power driver’s seat, Siri Eyes Free capability, and NissanConnect telematics are also available. Sentra’s combination of a spacious trunk and back seat, excellent EPA fuel-economy ratings, and high features-per-dollar quotient look very appealing, at least on paper. In practice, the base Sentras are slow, don’t handle exceptionally well, and are extremely noisy. (The exceptions are SR Turbo and NISMO that are quicker with better handling than mainstream Sentras.) Sentra’s features that do stand out are more than overshadowed by its dynamic shortcomings. Given the fact that most rivals have similar strengths without such glaring weaknesses, this is a tough car to recommend.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/titan/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Redesigned model offers new comfort, convenience, safety, and utility features; Titan XD model could hit “just-right” market niche in between half-ton and heavy-duty pickup trucks</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Significant price premium for Cummins diesel engine; overall model lineup remains limited compared to domestic-brand competitors; lack of fuel-efficient V6 engine</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Nissan Titan is unchanged, except for the addition of an available Midnight Edition package with 20-inch black wheels and black exterior trim. Titan is offered in half-ton and XD series. Titan XD essentially splits the difference between a traditional half-ton pickup and a heavy-duty three-quarter-ton model. Nissan claims the Titan XD model has a maximum towing capacity of more than 12,000 pounds, but offers the fuel efficiency and affordability of a half-ton pickup. Both series are available in regular cab, extended cab, and crew cab. XD is powered by either a 310-horsepower 5.0-liter Cummins diesel with 555 lb-ft of torque or a gasoline 390-hp 5.6-liter V8 with 394 lb-ft of torque. The 5.6-liter gas engine is only engine choice for half-ton models. The gas engine is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel has a 6-speed automatic. Available features include blind-spot alert, LED headlights, heated/cooled front seats, 360-degree monitor, and trailer sway control. Titan’s recent redesign makes it competitive with other full-size pickups. Plus, the XD’s middle ground between half-ton and three-quarter-ton might be just right for some customers. Titan’s generous 5-years or 100,000-miles warranty is another incentive for big pickup buyers to give Titan a look.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/nissan/versa/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Value pricing; dexterity in city commuting; fuel economy; rare-for-the-class features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Lots of noise; meager power at highway speeds; built-to-a-price cabin materials</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Nissan Versa drops its topline SL model, but gains standard variable-intermittent wipers, map lights, and adjustable front headrests for all models. The Versa compact sedan is one of the least expensive cars on the market. Note that the Versa sedan is also available in a hatchback body style called Versa Note (see separate report). The sole engine is a 109-horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with a choice of 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmissions. Although the base S and mid-level S Plus versions of the Versa are somewhat sparsely equipped by today’s standards, the top-line SV and SV Special Edition models have all the expected features at a price that looks good even against smaller subcompact rivals. Power can feel meager at higher speeds and some of the interior materials don’t impress, but if interior room, cargo space, and high fuel economy are tops on your list, the Versa is a must-see.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Value pricing; dexterity in city commuting; fuel economy; cargo versatility of hatchback body style</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Lots of noise; meager power at highway speeds; built-to-a-price cabin materials</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, the Nissan Versa Note’s topline SL trim is dropped and the base S Plus model is renamed S. SR is now the top trim and gains standard keyless access and starting, as well as Easy Fill Tire Alert. Versa Note is a compact four-door hatchback that seats five. Bear in mind that this car is also available in a sedan body style called Versa (see separate report). A 109-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is the sole drivetrain. Although the base S version of Versa Note is rather sparsely equipped by today’s standards, the top-line SR has all the expected features at a price that looks good even against smaller subcompact rivals.

----------http://consumerguide.com/porsche/cayenne/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> One of the sharpest-handling midsize SUVs around; spectacular acceleration in Turbo models; impeccably finished interior; lots of high-tech features</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Stiff ride gets worse with the available 21-inch wheels; copious fuel thirst in Turbo models; complicated, button-heavy control layout; sky-high prices</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Porsche Cayenne is essentially unchanged. Cayenne is a premium midsize SUV with seating for five. Not surprisingly, the literal “Porsche of SUVs” goes, stops, and handles more like a welterweight sports sedan than a burly wagon. But though few rivals come close to matching Cayenne’s on-road abilities, many offer superior ride comfort and/or off-road prowess and at least as much in the way of luxury features. Available features include power sunshades, front and rear ventilated seats, heated windshield, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, autonomous braking, lane-departure warning, LED headlights, and ceramic brakes. Porsches appeal to serious drivers, so those folks will be most attracted to the rapid, tautly sprung V8 models. The top-engine choices are a turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 rated 520 hp in Turbo or 570 in Turbo S. Other Cayennes are less awe-inspiring, but are still plenty quick and rather more frugal to own and operate. The base 3.6-liter V6 puts out 300 hp, while a turbocharged 3.6-liter V6 develops 440 hp. The plug-in E-Hybrid is one of the most refined gas/electric vehicles of any kind and is said to be capable of traveling up to 14 miles on electric power alone. All Cayennes have an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. As with other Porsches, though, top-flight engineering and a platinum-grade brand image carry a high price–too high, in our view, unless you understand and value the “Porsche Way.” But if you can afford to indulge, the 2018 Porsche Cayenne is a compelling alternative to usual-suspect premium SUVs, and more exclusive with it. We’d opt for a modestly equipped S or Hybrid as the best blend of practicality and performance.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/porsche/macan/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Vigorous acceleration, especially in Turbo model; excellent handling and agility; broad range of available features and customization options</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Steep prices (especially on Turbo model) get even steeper as options are added; ride quality gets stiffer with available 21-inch wheels; so-so cargo room</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Porsche Macan is unchanged for 2018. The Macan is essentially a junior version of the Porsche Cayenne, and it shares some of its basic structure with the Audi Q5. Macan is offered in four trim levels: Base models have a turbocharged 252-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, S models have a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that puts out 340 horsepower, that engine develops 360 horsepower in GTS models, while Turbo models have a turbocharged 3.6-liter V6 that makes 400 hp. Porsche’s PDK 7-speed automated-manual transmission is standard on all models. Available features include a variety of on-road and off-road performance equipment, such as Active Suspension Management, launch control, summer performance tires, torque-vectoring rear differential, hill-descent control, and air suspension (which can raise the ride height to 9.1 inches for off-roading). Naturally, plenty of luxury gear is available as well, including a 16-speaker Burmester audio system, Alcantera headliner, panoramic sunroof, 18-way power front seats, heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, and adaptive headlights. Available safety features include lane-keep assist, blind-spot warning, front and rear park assist, and adaptive cruise control. The Macan is easily the quickest, most athletic vehicle in the premium compact SUV class. Its exceptional performance comes at exceptional prices, but this compact hauler does the Porsche name proud.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/subaru/brz/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lithe, agile handling; true sports-car personality; nice selection of standard equipment; good fuel economy for a sports car; relatively affordable pricing</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Some enthusiast drivers will wish for more power; low-slung body and long doors make for tricky entry and exit; barely usable back seat; no options available</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Subaru BRZ has an upgraded infotainment control system on Limited and the new tS trim. The tS is a limited-production model with has sport suspension, upgraded brakes, aerodynamic enhancements, and unique trim. BRZ is a rear-wheel-drive sporty/performance coupe with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that develops 200 horsepower with a 6-speed automatic transmission or 205 hp with a 6-speed manual. Like its near twin, the Toyota 86 (formerly Scion FR-S), the Subaru BRZ attempts to blend the pure enthusiast appeal of a finely honed rear-wheel-drive sports car with the accessibility and everyday practicality of a compact economy car. It succeeds on most counts. The typical sporty-coupe demerits–most notably a somewhat stiff ride and a tiny back-seat area–are here, but they’re tempered by the BRZ’s respectable fuel-economy numbers and sprightly all-around performance.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/subaru/xv-crosstrek/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fine balance of car and SUV traits; good fuel economy; comfortable, well-finished interior</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Engine power is only adequate; interior storage is only average</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Subaru Crosstrek is redesigned for 2018, gaining new features, fresh-but-familiar styling, and about an inch more rear-seat legroom. The Crosstrek is based on the hatchback version of Subaru’s Impreza compact car (which itself was redesigned for 2017). To the basic Impreza platform, the Crosstrek adds SUV-esque styling touches (including rugged-looking lower-body cladding) and a raised ride height (Crosstrek has a generous 8.7 inches of ground clearance). Though it straddles the line between a compact car and a compact crossover SUV, we categorize it as the latter. The Crosstrek’s sole engine choice is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder; it gains direct injection and four horsepower, for a total of 152. The engine can be paired with a six-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. Available features include pre-collision braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, keyless access and starting, adaptive cruise control, and newly available rear automatic braking. Crosstrek is a fine combination of car-like driving refinement and SUV versatility. It’s a little short on power, but it delivers respectable fuel economy. If you can’t decide between a compact SUV or a compact car—or you’re just looking for a sensibly sized, all-weather family vehicle that offers some light off-road capabilities—the Crosstrek is a good value that is well worth a look.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/subaru/forester/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Respectable fuel economy for the class; large windows all around make for excellent visibility; generous passenger room both front and rear</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Middling acceleration with base engine; CVT transmission exacerbates engine noise; wind noise; some lackluster interior materials</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Subaru Forester has few changes for 2018. Subaru’s Active Torque Vectoring, which enhances handling, is now standard on the top-line 2.0XT Touring. EyeSight safety system is now standard on 2.5i Touring and 2.0XT Touring models. Also, a 2.5i Black Edition is a new model with unique interior and exterior trim. Forester is a crossover compact SUV. A 170-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder powers 2.5i models, while a 250-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is in 2.0XT versions. The 2.5-liter engine is paired with a six-speed manual or a CVT automatic transmission. The turbo 2.0-liter is only offered with a CVT. All-wheel drive is standard. Though it feels a bit more “car-like” than many compact SUVs, Forester offers competitive passenger and cargo room, along with welcome available features such as hill-descent control and Subaru’s EyeSight system with pre-collision braking and lane-departure warning. Performance of the 2.5-liter engine with the CVT doesn’t peg the thrill meter, but that powertrain delivers good fuel-economy numbers and adequate power. Plus, the starting price for 2.5-liter models is still well under $25,000. Turbocharged XTs have more pleasing performance, but cost more to buy and feed with no gain in utility.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/subaru/impreza/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Standard (and affordable) all-wheel drive; wide array of available safety features; simple-to-use controls</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Acceleration is a bit slow from a stop; no optional engine available</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Subaru Impreza gains windshield-wiper-activated headlights for 2018. Four-door hatchback and sedan body styles are offered, and all-wheel drive—an unusual feature in the compact-car class—is standard. The sole engine is a 152-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a five-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Available convenience features include keyless entry and starting, self-dimming headlights, and roof rails. Available safety features include forward collision warning and mitigation, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, and adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alert, rear-cross-traffic alert, rear-obstacle detection with automatic braking, and adaptive fog lights that turn with the steering wheel. Subaru’s all-wheel-drive system has long been a key Impreza selling point, but the redesign for 2017 brought plenty of new strengths that made this compact contender a more compelling choice. The Impreza’s standout features include excellent visibility, a sensible control layout, and a full range of up-to-date safety and convenience features. Interior room, fuel economy and overall driving dynamics are also class competitive. The Impreza is well worth a look—even if you don’t need all-wheel drive.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Spacious interior; controlled, comfortable ride; standard all-wheel drive; large trunk</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Middling fuel economy with 6-cylinder engine; some ergonomic issues with climate controls and available navigation system</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Subaru Legacy is refreshed for 2018 with updated front and rear fascias and revised interiors. Legacy now has more sound insulation for a quieter interior. Subaru’s midsize sedan has two engines choices: a 175-horsepower 2.5-liter four cylinder and a 256-hp 3.6-liter six-cylinder. Both are paired with a CVT automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. Available safety features include pre-collision warning and autonomous braking, lane-departure warning, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic reverse braking. These midsize cars are pleasant to drive, have great interior room, and come with a lot of equipment at reasonable prices. Standard all-wheel drive is a bonus for snow-belt states. While any Legacy is a solid choice, we like the 3.6R models, which have good power and lots of features for the money.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The Subaru outback has new front-end styling for 2018. There is also more sound insulation for a quieter interior. Subaru’s midsize wagon has two engine choices: a 175-horsepower 2.5-liter four cylinder and a 256-hp 3.6-liter six-cylinder. All-wheel drive is standard and both engines are paired with a CVT automatic transmission. Available safety features include pre-collision warning and autonomous braking, lane-departure warning, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic reverse braking. Outback blends midsize station wagon and SUV attributes while delivering a host of welcome safety and convenience features. Car loyalists, crossover intenders, and even those searching for an at least mildly off-road-capable SUV will find a lot to like with the Outback.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/2018-avalon/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Comfortable, quiet ride; outstanding fuel economy with Hybrid model; respectable acceleration in both V6 and and Hybrid models</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Center control panel’s touch-sensitive buttons not always responsive; infotainment system can be slow to respond to inputs</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Avalon is unchanged. A redesigned Avalon is expected for 2019. Avalon is a big, comfortable car that gives large, expensive luxury cars a run for their money. The standard engine is a 268-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Hybrids have a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gas engine combined with an electric motor for a total of 200 hp and paired with a CVT automatic transmission. Available features include adaptive cruise control, pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning and mitigation, tri-zone automatic climate controls, and front and rear heated seats. This large sedan offers many of the luxury features and interior appointments of a premium sedan without the premium price. The distracting control scheme is a mark against it, but the rest of the package is quite refined and comfortable. Though it lacks the brand cachet and dealer experience of a high-end brand, owners who can do without those aspects will find the Avalon a quite suitable and accommodating vehicle.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Toyota’s perennially popular midsize sedan kicks off its eighth generation for 2018 with a redesign that brings a bit more space, more horsepower, several new features, and dramatic new styling. The 2018 Toyota Camry model lineup ascends through the entry-level L (new for 2018), LE, SE, XSE, and XLE; the Camry Hybrid is offered in LE, SE, and XLE trim. Newly standard on all is Toyota’s Safety Sense-P, a suite of high-tech items that includes forward collision warning and mitigation with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning and mitigation, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. Three powertrains are offered. Output of the base 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is bumped from 178 to 203 horsepower (206 in the XSE), while the 3.5-liter V6 sees an increase from 268 hp to 301. On both of these engines, an eight-speed automatic transmission replaces the previous six-speed unit. The Hybrid combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine with an electric motor for a combined 208 hp (up from 200), and comes standard with a CVT automatic transmission. Available features include a head-up instrument display, 360-degree camera, LED headlights, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and a brake-hold feature. The redesigned Toyota Camry retains the sensible-shoes virtues that have long been its trademark, but adds a level of design flair and dynamic appeal that will likely cause traditional family-sedan buyers to do a double take. A fine selection of trim levels and powertrains allows the Camry to be tailored to a wide range of shopper wants and needs.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/c-hr/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Nimble-for-the-class handling; generous list of safety features; easy entry and exit</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Missing some expected comfort and convenience features; rearview camera display is small; middling acceleration; so-so passenger space; less cargo capacity than most rivals; AWD is currently not available</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Toyota introduces an all-new, genre-bending crossover vehicle for 2018. The C-HR is a subcompact-sized four-door hatchback that straddles the line between the subcompact car and subcompact SUV segments. The C-HR’s tall body build, raised ride height, and better-than-a-car cargo capacity push it into our subcompact SUV category, but unlike most SUVs, the C-HR isn’t available with all-wheel drive—for now at least, it comes solely with front-wheel drive. And, despite its name (C-HR stands for Coupe-High Rider), the C-HR is a four-door (though the rear doors are camouflaged by the swoopy styling and “hidden”door handles). The sole powertrain is a 144-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a CVT automatic transmission.</p>, <p>XLE and XLE Premium trim levels are available. Standard equipment on the XLE includes 18-inch alloy wheels; dual-zone climate control; rearview camera; and Toyota’s TSS-P (Toyota Safety Sense P) suite of high-tech safety features, which includes forward collision warning and mitigation with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning and mitigation, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. XLE Premium models add blind-spot alert, rear-cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, a sport driver seat with adjustable lumbar support, and keyless access and starting. The C-HR is missing a few desirable comfort and tech features (such as Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, leather upholstery, a sunroof, or a navigation system) that are offered in many subcompact-SUV competitors, and it’s not quite as quick or as spacious inside as some of those rivals either. However, this hard-to-categorize runabout’s radical styling, crisp handling, and decent practicality may attract shoppers who want to stand out from the crowd.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/corolla/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Competitive pricing; pleasant interior with simple, straightforward dashboard layout; good close-quarters maneuverability; rear-seat legroom is among the best in the class</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not as quiet as class-leading compact cars; driving personality is rather bland compared to rivals such as the Ford Focus and Mazda 3; gooseneck-style trunklid hinges intrude on trunk space; no hatchback version available</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> All 2018 Toyota Corollas get standard illuminated visor mirrors. Otherwise, Corolla is essentially unchanged. The Corolla is a compact sedan with front-wheel drive. Two 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engines are offered. All models, except the LE Eco, are powered by a 132-horsepower engine that is paired with a 6-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission. The LE Eco’s engine is tuned to produce 140 hp and better fuel economy. Its sole transmission is the CVT automatic. Available features include pre-collision system with pedestrian alert; lane-departure warning and mitigation; and adaptive cruise control. Corolla retains a conservative, practical character that appeals to a broad range of compact-car shoppers who just want reliable transportation. There are plenty of compact cars that are more engaging and enjoyable to drive, and several that have more-upscale trimmings, but this mainstream Toyota’s unassuming personality and reputation for reliability will still attract many buyers.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/corolla-im/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Competitive pricing; generous selection of standard features; versatile hatchback body configuration</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Driving character isn’t as peppy or agile as sporty looks suggest; some middling interior materials</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Corolla iM is unchanged. The Scion iM became Toyota Corolla iM for 2017. Toyota closed its youth-oriented Scion division after the 2016 model year and iM moved over to the Toyota brand. The Corolla iM is essentially a hatchback version of the Toyota Corolla that’s sold overseas as the Auris; as such, the iM can be considered a spiritual successor to the departed Toyota Matrix compact hatchback. The sole engine is a 137-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder that is paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a CVT automatic transmission. The iM has standard Toyota Safety Sense that includes pre-collision system, lane-departure warning, and automatic high-beam headlights. The Corolla iM’s sporty, aggressive styling belies its lackluster acceleration and so-so driving character; a Mazda 3 or Ford Focus are much better choices for fun behind the wheel. However, the iM’s formidable list of standard features, aggressive pricing, and spunky styling inside and out make it a compelling compact-car choice.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Highlander is unchanged. This midsize-SUV Best Buy boasts a long list of strong points, including excellent passenger room in the first and second rows, flexible cargo space, thoughtful small-items storage spaces, and high-quality interior materials. The available Entune infotainment system offers a broad array of up-to-the-minute connectivity features, and the optional Driver Easy Speak feature, which utilizes the vehicle’s speaker system so front-seat occupants can easily converse with occupants in the 3<sup>rd</sup> row, is a unique convenience. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning and mitigation, and adaptive cruise control. Three powertrains are offered: a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder with 185 horsepower that is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission; a 295-hp 3.5-liter V6 mated to a 8-speed automatic; and a hybrid that combines a 3.5-liter V6 with an electric motor for a total 306 hp paired with a CVT automatic transmission. The 4-cylinder engine is not available with all-wheel drive. All other non-hybrid models off a choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Hybrids are only available with all-wheel drive. Highlander is competitive from a dynamic standpoint as well, offering a comfortable ride and decent maneuverability for its size and heft. As it has been for several years, the Highlander is a must-see vehicle in the midsize-SUV class.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/land-cruiser/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Off-road prowess; impressive quietness; “old-school” architecture and Toyota quality appeals to a select group of buyers</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy; disappointing cargo versatility, mainly due to tedious side-folding 3rd-row seats; feels a bit archaic compared to many rivals</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser is unchanged. Land Cruiser is a premium full-size SUV with traditional body-on-frame construction. It seats up to eight in three rows of seating. ( Toyota’s luxury brand, Lexus, sells a high-trim version of the Land Cruiser badged Lexus LX 570.) A 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 mated to an 8-speed automatic is the sole powertrain. Four-wheel drive and a two-speed transfer case are standard. Standard safety features include a front collision avoidance system, blind-spot alert, lane-departure warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Land Cruiser is well equipped and a rear-seat entertainment system is the only factory option. Standard equipment includes leather upholstery on all three rows of seats, heated/ventilated front seats, four-zone automatic climate controls, and power sunroof. Land Cruiser blends legendary off-road capability with impressive on-road manners and luxurious accommodations. However, it feels rather archaic compared to most of the competition, largely due to its limited passenger/cargo versatility. Land Cruiser’s staunchly traditional architecture appeals to a select group of high-rolling off-roaders and brand loyalists, but most premium-large SUV shoppers will probably be better served by less expensive, more-mainstream class competitors.</p>]

Prius is Toyota’s hybrid compact hatchback sedan and the Prius Primes is a plug-in hybrid version that Toyota claims has an all-electric range of 25 miles. A 1.8-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine and an electric motor produce a combined 121 horsepower. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is the only transmission. LED headlights and keyless entry and starting are standard. Parking assist, Siri Eyes Free, and head-up instrument display are available. Safety features include pre-collision system with pedestrian detection; automatic high-beam headlights; lane-departure alert with steering assist; and adaptive cruise control. Legroom is generous up front, but only adequate in the rear. The Prius is simply a fine car—a fine car capable of breaking 50 mpg.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/prius-c/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Outstanding fuel economy; decent passenger and cargo space for a subcompact; reasonable base prices</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Weak acceleration at highway speeds; high noise levels; some cheap-looking interior components</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Prius c has refreshed styling with new rocker panels and restyled wheels. Prius c is Toyota’s smallest hybrid. The subcompact four-door hatchback has seating for five. A 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor produce a combined 99 horsepower. A CVT automatic is the only transmission. Standard safety features include: pre-collision system with pedestrian detection; automatic high beams; lane-departure warning with steering assist; and adaptive cruise control. The Prius c might be short on acceleration and quietness, but it’s big on fuel economy. Very big, actually, as it recorded some of the highest fuel economy numbers we’ve ever seen. Toss in decent versatility, passenger room, and a price tag that rivals many non-hybrid small cars, and you have an ideal choice for those who place a high value on frugality in all forms.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/sequoia/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Muscular 5.7-liter V8 engine, vast passenger- and cargo space despite being one of the smaller vehicles in the class; fine build quality</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fuel economy; wallowing handling; dashboard layout puts climate and audio controls out of easy reach</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Sequoia gains standard Toyota Safety Sense (pre-collision system, pedestrian detection, lane-departure mitigation, adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights) as well as blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. The front fascia and the dashboard have been revised. Also, there is a new TRD Sport model with unique trim that slots between SR5 and Limited. Sequoia is Toyota’s full-size SUV with traditional body on frame construction. Up to eight passengers can be seated in three rows. A 381-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 mated to 6-speed automatic transmission is the sole drivetrain. Rear-wheel drive is standard and a four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case is available. All Sequoias have tri-zone automatic climate controls, power sunroof, and running boards. Load-leveling rear suspension, heated front and 2<sup>nd</sup>-row seats, and adaptive cruise control are available. Sequoia stacks up well against its rivals. We appreciate its strong engine, comfortable seating, large cargo hold, and surprising maneuverability. Less exciting are this Toyota’s wallowing handling and recalcitrant transmission. The most appealing models are the SR5 and Limited. While the Platinum offers some nice exclusive features, they’re not numerous enough to offset its substantial price premium.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Availability of class-exclusive all-wheel drive; solid driving dynamics; broad range of trim levels and option packages</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Higher-end models get expensive; less outright cargo volume than most class competitors</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Sienna gains standard Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P) that includes: pre-collision system with pedestrian detection; automatic high beams; lane-departure warning with steering assist; and adaptive cruise control. There is revised front-end styling and a new Entune infotainment system. Wi-Fi is also offered and the available rear-seat entertainment system can stream from Android devices. A Bird’s Eye View camera system is available on the topline Limited Premium. The Sienna minivan has seating for seven or eight. The sole powertrain is a 296-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Sienna stands out from the minivan pack by being the only one to offer all-wheel drive. Available features include blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, power 3<sup>rd</sup>-row seats, rain-sensing wipers, and Driver Easy Speak that broadcasts the driver’s voice through the rear speakers. Sienna can’t match Chrysler’s Stow ‘n Go fold-flush 2nd-row seats or Honda’s overall refinement, but this Toyota compensates with terrific interior comfort and cargo flexibility. Sienna is well worth your time and consideration.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Broad range of models and optional equipment; respectable acceleration in V6 models; sturdy build quality; nicely assembled, rugged interior with large, easy-to-use controls; excellent ground clearance for off-roading</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Cramped, uncomfortable back seat in “Access Cab” extended-cab models; tall step-in height on 4WD models; bouncy ride with off-road suspension</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Tacoma gets standard Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P) that includes autonomous emergency braking, pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high-beam headlights. A 5-speed manual transmission is no longer offered with the 4-cylinder engine. There are also revised grilles. Tacoma is a compact pickup truck offered in 2-door extended cab and 4-door crew cab styles. The base engine is a 159-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that is paired with a 6-speed automatic. A 278-hp 3.5-liter V6 is offered with 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmissions. Both engines are available with part-time 4WD. Full-time 4WD is not offered. Available features include wireless cell-phone charging, keyless access and starting, power sunroof, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. The Toyota Tacoma’s 2016 redesign was more a very heavy refresh than a clean-sheet-of-paper re-envisioning, but it still brought a number of worthwhile improvements and technology features that keep this truck competitive with the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon (both of which offer the choice of a diesel engine).</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/tundra/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> High level of refinement (particularly on upper-line models) and good driving dynamics; quality interior materials; good cabin ergonomics</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The 4-wheel drive is an inconvenient part-time system; fuel economy may come up a bit short compared to some domestic rivals</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Tundra drops its regular cab, but gains standard Safety Sense-P, a suite of high-tech items that includes forward collision warning and mitigation with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. The TRD PRO models have been replaced by a TRD Sport package. There are also revised grilles and headlights. Tundra is a full size pickup available in extended cab and crew cab styles. Two engines are offered: a 310-horsepower 4.6-liter V8 and a 381-hp 5.7-liter V8. Both are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive and part-time 4-wheel drive are offered. Available features include blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, power-sliding rear window, trailer-sway control, and LED headlights. It might not have as many configuration options as its domestic-brand rivals, but what Tundra does offer should be more than enough for both commercial and recreational truck buyers. This big rig demands serious consideration, even from those who have remained loyal to one of the Detroit 3.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/toyota/yaris/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Penny-pinching prices; great close-quarters maneuverability; decent selection of available features</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Weak acceleration; high noise levels; not as fun to drive as most subcompact-class rivals</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Yaris has revised front and rear styling. Yaris also gains some audio and convenience features. Yaris is a subcompact car that is available in two-door and four-door hatchback bodystyles. The sole engine is a 106-horsepower 1.5-liter four-cylinder mated to a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Available features include pre-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and automatic high-beam headlights. On its own, the Yaris is a pleasant subcompact that will more than meet the needs of shoppers in this class. It’s decently roomy and pretty reasonably priced. Unfortunately, when you put the Yaris up against its contemporaries, it falls a bit flat. Rival subcompacts best it in a variety of areas, from passenger and cargo flexibility to noise suppression and overall refinement. Don’t discount this Toyota entirely, but be sure to test drive the competition first.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Toyota Yaris iA is unchanged. Toyota closed its youth-oriented Scion division after the 2016 model year and the Scion iA became the Toyota Yaris iA for 2017. The Yaris iA is a subcompact-sized 4-door sedan that is essentially a restyled version of the Mazda 2 sedan. (Mazda has elected to not offer the Mazda 2 sedan or hatchback in the U.S. market.) A 1.5-liter 4-cylinder is the sole engine choice. The Yaris iA comes as a “mono-spec” vehicle; besides paint color, the only options are 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission and dealer-accessory-type add-ons. Thankfully, the Yaris iA comes surprisingly well-equipped—its standard features include keyless entry with push-button start, a 7-inch multimedia touchscreen, a rearview camera, Bluetooth connectivity, and even a low-speed collision warning and mitigation system. The collision mitigation system is capable of automatically applying the brakes at speeds under 18 mph. The Yaris iA is a compelling entry in the subcompact market that offers competitive pricing, a nimble driving personality, pleasant interior trimmings, and an impressive level of standard features. It’s a must-see in its class.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cavernous interior; generous warrantee; well-sorted touchscreen infotainment system</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Plus-size dimensions can make close-quarters parking a chore; mediocre projected fuel economy with V6 engine</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Volkswagen introduces a new midsize crossover SUV for 2018. The Atlas is one of the largest vehicles VW has ever sold in the U.S.; it’s bigger than most every midsize-SUV rival, and almost 10 inches longer than Volkswagen’s other midsize SUV: the pricey, upscale Touareg. Despite its larger size, the Atlas is priced significantly cheaper than the Touareg; its price range puts it right in the heart of the midsize SUV market. The Atlas has three rows of seating for up to seven passengers with the standard second-row bench seat, or six with the available second-row captain’s chairs. At launch, a 276-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 is the sole engine choice. Later in the model year, a 235-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder will be available. Both engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Four-cylinders are front-wheel drive only, while V6s are available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Available safety features include autonomous emergency braking, automatic post-collision braking, pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. Other available features include adaptive cruise control, park assist, automatic high-beam headlights, hands-free power liftgate, panoramic sunroof, overhead-camera view, and LED headlights. The new Atlas’s cavernous interior provides generous passenger and cargo room, and the cabin is finished in VW’s typical classy, understated fashion—especially in the top-line SEL models. A pleasant driving personality; satisfying acceleration from the V6 engine; and a responsive, feature-rich infotainment system are other assets. Projected fuel economy with the V6 engine is a bit disappointing, but the Atlas’s space, performance, and European style should make it a viable alternative to rivals such as the Honda Pilot and Chevrolet Traverse.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unique retro looks; good build quality; peppy acceleration; availability of slick, stylish convertible body style</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Swoopy styling takes precedence over ergonomics; pricier than similarly equipped Golfs and Jettas; cramped back seat</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Volkswagen Beetle has a new engine. The previous 170-horsepower turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder has been replaced by a 174-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. The sporty R-line and its 210-hp turbo 2.0-liter engine have been discontinued. Manual transmissions have also been dropped and a 6-speed automatic is now the sole transmission. There is a new Coast model with unique interior trim and paint. Beetle is based on the same platform as the previous generation of VW’s compact Golf and Jetta, but has retro styling. We class Beetle as a Sporty/Performance Car. While Golf and Jetta can seat five passengers, the Beetle has seating for only four. The beetle is offered in both  2-door hatchback and convertible bodystyles. Available features include blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and keyless entry and starting. The current-generation Beetle is just as style-driven as the New Beetle was, but it’s also more practical in everyday terms, feels more substantial, and is arguably better to drive. Trouble is, it costs a fair bit more than a comparably equipped version of a Golf or Jetta, which offer many of the same virtues, plus far better rear-seat and cargo room. So what we have here is another nostalgia trip that makes sense if you love the styling, can accept the compromises that go with it, and are willing to pay for the privilege.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Volkswagen Golf has revised front and rear styling. All models have a larger control screen. The electric eGolf will be released later in the year and sold in limited numbers. The eGolf with SEL trim gets Volkswagen’s digital cockpit that replaces the instrument cluster with an LCD screen. Golf is a compact four-door hatchback. The Golf hatchback is also available in sporty GTI and R versions. There are also two Golf wagons: Golf SportWagen and all-wheel-drive Golf Alltrack. (See separate reports for Golf GTI, Golf R, Golf SportWagen, and Golf Alltrack.) Gas-powered Golfs have a 170-horsepower turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that is paired with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automated-manual transmission. The e-Golf has a 132-hp electric motor and a single speed transmission. VW claims the e-Golf has a driving range of up to 124 miles. Available features include panoramic sunroof, keyless access and starting, rain-sensing wipers, autonomous emergency braking, and blind-spot alert. Golf was redesigned for 2015. This generation VW Golf did not get a radical update, but it delivered tangible improvements inside and out that keep it competitive in its class. Though the Golf is not without its quirks, no other compact hatchback can match its upscale European feel. The all-electric e-Golf is an interesting variation, but it is not exempt from the typical electric-car downsides of a limited driving range and a considerable price premium.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> For 2018, Volkswagen Golf Alltrack adds standard collision warning and autonomous braking to SE and SEL models. The SEL also gets standard adaptive LED headlights. The base S gains LED daytime running lights and taillights, along with automatic headlights and rain-sensing wipers. The Volkswagen Golf Alltrack debuted last year as an SUV-flavored version of VW’s compact Golf station wagon. To the basic Golf SportWagen, the Alltrack adds standard all-wheel drive, a ride height raised by 1.4 inches, and rugged lower-body cladding. Also included are rough-terrain features such as a front skid plate, hill-descent control, and an “Off-Road Mode” drive-control setting. Golf Alltrack comes with the same 170-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder turbo as SportWagen and other Golfs. The sole transmission is VW’s DSG 6-speed dual-clutch automated manual. The base Golf Alltrack S is equipped with standard rearview camera, heated front seats and mirrors, 6.5-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto/MirrorLink, and hill-descent control. Available features include forward-collision warning and mitigation, lane-departure warning and mitigation, adaptive cruise control, and automatic climate control. The Alltrack is more expensive and rides a little more firmly than its Golf SportWagen sibling, but it’s still a tremendously compelling vehicle that offers a “best of both worlds” blend of car and SUV attributes. Like the rival Subaru Outback, Alltrack is an excellent alternative to a traditional crossover SUV.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Volkswagen Golf GTI gains LED daytime running lights and taillights. There are also new, larger touchscreens. The base S model gains 10 horsepower for a total of 220 hp—the same as the other GTI models. The midline SE trim adds standard adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, and autonomous emergency braking. SE and Autobahn trims gain upgraded brakes from the Golf R. The Volkswagen Golf GTI is the sporty “hot-hatch” performance version of VW’s Golf lineup. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. All models are front-wheel drive and offer a choice of a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automated-manual transmission. The SE and Autobahn have a standard Performance Package which includes a limited-slip differential and larger brakes. An adaptive suspension is a performance option. The 2018 Golf GTI is an impressive car that upholds this time-honored nameplate’s status as a benchmark among performance-focused sporty hatchbacks. What the GTI might lack in outright horsepower compared to others in the Sporty/Performance Car category, it more than makes up for in terms of sprightly handling, surprising practicality, and a high level of refinement. It’s simply one of the best vehicles in its class.</p>]

[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen has refreshed front and rear styling with LED daytime running lights and taillights. The base S model gains standard automatic headlights and rain-sensing wipers. Forward-collision warning with emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitor are now standard on midline SE. All models get new touchscreens: a 6.5-inch for S and an 8-inch for SE and SEL. The Golf SportWagen is a 4-door wagon version of the Volkswagen Golf, and shares its powertrains and basic design. SportWagen also shares its design with VW’s Alltrack that adds a raised ride height and SUV styling cues. SportWagen is powered by a 170-horsepower turbocharged 1.8-liter engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is available on the base S model, otherwise SportWagens are front-wheel drive. SportWagen available features include forward-collision warning with emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitor, panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and starting, and park assist. The Golf SportWagen stands out simply by virtue of being one of the only traditional compact station wagons on the market. Its fuel efficiency, passenger and cargo versatility, and all-around practicality make it a compelling choice in its class, as well as fine alternative to many compact SUVs.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/volkswagen/2018-jetta/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Class-leading interior room and comfort; clean, simple control layout; broad model range; high-performance fun of GLI model</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some interior materials don’t live up to Volkswagen’s typical standards; throttle lag when pulling away from a stop; occasionally awkward performance from the GLI’s automated manual transmission</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Volkswagen Jetta gets revised grilles and wheels for most models. Wolfsburg Edition and SE Sport are new trim levels and the GLI loses its manual transmission option. Jetta is Volkswagen’s compact sedan. VW’s Golf is similar to Jetta, but has a hatchback instead of a trunk. Jetta S, Wolfsburg Edition, and SE models are powered by a 150-horsepower turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that is paired with either a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. Midrange SE Sport and SEL have a 170-hp turbocharged 1.8-liter four cylinder with a six-speed automatic, while the sporty GLI is powered by 210-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four with a six-speed automated-manual transmission. All Jettas are front-wheel drive. Available features include forward-collision warning and mitigation, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic monitor, and adaptive cruise control. Jetta offers great passenger and cargo room, as well as powertrain refinement that exceeds the class norm. At the same time, its ride/handling balance and quality of interior materials on lower-line models fall short of the lofty standards we expect from a Volkswagen. VW’s compact sports sedan, the GLI, maintains the Jetta’s practical and roomy package but is much more fun to drive. While GLI has a much lower horsepower rating than many competing sporty compacts, in practice it offers fine power and is very refined. Responsive handling and livable ride quality are other positives.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/volkswagen/passat/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good fuel economy; vast-for-the-class cabin with excellent rear-seat space; refined interior materials; composed ride</p>, <p><strong>Cons: </strong>V6 models significantly pricier than 4-cylinder versions; some less-than-intuitive controls; lack of stand-alone options</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Volkswagen Passat gets a new base engine. The previous 170-horsepower turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder is replaced by a new 174-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. The new engine gains only four horsepower, but there is also a slight improvement in EPA fuel economy numbers. This engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. There is also a new GT model with sport suspension and a 280-hp 3.6-liter V6 engine that is shared with the existing V6 SEL Premium model. The V6 is mated to a 6-speed automated-manual transmission. Passat is VW’s midsize sedan. All Passats are front-wheel drive. Available features include forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot alert, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning and mitigation, keyless entry and starting, remote engine start, LED headlights, adaptive cruise control, and park assist. The Volkswagen Passat offers excellent passenger and cargo room in a very practical and comfortable package. In a class filled with excellent choices, the Passat follows a bit of a different path–one that helps it stand out from the crowd.</p>]

[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generous cargo room; well-finished interior; good ride quality with composed handling</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Third-row seat is cramped; powertrain occasionally feels lackadaisical</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> Volkswagen’s compact crossover SUV is redesigned for 2018, gaining more space, new styling, and a host of new technology features. The all-new second-generation Tiguan rides a larger platform that is 10.6 inches longer than its predecessor. The extra length provides more cargo room and creates space for an available third-row seat, for 7-passenger capacity. (The Mitsubishi Outlander is the only other compact SUVs that offers a third-row seat.) The shorter, two-row, first-generation Tiguan continues for at least a couple more years as the Tiguan Limited (see separate report). The new Tiguan’s sole powertrain is a 184-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and Volkswagen’s 4Motion all-wheel drive is optional; interestingly, the third-row seat is standard on front-drive Tiguans and is available on AWD models as a $500 option. Available safety features include blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning and mitigation, forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking, and automatic post-collision braking. Other available features include adaptive LED headlights, a hands-free power liftgate, and adaptive cruise control. The first-generation Tiguan is one of the oldest designs in the compact-SUV segment, so it was high time that VW introduced a new version. The redesigned Tiguan hits the mark with its spacious cabin, well-designed technology features, and classy styling inside and out. The available third-row seating is a handy addition, but it cuts into maximum cargo volume a bit and it’s cramped enough to be suitable mainly for small children. Dynamically, the Tiguan offers a comfortable, absorbent ride with composed handling, but some shoppers might wish for a bit more powertrain pep and responsiveness.</p>]
----------http://consumerguide.com/volkswagen/tiguan-limited/
[<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Car-like ride and handling quality; high-quality cabin materials and finishing; comfortable passenger accommodations; simple, user-friendly controls</p>, <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Firmer ride than some class competitors; not as much cargo room as some rivals; aging basic design means Tiguan’s features aren’t as up-to-date as most compact SUV competitors</p>]
[<p><strong>CG Says:</strong> The 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan Limited is a continuation of the previous-generation Tiguan. A new, larger Tiguan with an available with a third-row seat debuted for 2018 (see separate report) and the old version carries on as a smaller, lower-cost alternative. A few Tiguan Limiteds were sold as 2017 models. Tiguan Limited is a crossover compact SUV with seating for five. The Tiguan Limited has a 200-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission and is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Tiguan Limited offers the premium engineering, solid workmanship, and sporty road manners expected of European brands. But its basic platform dates back to the 2009 model year. Most of the Tiguan Limited’s competitors offer more up-to-date designs, powertrain choices that offer better fuel economy, and cutting-edge safety features that aren’t available here. The Tiguam Limited lacks many comfort and technology features, but its low price and compact size should appeal to some buyers.</p>]
