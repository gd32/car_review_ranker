[<p>The Acura RDX is a compact crossover SUV that can seat up to five passengers in relatively affordable luxury.</p>, <p>The RDX is redesigned for 2019 on a new Acura-exclusive platform instead of using the last-generation CR-V architecture. It is smaller than the seven-passenger MDX.</p>, <p>With the RDX, Acura has a rival for vehicles like the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, and Volvo XC60.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/acura_rdx_2019">2019 Acura RDX review<br/></a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Acura RDX</strong></p>, <p>Not only does the RDX get a new platform for 2019, but the redesign marks the return of turbo-4 power and Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive. The new 2.0-liter turbo-4 makes 272 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque. A dual-overhead-cam engine and a variant of the engine found in the Civic Type R, it has 40 percent more low-rpm torque, according to Acura. The lone transmission is now a 10-speed automatic.</p>, <p>The AWD system offers torque vectoring. Up to 70 percent of the torque can go to the rear axle and all of that power can flow to the outside wheel in a turn to improve handling. Customers can also choose front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The new platform employs more than 50 percent high-strength steel for improved rigidity, and the wheelbase grows by 2.6 inches. Adaptive dampers join the options list for the first time, and an NSX-inspired dial offers five drive modes.</p>, <p>The longer wheelbase promises improved cargo space and rear-seat comfort, while the cabin benefits from higher-end materials. New sport seats come with 12-or 16-way power adjustments and use high-strength steel frames.</p>, <p>A new True Touchpad interface controls the infotainment system. It uses a touchpad on the center console and a 10.2-inch screen set high. Each position on the touchpad is mapped to a position on the screen, and drivers simply click to activate the functions they want.</p>, <p>Standard equipment includes the infotainment system, Apple CarPlay, keyless ignition, in-car wi-fi, 12-way heated front sport seats, a panoramic sunroof, a power height-adjustable tailgate, and 19-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>A new A-Spec model tops the lineup with 20-inch wheels, gloss black accents, and an optional two-tone red and black interior.</p>, <p>Standard safety items consist of forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warnings, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control.</p>, <p><strong>Acura RDX history</strong></p>, <p>The RDX hasn't changed its mission at all since it was new in the 2007 model year.</p>, <p>From its introduction in 2007 through the 2009 model year, the RDX was offered with one powertrain setup only: a turbo-4 with standard AWD. The 2.3-liter engine had relatively high output, with horsepower at 240 and a fat 260 pound-feet of torque. The turbocharger made it a bit peaky and supplied a typical turbo soundtrack, which put off some potential buyers. A paddle-shifted 5-speed automatic provided more sporty character, while a taut suspension gave it a handling edge over competitors at the expense of some ride comfort.</p>, <p>That first RDX also shared the "Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive" system that put power to all four wheels in the larger Acura MDX, and featured torque vectoring. For the 2010 model year, Acura added a front-drive RDX to the order sheet, significantly boosting its fuel-economy numbers (at 19/24 mpg, versus 17/22 mpg) though it was still as thirsty as vehicles like the massive Lincoln MKT.</p>, <p>With its 2013 redesign, the RDX took on a series of updates that were meant to give it a more distinctive place in the market, versus the related CR-V.</p>, <p>Just when other makers began replacing large V-6 engines with smaller turbocharged inline-4s, the RDX adopted a new drivetrain—a 273-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The new powertrain maintained the prodigious power of the earlier model while making it easier to drive.</p>, <p>It also delivered better fuel efficiency, with a combined EPA rating of 23 mpg for front-wheel drive models and 22 mpg for all-wheel drive versions—both improvements on the prior model.</p>, <p>Also, the earlier model's all-wheel-drive system was replaced in 2013 and later models by a more ordinary front-biased AWD system. The change helped to reduce weight and improve efficiency.</p>, <p>The V-6 provided plenty of power without the lag the original's turbo-4 had. The longer wheelbase helped provide a smoother ride, opening up the RDX to a wider audience. The interior was still relatively small, especially for second-row occupants, although Acura improved cabin materials and design, with good differentiation between the RDX and its Honda kin.</p>, <p>The rear seat folded forward to create a 60-cubic-foot cargo area, and the RDX had about 27 cubic feet of space with the seat raised.</p>, <p>Safety scores made the RDX one of the best in its segment, and the IIHS repeatedly named it a Top Safety Pick.</p>, <p>
The focus shifted toward families from sporting enthusiastic drivers. Leather seating, heated/power front seats, a power moonroof, and a 360-watt audio system were on the standard-features list, while the top Tech Package included navigation with real-time traffic and rerouting; a power rear tailgate; and an Acura/ELS surround sound system.</p>, <p>The Acura RDX carried over from the 2013 model year into 2014 and 2015 with no significant changes.</p>, <p>Acura refreshed the RDX for the 2016 model year with an improved 3.5-liter V-6 that provided slightly more power and torque as well as fuel-economy ratings that improved by one mpg in both city and highway testing. The available AWD system was retuned to provide a greater rearward torque bias for improved handling. Acura added new active-safety features, and gathered them under the AcuraWatch banner.</p>, <p>The RDX also received a mild refresh that included LED headlights and some tweaks to the front and rear fascias, while the interior received some minor trim changes.</p>, <p>The RDX was largely unchanged for 2017 and 2018.</p>]

[<p>The Acura NSX is a two-seat sports car that sits atop the Acura pile in position and price.</p>, <p>The NSX was launched in the 1990 model year as an aluminum-bodied performance halo car, with stats that rivaled contemporary Ferraris and daily-driver ease that rivaled Honda's own Civic. Noted as much for its performance prowess as its livability, it became a legend in its own day. </p>, <p>The Acura NSX withered for 15 years and received small updated before it was eventually discontinued in 2005. A revived NSX had been making the rounds for years before Acura finalized its design and settled on a car that hit the streets in spring 2016. The car was unchanged for its second model year in 2018.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/acura_nsx_2018">2018 Acura NSX review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Acura NSX<br/></strong></p>, <p>The NSX took a slow but steady track for production. Honda developed it at its American engineering arm in Ohio.</p>, <p>In the late 2000s, Honda began to toy with the idea of an NSX replacement and initiated development of a V-10-powered successor. The company scuttled the program as the 2008 recession hit.</p>, <p>Recasting its efforts as part of a plan to turn around the Acura division, it later approved a new NSX concept, which bowed at the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1071439_acura-nsx-concept-2012-detroit-auto-show">2012 Detroit auto show</a>.</p>, <p>A new concept car was shown several times and eventually translated into the final production version, with the concept's design left largely intact; Acura showed the new model at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.</p>, <p>The new NSX went on sale in 2016. Though substantially different from the groundbreaking, aluminum-bodied original, the NSX is once again the mid-engined sports car atop the lineup of Honda's luxury brand.</p>, <p>Power comes from a new direct-injected V-6 with a 9-speed dual-clutch transmission and a built-in electric motor as well as motors on the front axle, which makes the NSX a through-the-road hybrid of sorts—one in which the electric motors can be used at the front wheels to provide all-wheel drive. The same basic setup is found on Acura's RLX luxury sedan and MDX SUV, although those vehicle the engine and transmission mounted up front, with the extra electric motors providing torque vectoring and all-wheel-drive functions at the rear axle.</p>, <p>The NSX's engine has twin turbochargers, a 75-degree V angle, and dry-sump lubrication. It is fed by a combination of port and direct injection.</p>, <p>The NSX measures 170.5 inches long, 74.6 inches wide, 45.7 inches tall, and rides on a 101.4-inch wheelbase. That compares with the original car's 174.2-inch overall length, 99.6-inch wheelbase, 46.1-inch height, and 71.3-inch width. The new NSX chassis is made mostly of high-strength steel but incorporates a carbon-fiber panel for the floor.</p>, <p>The NSX remains a two-seater, with a luxuriously trimmed interior and very small space reserved for luggage.</p>, <p><strong>Acura NSX history</strong></p>, <p>The first NSX came as an outgrowth of Honda's smashing success in Formula One racing in the 1980s. It was inspired by the road cars from its racing rival Ferrari, but with Honda's usual application of its own hallmark intensive engineering.</p>, <p>The NSX was first shown at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show and entered production later that year as a 1990 model. It was sold as an Acura in the U.S.; most of the rest of the world knew it as the Honda NSX. The sports car wore an aluminum body, drew its power from a 270-horsepower 3.0-liter mid-mounted V-6 engine, sent that power to the rear wheels via a 5-speed manual transmission, and had what some drivers felt was the best handling of any of its contemporaries—Ferraris included.</p>, <p>The NSX was so well received, Honda kept the car in production for 15 years. While the basic body and structure remained the same, several changes were made over the car's lifespan. The coupe was joined, and then ultimately replaced, by a targa model with a removable roof panel; a 4-speed automatic option was added; the 5-speed manual was swapped out for a 6-speed unit; and the V-6's output increased by 20 hp on manual models. In 2002, the car received a mild facelift.</p>, <p>While the NSX remained as pure as ever to the end of its run, there were some who lamented a lack of progress, especially compared to the competition of the time.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/acura_mdx
[<p>The Acura MDX is a seven-passenger crossover SUV that blurs the lines between mid-size and large, luxury and mainstream.</p>, <p>With the MDX, Acura competes with vehicles like the Lexus RX, the Infiniti QX60, and the Buick Enclave. When trimmed out in their most expensive versions, the Nissan Pathfinder and Volkswagen Atlas might also be considered competitors.</p>, <p>The Acura MDX is standard with front-wheel drive, although all-wheel drive is optional. The MDX distinguishes itself from other competitors with better handling—despite its similarities with the Honda Odyssey minivan.</p>, <p>It's one of the longest running SUV names—and one of the best sellers too. The MDX has been a mainstay for the Acura brand.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/acura_mdx_2018">2018 Acura MDX review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Acura MDX</strong></p>, <p>The Acura MDX now shares some of its running gear with a number of other Acura and Honda models, including the Pilot crossover and earlier versions of the Odyssey minivan.</p>, <p>Today's MDX was introduced for 2014, the result of a complete redesign of the model. The body is much sleeker, with improved aerodynamics; it has lots the blocky, somewhat blunt look of its predecessor. The 3.5-liter V-6 is fitted with direct injection and returns better fuel economy than before. Acura also added advanced safety features to the MDX's roster, including adaptive cruise control and forward-collision warnings. The current model receives a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA, as well as the IIHS's Top Safety Pick rating, putting it at the top of its class in safety.</p>, <p>This generation is the first to offer a front-wheel-drive MDX, broadening its appeal to those in warmer climates who don't need all-wheel drive and its attendant fuel-economy penalty. The Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system is once again available. Handling is still crisp for a crossover, but the latest MDX has lost the sharp dynamic edge of the previous model. Those who prioritize comfort will, of course, see that as a good thing.</p>, <p>The 2017 MDX has a few key changes. The 3.5-liter V-6 engine is now mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission for improved efficiency, and the available Advance package also adds an engine stop-start function to further improve fuel economy. The front-drive MDX now hits a maximum of 23 mpg combined. Several other features have been added as standard or optional equipment, including a revamped suite of safety features now called AcuraWatch, which includes road-departure mitigation and a rear cross-traffic monitor. The optional SH-AWD system has been redesigned as well, now featuring a lighter rear differential that has switched to a dual-clutch design for what Acura claims is better responsiveness.</p>, <p>An MDX Sport Hybrid was released for 2017 and featured the same "through-the-road" hybrid technology found in the RLX and NSX. Electric motors can power two wheels alone, which means that not only is all-wheel drive standard, but a "sportier" torque vectoring system helps carve a cleaner corner. No one will confuse an MDX with a sports car, but a least Acura's pricing for the Sport Hybrid model is aggressive.</p>, <p>For 2018, Acura updated its 7.0-inch touchscreen with a faster processor and more responsive screen.</p>, <p><strong>Acura MDX history</strong></p>, <p>The MDX entered the market back in 2001, when it supplanted a slow-selling vehicle dubbed the SLX—simply a rebadged version of the then-current Isuzu Trooper. Offered as a seven-passenger crossover, the original MDX came with a single drivetrain, a 3.5-liter V-6 with 240 hp, mated to a 5-speed automatic and AWD. Over the years, this first MDX would see its power boosted to 265 hp, while it added features such as Bluetooth connectivity, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, Bose audio, satellite radio, and a voice-activated navigation system. Side-curtain airbags were added to the MDX's safety package, and the original model performed well in crash tests.</p>, <p>While it never reached the prestigious ubiquity of the Lexus RX, the Acura MDX became a reliable sight in upscale mall parking lots and commuter lanes thanks to its luxe equipment, airy interior, and relatively good ride and handling.</p>, <p>The second-generation MDX arrived for the 2007 model year with a substantial look and feel both inside and out. It featured a 3.7-liter V-6 engine with a power output of 300 hp as well as a new all-wheel-drive system. "Super Handling All-Wheel Drive," as Acura called it, was related to the one that would bow in the Acura RL large sedan and featured true mechanical torque vectoring on the rear axle. Standard equipment included a sunroof and leather trim, while options included a high-quality premium audio package; voice-activated navigation; and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Handling remained above-average for a crossover of its size, while the MDX's interior grew more spacious and useful, giving it one of the most adult-friendly cabins of any crossover vehicle. Fuel economy was not a strong point at 14 mpg city, 20 highway originally and then improving to 16/21 mpg in later years. This was in part due to the heavy and complicated AWD system that was fitted for this generation.</p>, <p>In 2010, the MDX was lightly refreshed, which included Acura's new and controversial corporate grille, which some likened to a bottle opener, though we found the MDX version of that design to be the best-integrated one found on any Acura. The MDX also received new electric power steering that year, but it missed the mark completely for responsiveness (it's too fast) and heft (it's too light). Safety remained a strong point, with the MDX named an IIHS Top Safety Pick. In 2010, the two-door Acura ZDX was introduced, with the model sharing some mechanicals with the MDX. Its severe lack of interior space led to very low sales, however; it was withdrawn after 2012. The Acura MDX changed very little for 2013, the last year before the entirely redesigned 2014 model.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/acura_ilx
[<p>The Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan that's the automaker's most affordable model.</p>, <p>With the ILX, Acura has a spiritual successor to the Integra and TSX, although it's not directly related to those cars. It follows a tradition of small, affordable luxury cars from the automaker.</p>, <p>When it was introduced, the ILX shared a platform and some powertrains with the contemporary Honda Civic. The Civic was redesigned for 2016; today, the vehicles share no running gear, although they're sized about the same. For 2018, the ILX is available with a new Special Edition trim package that adds some sportier styling touches and larger wheels.</p>, <p>Rivals for the ILX include cars such as the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/acura_ilx_2018">2018 Acura ILX review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The ILX launched with three different powertrain options, each offering its own character. All were front-wheel drive. The base model was powered by a 150-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The sportiest offering carried a 201-hp 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, available only with a 6-speed manual. A third option, and the first to be discontinued, was the ILX Hybrid, which was decidedly slower but greener, using the same 1.5-liter 4-cylinder and integrated hybrid drive system as the equivalent Civic model. Its total output was just 111 hp, but it was rated at an EPA estimated 38 mpg highway.</p>, <p>The standard ILX 2.0-liter inline-4 was rated at an EPA-estimated 24 mpg city, 35 highway, 28 combined. The sportier ILX 2.4L, not surprisingly, didn't do that well. It was rated at 22/31/25 mpg, while the fuel-sipping ILX Hybrid got an EPA-estimated 39/38/38 mpg.</p>, <p>With comfortable ride quality, a still-somewhat-sporty demeanor in the turns, and the performance-oriented ILX 2.4-liter inline-4, the littlest Acura offered a taste of sport sedan in the entry-luxury arena. If you chose the 2.0-liter model, you got a relatively efficient commuter, while the Hybrid eked out better-than-average fuel economy, though it was short on both power (against other small luxury cars) and gas mileage (against the most efficient hybrids).</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">There were three main trim specs for the ILX early on: the base model, the Premium Package, and the Technology Package. The standard ILX specification included cloth seats with a leather-wrapped steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth hands-free calling, a power moonroof, keyless ignition, rearview camera, and more.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">The ILX received only minor changes into 2014. For the 2015 model year, the slow-selling ILX Hybrid was dropped from the lineup.</p>, <p>The ILX received its first thorough refresh for 2016, which included a revised powertrain lineup across the model range with no manual transmission, updated styling, and features. In 2017, LED headlights were made standard. For 2018, the ILX gained a Special Edition package with a unique body kit and larger wheels.</p>, <p>A single powertrain now powers the ILX. A revised 2.4-liter making 201 hp is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic; the same combination can be found in base versions of the new TLX sedan. The front and rear styling have been updated, as have the interior and tech options, and Acura says it has retuned the suspension and stiffened the body structure to improve dynamics and comfort. Now that the ILX has made this changeover, a manual is no longer available anywhere in the Acura lineup, the first time that's been the case since the very early days of the brand.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/acura_rlx
[<p>The Acura RLX is a full-size luxury sedan that's a technological wonder. Despite its conservative style, the RLX paved the way for the latest NSX, with its advanced all-wheel-drive system that utilizes a pair of electric motors to supply power to the rear wheels. </p>, <p>Even the front-wheel drive RLX's rear-wheel steering helps it stand out on the spec sheet, but there's no disguising the fact that this Acura doesn't look particularly special for a model designed to square off against the BMW 5-Series, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and the Audi A6, among others. It's a case of "there's more than meets the eye" with the RLX. </p>, <p>Acura changed to the RLX name for the 2014 model year. For 2018, the front end was changed slightly and a new transmission was added.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/acura_rlx_2018" title="2017 Acura RLX review">2018 Acura RLX review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Technology aside, the more luxurious and spacious interior may be just as deserving of the new name. It's 2 inches longer and 2 inches wider, which helps open the cabin in the RLX and offer more space than the old RL.</p>, <p>Styling is attractive but hardly radical, with a typically aggressive Acura stance and a smooth, arched roofline fronted by "Jewel Eye" LED headlights—framed in a dual-stacked array, with ultra-reflective optical lenses, that should be distinctive day or night.</p>, <p>The RLX gets its power from a version of Honda's latest 3.5-liter V-6. On front-wheel-drive models, it makes 310 horsepower and is mated to a 10-speed automatic with paddle shifters and a sport shift setting. The RLX Sport Hybrid pairs the V-6 with a trio of electric motors—one situated with the engine and transmission on the front axle and two for the rear axle to provide all-wheel drive and torque vectoring, which helps save weight compared to the previous mechanical SH-AWD system. The Sport Hybrid uses a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic and returns a 30-mpg EPA combined rating.</p>, <p>All RLX models include both forward-collision warnings and active lane control. The RLX has aced the IIHS tests, earning it the Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS.</p>, <p>Outside of the choice to go hybrid/AWD or not, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080874_2014-acura-rlx-video-preview">Acura RLX</a> initially came in five trim grades: RLX, RLX with Navigation, RLX with Technology package, RLX with Krell Audio package, and RLX with Advance package. The navigation system included surface-street traffic, and security features include stolen vehicle tracking, airbag deployment notification, remote locking and unlocking, and 24-hour concierge services. Infotainment systems use both an embedded data connection and smartphone integration. The RLX features a next-generation AcuraLink Communication system, with dual LCD display screens, high-end audio, the Aha streaming-audio interface, and an expanded range of infotainment and connectivity features.</p>, <p>After a very brief 2015 model year, the RLX received a small reboot with some updates for the 2016 model. The car's standard and available safety-feature set has been updated and is now collected under the AcuraWatch banner. The tech now includes a surround-view camera system, road-departure mitigation, and cross-traffic monitoring. The suspension has been retuned for improved ride quality, reduced noise, and better handling, and all models now come standard with 19-inch wheels. Acura has also trimmed the trim-level options from five to three, doing away with what was previously the base model and effectively raising the price. As a result, all models now include navigation and some other equipment.</p>, <p>A substantial facelift for the 2018 model year also lowered the RLX's price, while front-drive models gained a 10-speed automatic. Acura now only offers the RLX and the RLX Sport Hybrid.</p>]

[<p>The Acura TLX is a mid-size four-door sedan that aims for the Goldilocks spot.</p>, <p>Smaller than the RLX sedan, bigger than the compact ILX, the TLX replaced the former TL and TSX sedans in the Acura lineup.</p>, <p>With the TLX, Acura has a rival for sedans like the Buick Regal and LaCrosse, the Lincoln MKZ, the Volvo S60, and the Lexus ES.</p>, <p>In 2018, Acura refreshed the TLX and gave the sedan a new grille, new infotainment system, and a new sporty A-Spec trim line for models equipped with a V-6. In 2019, Acura gave the A-Spec treatment to inline-4 versions.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/acura_tlx_2019">2019 Acura TLX review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>With a more expressive sense of style, the Acura TLX comes across as a handsome update on the themes from the latest Acura products. It's neither offensive nor terribly exciting, though it looks much more balanced than former Acura four-doors that wore a beaky, pointed grille.</p>, <p>The TLX is offered with a choice of two engines. Base models come with a 2.4-liter direct-injected 4-cylinder making 206 horsepower and paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic. For a little extra, buyers can choose a 3.5-liter V-6 good for 290 hp and mated to a 9-speed automatic. V-6 versions also use cylinder deactivation technology, which can shut off three cylinders to save fuel under lighter loads, such as cruising on the highway.</p>, <p>Front-wheel-drive versions of the TLX get one noteworthy piece of technology handed down from the top-of-the-line RLX sedan: the Precision All-Wheel Steer system, which turns the rear wheels slightly in a way that will either add to maneuverability at low speeds or aid stability at higher speeds. All-wheel drive is available on V-6 models, featuring a new, lighter version of the brand’s Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system with rear-axle torque vectoring.</p>, <p>Dedicated modes allow the driver to cater the driving experience to their desires. As part of a so-called Integrated Dynamics System, the TLX gets Econ, Normal, Sport, and Sport+ settings, with each one affecting power-steering calibration, throttle response, transmission shifts, Active Noise Control settings, climate control operation, and the calibration of the all-wheel drive or rear-wheel steering system.</p>, <p>The TLX’s overall length is around 190 inches, which is close to the former TSX's measurement; its 109.3-inch wheelbase is carried over from the TL. The TLX is just as roomy inside as the TL—in other words, still a bit roomier in back than the German sport sedans in this size class. Active Noise Control helps keep the cabin quiet, as do new body-sealing and sound-insulation measures.</p>, <p>An array of accident-avoidance technologies, some of them offered on the RLX and MDX, are baked into the TLX. Forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitors are available on top-of-the-line versions. The TLX has achieved a top five-star overall rating from the federal government, and mostly top "Good" scores from the IIHS, except for an "Acceptable" rating on the small-overlap crash test.</p>, <p>Priced from the low $30,000 range, the TLX comes standard with power features; cruise control; Bluetooth; Apple's Siri Eyes Free; and a AM/FM/satellite radio sound system with seven speakers.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/alfa-romeo_stelvio
[<p>The Alfa Romeo Stelvio is the Italian automaker's first crossover SUV and loosely based on the Giulia sedan. It's the third product from Alfa Romeo since the brand's re-entry back into the U.S.</p>, <p>With the Stelvio, Alfa brings a serious dose of style and passion into the mid-size, luxury crossover niche, where many entries have relied on utility as their calling card.</p>, <p>As a luxury SUV, the Stelvio competes in the most difficult automotive segment on the planet. Among its rivals are the BMW X3, Porsche Macan, and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. The Stelvio trades on its seductive shape and interior, available horsepower, and relative rarity.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/alfa-romeo_stelvio_2018">2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>For its initial model year, the Stelvio is offered in three trim levels powered by a choice of two engines. All-wheel drive is standard across the lineup. The Stelvio and Stelvio Ti models come with a 280-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4, while the Quadrifoglio—that's Italian for "four leaf clover"—utilizes a 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6 rated at an impressive 505-hp. </p>, <p>Alfa Romeo made extensive use of aluminum to lighten the Stelvio, and it says that the Quadrifoglio in particular will be a track-oriented machine. To that end, the range-topper will offer Brembo carbon ceramic brakes and carbon fiber sports seats created by Sparco as options. Even the standard Quadrifoglio is a performance machine, however, with adaptive dampers and a four-mode control system including a race setting. The Quadrifoglio also includes a torque-vectoring rear differential designed to help out in hard cornering situations. In normal situations, most of the SUV's power goes to the rear wheels, but it can transfer up to 60 percent to the front axle. </p>, <p>The Stelvio looks properly Alfa Romeo, with numerous styling cues reminiscent of its Giulia platform-mate. Inside, the base model features a 6.5-inch infotainment screen, but other trim levels up that to a big 8.8-inch widescreen. A 7.0-inch LCD is included in the instrument cluster on all models, although Alfa Romeo hasn't gone the way of Audi with a fully virtual gauge cluster (yet). A control knob for the infotainment system with a touchpad for navigation entry will also be available. </p>, <p>Alfa Romeo says that it will offer a full complement of safety features in the Stelvio, including automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control that can be used in heavy traffic situations to bring the vehicle to a halt. The airbag count includes the expected front, side impact, and curtain airbags, plus knee airbags for the front seat passengers. </p>]

[<p>The Alfa Romeo Giulia is a compact sport sedan aimed at the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4, and Cadillac ATS.</p>, <p>Giulia is an old name for Alfa Romeo, reaching all the way back into the 1960s. The current model is a four-door sedan and the first meaningful step for the automaker to return to the U.S. The biggest changes for 2018 include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability, and a reshuffled trim lineup including better standard and optional equipment.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/alfa-romeo_giulia_2018">2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Giulia launched as the high-performance Quadrifoglio model, which is a competitor for the BMW M3, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Cadillac ATS-V. With a Ferrari-derived twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 under the hood, the Quadrifoglio makes 505 horsepower and 443 pound-feet of torque. This engine comes standard with start/stop technology and cylinder deactivation, a technology Alfa Romeo claims will result in a 15 percent improvement in real-word fuel economy. Alfa Romeo says the engine will vault the car from 0-60 mph in just 3.8 seconds on its way to a top speed of 191 mph.</p>, <p>Base models and Ti versions are powered by a turbocharged inline-4 making 280 horsepower. An 8-speed automatic is the only transmission in all models. All-wheel drive is optional with the inline-4.</p>, <p>Alfa Romeo claims the Quadrifoglio offers best-in-class torsional rigidity and a best-in-class power-to-weight ratio of 7 pounds per horsepower. Several weight-savings measures are applied to arrive at that number. Carbon fiber is used for the driveshaft, hood, and roof, while the doors, fenders, front and rear subframes, mirrors, and suspension are aluminum components. An aluminum composite and plastic crossmember sheds pounds at the rear, while optional carbon ceramic brakes weigh half as much as the standard cast iron rotors and save unsprung weight at all four corners. Cast-iron brakes are also offered.</p>, <p>All Giulia models feature a double wishbone front suspension and a multi-link independent rear suspension. The Alfa DNA Pro drive-mode selector is standard for the Quadrifoglio, offering Advanced Efficiency, Natural, Dynamic, and Race modes that adjust the brake and steering feel, as well as the engine, transmission, and throttle response.</p>, <p>The Giulia Quadrifoglio’s design features a long wheelbase with short overhangs. The familiar Alfa Romeo trefoil grille is front and center, flanked by adaptive bi-xenon headlights. A carbon fiber front active aero splitter increases high­-speed downforce by as much as 220 pounds. The rear fenders have powerful haunches that are reminiscent of the previous-­generation M3. The coefficient of drag is a fairly slippery 0.32.</p>, <p>Inside, the Quadriglio has aggressively bolstered Alcantara sport seats and a small steering wheel that is home to the start button and other controls. The instrument cluster has a A 7.0-inch driver information display, and the dash is available with an 8.8-inch display for infotainment information, as well as real-time performance data and telemetry. The center console houses a BMW iDrive-style control knob. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto were made optional for 2018 after not being offered in the Giulia's launch year.</p>, <p>The Giulia comes standard with eight airbags, including knee airbags for both front occupants, as well as hill start assist and a rearview camera. Also offered are forward collision warning with emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, lane departure warning with lane keep assist, blind-spot monitors with rear cross-path detection, front and rear park assist, and automatic high beams.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/alfa-romeo_4c
[<p>The Alfa Romeo 4C is the Italian automaker's two-seater sports car coupe or convertible.</p>, <p>The 4C was the first Alfa Romeo sold in the U.S. after a considerable hiatus. The 4C sports a turbo-4 and a dual-clutch automatic transmission. It's hardly advanced: the 4C skips power steering, many creature comforts, and usable space in favor of a "teenage Ferrari" approach to no-frills performance.</p>, <p>Is the 4C as good as all that? Well, our sister site <em>Motor Authority</em> liked it enough to name it the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1095367_2015-alfa-romeo-4c-motor-authoritys-best-car-to-buy-2015">Best Car to Buy 2015</a>, beating out competitors such as the BMW M3 and M4, the Dodge Challenger Hellcat, and even Lamborghini's entry-level Huracán.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 are very minimal. The front fascia is now available with carbon-fiber vents, and the black leather interior is now offered with yellow stitching.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/alfa-romeo_4c_2018">2018 Alfa Romeo 4C review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The 4C Spider features a removable cloth roof panel that rolls up and stows in the trunk. Compared to the very light coupe model, the Spider only adds 22 pounds. Styling is basically unchanged, though the Spider features an exposed carbon-fiber windshield header and trades the coupe's windowed engine cover for one that doesn't showcase the turbo 4-cylinder in back.</p>, <p>The concept may be simple, but the 4C was not done as a cost-saving exercise. It gets its own carbon-fiber chassis tub, with a massaged front-engine powertrain flipped around and installed in the rear to create a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The wheelbase measures only about 96 inches, and the whole car isn't much longer, at 156 inches. The tidy size and lightweight design lead to a U.S.-spec total of 2,465 pounds. That's slightly higher than the European model, as a result of additional crash-structure requirements as well as standard infotainment and air conditioning, as well as a passenger seat that adjusts, if only barely.</p>, <p>All 4Cs are powered by a turbocharged, direct-injected 1.75-liter 4-cylinder engine. This setup is rated at 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque—that means each horsepower is matched with only 10.3 pounds in the Italian mini-supercar. The Alfa makes a pretty fantastic noise, thanks in part to no muffler, and a center-exit dual-mode exhaust is available for those who want a different look and more control over the ruckus. </p>, <p>The engine features an aluminum block and special intakes designed to deliver a sporty note and good throttle response. Alfa Romeo also boasts that the engine features a "scavenging control system" that is said to all but eliminate turbo lag.</p>, <p>The 4C is rear-wheel drive, and the sole transmission is a 6-speed, dual-clutch automatic with paddle shifters. It offers several shift modes, from fully automatic operation to full-manual control.</p>, <p>Performance is pure sports car: 0-60 mph takes just 4.5 seconds, and the top speed is limited to 155 mph. Fuel economy is rated at 24 mpg city, 34 highway, 28 combined, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>Ride and handling are managed by a lightweight aluminum suspension--struts in front, double wishbones in back—mounted on subframes that are in turn mounted to the car’s carbon tub. The 4C also comes with a driving "DNA" selector, which allows the driver to choose from Dynamic, Natural, and All Weather modes, plus a special Race mode. American-spec cars have staggered 17- and 18-inch wheels and tires; an optional setup includes 18-inch front and 19-inch rear wheels.</p>, <p>Inside, the 4C has two seats and a minimalist look for the dash, with much of the carbon-fiber structure left bare for admiration. The center column, which is actually part of the carbon structure, has been left in full view to enhance the sense of uniqueness, technology, and light weight.</p>, <p>A special Launch Edition of the coupe was offered in the U.S. with sales limited to 500 units. It featured additional convenience features and special trim—and a price tag just below $70,000.</p>, <p>For 2016, Alfa offered a new Carbon Fiber Interior package and a new Akrapovic dual-mode electronically controlled exhaust system. The Carbon Fiber Interior package adds carbon fiber on the interior vents, instrument cluster surround, and instrument panel and shifter bezels. The new exhaust has dual center-mounted tips with a carbon fiber surround, and it delivers maximum sound when the DNA switch is in the Dynamic or Race modes. All models also received premium speakers, the coupe got the Alpine audio system from the Spider and a lockable console, and the Spider added a higher quality alarm system.</p>, <p>For 2017, the coupe received an available carbon-fiber roof, as well as a premium Alpine audio system with a subwoofer.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/aston-martin_db11
[<p>The Aston Martin DB11 is a 2+2 luxury coupe or convertible that replaced the DB9. The topless version is called the DB11 Volante.</p>, <p>(For math majors, the DB10 was a one-off movie car made exclusively for the James Bond film "Spectre.")</p>, <p>With the DB11, Aston Martin competes with heavy-hitters such as Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, and Mercedes-Benz.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our</strong></em> <em><a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/aston-martin_db11_2018"><strong>2018 Aston Martin DB11 review</strong></a></em></p>, <p>The DB11 made its debut for 2017 as a V-12-powered coupe. For 2018, it adds a V-8 engine option, a 4.0-liter twin-turbo unit sourced from Mercedes-AMG, and adds a convertible body style that Aston Martin calls Volante.</p>, <p>Instantly recognizable as a DB, the DB11 manages enough change that it looks fresh and distinctive. Aston Martin's signature grille returns, but it is deeper and wider. New LED headlights look considerably more modern than those they replace. A new clamshell hood has more pronounced hood lines without the cutlines. In fact, it's one large piece of rolled aluminum. Perhaps the most controversial element is the "floating" roof look. It features a two-tone appearance, but keeps its sleek profile. The rear gets LED taillights that extend into the center panel.</p>, <p>Many of the design features are there for aerodynamics. The gill-like “curlicues” behind the front wheels release high-pressure air from inside the wheel arches via concealed vents within the redesigned side-strakes. The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1105032_aston-martin-clears-the-air-on-new-db11s-aeroblade">AeroBlade</a> design of the rear pillars also draws in air through a vent at the base of each rear pillar and channels through the trunk and out the back, acting as a spoiler.</p>, <p>Under the sumptuous hood buyers can opt for a pair of new engines. First up is the twin-turbocharged 5.2-liter V-12 that makes 600 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. Also on offer is the Mercedes-AMG twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. With either engine, the power is sent through a torque tube via a carbon fiber driveshaft to a rear-mounted 8-speed automatic transmission. The DB11 has only rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Aston Martin says the DB11 can rocket from 0 to 62 mph in 3.9 seconds and reach a top speed of 200 mph with the V-12 or hit 60 mph in 4.0 seconds and reach 187 mph with the V-8. Fuel economy numbers are not yet available for the V-8, but the V12 drinks fuel at a rate of 15 mpg city, 21 highway, 17 combined.</p>, <p>The new platform is a bonded aluminum structure like Aston Martin’s previous design. However, it now incorporates more lightweight materials and is more space efficient. Twenty-inch wheels are fitted at all four corners, and the iron brakes are massive: 15.7-inch rotors with six-piston calipers up front and 14.2-inch rotors with four-piston calipers in the rear. Performance is also aided by a brake-based torque vectoring system, adaptive dampers, and a driving mode selector.</p>, <p>The interior of the DB11 features beautiful materials, a digital instrument cluster, an 8.0-inch screen with a rotary dial and touchpad, an additional 2.1 inches of head room and 3.4 inches of leg room in the rear, and an available Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. Safety features include camera-based monitoring systems, parking aids, and even ISOFIX mounting points for a pair of child seats in the back.</p>, <p>Pricing starts just below $200,000 for the V-8 and comes in around $212,000 for the V-12.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/aston-martin_rapide
[<p>The Aston Martin Rapide is a luxury coupe disguised as a four-door sedan. It's athletic and svelte, albeit not very practical for a sedan.</p>, <p>Not that it matters much with its devastating shape.</p>, <p>With the Rapide, Aston Martin competes with models such as the Porsche Panamera, Maserati Quattroporte, and BMW M6 Gran Coupe. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1105964_2017-aston-martin-rapide-s">2017 Aston Martin Rapide S review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Aston's exterior design suits the large Rapide very well, wrapping the four-door in stunning curves and tasteful details. The car made the transition from concept to production with surprisingly few styling changes. Indeed, the roadgoing version itself looks like a concept car to this day.</p>, <p>Inside, it's more of the same: simply gorgeous. As is usually the case with coupe-like sedans, the Rapide takes a usability hit as a result of its design. The swoopy roof cuts into rear headroom, and the stubby rear doors combine with the steep C-pillar to make entry and exit from the rear bucket seats surprisingly difficult for a sedan. That said, most owners won't mind making those sacrifices for style, especially since they're more likely to sit up front anyway.</p>, <p><a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1030995_2010-aston-martin-rapide-debuts-at-frankfurt-auto-show">Introduced in late 2009</a>, the Aston Martin Rapide was initially produced under contract by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, but as of 2012, production moved to the brand's home base in Gaydon, England. Regardless of where it's built, however, the Rapide exudes a style only Aston Martin offers, along with performance rarely found in an ultra-luxury sedan.</p>, <p>
The standard Rapide initially came with a 5.9-liter V-12 engine rated at 470 horsepower and 443 pound-feet of torque driving the rear wheels. Zero-to-60-mph acceleration for models so equipped was more than brisk, at just over five seconds, and the 188-mph top speed was shockingly fast.</p>, <p>The biggest changes to the Rapide's specification came very recently, with the addition of a new Rapide S model. Beginning with the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/aston-martin_rapide_2014">2014 Aston Martin Rapide S</a>, the standard Rapide spec gave way to the a version with more power and a new face, among other differences.</p>, <p><a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081857_aston-martin-rapide-s-more-power-sharper-style">The 2014 Rapide S</a>, which <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083120_2014-aston-martin-rapide-s-first-drive">we drove early in 2013</a>, boosted output from the 5.9-liter V-12 engine to 550 hp, making it Aston Martin's most powerful four-door ever. The result was a reduction in 0–60 mph time to 4.7 seconds and an increased top speed of 190 mph. Visually, the Rapide S was differentiated with a large grille that dropped the horizontal cross-bar for a more open-mouthed look; aerodynamic enhancements to the front splitter and integrated rear deck-lid spoiler; and other subtle details. Inside, the Rapide S's optional Duotone perforated red-and-black leather was a first for Aston Martin; other elements were largely untouched from the original Rapide.</p>, <p>
As with any Aston Martin, colors, materials, and features are highly customizable, with the only limiting factors being your imagination and your budget—not that Rapide buyers are likely to have many limitations in either regard.</p>, <p>Aston continued to upgrade the Rapide S for 2015. Changes included a new 8-speed automatic transmission from ZF, which puts it in good company of many other luxury sedans that use the same transmission. Together with software updates to the engine, the 2015 Rapide S was capable of a 0-60 time of 4.2 seconds and a top speed of 203 mph. The Pirelli tires were also re-engineered for improved ride quality and lower rolling resistance, supposedly without losing any grip. The wheels were made lighter as well. All told, these changes resulted in a boost in fuel economy: a 1-mpg improvement in the city and an increase of 3 mpg on the highway, for ratings of 14 mpg city and 22 highway. Not amazing, but pretty good for a 12-cylinder super-sedan.</p>, <p>For 2016, the Rapide S gets the brand's AMi II infotainment system, which includes such features as real-time visual read-outs of engine bhp and torque. Few changes were made for the 2017 model year in anticipation that the car will fundamentally change soon.</p>, <p>While the Rapide has been well-liked, it may not get renewed after this single first generation. Aston <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1101251_aston-martins-future-includes-v-12s-electrification-massive-product-investment#disqus_thread">has plans to offer a crossover vehicle as well as a new Lagonda super-sedan</a>, and the two models could indirectly replace the Rapide in the process. It's likely that the Rapide will feature an electrified or heavily modified powertrain in the coming years.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/aston-martin_vanquish
[<p>The Aston Martin Vanquish is a luxury two-door coupe or convertible that serves as the figurative top of the automaker's sleek portfolio. Without a roof, it's called a "Volante"—calling either "gorgeous" is just fine by us too.</p>, <p>It's a fitting revival of the Vanquish name, which was last used in the early 2000s.</p>, <p>With the Vanquish, Aston has rivals for the Bentley Continental GT, Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe, and Rolls-Royce Wraith.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/aston-martin_vanquish_2018">2018 Aston Martin Vanquish review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Aston Martin Vanquish</strong></p>, <p>Aston Martin previewed the latest Vanquish with its Project AM310 Concept. A nearly identical production version arrived for 2014 wearing a carbon-fiber body with visual influences from the original Vanquish.</p>, <p>At launch, it was powered by Aston's most powerful production engine yet, a version of its 6.0-liter V-12 initially rated at 565 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque. Only an automatic transmission was offered, with the initial run using a paddle-shifted Touchtronic 2 6-speed unit that sent power to the rear wheels.</p>, <p>For the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1093700_2015-aston-martin-rapide-s-vanquish-meld-old-with-new">2015 model year</a>, the Vanquish swapped a 6-speed automatic transmission for an 8-speed, greatly improving responsiveness and driving character. Upgrades to the engine tune and control units resulted in a rise to 568 hp and 465 lb-ft output from the 6.0-liter V-12 engine. The smidgen of added power and new transmission helped reduce the Vanquish's 0-to-60 time by a half-second, to 3.6 seconds. At the same time, fuel economy rose slightly, which is always a neat trick when performance is so markedly improved.</p>, <p>Despite a carbon-fiber body, the Vanquish's extensive luxury and aluminum-and-steel chassis result in a curb weight of 3,900 pounds. The less-than-sprightly weight <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079641_2014-aston-martin-vanquish-first-drive">lends a substantial feeling to the Vanquish's movement</a>, encouraging smooth and effortless cruising, but discouraging truly sporty behavior—despite quick acceleration and a 201-mph top speed.</p>, <p>The Vanquish's equipment list is excellent, as you might expect from a car that stickers close to $300,000, and includes a fantastic 1,000-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system; iPod and iPhone integration; Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity; a wi-fi hotspot; and navigation.</p>, <p>Most Aston Martin buyers will end up customizing their order somehow, and the company is more than happy to oblige. For extra cost, Aston will outfit the car with whatever upholstery and color combination of hides and paint that the person writing the check would like, and the personalization service extends to other one-off options and fitments. The company now calls this service Q by Aston Martin, lending it a slightly more mysterious and Bond-like air.</p>, <p>The 2016 and 2017 models were largely unchanged, except for an updated infotainment system with Apple's CarPlay as standard.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year it becomes the Vanquish S, receiving a power bump to 580 horses, getting a suspension tweak for sharper handling, and also undergoing exterior changes inspired by the Vulcan hypercar. Larger intake manifolds increase horsepower, while the 8-speed automatic is reworked for quicker shifts and more refinement at low speeds. The dampers, spring rates, and sway bar bushings are revised to improve dynamics. On the outside, exposed carbon fiber is used for a more aggressive front splitter and rear diffuser, both inspired by the look of the Vulcan. The Vanquish S is also now offered with carbon-fiber hood louvers, new forged five-spoke diamond turned wheels, and several new painted graphics packs.</p>, <p><em><strong>Aston Martin Vanquish history</strong></em></p>, <p>In its initial form, from 2001 to 2005, the Vanquish was known as the V12 Vanquish and featured a 5.9-liter V-12 engine making 450 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. The car was available in either a 2+2 or 2+0 seating configuration and used a variety of high-tech features and construction methods, such as a bonded chassis, aluminum and composite materials throughout, a drive-by-wire throttle, and an electrohydraulic transmission. It was also one of many Astons before and since to star in a James Bond film.</p>, <p>The second iteration of the car was known as the Vanquish S and was built from 2004 to 2007. More a collection of revisions than a full redesign, the S's primary mechanical difference was an increase in engine output to 514 hp. Slight modifications to the exterior and interior marked the new Vanquish S to skilled observers. A limited run of the final 40 cars built in the line were called the Vanquish S Ultimate Edition and received a special Ultimate Black paint scheme as well as special interior touches.</p>]

[<p>The Aston Martin Vantage is a luxury sports car that helped signal a new direction for the automaker when it was unveiled in 2017.</p>, <p>With the Vantage, Aston Martin has a rival for vehicles like the Porsche 911, and it is Aston's only car anywhere near $100,000. A new Vantage arrived for 2019.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read <a href="https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1116201_2019-aston-martin-vantage-first-drive-review-tilting-at-windmills">Motor Authority's first drive of the 2019 Aston Martin Vantage</a><br/></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Aston Martin Vantage</strong></p>, <p>With its beautiful new shape, the 2019 Aston Martin Vantage presents a new face for the British automaker's smallest sports car.</p>, <p>It's also new underneath, with aluminum body sections based on the Aston DB11. An inch shorter than the Porsche 911, the new Aston Vantage is 176 inches long in all.</p>, <p>Power for the Vantage comes from the same 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V-8 now found in the DB11, and sources from Mercedes-AMG. With 503 horsepower and 505 pound-feet of torque, it should shoot to 60 mph in less than five seconds. An 8-speed automatic sends power to the rear wheels.</p>, <p>Adaptive dampers, a torque-vectoring electronic rear differential, and 20-inch Pirelli PZero tires help take advantage of the power.</p>, <p>Prices for the 2019 Vantage start just below $150,000, or about $11,000 less than the more powerful Porsche 911 Turbo.</p>, <p><strong>Aston Martin Vantage history</strong></p>, <p>The current Vantage lineup was launched in 2005 as the V8 Vantage, and joined in 2009 by the V12 Vantage. This crop of sports cars and near-supercars bearing the Vantage name offers a range of coupes and convertibles, V-8 and V-12 engines, and special-edition models. Today it even includes a racing variant that is available in a streetable version.</p>, <p>The V8 Vantage is powered by a 4.7-liter V-8 engine rated at 420 horsepower and 336 pound-feet of torque. A choice of either 6-speed manual or 7-speed Sportshift II automatic transmissions is available. All Vantage models are rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Before the 2015 model year, V12 Vantages used a 5.9-liter V-12 engine that was good for 510 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque. So equipped, the Vantage was able to hit 60 mph in a scant 4.2 seconds and go on to a top speed of 190 mph. The larger engine added just 110 pounds compared to the weight of a V8 Vantage.</p>, <p>Aston Martin replaced the V12 Vantage in 2015 with the V12 Vantage S. The 5.9-liter V-12 engine was upgraded to 565 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque. The manual transmission was dropped, and it went automatic-only with a single-clutch Graziano transmission used elsewhere in the Aston lineup. With this combination, the V12 S can hit 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and run on to a top speed of 205 mph. The V12 S also benefits from three-stage adaptive damping.</p>, <p>An S version of the V8 Vantage coupe and roadster is also available. It offers an extra 10 horsepower over the standard V8, for a total of 430 hp, along with a different suspension tune, additional styling flourishes, and more standard equipment than on the regular V8. It uses a seven-speed transmission in place of the 6-speed unit from before.</p>, <p>A Vantage GT model joined the range in 2015 as an entry point to the brand, lowering the price while giving it the engine from the V8 Vantage S.</p>, <p>Aston also announced it would build 100 examples of what was originally to be called the Vantage GT3, a slightly toned down race car for the road. It makes use of carbon fiber everywhere, including the roof and hood, and is powered by a massaged version of the corporate V-12 that makes 591 hp. Shortly after the variant was unveiled, Porsche took issue with the GT3 name, as it uses it on high-performance 911s, and so Aston agreed to change the name to GT12 as a reference to the engine's cylinder count. The Vantage GT12 went on sale in 2015, but not in the United States.</p>, <p>The Vantage lineup changes little for 2016. Updates include a new touch interface for the center stack, as well as the addition of several new interior colors, a new wheel design, newly available Glen Coe leather, and two new exterior colors: Cinnabar Orange and Ultramarine Black.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Vantage lineup simplifies with a V8 Vantage GTS and V12 Vantage S as the only models. Both hardtop and convertible versions are available, and either model can be equipped with an automatic or manual transmission, although only 100 V12 Vantage S models with a manual will be made and only 100 GTS versions will be made altogether.</p>, <p><strong>Aston Martin Vantage history</strong></p>, <p>The Vantage has a long and distinguished—though somewhat disjointed—history at Aston Martin. The Vantage name has been appended to vehicles in fits and starts since 1951, when it debuted on the DB2 Vantage. After a two-year run, the Vantage name went on an eight-year hiatus until 1961-63 when it returned for the DB4 Vantage. That began a succession of cars running through 1969, including the DB5 and DB6 Vantage models.</p>, <p>
All of the DB-prefixed Vantages evolved a common theme of design and performance that built the Vantage name and, in many respects, Aston's reputation for style and speed.</p>, <p>
Following the original DB-series cars, another short hiatus saw the name lie dormant until its return for a two-year run in 1972 and 1973 as, simply, the Vantage. Returning once again in 1977, the V8 Vantage would run until 1989. In 1986, a Vantage Volante convertible joined the coupe, also ending its run in 1989.</p>, <p>
This second batch, the V8 Vantages, took both the name and the Aston Martin brand in new directions, both stylistically and in terms of performance. Almost a sort of luxurious British muscle car, the Vantages of this era were V-8 powered (as the name implies), larger, heavier cars that moved into the grand touring realm.</p>, <p>
From 1999 to 2003, the DB prefix returned with the DB7 V12 Vantage, bringing with it another advance, this time into the modern era of Aston Martin design and proportions. This car was designed during Ford's ownership of both Aston and Jaguar, and the DB7 began life as a concept for an F-Type that wasn't built. Based on a modified Jaguar XJS platform, the 420-hp DB7 V12 Vantage nevertheless managed to stake out its own territory in the exotic sports car world.</p>]

The Q5 is partially related to the A4, but boasts better ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive for all-weather situations.</p>, <p>The new 2018 Q5 not only rides on the same architecture as the Audi A4, but also it shares much of the sedan's powertrain and interior. Highlights for the new model include an all-wheel-drive system that disconnects the rear differential to save fuel and then, Audi claims, it reconnects the rear wheels quicker than any rival. Inside, the Q5 gains as an option Audi's Virtual Cockpit instrument cluster that replaces conventional gauges with a high-resolution, multi-configurable digital screen. </p>, <p>Initially, the Q5 is available only with a 2.0-liter turbo-4 <span>rated at 258 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque, improvements of 38 hp and 15 pound-feet over the outgoing model. It's mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox and it sends power to all four wheels exclusively; unlike some of its rivals, the Q5 is not available in a two-wheel drive configuration.</span></p>, <p><span>A replacement for the performance-oriented SQ5 <span>also</span> has arrived. </span>Power comes from the new turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 fitted to the latest S4 and S5 sedan and coupe, with peak output rated at 354 hp and 369 pound-feet of torque. Mated to an 8-speed automatic and driving all four wheels, the engine will hustle the SQ5 from 0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds.</p>, <p><strong>Audi Q5 history</strong></p>, <p>The Q5 first arrived in U.S. showrooms in late 2009 as a 2009 model, and was left virtually unchanged for the 2010 model year. It was offered in a single configuration: with a V-6 engine, an automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive. This initial Q5 had a smart mix of luxury and performance off the bat. The heart of the performance package was a 3.2-liter, 270-horsepower V-6, teamed up with a 6-speed automatic with manual gear selection and all-wheel drive. It was powerful, but created a little more volume and vibration than expected from an otherwise refined German offering. Gear changes were smooth enough, and Audi claimed a 0-60 mph time of 6.7 seconds.</p>, <p>The Q5's chief dynamic liability is its fairly stiff ride, and Audi's adjustable Drive Select suspension and steering are some of our least favorite applications of chassis electronics. The Q5 will tow 4,400 pounds and has nearly 8 inches of ground clearance, so mild off-roading isn't entirely out of the question. Most versions come with luxury features such as leather, Bluetooth, and satellite radio; a panoramic sunroof is a great addition to the options list.</p>, <p>In the 2011 model year, Audi added a new drivetrain option to the Q5 mix—a version of the VW/Audi corporate turbocharged 4-cylinder making 211 horsepower. Mated to a 6-speed automatic and front-wheel drive in base form, this is the Q5 we recommended unanimously at the time. It felt lighter on its feet, produced much better fuel-economy numbers than the V-6 (20/27 mpg vs 18/23 mpg), and had a lower sticker price. That said, it's still rare to find a Q5 priced below $40,000 with popular features.</p>, <p>For <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075662_2013-audi-q5-preview">the 2013 model year</a>, the Audi Q5 carried over its 2.0-liter turbo-4, but offered as a high-output option its 272-hp supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 coupled to an 8-speed automatic, plus a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1056338_2013-audi-q5-hybrid-coming-soon-report">new Q5 Hybrid</a> was added to the mix. The hybrid blends the turbo-4 powertrain and 8-speed automatic with lithium-ion batteries and a 54-hp electric motor for a net of 245 hp, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds, and a combined gas-mileage rating of 26 mpg, according to the EPA. Quattro all-wheel drive is standard with all powertrains, including the hybrid.</p>, <p>Audi added a TDI turbodiesel Q5 to its lineup for the 2014 model year and it earned EPA ratings of up to 27 mpg combined.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>On the other end of the spectrum, an SQ5 was added as the high-performance version of the Q5. It uses a 354-hp version of the corporate supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 and also gets upgraded chassis and suspension components, although it manages just 19 mpg combined. With those additions, the available Q5 powertrains numbered four, easily the most variety for any crossover in its class.</p>, <p>For 2016, Audi added some to the Q5's standard-equipment list and brought on some new package contents and options. A three-spoke multifunction steering wheel and the panoramic sunroof are now available on all Q5 models, and the adaptive damping suspension is now available as a stand-alone option on Q5 Premium Plus models. Audi connect is now available as part of the Navigation Plus package, while a new Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system arrives in Technology package Premium Plus models.</p>, <p>For 2017, Audi discontinued the Q5 Hybrid and added an available appearance package to the top-of-the-line SQ5.</p>]

[<p>The Audi Q7 is the automaker's biggest family-friendly crossover SUV. With seats for up to seven passengers, the Q7 has lots of space in addition to some of the latest technology offered by the Volkswagen Group.</p>, <p>In its first generation, the Q7 went largely unchanged from its 2007 introduction through its final year on sale as a 2015 model year. A redesigned Q7 arrived for the 2017 model year, carrying new styling, improved technology, and an updated powertrain menu. For 2018, it's mostly unchanged aside from a few additional standard features.</p>, <p>The Audi Q7 is the first among a slew of large SUVs that will ride atop similar structures underneath. The Q7 is distantly related to the Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and even counts the Lamborghini Urus in its family tree. The Audi Q8 adopts a sleeker roofline with similar running gear to the Audi Q7.</p>, <p>With the Q7, Audi competes with the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class and GLE-Class crossovers, the BMW X5, and the Volvo XC90.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_q7_2018">2018 Audi Q7 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi Q7</strong></p>, <p>Audi introduced a second-generation Q7 for the 2017 model year.</p>, <p>The look is more like that of a tall wagon than a hulking SUV, and the new interior is the most luxurious and refined yet for any Audi crossover. The new platform lowers weight by a claimed 700 pounds. Audi initially made the Q7 available with the corporate 3.0-liter, supercharged V-6 that makes 333 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque. A 2.0-liter turbo-4 joined the mix later, and a plug-in hybrid model will be part of the lineup.</p>, <p>Audi managed to make the Q7 slightly narrower and shorter overall while increasing cargo room and second-row leg room; head room has also been increased, and the Q7 continues to offer a third row of seats.</p>, <p>Audi has filled the new Q7's cabin with its latest technology. The interface uses a version of the Virtual Cockpit digital-instrument/infotainment combo first used on the TT, but the Q7 benefits from a second control screen located in the center stack. It also offers integration with iPhone and Android smartphones through Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with the option to add Android tablets for back-seat passengers. This is the most advanced Audi infotainment setup yet, and should make its way into the rest of the brand's lineup shortly.</p>, <p>Audi has shown a plug-in hybrid version of the new Q7, dubbed e-tron, which uses electric motors and either a diesel or gas engine. The model may be offered here, but it's likely that a U.S.-bound e-tron would eschew the TDI engine for one that sips gasoline.</p>, <p>For its sophomore year, the 2018 Q7 is mostly unchanged. A proximity key with keyless ignition is standard, a Bose audio system now comes on Premium Plus models, and Prestige models have power door closers.</p>, <p><strong>Audi Q7 history<br/></strong></p>, <p>Shown first as a concept vehicle, the Q7 was Audi's first SUV when it joined the U.S. lineup in the 2007 model year—although Audi had offered a higher-riding "Allroad" version of the A6 Avant wagon in prior years. The Q7 was expressly designed to appeal to sport-'ute shoppers.</p>, <p>Initially, the Q7 came with only a single powertrain: a 4.2-liter V-8 with 350 hp, all-wheel drive and a 6-speed automatic transmission. Still, it proved a major upgrade over the usual SUV handling—and most of all, the usual SUV styling, with its sleek side view.</p>, <p>In the 2008 model year, Audi addressed the fuel-economy shortcomings of the V-8 somewhat with a new 280-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 option—and then again in 2009 when it introduced a turbodiesel V-6 version of the Q7 capable of 17 mpg city, 25 highway, according to the EPA. A 333-hp version of the gas-powered V-6 was added later and the V-8 was dropped from the lineup.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>For 2015, three V-6 versions of the Q7 were available with the sweet-shifting automatic transmission delivering power to all four wheels and with an adjustable air suspension tuning the ride quality to near-ideal, as long as you stay away from the larger wheel options.</p>, <p>The Audi Q7 has been among the safest SUVs on the road. The NHTSA gave in 2011 the Q7 its highest ratings for front and side impact protection, and has also awarded the Q7 four stars for rollover resistance. The IIHS rated the Q7 as "Good" in front, side and rear impacts, and generally considers the 'ute to be one of the safest picks.</p>]

[<p>The Audi A5 is a luxury coupe, sedan, or four-door fastback that's related to the A4 but with a sleeker shape. It's also the basis for the hotter Audi S5, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_s5">which we cover separately</a>.</p>, <p>New for 2008, the A5 family was most recently redesigned in 2018.</p>, <p>The second-generation A5 is built on the same lighter, leaner platform as the new A4 sedan. The A5 comes with a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that puts out 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque, up 32 hp and 15 lb-ft from last year. Transmission choices consist of a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox for all models and a 6-speed manual that is exclusive to the coupe. All models come with all-wheel drive that Audi calls as Quattro.</p>, <p>With the A5, Audi has a rival for cars such as the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS, Lexus RC, Infiniti Q60, and BMW 4-Series.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_a5_2018">2018 Audi A5 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi A5</strong></p>, <p>With 20 percent more power on tap and about 100 pounds of weight savings due to a trim new platform, the 2018 Audi A5 is quicker than the outgoing model, accelerating from 0-60 mph in as little as 5.7 seconds, and it's also decidedly sportier. Audi also includes a "Drive Select" system that lets drivers choose the parameters for the steering, throttle, transmission, and when properly equipped, adaptive suspension. Opt for the Dynamic settings, and it's even sportier. Ride, however, doesn't suffer. The A5 retains its mission as a comfortable grand tourer.</p>, <p>You'd be forgiven for mistaking the new A5 with the outgoing model. Its edges are sharper this time around, but the silhouette is identical. The Sportback is the pick of the trio, only if its shaped is wholly plagiarized from the A7.</p>, <p>Audi didn't mess with the A5's sleek styling, making it an evolution of the proven original. The lines are a little sharper, but the silhouette is very much the same, and the seductive look is basically unchanged. The Sportback rides the longer A4 wheelbase but effectively stretches the coupe's roofline into a sleek hatchback profile.</p>, <p>The interior, however, is much different, and it's highlighted by the newly available Audi virtual cockpit digital instrument cluster. This 12.3-inch cluster offers various screens that show trip, navigation, and other infotainment information. It also gets an updated version of Audi's Multi-Media Interface with hand-writing recognition.</p>, <p>The Sportback's longer wheelbase gives it a roomier rear seat, and the hatchback body style adds real cargo utility.</p>, <p>New safety features include collision warnings with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts, active lane control, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>Fuel economy for the A5 is improved at 27 mpg combined for all body styles.</p>, <p><strong>Audi A5 history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The Audi A5 and S5 coupe were introduced in the 2008 model year with a distinct division of power. The A5 two-door hardtops received a 265-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 with direct injection and a choice of a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission. This edition also had standard Quattro all-wheel drive, which gave it substantial curb weight—but not as much of a performance penalty as expected, as Audi estimated 0-60 mph times of about six seconds. Our editors praised the A5's ride, refinement, and ravishing looks, but took note of the A5's cramped back seat, and the relative lack of steering feel. An optional S-line package firmed up handling somewhat, and a Drive Select option allowed drivers to choose settings for the electronically controlled suspension, steering, transmission, and throttle with mixed results.</p>, <p>For the 2010 model year, Audi added several new options to the lineup. Both the A5 and S5 arrived in handsome Cabriolet form, with a power-folding fabric roof. Cabriolets adopted optional Drive Select, while the Quattro all-wheel-drive system on the S5 coupe and Cabriolet was tuned for a rear power bias.</p>, <p>As for the A5 coupe and Cabriolet, things became more complex as well. The base coupe received a new turbo-4 with 211 hp (now the only A5 engine), all-wheel drive, and a 6-speed manual transmission, with an option for a 6-speed automatic. The base Cabriolet arrived with front-drive and a continuously variable transmission mated to the same turbo-4; all-wheel drive was optional on the Cabrio and was packaged with the conventional 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>For the 2014 model year, Audi increased power fro the A5's turbo-4 from 211 to 220 hp. All-wheel drive was standard, and Drive Select was an option. Coupes came with a choice of a 6-speed manual or a new 8-speed automatic; Cabriolets offered only the automatic.</p>, <p>Audi also fitted its most advanced telematics and infotainment features to the A5 (and S5 as well as the RS 5), including Audi Connect, which added 3G connectivity to turn the car into a rolling wireless hotspot. The navigation system added the ability to render maps with Google Earth and Google Street View data to gorgeous effect. A Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system was available, as was adaptive cruise control that could bring the car to a complete stop if it detected an obstacle at speeds of up to 19 mph.</p>, <p>Changes for the 2016 model year were limited to standard and optional equipment adjustments. The S line exterior package became standard, and Audi Connect became part of the Navigation Plus package. Premium Plus models came with a Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system. For 2017, the A5 lineup was carried over with no changes.</p>]

[<p>The Audi A3 is the luxury automaker's smallest and most affordable car.</p>, <p>Petite but polished, the A3 family of cars has much of the driving essence of Audi's big sedans and hatchbacks, just without all that useful space.</p>, <p>With the A3, Audi offers a small convertible, sedan, or plug-in hybrid hatchback. A turbodiesel was dropped when Audi and parent-company Volkswagen admitted it illegally polluted.</p>, <p>Those looking for more zip will find the S3, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_s3">which is covered separately</a>. The big news for 2018 was the inclusion of an RS 3 sedan variant that added more horsepower to the formula with predictable results: it's wildly entertaining to drive everywhere.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1110927_2018-audi-a3">2018 Audi A3 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new A3 family</strong></p>, <p>The new A3 is much like the original Audi compact—the 1996 A4—both in size and in style. Their interiors carve out new territory namely because they're stark and more plainly drawn than anything in the upper Audi reaches.</p>, <p>The A3 offers two different powertrains—gas and plug-in hybrid—as well as the high-performance S3 and RS3 models. For 2017, all A3 sedans and cabriolets are powered by a 220 horsepower 2.0-liter turbo-4 and they offer a choice between front- and all-wheel-drive paired exclusively to a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.</p>, <p>The A3 features front struts, a four-link independent rear suspension, and precise electric power steering.</p>, <p>The A3's compact cockpit is fine in front, tight in back. At just 175.4 inches long, and with a 103.8-inch wheelbase, the A3 has a more accessible back seat than the Mercedes-Benz CLA, but leg room is still is tight. </p>, <p>The A3's base price is around $31,000. Standard equipment includes a panoramic sunroof, leather upholstery, Bluetooth, and Audi's Multi Media Interface (MMI) infotainment system, which controls audio and vehicle systems. Audi also offers a 4G LTE connection with wi-fi hotspot capability, as well as an upgraded Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo with 705 watts of power and 14 speakers. The S3 gets a little more standard equipment plus the performance enhancements, and starts near $42,000.</p>, <p>The A3 Cabriolet went on sale in late summer 2014, powered by the A3's turbocharged gas-powered inline-4, and priced in the $30,000 range. Like in the sedan, quattro all-wheel drive is optional and an automatic is the only gearbox available.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the A3 lineup added the <a href="http://http//www.greencarreports.com/news/1093607_2016-audi-a3-e-tron-first-drive">e-tron hybrid hatchback wagon</a>. In a distinctive hatchback body, Audi mates a lithium-ion battery pack and an electric motor to a 1.4-liter turbo-4, for a net of 204 hp. In electric-only mode, the A3 e-tron can travel about 25 miles, and has a range of more than 500 miles on a full tank of gas and a full charge of the battery pack. Audi promises a full recharge in less than four hours and it includes a Level 2 home charger. </p>, <p>The A3 received a few changes for 2017, namely some mild styling updates, an available full LCD instrument cluster, and standard automatic emergency braking. The car was largely the same for 2018.</p>, <p><strong>Audi A3 history</strong></p>, <p>The first A3, which came to the U.S. as a 2006 model, offered several different combinations of running gear. It could be bought with front-wheel or quattro all-wheel drive, 4- and 6-cylinder engines, and manual or dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The A3's nimble handling won favor with enthusiasts, though some reviewers felt the stiff ride and the electric power steering were lacking compared to the best competitors. Most A3s of this era driven by enthusiasts were fitted with the 200-hp 2.0-liter turbo-4, which feels quicker in most real-world driving than the much heavier 250-hp, 3.2-liter V-6.</p>, <p>The A3 received its first refresh for the 2009 model year. Mechanical changes included a newly optional adaptive dampers, which could be switched between Normal and Sport modes, changing the properties of the magnetic fluid in the dampers to alter ride firmness and response. There also were aesthetic adjustments, such as new designs for the wheels and side mirrors, metallic interior trim, and revised audio controls.</p>, <p>More changes arrived for 2010, including a new engine choice—the Volkswagen Group's popular 140-hp, 2.0-liter TDI turbodiesel—and the end of the V-6 option. The other change for 2010 was that the previous S-line appearance package became standard equipment on all A3 models.</p>, <p>In 2015, the EPA notified Volkswagen that its 2.0-liter diesel engines—including the one in the A3 TDI—exceeded by 40 times the legal limit for nitrogen oxides emissions. The automaker issued a stop-sale for the A3 TDI cars, and Volkswagen is working to fix engines that were sold with falsified emissions levels.</p>]

[<p>The Audi A4 has been the brand's hallmark sedan since the 1996 model year, when it replaced the old 80/90 compacts. Today, the A4 family includes the high-performance S4, the Allroad wagon, and the stock-and-trade four-door sedan.</p>, <p>A new A4 arrived for the 2017 model year and largely carries over into 2018 aside from some streamlining of models and a few more standard features. With the A4, Audi takes on competitors such as the Cadillac ATS, BMW 3-Series, Infiniti Q50, and Mercedes C-Class.</p>, <p>Audi's family of A4 cars also counts the Q5 crossover—it's distantly related—as well as the A5/S5/RS5 coupes, convertibles, and hatchbacks.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_a4_2018">2018 Audi A4 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi A4</strong></p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078569_first-details-emerge-on-the-next-gen-audi-a4-b9">new Audi A4</a> arrived in the U.S. in spring 2016 as a 2017 model. It remains about the same size as the previous car, but has lost weight thanks to better construction and a lighter all-wheel-drive system. An <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_allroad_2017">A4 Allroad wagon</a> is also available with a raised suspension and standard all-wheel drive, and a high-power Audi S4 is available for those looking for something a little sportier.</p>, <p>Its new style is largely derivative, but it has grown in places where its predecessor was lacking. Surprisingly, the A4 is related to cars much bigger than it, including the Q7, as part of a larger plan to standardize more of Audi's vehicles. The new A4 is lighter too—Audi claims it's as much as 264 pounds lighter than the prior model.</p>, <p>A new 2.0-liter turbo-4 became the first powertrain available in the U.S.-spec A4 and it's available in two different flavors: The standard A4 puts out 252 horsepower, while the more efficiency-oriented <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1105648_audi-ups-its-game-with-new-37-mpg-a4-ultra">A4 Ultra</a> serves as the entry-level model with 190 hp. The Ultra and the front-wheel drive standard A4 come exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the A4 Quattro (that's Audi-speak for all-wheel drive) offers either a 6-speed stick shift or the 7-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Redesigned five-link suspensions are used front and rear that result in a more comfortable drive. The Audi Drive Select system with adjustable shocks, steering, and throttle will be available as an option. The power steering is a newly developed electromechanical system with an available dynamic mode that varies the ratio based on vehicle speed and steering angle.</p>, <p>Inside, the A4 adopts some of Audi's latest infotainment technology. A 12.3-inch digital instrument panel is available, as is a new Multi-Media Interface (MMI) system with touchpad input. Safety features now include lane-keeping assist, forward-collision warnings with automatic braking, and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality.</p>, <p>For 2018, heated seats were made standard on all models, while Premium Plus trim levels gained a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p>, <p>Prices range from about $36,000 to more than $55,000.</p>, <p><strong>Audi A4 history</strong></p>, <p>For almost two decades, the A4 was the brand's entry-level vehicle in its American lineup. But with the arrival of the A4's smaller A3 siblings, the A4 is no longer the baby of the family.</p>, <p>Since 1996, when it first arrived as the replacement for the Audi 80/90 lineup, the A4 has been seen as a slightly sportier alternative to traditional luxury cars.</p>, <p>At first, it wasn't a pure success: The 1996 A4 offered a wheezy 172-hp, 2.6-liter V-6 with a 5-speed manual transmission or optional 5-speed automatic (with Tiptronic manual control on some models). Performance with this engine was just adequate, particularly with the added weight of quattro all-wheel drive. At least it sounded good and was very smooth. In its second year, the A4 grew stronger with a 193-hp, 2.8-liter V-6 that moved it with more authority. Its base engine, a 150-hp, 1.8-liter turbo-4 (dubbed 1.8T) ended up being the real star, however. It offered a more sprightly feel than the V-6 because of its accessible torque and better fuel economy.</p>, <p>Size was an issue, not just with the Audi, but also with its German rivals. Many shoppers forgot how small the A4 was until they got inside—or tried the back seat. At just 178 inches long, the 1996 A4 wasn't much longer (or any larger inside) than a contemporary Toyota Corolla. It had a winning interior with a rich feel, mostly because Audi was way ahead of most other luxury automakers, including Mercedes-Benz and BMW, when it came to interior appointments. That included the introduction of items such as a navigation system before most other compact luxury sedans were offering one.</p>, <p>Avant (wagon) models of the A4 were offered from 1998 until 2012, and mirrored the sedan offerings, though they offered a bit more versatility thanks to flat-folding back seats and the wide-opening hatch. The Allroad replaced the A4 Avant, using the same body on slightly higher suspension and with off-road-evocative body cladding.</p>, <p>For 2000 and 2001, the limited-edition S4 offered a 250-hp, twin-turbo V-6 and quattro all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Audi extended its lead with the A4's redesign for 2002. It brought with it a completely new, more athletic look on the outside. With this generation, the A4 was fitted with a 170-hp version of the 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine or a 220-hp, 3.0-liter V-6. Audi offered an automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT) for several years, but it was only offered on front-wheel-drive versions of the A4 (quattro models had the manual or a 5-speed automatic). Overall, the CVT was serviceable, just not especially satisfying from a performance standpoint.</p>, <p>Audi introduced a Cabriolet (convertible) version of the A3 in 2003. It used a soft folding top and was made safer with a pop-up roll bar and side airbags. It was offered with a choice of front-drive and a CVT or all-wheel drive paired with an automatic transmission through 2009. The A4 Cabriolet was subsequently replaced by a Cabriolet version of the A5, which arrived in 2010.</p>, <p>The Audi A4 was completely redesigned for 2009, and rode on an all-new platform. All post-2009 Audi A4 models equipped with all-wheel drive received Audi's latest version of the quattro system, which sent more power to the back wheels and appealed to those who wanted more performance alienating all-weather buyers</p>, <p>The S4 returned for 2010; it was fitted with a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 333 horsepower, teamed with a dual-clutch transmission, and an available Drive Select system that let drivers tailor transmission, steering, throttle, and suspension settings through Normal, Comfort, and Sport modes.</p>, <p>A facelift was applied for the 2013 model year, when Audi also fitted its latest infotainment and telematics services, including Audi Connect, which turns the car into a mobile hotspot. Also available: an optional navigation system that incorporates Google Earth and Google Street View data, displayed on a gorgeous LCD screen, for one of the best GPS experiences available.</p>, <p>Instead of offering the sport wagon in the 2013 model year with other revamped models, Audi instead chose to import the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_allroad_2013">Allroad</a>, a wagon with higher ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive. The Allroad is basically an A4 Avant with body cladding and more standard features. It lacks the manual-transmission option of its Avant forebear.</p>]

[<p>The Audi TT blurs the line between sporty coupes and convertibles and true sports cars. It's a two-door luxury vehicle now in its third generation, after a 2016 reboot.</p>, <p>Audi adds a high-powered, track-ready TT RS for the 2018 model year. It features a 400-horsepower turbo-5 and a magnetic ride suspension, as well as massive front brakes.</p>, <p>Audi has moved the TT further up the performance ladder since its 2000 debut. The first TT was an expression of style at the cost of substance. While its Deco-tinged tribute turned heads, it lacked the handling to do much for interior passengers. The second time around for the TT was somewhat sharper, although its looks were less bleeding-edge.</p>, <p>Now, in its third generation, Audi is pitching the TT as a true sports car, with next-level handling and grip. With the TT, Audi has a rival for vehicles like the Mini Cooper, Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ, even the BMW 2-Series and Mercedes SLC-Class.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_tt_2018">2018 Audi TT review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi TT</strong></p>, <p>In the TT's third generation, the car was initially offered in TT and TTS strengths, with both coupes and convertibles available. The latest TT design is certainly more starched than the flowing lines of the last generation, bringing with it a wider, more angular grille and a horizontal theme to the overall concept. There's more use of aluminum throughout, with the automatic rear spoiler and fascias being the only body panels made of something else (plastic).</p>, <p>The cabin is where the TT changes most dramatically. The gauges and center LCD screen have been combined, with Audi placing a single 12.3-inch screen in the nacelle where the dials used to live. The screen can toggle through various functions, including navigation and all infotainment modes while also showing gauge info. This single-screen setup is shared with the R8, while other Audi models get multi-screen versions of the virtual cockpit system.</p>, <p>The third-gen TT doesn't grow in external dimensions very much, but the wheelbase is up almost 1.5 inches. It rides on a version of the VW Group's new "MQB" platform. The TT's suspension remains a strut design in front—with some aluminum pieces to shave weight—and four-link setup in the rear. The TT's electric power steering enables new functions, such as active lane control and parking assist.</p>, <p>TT models have a 220-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4. In the TTS, the same engine puts out 292 hp; both are paired to the VW Group's DSG gearbox, which Audi calls S tronic. Quattro all-wheel drive is standard in the U.S., and the TTS also comes with the magnetic ride dampers. Coupe versions of both models are offered, while the TT only gets the convertible treatment for now.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, some TT trim choices changed and a rearview camera became standard.</p>, <p>The high-performance TT RS joined the lineup for 2018. In addition to the 5-cylinder, it features a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. It is also offered with a Dynamic Plus package that replaces the magnetic ride dampers with fixed dampers, adds front carbon ceramic brakes, and gets a top speed increase from 155 to 174 mph. Other 2018 changes include making front and rear parking sensors standard across the lineup and the addition of two new packages: an S line Competition package for TT and TTS models and an exclusive interior package for the TTS.</p>, <p><strong>Audi TT history</strong></p>, <p>The TT was originally based on Volkswagen/Audi running gear shared by the Audi A4. It struck a fresh styling chord when it first arrived. Audi's prior coupes, from the 1980s Coupe GT to the unloved Audi 90 Coupe, had been more characteristically German. The Audi TT brought a lovingly detailed, Art Deco-influenced look to the sporty realm. The lovely lines—especially effective in flat gray paint—were met with an interior that could be fitted with beautiful swatches of baseball-glove leather and stitching, and aluminum trim. The TT was less convincing as a sports car in that first edition, which was sold through the 2006 model year. Safe, but unexciting handling combined with somewhat lively 222-hp turbocharged 4-cylinder power in the best quattro all-wheel-drive versions; V-6 cars were heavier and felt less responsive despite their 250 hp, while front-drive versions suffered torque steer.</p>, <p>With the 2008 redesign, Audi turned the tables; the TT's exterior style was muted to match more of the cues found on its other cars. This TT fit more with the then-new R8 thanks to its side sculpting, low nose, and LED detailing. The cockpit lost its grabby circular theme, and faced the driver and passenger with a flight-inspired set of knobs, switches, and LCD screens bearing a distinctly masculine appeal. It was a sleeker look for sure, though less distinctive. Either as a TT or a TTS, there remained two body style choices: coupe and roadster.</p>, <p>For 2012 and 2013, Audi brought the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1066631_2012-audi-tt-rs-first-drive">top-performance TT RS to the U.S.</a> for a very limited run. With a 360-hp, 2.5-liter high-boost-turbocharged inline-5, a lowered magnetic suspension system, and upgraded performance trim and hardware, the limited-production TT RS had serious sports-car appeal for enthusiasts who wanted a car for weekend track outings. It was offered here only with a manual transmission, while other markets were also offered a slightly quicker, but less involving, dual-clutch automated model.</p>, <p>Powertrains for the second generation included a 200-hp, 2.0-liter turbo-4, which only came with a fantastic 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. The performance,-oriented <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1025596_audi-announces-u-s-pricing-for-tts-coupe-and-roadster">265-hp turbo TTS</a> also came exclusively with the dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive. All models with the old 250-hp V-6 were given the axe for 2010.</p>, <p>The TT complemented good fuel economy with nimble handling and more of an authentic sports car feel, flat and eager to hook up with the pavement. Interior room wasn't the TT's strongest suit, though the seats were wide and the cabin spacious enough for adults. The roadster models had a nicely executed power fabric top. Trunk and interior storage were somewhat limited, though, so weekend trips were best reserved for two.</p>, <p>The TT was carried over through the 2015 model year to finish out the second generation.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_r8
[<p>The Audi R8 is a two-door sports car that joined the Audi lineup in the 2008 model year. Offered over time as a coupe and as a convertible, with either V-8 or V-10 power, the R8 skipped the 2016 model year—and returned for 2017 with a new design and V-10 power.</p>, <p>The Audi R8 calls the Lamborghini Huracan its distant cousin, just over the border across Austria or Switzerland. The R8's roots are firmly German, however; it emphasizes everyday usability and drivability. The Lamborghini is full of right angles and bright colors.  </p>, <p>Still, with its handsome, somewhat reserved good looks, the Audi R8 hides impressive performance. For 2018, the R8 is mostly unchanged. A new Black Optic appearance package peppers in black styling elements, LED headlights are now standard on the R8 V10 Plus, and as part of a greater shift toward emphasizing the Audi Sport brand, that nameplate is now festooned to the R8's grille.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_r8_2018">2018 Audi R8 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi R8<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The second-generation R8 went on sale in early 2016 as a 2017 model, offered only as a coupe with a V-10 engine. Standard all-wheel drive returns, but the V-8 of the last generation is gone, though it will likely be replaced by a new smaller engine. The convertible body style has returned for the newest generation.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, Audi has no plans to bring back a manual transmission for the R8.</p>, <p>The latest R8 is based on the Volkswagen Group’s new Modular Sportscar System aluminum space-frame, which is reinforced with carbon fiber in key areas such as the central tunnel and firewall. This, along with other measures, helps the car save about 110 pounds. There is more power from updated V-10 powertrains: 540 horsepower in the R8 V10, and 610 hp in the V10 Plus. The V-10 also delivers 13 percent better fuel economy thanks to the addition of port fuel injection (it already had direct injection) and cylinder deactivation. Unlike most other Audi models, the R8 retains normally aspirated engines, but the forthcoming base engine will probably have forced induction. Shifting duties are handled exclusively by Audi’s 7-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission in both models. (It's worth mentioning that the V10 Plus model won't have any forward overdrive cogs in its gearbox, which makes it a true trackday special.)</p>, <p>The R8 offers up stunning straight-line and cornering performance. A tenacious handler, the R8 also has excellent electric power steering and strong brakes. On the safety side, it offers side-impact and curtain airbags, as well as a very rigid body structure. As a supercar, don’t expect the R8 to be crash-tested. In all, we praise the R8 most for its surprising practicality and balanced handling, with reservations expressed for its tiny cargo area and obstructed rearward views. The standard rearview camera and parking sensors make backing up and parking the car easier.</p>, <p>For 2018, the R8 gains a new Black Optic appearance package that has dark-finish alloy wheels, a black side blade on V10 models, and a few more hints in, predictably, black. LED headlights are now standard on the V10 Plus and optional on the V10, while Audi Sport badging replaces the Quattro badge formerly affixed to the sports car's grille.</p>, <p><strong>Audi R8 history</strong></p>, <p>The R8 broke cover at the 2006 Paris Auto Show to immediate acclaim. Audi paired the first 2008 R8 with its own 4.2-liter, 420-hp V-8 mounted midships, behind the driver and passenger.</p>, <p>Elsewhere, Audi borrowed liberally from the Lambo parts bin to create the R8. The four-wheel-drive system was related to that in the Lamborghini Gallardo, as were the semi-automatic R tronic gearbox and the standard 6-speed manual gearbox. Distinct from the Lambo exotics, the Audi R8 sported an aluminum space-frame that gave it an overall length some five inches longer than the Gallardo's—and as a result, much more interior space, not to mention a far more logical interior layout.</p>, <p>The R8 carried into the 2009 model year mostly unchanged. Starting in 2010, Audi introduced a string of new versions. The first was a V-10-powered model that drilled out 525 hp and dramatically dropped acceleration figures below the 4-second mark. A Spyder version was introduced in 2011. Fitted with the V-10 engine and the R tronic transmission, and priced well above the R8 V10 coupe's $150,000 sticker, it was the one to have for those who wanted exclusivity. The Spyder's fabric roof was power operated, though the Spyder lost the Coupe's distinctive "sideblade" intake covers in the transition.</p>, <p>For 2012, as a sort of swan song for the pre-facelift R8, a GT model was offered. It weighed 200 pounds less than a comparable V-10 model and was tuned to 560 hp, allowing a 0-60-mph sprint of 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 199 mph. Just 333 R8 GTs were built for sale worldwide, all of them coupes wearing body kits and spoilers for extra downforce.</p>, <p>Audi skipped the 2013 model year entirely, selling the 2012 models through the arrival of the refreshed R8 early in 2013 as a 2014 model. That car <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1077965_2013-audi-r8-refresh-first-images">received some mild appearance updates and some more significant mechanical changes</a>. At the top of the list was a new S tronic dual-clutch transmission that replaced the previous automated manual (a 6-speed manual transmission was still offered). This dual-clutch was exactly what should have been in the R8 all along, offering paddle-shifted manual control while also managing almost psychic levels of automatic-mode predictive downshifts and upshifts based on the driver's use of the brake and throttle.</p>, <p>A new <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080350_2013-audi-r8-v10-spyder-and-v10-plus-first-drive">V10 Plus model joined the range for 2014</a>, generating 550 hp and shaving 110 pounds from the weight of the standard V10 Coupe, but without the extreme edginess or limited sales targets of the R8 GT.</p>, <p>For 2015, Audi offered a very small run of special R8s. The R8 Competition was based on the V10 Plus and made an additional 20 hp. It was produced as a tribute to Audi's LMS race cars. The package included special carbon fiber trim, a modified aero setup, and other touches. Only 60 were offered in the U.S.</p>, <p>No 2016 model was offered as Audi prepared to release the 2017 model.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_s4
[<p>The Audi S4 is a spin-off of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_a4">Audi A4 line of luxury compact vehicles</a>. A higher-performance version, called the RS 4, has joined the S4 at points through its 15-year history.</p>, <p>The S4 is one of Audi's family of "S" sport vehicles—S3, S5, S6, S7, and S8 included. With the S4, Audi has a rival for the BMW M3 and M4, Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG, Lexus RC F, and Cadillac ATS-V.</p>, <p>The S4 received a significant update alongside the related A4. While the car's exterior hasn't changed much, the car is lighter and more powerful—all to the benefit of performance. Its tame exterior belies its technological upgrades, including an advanced cockpit with a large display.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_s4_2018">2018 Audi S4 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi S4</strong></p>, <p>Audi introduced a new S4 for the 2018 model year, based off the automaker's new A4. Like before, the S4 receives a bigger engine than the A4; this time a 3.0-liter turbocharged V-6. The engine produces 354 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. Mated to a standard 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, the S4 sprints up to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds on its way to a top speed of 155 mph. For the first time, Audi made available a sport rear differential to shuffle power along the rear axle and adaptive suspension to firm the dampers for sportier driving.</p>, <p>A new body wraps around the engine for a sleeker, honed shape this time around. The S4 is more serious than the cars that came before it; styling elements cut a sharper tone—no more Skittles-colored cars. The S4 carries four in relative comfort inside, awash in leather and Alcantara. Audi offers more tech in the S4 this year, including an optional "Virtual Cockpit" that replaces traditional gauges with a 12.3-inch display for the driver.</p>, <p>The S4 isn't the only four-door, small S model anymore, however. For the first time in the U.S., Audi offers the S5 Sportback four-door model stateside.</p>, <p><strong>Audi S4 history</strong></p>, <p>Though Audi offered an earlier model named S4 that was based on the former Audi 100 sedan, the modern-day S4 is something different. It arrived shortly after the entire Audi lineup changed its nomenclature, and after the brand's compact sedan became the A4. The name change in 1996 turned the 80/90 sedans into the A4; the S4 came to U.S. showrooms in 1999 as a 2000 model. The first edition lasted through the 2002 model year and was equipped with a twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 engine rated at 250 hp. With a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive, this S4 was capable of 0-60 mph times of less than six seconds and a top speed that was limited to 155 mph. This generation of the sedan was much smaller than today's car—about the size of a contemporary Toyota Corolla—but with a much more lavish interior, offered in either sedan or Avant wagon models.</p>, <p>While a redesigned A4 arrived for 2002, the S4 carried over the previous body style until 2004. The replacement made use of a 340-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8. Quattro all-wheel drive was standard again, and there was a choice of either a 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission. The added power and suspension revisions helped improve the S4's performance. This generation was offered here first as a sedan and wagon, with a Cabriolet (convertible) model added late in its life cycle.</p>, <p>The Audi A4 was completely redesigned for 2009, and the Cabriolet was shifted over to a new A5/S5 designation along with a coupe model. The S4 would not return until the 2010 model year, this time fitted with a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 333 hp and 325 pound-feet of torque. The standard gearbox was a dual-clutch automatic, and along with all-wheel drive, the S4 was offered with Drive Select, a new system which allowed drivers to change settings for transmission shift speed, steering feel, and throttle quickness—all through Normal, Comfort, and Sport modes. Only the sedan body style is offered in its current form, although Audi has added a row-your-own 6-speed manual transmission to the S4 since.</p>, <p>In this generation, the S4 has added a rearview camera and blind-spot monitors, as well as Audi's latest infotainment and telematics services, including Audi Connect, which turns the car into a mobile hotspot. Also available: an optional navigation system that incorporates Google Earth and Google Street View data, displayed on a gorgeous LCD screen.</p>]

[<p>The Audi S3, and the related Audi RS3, are performance versions of Audi's compact sedan.</p>, <p>As such, it's a competitor for cars such as the BMW M2, the Mercedes-AMG CLA45, the Volkswagen Golf R, and even the Subaru WRX and WRX STI.</p>, <p>The S3 is available here only as a sedan, although in other markets Audi offers the S3 Cabriolet and S3 Sportback (hatchback).</p>, <p>The higher performance RS 3 arrived for 2018 with predictable results—<a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1111788_2018-audi-rs-3-first-drive-review-less-money-but-no-less-fun">it's massively entertaining to drive.</a></p>, <p>Changes for the 2018 Audi S3 are minor. Heated seats become standard, and the S3 now has two USB ports instead of one. A new S Sport package combines red brake calipers and Audi magnetic ride dampers.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_s3_2018">2018 Audi S3 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The A3 and S3 are the smallest cars Audi offers in the U.S. Both ride on platforms shared with the Volkswagen Golf. Despite their relative smallness, the A3 and S3 are about the same size as a 1994 Audi A4, which shows how much cars have ballooned in size in 20-plus years.</p>, <p>The A3/S3 family of cars includes the aforementioned sedan, convertible, and hatchback, as well as an Avant wagon unlikely to be sold in America. Also related—but a little more distantly—is the compact <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_q3">Audi Q3</a> crossover, which shares some drivetrain and suspension pieces. For now, the S3 is offered here only as a sedan.</p>, <p>While other versions of the A3 offer efficient turbo-4s and plug-in powertrains, the S3 takes to the road only with a 292-horsepower turbo-4. The S3 is good for a 0-60 mph time of 4.7 seconds, and a top speed of 155 mph, according to Audi.</p>, <p>Standard equipment includes a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission in the S3, the RS3 uses a 7-speed unit. The S3 has quattro all-wheel drive, and it rides on a relatively simple front strut/rear multi-link suspension, with a lower ride height than the A3.</p>, <p>The S3's electric power steering can be tuned to different amounts of effort using Audi's Drive Select controls. Drive Select also manages the optional magnetic shocks if equipped, as well as throttle, transmission, and sound settings. All S3s come wearing a set of sticky summer tires on 18- or 19-inch wheels, though all-season tires are available for a no-cost swap.</p>, <p>Given its compact dimensions, the S3 lends good room to front passengers, and slights those in the rear. At 175.9 inches long, the S3 is about seven inches shorter than a CLA, and its 103.4-inch wheelbase is nearly three inches shorter, though its more upright style nets better interior room than the Benz. The trunk space measures in at a rather small 10 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Safety features include forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, and options for blind-spot monitors and adaptive cruise control. Crash-test results have been exemplary.</p>, <p>Every S3 comes with standard power windows, locks, and mirrors; cruise control; leather upholstery; Bluetooth; dual-zone automatic climate control; and a panoramic sunroof. Audi's MMI system with touchpad input is also standard on the top model, with a big retractable screen displaying output from the dash. Audi Connect is offered; it delivers LTE-speed data from AT&amp;T and renders Google Earth maps and other rich feeds to the car, and also enables wireless service to as many as eight devices.</p>, <p>Just a few changes came to the S3 for 2016. The most noteworthy was the addition of an available <span>Black Optic Performance package, which bundled Audi Sport multi-spoke titanium-matte wheels, Black Optic exterior trim, and magnetic ride suspension.</span></p>, <p><span>For 2017, Audi revised the S3's front and rear fascias and made its virtual cockpit a new option.

[<p>The Audi S7 is a five-door, mid-size hatchback that was spun off from the A6 family of cars. The S7 is very close to the high-performance Audi S6 sedan, though the S7 also has an even hotter version in the form of the scorching RS 7.</p>, <p>The S7 calls into question every prejudice against practical hatchbacks, but it's more than just a thought leader. It's serious competition against the Mercedes-AMG CLS63 and the BMW M6 Gran Coupe, as well as the Alpina B6 Gran Coupe.</p>, <p>For 2018, the S7 and RS 7 line see few changes other than some revised wheel styles. A new S7 is in the pipeline and may debut as soon as the 2019 model year, since the new 2019 A7 already has been confirmed for U.S. sale.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <strong><a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_s7_2018">2018 Audi S7 review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi S7<br/></strong></p>, <p>You can call the S7 a hatchback or a coupe-like sedan. It's one of the best vehicles of its kind, no matter if you're judging it on looks, dynamics, or content. Under the S7's hood there's a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 with 450 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque, sent to all four wheels via Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. It can throw down 0-60 mph runs in 4.3 seconds, on its way to a top speed limited at 155 mph, while delivering highway fuel economy in the high 20s, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>The even hotter RS 7 has a 560-hp version of the same engine standard and is also offered with 605 hp in the RS 7 Performance model. The S7's dual-clutch can't handle the insane torque of the RS 7's V-8, so a much smoother 8-speed automatic stands in its place. The automatic transmission has launch control and actually makes the RS 7 more comfortable than the S7, especially when just cruising. The rear-biased, all-wheel-drive system has a torque-vectoring rear differential that gets the big hatch to really turn. With all of this power, the RS 7 Performance doesn't just beat up on sports sedans. It's also a match for some real sports cars, with a 3.6-second 0-to-60 mph time and a top speed of 190 mph.</p>, <p>Even with all that performance, the poise of the S7 and RS 7 is unmistakable: steering can be firm and direct, and ride quality controlled, even with Drive Select in its more relaxed settings.</p>, <p>That performance and poise comes under the auspices of a practical luxury car. The sloping roof and the enormous hatchback opening make the S7 more practical and versatile than it has a right to be. Rear-seat passengers may note that headroom is somewhat tight in back, but those rear seatbacks fold forward to expand cargo space. There's extensive use of aluminum in the S7's body to reduce weight, and the frameless doors look elegant and do their part to minimize wind noise.</p>, <p>Inside, the S7 and RS 7 receive some of the best elements of the cabin from Audi's A8 flagship—including superb materials, trims, and Audi's Multi-Media Interface (MMI) Plus screen-based system, which includes a combination rotary controller and an interface for audio navigation, and calling functions. In addition to the controller, there's MMI Touch, which lets you enter destinations, phonebook entries, and such by tracing out individual letters, one at a time. The navigation system also includes 3-D Google Earth imagery. Combined with SiriusXM Traffic updates, Audi's navigation system is one of the best on the market.</p>, <p>For 2016, Audi tuned its 4.0-liter V-8 for even more punch in the S7; the potent engine now produces 450 hp, up 30 from prior years. A new model for the 2013 model year, the 2016 S7 also received its first facelift. Changes included subtle updates to the lighting elements in front and rear, as well as a revised interior layout with improved materials and the latest Audi infotainment offerings.</p>, <p>The changes for 2017 are highlighted by more standard equipment and a new trim level for the S7 called Performance Plus. Newly standard are an Audi smartphone interface, a Bose surround sound audio system, and five-spoke 19-inch wheels. Also offered are new 20- and 21-inch wheels, and red calipers with the available S7 Sport package.</p>]

The A6's look is evolutionary—few will mistake the luxury sedan for anything else—and punctuated by lighting elements at the nose and tail that are unique to the sedan.</p>, <p>When it goes on sale in the U.S., it'll offer a 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 340 horsepower mated to a mild-hybrid system and all-wheel drive. A 2.0-liter turbo-4 may show up as well, although it's unlikely that the A6 in the States will receive any diesel powertrain.</p>, <p>The A6 features several tech "firsts" including a garage parking assistant and semi-self driving programs that can negotiate traffic jams.</p>, <p><strong>Audi A6 history</strong></p>, <p>The first American-market A6 arrived in showrooms as a 1995 model. In that generation, the A6 name merely moved to the existing Audi 100 chassis with a light facelift. But 1998 brought a more distinct new A6 in both sedan and Avant wagon forms. Offered with a choice of 4- or 6-cylinder engines, the A6 also had front-wheel drive, available quattro all-wheel drive, and a choice of manual and automatic transmissions—along with new features like stability control, side airbags and a navigation system.</p>, <p>Audi chose a more dramatic aesthetic for the third-generation A6, which went on sale in the U.S. for the 2005 model year. The brand's signature "tornado" line carried across the sills, helping give the car a wedge-like profile. The chrome-edged grille made the car instantly recognizable. The cabin relied heavily on plastic-feeling materials, while the layout was cluttered with new tech options and a navigation screen. The new Multi Media Interface (MMI) let occupants control climate, audio, and GPS functions through a roller wheel.</p>, <p>On the performance front, the usual pairing of 4-cylinder turbo engines and V-6 powerplants came with options for Tiptronic automatic transmissions (the standard gearbox on some models was a continuously variable transmission); quattro all-wheel drive; and later, a V-8 edition came solely with quattro and the automatic. An Avant wagon returned to the range in 2006, and an S6 sport sedan with a Lamborghini-derived V-10 engine invigorated the range in 2007. Then, in 2009, the A6 swapped its staid V-6 engine for a supercharged V-6, picking up a mild cosmetic refresh at the same time to complete its mid-cycle update.</p>, <p>In the final years of the third generation, the Audi A6 was sold in both sedan and wagon body styles, with an amazingly quick and tenacious performer in the form of the S6. Prices that were somewhat lower than the usual German competition pitted this A6 against the likes of the Volvo S80, Lincoln MKS, and Acura RL—although those models didn't supply the same kind of image or driving character. The A6's light driving feel and the still-fresh exterior shape complemented its supercharging, direct injection, curtain airbags, and new versions of the MMI controller, helping the A6 maintain its "otherness" when compared with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5-Series.</p>, <p>A new Audi A6 went on sale for the 2012 model year. Offered only as a sedan in the U.S., the A6 initially split its drivetrains into two clear offerings. A base turbocharged 4-cylinder is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive, while the supercharged V-6 version received quattro all-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic transmission with available paddle shifters. There's no contest as to which we prefer: the 4-cylinder CVTs in Audi's past have been fuel-economy specials, while this A6 with the 6-cylinder is a spectacular straight-line performer, with taut ride control and light steering, although admittedly little feedback. The CVT since has been dropped from the A6 lineup.</p>, <p>Beginning in 2013, Audi made available its A6 TDI in the U.S., which paired a 240-horsepower turbodiesel V-6 and an 8-speed automatic transmission. In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>The Audi A6 offered in 2012 a wide array of top tech features, from in-car wireless internet service to navigation with Google Earth mapping. The same cutting-edge features could be found in the A7, which uses the same underpinnings as the A6, but places a slinky hatchback body on top. The A6 received top "Good" scores from the IIHS, as well as a perfect five-star rating from federal officials.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1065645_2012-audi-s6-and-s6-avant-2011-frankfurt-auto-show">high-performance S6 sedan</a> rejoined the U.S. lineup in the 2013 model year, offering a new twin-turbo 4.0-liter TFSI V-8 engine making 420 hp and capable of accelerating the car to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. The S6 received additional performance improvements like a torque-vectoring sport differential, sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, and a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. For 2016, Audi bumped the performance of the S6 up to 450 hp.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_q3
[<p>The Audi Q3 is one member of the automaker's three-part crossover-SUV family. The Q3 is the smallest in the range, which also includes the Q5 and the Q7. More are likely to come, including the Q8.</p>, <p>Rivals for the Q3 include the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class, the Infiniti QX30, the BMW X1, and the Buick Encore.</p>, <p>The five-passenger Q3 offers a single turbocharged engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission, and the choice of front- or all-wheel drive. It's based on the same running gear as the Audi A3.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: See our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_q3_2018">2018 Audi Q3 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Q3 shared more visual similarities with the older Q5 that was replaced in 2017—by our eyes the Q3 is somewhat of a loner. The hatchback has slightly more rake to it, however, giving the Q3 an even tidier appearance on the road. LED headlights and an interior like the one in the A3 makes the Q3 handsome in a way some of its competitors aren't. The wraparound tailgate caps a stubby tall-wagon shape that's much smaller than the Q5's, though it's more city-sized than family-sized—unless the family is a small one.</p>, <p>Unlike other markets, the Q3 is offered here in the States in just one powertrain configuration. The 2.0 TFSI is a direct-injected, 2.0-liter turbo-4 that makes 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque. The engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission only. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available as an option.</p>, <p>Audi’s Drive Select system is an option. It allows the driver to adjust the handling and throttle response through three preset and one configurable mode. The Q3 rides on standard 18-inch wheels and tires, though 19-inchers are offered.</p>, <p>The Q3 is a five-passenger vehicle, but its small size means a tight fit for three in the rear seat. Q3s equipped with the optional Sport package boast seats with additional bolstering and thigh-cushion extensions. With the rear seats in place, there is 16.7 cubic feet of cargo space. Fold the seats down, and it expands to 48.2 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Among its safety features, the Q3 offers front thorax side and head curtain airbags. Front and rear parking systems became standard for model year 2016. Blind-spot monitors are available, but forward collision warnings aren't.</p>, <p>Standard features include electronic stability control with off-road and hill descent settings, 18-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, xenon headlights, LED interior lighting, and 12-way power-adjustable front seats with heating.</p>, <p>There’s a long list of options, too. Some highlights are Audi’s MMI navigation plus system with a 7.0-inch display, Audi connect wi-fi, a power hatch, and a Bose sound system with 14 speakers. Audi Connect adds in-car data services (powered by AT&amp;T and eligible as a Mobile Share device if you have an existing plan), Google Earth mapping, and Google Local Search by voice.</p>, <p>The Q3 was updated lightly for the 2016 model year. Audi applied new front and rear styling as well as upgraded interior materials and infotainment systems.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Q3 added a new entry-level model, the Q3 Premium, but the Q3 remained functionally unchanged.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 center around equipment. The base Premium model gets the S line front bumper and side sills, as well as heated seats, and it is offered with a new Convenience package. The Premium Plus now has blind spot monitors, and its Sport plus package gets revised equipment.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_a7
[<p>The Audi A7 is a luxury four-seat hatchback that's one of the most handsome vehicles on the road. The fastback shape has a beautiful sloped profile, and it's useful, too: the hatch opens up a huge and very useful cargo space.</p>, <p>While the A7 shares drivetrain components and equipment with the A6 sedan, the A7 comes in a pair of high-performance versions, the S7 and RS 7, while the A6 gets only the S6. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_s7">performance models are covered separately</a>.</p>, <p>The A7 competes with other style-conscious offerings like the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class and the BMW 6-Series Gran Coupe.</p>, <p>A second-generation 2019 Audi A7 features updated tech inside and under the hood, while it retains its beautiful shape.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_a7_2019">2019 Audi A7 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>No matter whether you call Audi's A7 a fastback, a four-door coupe, or a hatchback, we've found it to be one of the best entries of its kind—and that's whether you go by refinement, performance, or features in addition to style. The sloping rear makes the A7 one of the best-looking vehicles you can buy today, and it also makes it one of a small set of vehicles crafted specifically to appeal to design enthusiasts. On top of that, it's more practical than a conventional four-door sedan.</p>, <p><strong>The new Audi A7</strong></p>, <p>The 2019 Audi A7 arrives in showrooms this fall with reworked styling and a heaping dose of new technology.</p>, <p>It's the second generation for the fastback (a hatchback, technically speaking), and it precedes the arrival of a new A6 sedan that shares its mechanicals by a few months.</p>, <p>Audi design chief Marc Lichte and his team penned the new shape, but derive most of it from the 2012 model. The proportions are similar, with a long hood, an elegantly draped roofline, and a long hatch marked by more sharply stamped lines, more trailing cues, and a six-sided grille.</p>, <p>The chiseled new looks extend to the cabin, where digital displays dominate and hard buttons have taken a back seat. The new A7 sheds Audi's old infotainment roller-knob system for one that relies on voice commands and wide touchscreens–a 10.1-inch panel that displays maps and other functions, and a secondary 8.6-inch screen that displays climate functions, drive modes, and accepts handwritten inputs.</p>, <p>Optionally, a 12.3-inch reconfigurable display swaps in where gauges would otherwise fit. That driver-focused screen delivers a host of information, from navigation maps to infotainment functions.</p>, <p>While the rear hatch and its sloped backlight make the A7 prettier than a conventional sedan, they also add versatility and practicality. The rear seats can fold to afford more cargo space, and the large opening and extra space make loading bulky items easy. The cargo area boasts 18.9 cubic feet of space that open up to a compact-SUV-like 49.1 cubic feet with the rear seats down. Rear head room suffers only a bit as a result of the roofline, though most will agree that this small (and likely infrequent) inconvenience is worth the usability dividends compared to a standard sedan.</p>, <p>For power, Audi will rely initially on a single engine, but a range of engines are likely for the new A7. At launch, all U.S.-market cars feature a single-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 with 340 horsepower. Equipped with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, it should spawn a plug-in hybrid model at some point. Future S7 models will likely sport a 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6, while a V-8-powered RS 7 may make a return.</p>, <p>The latest A7 is built on the Volkswagen Group's MLB II-Evo platform, which it shares with other new models including the Q7 and Q5 SUVs. By using a mix of steel and aluminum, engineers have increased body rigidity and lowered weight. The new car is a half-inch longer in wheelbase, overall length increases 0.8 inch, and height doesn't change.</p>, <p>An independent suspension and all-wheel drive are complemented by new technology such as rear-wheel steering, which can dial in up to 5 degrees of countersteer to the rear wheels at parking-lot speeds to help the A7 corner more effectively. The countersteer is dialed down and out as the A7 reaches higher speeds. In fact, the rear wheels move with the fronts at highway speeds for added stability.</p>, <p><strong>Audi A7 history</strong></p>, <p>The A7 was new to the U.S. market for the 2012 model year. More a sport sedan than a sports car—and even then, not a sharply honed one unless buyers chose the high-performance S7 or batty RS 7. Regardless, we found the A7 to be both fun to drive and well-mannered enough for the daily commute or long-distance road trips.</p>, <p>The supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine (3.0 TFSI) started at 310 but rose up to 340 horsepower. It fit the quiet character of a luxury car yet churned out the torque just off idle and developed a raspy bark when called on. It was matched with Audi's 8-speed automatic transmission, which proved a willing companion and came with Tiptronic manual controls. Quattro all-wheel drive delivered power to all four wheels, and Audi Drive Select allowed the driver to pick among four different modes that control the way the transmission responded, the feel of the steering, and throttle responsiveness, among other variables.</p>, <p>The A7 boasted great isolation from road and wind noise inside, and as in Audi's TT sports car, an integrated spoiler extended (at 80 mph in the A7) to improve aerodynamics—then it retracted back at 50 mph. Hydraulic bushings helped mute out harshness, as did frameless doors, and the A7 stayed stiff yet light through the extensive use of aluminum in its structure.</p>, <p>Inside, the A7 received some of the best elements from the cabin of Audi's A8 flagship, including superb trim materials and Audi's Multi Media Interface (MMI) Plus screen-based infotainment system. This version of MMI featured a combination rotary controller and an interface for audio and navigation as well as calling functions. In addition to the controller, Audi offered MMI Touch, which let drivers enter destinations, phonebook entries, and such by tracing out individual letters on a trackpad. The navigation system in the A7 offered 3D Google Earth imagery; combined with SiriusXM Traffic updates, it was one of the best systems on the market.</p>, <p>Audi made only a few minor feature and option changes for 2013. That's also the year <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080244_2013-audi-s7-first-drive">the Audi S7 was added to the lineup</a>. For the 2014 model year the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081101_audi-bringing-rs5-cabriolet-and-rs7-to-the-u-s-but-no-rs6-report">even hotter Audi RS 7</a> was introduced in the U.S., with higher specific output and a track-ready suspension. It got 560 hp in standard form and the RS 7 boasted an incredible 605 hp for buyers who tacked on the performance package.</p>, <p>Another engine option joined the lineup for 2014, this one at the other end of the fuel-economy spectrum from the RS 7. Audi began offering its 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 in the A7, paired with an 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. The engine put out 240 hp and a delightful 428 pound-feet of torque, sending the car to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. It was also able to return 24 mpg city, 38 highway, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners.</p>, <p>Few changes were made for the 2015 model year. The 2016 model year brought a facelift all around, yet the changes were relatively subtle: new headlights and taillights, revisions to the grille and fascias, and an updated interior design, plus the latest from Audi's infotainment cabinet, incorporating a faster processor. Additionally, the adaptive cruise control added the ability to come to complete stop and resume following. There was also an improved night vision system, and the lineup gained further improvements to the Audi Pre Sense forward collision warning system. Audi boosted the specific output of the base A7 3.0 TFSI to 333 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque for 2016 as well.</p>, <p>The 2017 model gained further refinements to both bumpers, an expanded color palette, and new wheel patterns. Interior changes for 2017 included new LED ambient lighting packages, aluminum and wood dash accents, improved Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, a wireless charging pad, and an available rear-seat entertainment package utilizing a pair of tablet PCs.</p>, <p>For 2018, the A7 added 7 horsepower for a total of 340 hp, while a new Competition package included a firmer suspension, special styling touches, 20-inch alloy wheels, and a unique rear differential. </p>]

[<p>The Audi S5 is the high-performance version of <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_a5">Audi's A5 coupe, four-door coupe, and</a> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_a5">convertible</a>. One of the best-looking vehicles in the automaker's lineup, the S5 has been joined by an even more sporty RS 5 variant.</p>, <p>The potent S5 is part of a family of vehicles that also includes the A4 and S4 sedans, as well as the Allroad wagon. The S5 and RS 5 models adopt a stiffer suspension, more power, and subtly enhanced design for differentiation from the standard A5.</p>, <p>Exterior design differences are hard to come by in the 2018 Audi S5. Under its skin, the S5 rides with an updated platform that shaves weight and increases power—sadly at the expense of a 6-speed manual that we liked in prior versions.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_s5_2018">2018 Audi S5 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi S5</strong></p>, <p>The 2018 Audi S5 went on sale in early 2017 after a complete redesign. A coupe and convertible were joined by an S5 Sportback model—a four-door sedan with a racier roofline. Regardless of body style, the S5 is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged V-6 that makes 354 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. Unlike previous versions, the 2018 S5 is available as an automatic only, no manual this time. An 8-speed automatic borrowed from the RS7 drives all four wheels, via Audi's all-wheel-drive system that it calls quattro.</p>, <p>The new S5's looks borrow heavily from the outgoing car, but sport a sharper approach this time around. A crisper line around the windows casts a longer shadow on the body, a power dome on the hood announces its prowess underhood, and the interior is awash in high-quality—albeit very conservative—materials. The hood's shunt line is cleverly hidden in the body line, and could be our favorite part of the new look.</p>, <p>Inside, Audi adopts a higher level of tech, particularly with its "Virtual Cockpit" setup that uses a 12.3-inch screen for instruments and driver information.</p>, <p>Audi offered for the first time an optional rear sport differential and adaptive dampers on the S5 as part of an optional sport package.</p>, <p><strong>Audi S5 history</strong></p>, <p>New in 2008, the S5 went on sale with its platform-mate, the Audi A5. While the lesser coupes arrived with turbocharged inline-4s and normally aspirated V-6 engines, the original S5 was equipped with a rich-sounding 4.2-liter V-8 making a healthy 354 horsepower. Sporty tuning, grippy tires, and visual tweaks completed the identity swap, and the S5 became an instant rival for the BMW M3, with a 0-60 mph time of 4.9 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph.</p>, <p>In 2010, Audi updated the S5 lineup by adding an S5 Cabriolet (convertible) model, which was outfitted with a power-folding fabric top. The S5 Cabriolet drew its power from a new 3.0-liter, 333-hp supercharged V-6, connected to a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. At that time coupe versions of the S5 stuck with the V-8 engine. By 2010, both body styles of the S5 had gained the option of a driver-adjustable suspension, steering, throttle, and transmission—Audi calls it Drive Select—and its all-wheel-drive system was updated to split its torque with a bias to the rear wheels. </p>, <p>An updated S5 arrived for the 2013 model year. The coupe finally switched from V-8 power to the supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that was already in convertible models. Coupes retained the choice of either a true three-pedal manual transmission or the dual-clutch automatic, while convertibles still only came with the dual-clutch.</p>, <p>The same year, Audi introduced the RS 5 in coupe form, with the cabriolet following a year later. Essentially a spin-off of the early S5 and its V-8, the RS 5 had a 450-hp, 4.2-liter V-8, set up with a Quattro all-wheel-drive system with a rear torque bias, all geared via a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. (Read our <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078319_2013-audi-rs5-first-drive">first drive of the RS 5 for more</a>.) The RS 5's performance is bright: it hits 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and is also capable of a 174-mph top speed. Drive Select is standard, but on the RS 5 the suspension is not adaptive.</p>, <p>Along with the other updates for 2013, Audi upgraded the infotainment systems in the S5 and RS 5. Audi Connect was added to the Multi-Media Interface (MMI), offering 3G connectivity and wi-fi hotspot functionality, as well as navigation maps showing Google Earth satellite imagery and Google Street View photography. MMI also was upgraded to a touch controller that accepts handwriting input and doubles as a preset selector for radio stations.</p>, <p>There were only a few minor changes for the 2016 S5, the main addition was a newly available Black Optics pack, which includes black exterior trim and unique wheels.</p>]

[<p>The Audi S6 is the performance version of the A6, the German automaker's mid-size sedan. On sale in the U.S. since the mid-1990s, the S6 at times has been joined by a hotter RS 6 edition, in the U.S. and in other markets.</p>, <p>Audi's S6 joined the A6 family shortly after the Audi 100/200 was renamed as the A6. Usually sold as a four-door sedan, it has also been offered in Avant wagon form.</p>, <p>With the S6, Audi has a rival for cars such as the Jaguar XFR, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, and BMW M5.</p>, <p>Audi kept the S6 identical for 2018, after a mild refresh in 2016. A new range of A6 and S6 sedans are due in the 2019-2020 model years.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1110890_2018-audi-s6">2018 Audi S6 review</a></strong><br/></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi S6</strong></p>, <p>Today's fourth-generation Audi A6 went on sale in the 2012 model year, but the S6 wouldn't return until 2013. While basic sedans came with a choice of inline-4 and V-6 engines, the S6 sports a new twin-turbo 4.0 TFSI V-8 engine. It's rated at 420 hp and is capable of 0-60 mph runs of around 4.8 seconds. The S6 gets additional performance improvements like a sport differential, sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission—plus appearance changes like a four-outlet exhaust, special wheels, and two additional, exclusive "S" colors: Estoril Blue and Prism Silver. Like the A6, the S6 also offers beautifully rendered navigation mapping via Google Earth mapping, and in-car wireless Internet, under the Audi Connect banner.</p>, <p>Well-heeled buyers can opt for pricey packages on the S6, including front seat massage functions, sport differentials, a top-notch Bang &amp; Olufsen sound package, and a black Alcantara headliner.</p>, <p>Both the A6 and S6 received mild styling updates for the 2016 model year. The most obvious exterior touches include restyled lighting units, while inside, the interior gets improved materials and a tweaked layout. The S6 received a 30 horsepower boost up to 450 hp.</p>, <p>The S6 didn't change for 2017 and 2018 model years.</p>, <p><strong>Audi S6 history</strong></p>, <p>That first S6 sold in the U.S. went on sale in 1995, and slipped off the radar after just one model year. It was powered by a turbocharged inline-5 engine rated at about 227 horsepower, and teamed with a manual transmission and quattro all-wheel drive. It passed out of the lineup quickly as Audi swapped out the old A6 for a new model with a more distinctive shape, though it didn't get around to offering a new S6 until the 2002 and 2003 model years. This version would be powered by a 4.2-liter V-8 with about 340 hp, with a new 5-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive—along with new features such as stability control, side airbags and a navigation system.</p>, <p>In its third generation, the S6 was based on a new body style, the A6 that was introduced for 2005. It was a striking shape, with the now-trademark "tornado" line along the lower sill, and it also had a more freely styled interior compared to the previous generation. When the third-gen S6 arrived in 2007, it was powered by a Lamborghini-derived V-10 engine; the 5.2-liter made 425 hp and sent its power through a 6-speed automatic and quattro all-wheel drive. The engine made a fabulous noise, but performance was disappointing considering the pedigree. This generation also saw the new Audi Multi-Media Interface infotainment controller for the first time, handling navigation, media, and other settings.</p>]

[<p>The Audi A4 Allroad is a compact luxury wagon with a rugged exterior and crossover-like abilities. It's a wagon replacement that Audi sells in the U.S. instead of a more conventional, lower-riding Avant wagon.</p>, <p>Audi's Allroad competes in a surprisingly growing field alongside the Subaru Outback, Volvo V60 Cross Country, and new Buick Regal TourX. The Volvo V90 Cross Country is nearly there too.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_allroad_2017">2017 Audi Allroad review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Today's Allroad is based on the new-for-2017 Audi A4. This blend of wagon and crossover sensibilities separates the Allroad from the Q3, Q5, and Q7 that make up Audi’s crossover-utility range.</p>, <p><strong>The new Audi Allroad</strong></p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, Audi's again based a new Allroad off the A4 architecture. Essentially a raised A4 wagon with front- or all-wheel drive, the new Allroad has some distinguishing details, like a vertically ribbed grille, flared plastic cladding, and 18-inch alloy wheels. The new Allroad shares the A4 interior, with a wide horizontal band of vents and trim and a pair of screens dominating the cockpit. A 12.3-inch screen takes the place of the gauge cluster, while a 7.0-inch screen (optionally, an 8.3-inch screen) runs the infotainment system.</p>, <p>A turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 252 horsepower pairs with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and pushes the Allroad to 60 mph in just 5.9 seconds. Fuel economy is as high as 25 mpg combined. As it does on the A4, Audi offers a Drive Select system that can tailor steering, transmission, throttle, suspension, and all-wheel-drive settings through driver-adjustable modes. A new all-wheel-drive system can decouple its rear wheels to improve fuel economy.</p>, <p>The Allroad is slightly larger than before, but the chief attraction is cargo space: up to 58.5 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down, and 24.2 cubic feet with the rear seats raised. No crash-test data is yet available, but the Allroad offers adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, and a rearview camera. Other features included are standard power features, Bluetooth, keyless ignition, a panoramic sunroof, power front seats, and Audi's MMI infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p><strong>Audi Allroad history</strong></p>, <p>The first Audi Allroad, sold from 2001 to 2006, followed a similar formula, but was a different car in a number of ways. It was essentially an A6 Avant wagon fitted with Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system, along with an adjustable-ride-height suspension, tougher-looking body trim and cladding, and some distinct luxury features. Pricing started around $42,000—a substantial sticker price for a decade ago—for a 250-hp, 2.7-liter turbocharged V-6 in its first four model years, paired with automatic or (unusually) manual transmissions.</p>, <p>For the last two years, the Allroad switched to a 4.2-liter V-8 producing 300 hp. The suspension could be raised to provide more than 8 inches of ground clearance, and the all-wheel-drive system provided solid roadholding and cornering capabilities over a wide range of surfaces and weather conditions. Luxury features included Bose audio and navigation; safety features included parking sensors, stability control, and rear side airbags.</p>, <p>Audi introduced a new Allroad for the 2013 model year. it was based on the then-new A4, but had a different grille and faux skid plates to toughen its look. At 2.3 inches taller and 0.6 inch wider than the first-generation Allroad, the second-generation wagon had a longer wheelbase, and provided more leg room and head room. Cargo space rivaled that of the best compact luxury crossovers at 27.6 cubic feet, and the five-passenger Allroad's rear seats folded and flipped for expandable storage space.</p>, <p>The sole engine offering was a 211-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Optional dynamic steering and Drive Select systems tailored the Allroad's electric power steering, transmission, throttle, and shock settings for sporty or comfortable driving at the driver's request. In 2015, output was raised to 220 hp.</p>, <p>Allroad standard equipment included leather upholstery; a choice of wood or aluminum trim; 19-inch wheels and tires; satellite radio; Audi's Multi Media Interface (MMI) complete with iPod/USB connectivity; a power tailgate; adaptive headlights; a panoramic sunroof; Bluetooth; Bang &amp; Olufsen audio; and a navigation system.</p>, <p>The second-generation Allroad was one of several Audi vehicles to adopt the brand's Connect suite of telematics. With a monthly subscription, Audi Connect tapped into a built-in 3G connection that turned the Allroad into a rolling wireless hotspot for up to eight devices and enabled Google local searches via MMI.</p>]

[<p>The Audi A8 is the brand's most exclusive full-size luxury sedan. Pitched against the likes of the BMW 7-Series and Mercedes S-Class, the A8 offers supercharged and turbocharged engines, and a heady dose of technology.</p>, <p>The A8 carried through into the 2018 model year with only minor changes, including an available Executive Package trim on V-6 versions of the car.</p>, <p>A new model arrives in the spring of 2018 as a 2019 model.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_a8_2019">2019 Audi A8 preview</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new 2019 Audi A8</strong></p>, <p>The 2019 A8 will feature some of the latest tech, but lacks self-driving hardware found in other countries due to U.S. regulations.</p>, <p>The new A8 arrives in spring 2018 behind a look that's not much of a departure from the current car. A wider front end, larger air intakes and slimmer LED headlights match up with taillights that span the width of the car, none of which disrupts its executive-sedan mission. Inside, the A8 has wiped nearly all the switches and toggles from the cockpit, and has replaced them with touch-sensitive screens that surround the driver. Gone, and good riddance, touch-sensitive control puck.</p>, <p>Audi has recast the A8's body and made it stronger by blending more materials in with its aluminum frame. The sedan now has some steel panels, some magnesium pieces, even carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic that all reduce weight.</p>, <p>Audi replaces that weight with motors and batteries. The new A8 is its first model line that's electrified—not pure electric, but at least mild-hybrid capable. In the U.S., a new 3.0-liter turbo-6 with a belt-driver motor-generator and a 48-volt electrical system turns in a new of about 340 horsepower. Over its lifespan, the A8 in the U.S. will gain twin-turbo V-8 mild-hybrid models, and a plug-in hybrid edition with more batteries and stouter motors, for a 30-mile plug-in driving range and 449 hp net. That A8 L e-tron also will offer a wireless charging system.<strong><br/></strong></p>, <p>The A8 will be fitted with a new active suspension that uses camera data to predict and react to coming road surfaces. Its all-wheel-drive system will be available with a rear differential. A new rear-wheel-steering system will dial in as much as 5 degrees of opposite steer at speeds under 37 mph, for superior parking-lot maneuvers.</p>, <p>Finally, on the technology front, Audi's new array of laser and radar sensors and cameras give the A8 Level 3 self-driving ability in some countries, which means the car will take control of steering and braking and acceleration indefinitely, until it senses higher road speeds, obstacles it can't correct for, or other more complex driving situations. Audi hopes it will be able to sell the system in the U.S., but that will not come until states and the federal government agree on how self-driving cars can be made legal to operate in a systemic way.</p>, <p>The system will engage via a console-mounted button. Other functions, from navigation to climate control, will be operated on the A8's central touchscreens, which have pressure-sensitive haptic feedback. High-end leather, wood, and premium audio will seem quaint by comparison to the A8's new driving technology, but they'll be available.</p>, <p><strong>The third-generation Audi A8</strong></p>, <p>Until the 2019 model makes its debut, Audi will sell the current A8.</p>, <p>In its third generation, the Audi A8 delivered strong performance and good looks, though it isn't quite as dramatic as cars like the Jaguar XJ, the other aluminum-bodied vehicle in the class—or even the current Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</p>, <p>The A8 went on sale in the U.S. in the 2011 model year, with a 4.2-liter V-8 rated at 372 hp, which <span class="keylinks_silent">Audi</span> quoted as having a 0-60 mph time of 5.7 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph. A W-12 engine option was added for the long-wheelbase model in 2012.</p>, <p>For 2013, a pair of new engines replaced the former V-8. The lower portion of the current powertrain lineup included a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 333 hp, and a 0-60-mph time of 5.5 seconds; and a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 420 hp and a 0-60 mph time of 4.7 seconds. Above them is the performance-oriented S8, which uses a 520-hp version of the twin-turbo 4.0-liter and hits 60 mph in 3.9 seconds. The most expensive was the W-12, a 6.3-liter that makes 500 hp and is good for a 0-60 time of 4.4 seconds. A 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 was added for the 2014 model year, available only on the long-wheelbase model, and was rated at 24 mpg city and 36 mpg highway, according to the EPA. In 2016, the 4.0-liter V-8 was uprated to 450 hp.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>Audi Drive Select coordinates steering, powertrain, and suspension with different preset modes and a programmable setting that allows the driver to control each component independently. The A8 feels a bit more nimble than some of the vehicles in its class, but it's still tuned for the tastes of its buyers—not shocking, never abrupt, always collected and calm even when it's accelerating with the quickness of a supercar.</p>, <p>The A8's subtle looks steer attention toward its rich finishes and high-tech features. Its infotainment system uses the latest version of Audi's Multi-Media Interface (MMI), including MMI touch, which allows fingertips to trace out individual letters of destinations, for example. There's built-in wi-fi hotspot capability and Google Earth 3D navigation-system data—the latter brings some of the most detailed, attractive map interfaces in any car. For the fitting final touch, there's a magnificent Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, with tweeters that rise from the dash surface when the system is switched on. The car's central display screen can also hide in the dash when not needed, for a cleaner look and an unobstructed view out the front.</p>, <p>For 2016, Audi nixed short wheelbase versions of the A8—only the S8 could be ordered with a short wheelbase. In addition to the longer wheelbase, Audi initially offered an A8 Sport (with the uprated V-8) that was made universal for 4.0T models in 2017. A sport exterior package that mimics the look of the S8 was made standard for A8 models in 2017 as well.</p>, <p><strong>Audi A8 history</strong></p>, <p>Preceded in sales by an 8-cylinder version of the A6 sedan called the V8, the Audi A8 was born after the automaker split off the special model and created its signature aluminum space-frame construction.</p>, <p>Audi sold the first-generation A8 from the 1998 model year through 2003. It heralded two firsts for the company: its first mass-produced vehicle with an aluminum space frame and its first car to offer six airbags. The A8 came to the U.S. with a V-8 and standard quattro all-wheel drive for most of that time, while other markets also saw 6-cylinder versions as well as a W-12 engine—a 12-cylinder layout that is basically a pair of V-6s joined side by side. Later in the first generation, Audi offered a high-performance S8 in the U.S.</p>, <p>In its second generation, which was sold from 2004 through 2010, the A8 returned with a 4.2-liter V-8 and a six-speed automatic transmission sending power to all four wheels. This A8 was offered in both short- and long-wheelbase models. Audi also brought back the W-12, now displacing 6.0 liters and making 450 horsepower. The second A8 was distinguished by its extra-large grille, which was part of the brand's signature at that time. When the second-generation A8's run ended in 2010, it had reverted to a V-8-only engine menu.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/audi_s8
[<p>The Audi S8 is the quickest, if not the most expensive, version of the German automaker's full-size A8 luxury sedan.</p>, <p>The S8 joined the A8 family in the late 1990s. Today's model is the third generation of the nameplate, though some years have been skipped along the way.</p>, <p>The Audi S8 is essentially carried over for the 2017 model year, although its A8 sibling is no longer offered with a shorter wheelbase. Even less changed for 2018—it's the same car again.</p>, <p>A new version is on the way and it figuratively paved its own road to the U.S. The newest Audi A8 and S8 sedans will arrive sometime after spring 2018.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1110854_2018-audi-s8">2018 Audi S8 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The first Audi S8 was introduced in Europe in 1997, but took until the 2001 model year to arrive in U.S. showrooms. Priced from $72,500, this S8 set the pattern for all future performance derivatives spun off from Audi's unique, aluminum space-frame sedan. The first edition packed a 360-horsepower V-8 engine and standard all-wheel drive; American-market cars were only offered with an automatic transmission. The higher-output model was distinguished by "S" badging, added aluminum trim, and more standard luxury features, as well as 18-inch wheels. The first S8 had a short run in the U.S., since that generation of A8 sedan went out of production in fall 2002.</p>, <p>The A8 was redesigned in that year, but it wouldn't be until 2007 that Audi would bring its second S8 to American drivers. The wait was worth it: instead of a V-8 engine underhood, the S8 bore a mighty, Lamborghini-derived V-10 engine. At 5.2 liters of displacement, the engine generated an awe-inspiring 450 hp at 7,000 rpm in the S8 and 398 pound-feet of torque, only slightly down from Lambo spec, all shuffled to the tires via a Tiptronic 6-speed automatic. Quattro all-wheel drive had variable torque distribution, with a rolling 40/60 split, with the ability to move up to 85 percent of the torque to the rear, or as much as 65 percent to the front.</p>, <p>The S8’s transmission, steering, chassis, adaptive air suspension, and brakes were upgraded compared to the rest of the A8 line, and it rolled on beefy 20-inch alloy wheels wearing 265/35 R20 high-performance (three-season) tires. Audi offered a carbon-fiber-trimmed interior, while its Multi-Media Interface (MMI) system came standard.</p>, <p>After ending that S8 model run in the 2009 model year, Audi once again put the uber-sedan on hold, this time until the 2013 model year. The latest Audi S8 has reverted back to V-8 form, but it hasn't lost any performance—it's more powerful, in fact, thanks to a 4.0-liter V-8 with twin turbocharging and 520 hp, as well as 481 lb-ft of torque. Via standard all-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic, the S8 can drop 0-60 mph times of 3.9 seconds while delivering 19 miles per gallon on the EPA's combined cycle.</p>, <p>This third-generation S8 features Audi's Drive Select control system, which allows the driver to choose one of two preset profiles—Comfort or Dynamic—an Auto mode, or the Individual setup that allows the driver to select different parameters separately. Drive Select controls myriad settings including suspension tuning, steering weight, throttle response, transmission shift points, the torque vectoring Sport Differential, and even the level of exhaust sound.</p>, <p>Audi's S8 returned for the 2014 model year with few changes, and carried over into 2015 largely intact. The car connected to the web through Audi Connect, see beautiful Google Earth maps on the navigation system, and bathe in stunning Bang &amp; Olufsen audio.</p>, <p>For 2016, Audi significantly changed the S8's demeanor and performance. Audi made available a "tweener" between the A8 and newly minted S8 plus. The A8 Sport is largely the S8 from 2014 and 2015, albeit in long-wheelbase form. With 450 hp and 444 lb-ft of twist coming from the turbocharged V-8, the A8 Sport satisfies the itch for full-size sport sedan buyers. The new S8 plus tunes the 4.0-liter V-8 up to 605 hp and 517 lb-ft (553 lb-ft during overboost) and makes the 0-60 run in a hair-raising 3.7 seconds.</p>, <p>The 2017 Audi S8 is largely unchanged from the 2016 version as this model prepares for a full-scale redesign. The new 2019 Audi A8 will go on sale in the U.S. late in 2018; the S8 derivative is expected soon after that.</p>]

[<p>The Audi TT blurs the line between sporty coupes and convertibles and true sports cars. It's a two-door luxury vehicle now in its third generation, after a 2016 reboot.</p>, <p>Audi adds a high-powered, track-ready TT RS for the 2018 model year. It features a 400-horsepower turbo-5 and a magnetic ride suspension, as well as massive front brakes.</p>, <p>Audi has moved the TT further up the performance ladder since its 2000 debut. The first TT was an expression of style at the cost of substance. While its Deco-tinged tribute turned heads, it lacked the handling to do much for interior passengers. The second time around for the TT was somewhat sharper, although its looks were less bleeding-edge.</p>, <p>Now, in its third generation, Audi is pitching the TT as a true sports car, with next-level handling and grip. With the TT, Audi has a rival for vehicles like the Mini Cooper, Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ, even the BMW 2-Series and Mercedes SLC-Class.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/audi_tt_2018">2018 Audi TT review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Audi TT</strong></p>, <p>In the TT's third generation, the car was initially offered in TT and TTS strengths, with both coupes and convertibles available. The latest TT design is certainly more starched than the flowing lines of the last generation, bringing with it a wider, more angular grille and a horizontal theme to the overall concept. There's more use of aluminum throughout, with the automatic rear spoiler and fascias being the only body panels made of something else (plastic).</p>, <p>The cabin is where the TT changes most dramatically. The gauges and center LCD screen have been combined, with Audi placing a single 12.3-inch screen in the nacelle where the dials used to live. The screen can toggle through various functions, including navigation and all infotainment modes while also showing gauge info. This single-screen setup is shared with the R8, while other Audi models get multi-screen versions of the virtual cockpit system.</p>, <p>The third-gen TT doesn't grow in external dimensions very much, but the wheelbase is up almost 1.5 inches. It rides on a version of the VW Group's new "MQB" platform. The TT's suspension remains a strut design in front—with some aluminum pieces to shave weight—and four-link setup in the rear. The TT's electric power steering enables new functions, such as active lane control and parking assist.</p>, <p>TT models have a 220-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4. In the TTS, the same engine puts out 292 hp; both are paired to the VW Group's DSG gearbox, which Audi calls S tronic. Quattro all-wheel drive is standard in the U.S., and the TTS also comes with the magnetic ride dampers. Coupe versions of both models are offered, while the TT only gets the convertible treatment for now.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, some TT trim choices changed and a rearview camera became standard.</p>, <p>The high-performance TT RS joined the lineup for 2018. In addition to the 5-cylinder, it features a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. It is also offered with a Dynamic Plus package that replaces the magnetic ride dampers with fixed dampers, adds front carbon ceramic brakes, and gets a top speed increase from 155 to 174 mph. Other 2018 changes include making front and rear parking sensors standard across the lineup and the addition of two new packages: an S line Competition package for TT and TTS models and an exclusive interior package for the TTS.</p>, <p><strong>Audi TT history</strong></p>, <p>The TT was originally based on Volkswagen/Audi running gear shared by the Audi A4. It struck a fresh styling chord when it first arrived. Audi's prior coupes, from the 1980s Coupe GT to the unloved Audi 90 Coupe, had been more characteristically German. The Audi TT brought a lovingly detailed, Art Deco-influenced look to the sporty realm. The lovely lines—especially effective in flat gray paint—were met with an interior that could be fitted with beautiful swatches of baseball-glove leather and stitching, and aluminum trim. The TT was less convincing as a sports car in that first edition, which was sold through the 2006 model year. Safe, but unexciting handling combined with somewhat lively 222-hp turbocharged 4-cylinder power in the best quattro all-wheel-drive versions; V-6 cars were heavier and felt less responsive despite their 250 hp, while front-drive versions suffered torque steer.</p>, <p>With the 2008 redesign, Audi turned the tables; the TT's exterior style was muted to match more of the cues found on its other cars. This TT fit more with the then-new R8 thanks to its side sculpting, low nose, and LED detailing. The cockpit lost its grabby circular theme, and faced the driver and passenger with a flight-inspired set of knobs, switches, and LCD screens bearing a distinctly masculine appeal. It was a sleeker look for sure, though less distinctive. Either as a TT or a TTS, there remained two body style choices: coupe and roadster.</p>, <p>For 2012 and 2013, Audi brought the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1066631_2012-audi-tt-rs-first-drive">top-performance TT RS to the U.S.</a> for a very limited run. With a 360-hp, 2.5-liter high-boost-turbocharged inline-5, a lowered magnetic suspension system, and upgraded performance trim and hardware, the limited-production TT RS had serious sports-car appeal for enthusiasts who wanted a car for weekend track outings. It was offered here only with a manual transmission, while other markets were also offered a slightly quicker, but less involving, dual-clutch automated model.</p>, <p>Powertrains for the second generation included a 200-hp, 2.0-liter turbo-4, which only came with a fantastic 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. The performance,-oriented <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1025596_audi-announces-u-s-pricing-for-tts-coupe-and-roadster">265-hp turbo TTS</a> also came exclusively with the dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive. All models with the old 250-hp V-6 were given the axe for 2010.</p>, <p>The TT complemented good fuel economy with nimble handling and more of an authentic sports car feel, flat and eager to hook up with the pavement. Interior room wasn't the TT's strongest suit, though the seats were wide and the cabin spacious enough for adults. The roadster models had a nicely executed power fabric top. Trunk and interior storage were somewhat limited, though, so weekend trips were best reserved for two.</p>, <p>The TT was carried over through the 2015 model year to finish out the second generation.</p>]

[<p>The Bentley Continental GT is one of the most luxurious and technically advanced cars in its class—or any class for that matter. Sold as either a coupe or as a convertible, in a range of V-8 and W-12 versions, the two-door GT is comfortable, phenomenally quick in any form, and capable in all weather.</p>, <p>Ten years ago, the Continental GT catapulted the historic British brand into the 21st century. Since then, it's been a celebrity favorite—and a rival to vehicles like the Rolls-Royce Wraith and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe, as well as the Maserati GranTurismo and the Ferrari GTC4 Lusso.</p>, <p>Launched in coupe form for the 2005 model year, the GT has seen increases to its power and refinement to its aesthetics. Now in its second generation, changes to the Continental GT have remained evolutionary concerning both the visuals and mechanicals.</p>, <p>A new 2019 Bentley Continental GT coupe will go on sale in the U.S. in 2018, leaving the 2018 model year for only the convertible.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our</strong> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bentley_continental-gt_2018"><strong>2018 Bentley Continental GT review</strong></a><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bentley_continental-gt_2016"><br/></a></em></p>, <p>The basics of the second-generation coupe and convertible are shared with the Flying Spur sedan. Though the two-doors have a much shorter wheelbase, they share the engine, transmission, all-wheel-drive system, and other performance pieces with the four-door Spur. All cars originally used a 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged 12-cylinder engine in which the cylinders are arranged not in a V shape, but as a W—basically two narrow-angle V-6 engines mounted side by side with a common crank. This spares some room under the hood, and produces power just as copiously and as smoothly as a conventional V-12.</p>, <p>In the first generation, which was sold until the 2011 model year with one exception, the standard W-12 engine produced 552 horsepower, good for a 0-60 mph time of about five seconds, even though the cars each weighed more than 5,500 pounds. Updated Speed editions saw power rise to 600 hp, while 60-mph acceleration times fell below five seconds and the top speed on coupes rose to 195 mph. A Supersports model added on 21 more horsepower, for a 0-60 mph time of 3.7 seconds, and a manufacturer-rated top speed of 204 mph. An ISR special edition reached 631 hp. Each version used a 6-speed, paddle-operated automatic transmission. Each also rode on an independent suspension, with power shuffled to the wheels via all-wheel drive featuring a Torsen differential. Fuel economy in the Continental GT in this generation was a very low: 10 mpg city, 17 mpg highway, mitigated only a little by the flex-fuel capability of all versions.</p>, <p><span class="keylinks_silent">Among the myriad convenience and luxury features on the Continental</span> were a marvelous convertible lid on the GTC versions that folded closed or open in 25 seconds. Lavish interior materials distinguished this Continental range even from the Ferraris and Maseratis of the world, and a 1,000-watt Naim audio system was on the options list for a mere $6,000 or so. The Mulliner trim package of quilted leather, knurled chrome, and turned aluminum trim was a highlight of modern-day automobile construction.</p>, <p>In the 2012 model year, Bentley updated the Continental GT and GTC with slightly revised styling, and made a 567-hp version of the W-12 standard. Quicker shift programming and a revised torque bias to 40/60 for the all-wheel-drive system were matched with slightly sportier handling. The Speed editions were dropped for the 2012 model year, while the Supersports GTC models were carried over intact from the 2011 model year, without the cosmetic and mechanical changes.</p>, <p>A <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1072992_2013-bentley-continental-gt-v8-first-drive">new V-8 drivetrain became available</a> for the 2013 model year, with a net output of 500 hp. It was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Because the V-8 was lighter, Bentley says performance nearly rivalled that of the W-12 cars, while fuel economy improved by as much as 40 percent.</p>, <p>Also for 2013, the Speed model returned in both <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1077092_2013-bentley-continental-gt-speed-preview">coupe</a> and convertible form. Unveiled at the 2013 Detroit auto show, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081328_2013-bentley-continental-gt-speed-convertible-leaked">new Continental GT Speed Convertible</a> offered figures to match the coupe: a stout 616 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque, enabling 4.1-second 0-60 mph acceleration and a top speed of 202 mph. The GT Speed Coupe accelerated to 60 mph in 4.0 seconds and hit a 205-mph top speed.</p>, <p>For the 2014 model year, Bentley added yet another model to the lineup with the Continental GT and GTC V8 S versions. They used a higher-output version of the twin-turbocharged V-8 that produced 521 hp and 502 lb-ft of torque, carrying less weight than the W-12 version. Then, for 2015, Bentley updated the GT Speed to produce 626 hp and 607 lb-ft from its W-12 engine, increases of 10 hp and 27 lb-ft compared to the previous Speed coupe and droptop.</p>, <p>The 2015 model year also brought a very limited run of Continental GT3-R models. Power for this variant came from a 592-hp version of the GT V-8 S's twin-turbo V-8. This Bentley shed 220 pounds compared to the V8 model, in part by removing the rear seat, creating what was the quickest Conti yet. Only 300 copies of this racy Continental were built and sold globally.</p>, <p>Continuing the pace of yearly updates, the 2016 Continental GT received a bit of a makeover, albeit a subtle one. Up front, noticeable changes included a smaller grille, vents carved into the fenders, and a revised bumper shape. In back, all models got a new decklid, while the GT Speed and V8 S models received a new lower fascia. Inside, gauge faces evolved, the steering-wheel diameter shrunk, and wi-fi became available as an option.</p>, <p>For 2017, the GT Speed received a bit of a power bump for good measure, giving it totals of 633 hp and 620 lb-ft, up 7 and 13, respectively.</p>, <p><a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1103236_bentley-unveils-its-fastest-model-ever-the-continental-gt-speed">A new Black Edition</a> was also introduced for the 2017 model year.</p>, <p>In addition to dropping the coupe for the short 2018 model year, Bentley brings back the Supersports convertible, now with 700 horsepower. The engine lineup also consists only of W-12s, now with 568 hp in the GT, and 615 hp in the GT Speed. Also new is the limited-edition Timeless Series, which gets takes a luxury focus, including Mulliner content, and features a Liquid Amber Veneer paint finish.</p>, <p>Expect a redesigned Continental GT convertible to follow the coupe within a year or so.</p>]

[<p>The Bentley Bentayga an ultra-luxurious SUV. It seats up to five passengers in superlative comfort with a resplendent cabin. Available in a wide range powertrains, including a high-powered 12-cylinder engine or plug-in hybrid V-8.</p>, <p>With the Bentagya, Bentley has just one direct rival for now: the Land Rover Range Rover, in its most opulent Autobiography trim.</p>, <p>However, there are more competitors in the offing. Mercedes will offer a Maybach-trimmed version of its big GLS SUV, alongside its military-grade G-Class, while BMW will also sell a new X7 in the years to come. A Rolls-Royce SUV, possibly called Cullinan, is in development, and a high-performance Lamborghini Urus SUV is on its way.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bentley_bentayga_2018">2018 Bentley Bentayga review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Bentley first showed the five-door sport-utility vehicle at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show, after showing it as a concept vehicle at auto shows for years.</p>, <p>The Bentagya is unmistakably a Bentley, incorporating all the usual cues of the brand's coupes, convertibles, and sedans. The front end is dominated by a massive grille and three other mesh-grille air intakes. There are LED headlights, paired with what look like oval running lights—which they are, though they also incorporate telescoping headlight washers that can run at extremely high speeds. Big 22-inch wheels on top versions give the Bentayga tremendous ride height, while flying-B logos are woven into its fender vents and taillights.</p>, <p>The cabin mixes the customarily lush levels of chrome, leather, and wood. Its most stunning detail, no doubt, will be the $170,000 optional Mulliner Tourbillon timepiece by Breitling. Embedded in the dash, it can be trimmed with diamond markers, one of three gold trims, and either ebony or mother-of-pearl facing.</p>, <p>The boundless luxury is backed up by what promises to be exceptional performance. The Bentayga's powertrain at launch will be a 600-horsepower W-12 engine, with twin-turbocharging and 663 pound-feet of torque. To conserve fuel—and to meet EPA estimates of 16 mpg combined—the engine is coupled to an 8-speed automatic, and incorporates direct injection, stop-start, fuel cutoff to some cylinders under light operation, and a "sail" mode that unlocks the torque converter in top gears when the throttle is released. Future versions will be powered by plug-in hybrid and turbodiesel drivetrains; a twin-turbo V-8 is a likely spin-off, too.</p>, <p>Bentley claims the Bentayga is not only the world's most luxurious SUV, but that it's also the fastest, with an estimated top speed of 187 mph. With the W-12, Bentley quotes the 187-mph top speed, as well as a 0-60 mph time of 4.0 seconds, both quicker and faster than the Range Rover or Porsche Cayenne Turbo S.</p>, <p>To tailor its extreme performance from pavement to trail, the Bentayga comes with standard all-wheel drive, with a Torsen center differential and built-in hill-descent control that works at speeds of up to 18 mph. An air suspension is also standard; it offers four ride heights, including a tall mode for cruising over off-road obstacles. The Bentayga's gauges offer data on altitude, roll, pitch, steering angle, and direction. On road, the Bentayga's electric power steering, air suspension, and adaptive dampers can be configured in one of eight driving modes to customize performance.</p>, <p>The Bentayga is a big vehicle, at 68.6 inches tall, on a 117.9-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 202.4 inches. The initial versions will seat four or five passengers, but a seven-passenger, three-row model is expected to join the lineup. Seating configurations can be upgraded to include power heated and ventilated buckets front and rear, with up to 22-way power adjustment; the back seat can be ordered in an executive setup that comes with a tablet device for controlling infotainment, as well as a center console with USB ports.</p>, <p>On all Bentaygas, a hands-free tailgate is standard. On the most luxurious versions, a stow-away "event seat" tucks in the cargo area, so you don't have to remember your Coleman camper chair. A range of lifestyle options will be bundled in packages; everything from a water-resistant tray and locker to a Mulliner Hamper Set complete with Linley china and a refrigerator will be offered.</p>, <p>Safety gear includes adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go ability, programmed to follow vehicles ahead in slow traffic with a minimum of intervention; predictive cruise control, which looks at data for the road ahead to smooth vehicle behavior and trim fuel consumption; traffic-sign recognition; automatic parking assistance; night vision; and a head-up display.</p>, <p>Standard and available luxury features abound, and will include a panoramic glass roof; an 8.0-inch touchscreen display; navigation; a 60GB hard drive for data and music storage; and a removable 10.2-inch tablet for back-seat passengers, linked to the outside world by 4G LTE, Bluetooth, and an in-car wi-fi hotspot.</p>, <p>Audio systems include a standard and a "signature" offering, with top versions gaining a 1,950-watt Naim for Bentley setup with 18 speakers.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bentley_mulsanne
[<p>The Bentley Mulsanne is a four-door sedan and the largest in the luxury automaker's stable. It's been around since 2011 and pushed the automaker to new, more opulent heights against Rolls-Royce and Mercedes-Maybach.</p>, <p>The Mulsanne nameplate was revived after being dormant from 1992 to 2010. The name is derived from the famous Mulsanne Straight at the Circuit de la Sarthe racing circuit in France, which is home of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p>, <p>Today's Mulsanne sedan is a stately, refined vehicle that can be configured with nearly any option or equipment, with almost any trim material in any hue.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bentley_mulsanne_2017">2017 Bentley Mulsanne review<br/></a></strong></em></p>, <p>The modern Bentley Mulsanne is powered in standard trim by a 505-horsepower, 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V-8. The engine makes an impressive 752 pound-feet of torque just off idle, and can whoosh this big luxury sedan to 60 mph in just 5.1 seconds—and on to a top speed of 184 mph. Shifts are handled by a very stout ZF-sourced 8-speed automatic. To save fuel, the engine can shut off four of its cylinders under light loads. The Mulsanne is composed in tight turns, although you do get a sense of the car's 5,700-pound curb weight when tossing it around. Brakes for this hefty sedan are entirely capable of stopping it confidently from triple-digit speeds, thanks to huge, 15.75-inch front discs tucked inside large, 20- and 21-inch wheels. The Mulsanne is the only model Bentley builds with rear-wheel drive, making its power and torque that much more entertaining and imparting more of a throwback feel to this big British brute.</p>, <p>A new Mulsanne Speed model was added at the top of the range for 2015. It's powered by a higher-output version of the standard car's V-8, offering 530 hp and a staggering 811 lb-ft of torque. The massive torque figure required a reworked automatic transmission and is one of the highest available from a modern car of any kind, certainly the most of any sedan. Exterior differentiation is minimal, although it would be hard to call something this large a sleeper.</p>, <p>With classic proportions, including a long hood, short front overhang, and relatively short trunk, the Mulsanne plays some visual tricks, appearing a bit shorter than its actual 18-foot-4-inch length. The Mulsanne isn't quite limousine-like in back (buyers will no doubt be split about whether to drive themselves or be driven), but it's luxurious for two rear passengers or comfortable enough for three. While some of the button surfaces are plastic, the rest of the interior is wood, hide, and metal, with all controls beautifully damped.</p>, <p>As you might expect for one of the world's most expensive sedans, nearly everything in the Mulsanne can be customized and custom-ordered, under a so-called "bespoke" process. As a result, the $285,000 entry price tag simply serves as a jumping-off point, with most cars getting extensive customization. Among the baseline choices are nine wood varieties—all real veneers, bonded to solid oak, maple, or cherry—and a wide range of leather colors, and various metal trim options. Also on offer on the outside are several potential two-tone paint schemes.</p>, <p>The interior manages to feature all the expected modern electronics, without tainting the old-world wood-and-leather experience too much. Standard features on the Mulsanne include Bluetooth connectivity, satellite radio, and full iPod integration, as well as heated 14-way front seats and a multimedia, screen-based control system with navigation and voice control. A rear entertainment system with dual screens, a heated steering wheel, and ventilated seats are among many additional options.</p>, <p>Recently, Bentley has made improvements to the Mulsanne with two new packages, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081854_bentley-enhances-the-mulsanne-gilding-the-gilded-lily">Comfort Specification and the Entertainment Specification</a>, and for 2014, the Comfort Specification also receives "airline"-style headrests, as well as new footrests and cushions. There's also an iPad "picnic table" and wi-fi hotspot built into the Entertainment Specification, and the previous window shades can be replaced with actual curtains. This should make the Mulsanne more comfortable than most homes.</p>, <p>A Mulsanne Speed Blue Train by Mulliner was recently unveiled, with only four copies slated for production and sales in Europe. The model commemorates the 1930 Blue Train race won by a Bentley Speed Six. It carries special blue paint and trimmings, as well as historical details from the original car.</p>, <p>Bentley also unveiled a convertible version of the Mulsanne—dubbed, quite unimaginatively, <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1095513_bentley-raises-the-roof-with-flagship-grand-convertible-concept">Grand Convertible</a>—at the 2014 Los Angeles auto show. It was called a concept, although a very similar model should see production soon—hopefully with a better name. The Grand Convertible uses the same powertrain as the Mulsanne Speed and rides on a wheelbase that is truncated by about half a foot. If produced, it will compete directly with Rolls-Royce's Phantom Drophead Coupe.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, Bentley introduced the Extended Wheelbase model. The highlight of the new edition is a stretch of 9.8 inches, which is devoted to increasing rear-seat leg room. Other changes include exterior tweaks front and rear, an all-new infotainment system, new contoured seats, a stiffened chassis, and a host of new rear seat options to take advantage of the extra room in the Extended Wheelbase model.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bentley_flying-spur
[<p>The Bentley Flying Spur is a four-door sedan that's impossibly luxurious—and impossibly fast.</p>, <p>It combines two automotive superlatives: British opulence with German precision.</p>, <p>The Flying Spur is a rival for the Rolls-Royce Ghost, the Mercedes-Maybach sedan, and the Aston Martin Rapide.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bentley_flying-spur_2017" title="2016 Bentley Flying Spur - review">2017 Bentley Flying Spur review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Bentley Flying Spur</strong></p>, <p>The second-generation <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082373_2014-bentley-flying-spur-preview">Bentley Flying Spur</a>, launched at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show as a 2014 model, dropped the Continental name and received a new and evolutionary look that's a little sexier but still on the conservative side. The re-engineered body and chassis provide a sporty driving experience, while the cabin is quieter than ever. Its W-12 engine received a substantial output boost—to 616 horsepower and 580 pound-feet of torque—and it's now mated to an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The new W12 S, which is added for the 2017 model year, puts out 626 hp and 605 lb-ft of torque. Bentley says it's the fastest sedan it's ever sold, with a top speed of 202 mph.</p>, <p>Bentley added a second engine to the Flying Spur line for 2015, creating the first Flying Spur V8. Its 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 makes 500 hp. In the V8 S, the 4.0 makes 521 hp. </p>, <p>The V-8 models are lighter and a bit more nimble than their W-12-powered counterparts. With the base V8, the Flying Spur is able to hit 60 mph in 4.9 seconds and move on to a top speed of 183 mph. The V8 S cuts the 0-to-60-mph time to 4.6 seconds and raises the top speed to 190 mph. With the help of cylinder deactivation, the V-8 engine returns 17 mpg combined.</p>, <p>As you'd expect, the fit and finish of the Flying Spur are exquisite. The interior will impress anyone with its variety of top-shelf materials—burled walnut, knurled aluminum, beautiful leather, soft lambswool carpets, layers of lacquer and chrome everywhere—and finely detailed craftsmanship. Buyers can also bring their own choices to the design table. Other additions to the Flying Spur include wireless hotspot capability, a rear-seat entertainment suite, and a feature that lets passengers control more vehicle functions from the back seat.</p>, <p>The Flying Spur doesn't have quite as much rear-seat room as you might expect, but that keeps it relatively small and driver-friendly—and gives folks looking for the chauffeured experience a reason to step up to the stately Mulsanne sedan.</p>, <p>Neither the NHTSA nor the IIHS have crash-tested the Flying Spur, but it's replete with airbags in all directions, as well as traction and stability control integrated with its anti-lock brakes. The standard all-wheel drive can also be seen as somewhat of a safety item.</p>, <p><strong>Bentley Flying Spur history</strong></p>, <p>In its first generation, the big sedan bore the Continental nameplate, but more recently the Flying Spur has been separated from the fastback two-door coupe and convertible models that relaunched the brand more than a decade ago. The two- and four-door models continue to share a platform and bear very similar styling, however.</p>, <p>Introduced in the 2006 model year in the U.S., the Flying Spur evolved carefully over its lifespan. The basics didn't change much in that first generation, and the car always received attention with its four-circle front end, its wedding-cake shoulders and roofline, and the sloping formality of its trunklid. It didn't share the very formal look of the big Bentley Arnage, thankfully—and its styling had positive influences on the Bentley Mulsanne that was introduced for 2011.</p>, <p>Since 2006, the Flying Spur's powertrains have been derived more from Volkswagen Group companies than from the brand's British heritage. The twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter W-12 engine originally laid out 552 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque, and distributed the power to an all-wheel-drive system through a 6-speed automatic. The first-generation Continental Flying Spur's claimed 0-60 mph time of less than five seconds and top speed of 194 mph were eventually bested by a Speed edition, which bumped the W-12 to 600 hp and 554 lb-ft of torque, cutting 60-mph acceleration times to 4.5 seconds and lifting top speed to 200 mph. Handling was unbelievably responsive for the 5,500-pound Flying Spur, and braking power was astonishing and abrupt.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_5-series
[<p>The BMW 5-Series has been one of BMW most prolific. Four-door sedans, five-door hatchbacks, wagons, and ultra-powerful super sedans have all worn the 5-Series moniker.</p>, <p>The newest 5-Series bowed in 2017 and now includes the 5-Series sedan and the related M5 sedan. (The high-performance variant of the 5-Series, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_m5">the M5</a>, is covered in a separate entry.) The former 5-Series Gran Turismo has been moved under the 6-Series badge.</p>, <p>The 5-Series is powered by a broad spectrum of powertrains including a turbo-4, turbo-6, plug-in hybrid, or a twin-turbo V-8.</p>, <p>Rivals include the Jaguar XF, Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and Cadillac CTS.  </p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111596_2018-bmw-5-series">2018 BMW 5-Series review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW 5-Series</strong></p>, <p>A new, seventh-generation BMW 5-Series arrived in 2017 (dubbed G30 in BMW-speak). The new sedan borrowed some chassis components from the bigger 7-Series, but none of the carbon fiber in its construction.</p>, <p>The new BMW 5-Series is more than 120 pounds lighter than the outgoing model, despite being marginally larger and wider. Although the newest 5-Series borrows heavily from the outgoing model, the nose and tail are recognizably different with shorter overhangs, bigger headlights, and a more pronounced grille.</p>, <p>Under the hood of the latest models are a turbo-4 that makes 248 horsepower, or a turbocharged V-6 that makes 335 hp in the 530i and 540i respectively. From the beginning, the sedans are offered with standard rear-wheel drive or available all-wheel drive. Roughly two months after the 530i and 540i went on sale in the U.S., they were followed by a plug-in hybrid 530e iPerformance model, and a V-8-powered M550i xDrive. A year later the vaunted M5 joined the lineup.</p>, <p>Although the 5-Series has roots as a sport luxury sedan, the new 5-Series is a technological showcase. A 10.2-inch touchscreen sits dead center in the dash and controls myriad functions including connected apps that can help find a parking space in a busy lot. The 5-Series also includes active lane control systems that can follow and read clear roads for more than 30 seconds without driver input.</p>, <p>BMW also included a revised electronic steering system in the new 5-Series and a rear-wheel steering system compatible with all-wheel drive, a first for the brand.</p>, <p><strong>BMW 5-Series history</strong></p>, <p>The 1997-2003 5-Series, known by the E39 chassis code name to insiders and enthusiasts, is considered one of the best examples of the model by those who appreciate a relatively simple but premium-feeling driver's car. BMW had made some major improvements in interior appointments, driving dynamics, and quality/reliability going into this generation.</p>, <p>In 2004, the BMW 5-Series was all-new, and that generation was a radical shift design-wise, incorporating a sleek, rounded front with swept-back headlamps, along with the so-called "Bangle Butt"—incorporating a downward-sweeping belt line and named after its designer, Chris Bangle, in back. This generation of 5-Series, called the E60 within BMW, failed to hit the mark with some longtime BMW fans. It's tough to offer a single criticism, but its swept-back exterior, smooth sheet metal, and more formal, less driver-focused instrument panel never went over very well with Bimmer loyalists. Factor in an armada of new tech features and a more isolated driving experience, and the 5 didn't always feel like the well-honed sport sedan it once was.</p>, <p>Initially, the E60 5-Series used engines carried over from the E39 car. So for the first couple of years, buyers were able to choose between the 525i's 184-hp, 2.5-liter inline-6 or the 530i's 225-hp, 3.0-liter inline-6. For 2006, output was upped to 215 hp for the 2.5 and 255 hp for the 3.0, and a new 360-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 arrived in the 550i; it replaced the 4.4-liter used in the 540i.</p>, <p>Overall, this last generation of 5-Series was seen as very tech-focused. Among the features available in the 5 during these years was a night vision camera, active roll stabilization, active steering, automatic high beams, lane departure warning, and a head-up display. To top it all off, the iDrive was judged by most as particularly frustrating here, though for 2010, the 5-Series was updated with the new fourth-generation iDrive system, which was much easier to navigate.</p>, <p>In 2010, BMW added a new body style to the 5-Series line, called the 5-Series GranTurismo (GT). This model is a cross between a hatchback and a sedan, offering a clever trunk/hatch area as well as added rear-seat leg room to rival that of the larger 7-Series. The 5-Series GT is the closest thing that U.S. customers can get to a 5-Series wagon now, as that body style is no longer sold in this market, although it's available elsewhere.</p>, <p>The F10 5-Series, which was introduced for 2011, was a return to some of the styling cues abandoned from the E39 and offered more accessible technology and a more direct driving feel. The 5-Series shared a number of components with the latest 7-Series model and again with the expanding 6-Series range. There were a variety of models including rear-wheel-drive 535i (300-hp turbocharged inline-6) and 550i (440-hp twin-turbo V-8) variants, as well as all-wheel-drive xDrive models, with an entry 528i as the first stop in the lineup.</p>, <p>The 528i was powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 that 240 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>For 2013, BMW phased in a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1077235_power-boost-for-2013-bmw-5-series-and-6-series-v-8-models">new twin-turbo V-8</a> (keeping the 550i name that previous normally aspirated V-8 cars wore) that offered more horsepower and torque (445 hp and 480 lb-ft), along with much-improved fuel economy. Also, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1072281_2012-bmw-activehybrid-5-priced-from-61845">BMW ActiveHybrid 5</a> joined the lineup, combining a 300-hp turbo-6 with a 54-hp electric-motor system and 1.3-kWh lithium-ion battery, and all 2013 5-Series models got a new configurable gauge cluster. A "contactless" trunk opener that lets you open the trunklid by waving your foot underneath the trunk was available that year as well.</p>, <p>Also for 2013, an <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078741_2013-bmw-m5-m6-on-track-at-laguna-seca">all-new version of the BMW M5</a>, a performance legend, was offered with a 560-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 and 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The 5-Series received a mild visual refresh and some modified infotainment options for 2014.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_x3-series
[<p>The BMW X3 is the German automaker's mid-size, luxury crossover SUV.</p>, <p>With its more stylish X4 sloped-roof companion, the X3 rides in the middle of the BMW lineup, between the smaller X1 and the larger X5. The X3 is assembled at BMW's assembly plant in Greer, South Carolina. Its competitors are the Mercedes-Benz GLC, Cadillac XT5, Audi Q5, and Range Rover Evoque.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our review of the <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_x3-series_2018">2018 BMW X3</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW X3</strong></p>, <p dir="ltr">The third-generation BMW X3 went on sale in the U.S. late in 2017.</p>, <p dir="ltr">The new design isn't a radical departure. It's carefully modulated to give it more presence, without breaking from the X3's essential profile. Inside the cabin's better organized, with high-end versions that sport a digital gauge panel and a widescreen navigation display amid the wood and aluminum trim.</p>, <p>BMW sells the X3 for 2018 with a standard 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. Drivers have a choice between a 248-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo-4 and a 355-hp turbo-6 that also gains sport handling hardware, grabby brakes, grippy tires, and styling add-ons. </p>, <p>In this generation, the X3 has gained a couple of inches between its wheels, but interior space is up just slightly. It's still very good for four adults, with supportive sport seats in front and fold-down second-row seats that expand its considerable cargo space.</p>, <p>The new X3 offers forward-collision warnings, surround-view cameras, and adaptive cruise control. Other features include high-end audio and a widescreen navigation system with iDrive infotainment control.</p>, <p><strong>BMW X3 history</strong></p>, <p>As one of the anchors of the luxury crossover segment, the BMW X3 first showed up in U.S. showrooms with 6-cylinder engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and an advanced all-wheel-drive system that used input from stability control to determine where to route power. It also featured a relatively small interior with inexpensive-looking trim and had a very firm ride.</p>, <p>In almost every model year of that first generation, BMW tweaked the X3's looks or hardware. In 2007, the engines were updated, and ride and steering were revised, while the cockpit was refurbished with better materials—a noticeable improvement all around. Toward the end of its first generation, BMW dropped all engine variants save for the 260-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline-6. A brisk performer, the X3 remained responsive and eager.</p>, <p>BMW introduced its second-generation X3—the current model—for the 2011 model year. In its first redo, the X3 slightly grew and also improved its handling and ride, with options such as selectable steering modes and adaptive suspension. At launch, BMW offered two versions of its ubiquitous 3.0-liter inline-6—a normally aspirated version making 240 hp and a turbocharged, 300-hp variant. Both were paired with a new 8-speed automatic transmission and a version of BMW's familiar xDrive all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>The current X3's styling has adopted some of the latest BMW curves, though in this iteration it's a much happier mix than in some of the early examples of this design theme—the 7-Series and 6-Series of the early 2000s, to be specific. The X3's upgraded interior brought new clarity and richer materials front and center.</p>, <p>BMW now offers a choice of three engines in the X3. The base setup is a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, available with either rear- (sDrive28i) or all-wheel (xDrive28i) drive. A 2.0-liter turbodiesel xDrive28d costs just a bit more and makes all-wheel drive standard while improving greatly on fuel economy. The top engine is a turbocharged inline-6 in the xDrive35i. All are paired with an 8-speed automatic that was introduced at the beginning of this generation.</p>, <p>With car-like ride and handling, and 0-60 mph times of 5.3 seconds on the top model, today's X3 sits atop the luxury-crossover class in almost every regard. The IIHS has given it favorable marks: it's scored a "Good" rating in every crash test, including a "Superior" rating, when optionally equipped, for frontal crash avoidance. The X3 is a past Top Safety Pick, but because the car hasn't been rated in the notoriously hard small overlap crash test, the IIHS hasn't yet returned the honor. And entertainment's finally on the menu: the options list includes an excellent navigation system, iPod integration, HD Radio, Bluetooth, and a big panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>The X3 was mostly unchaged for 2012. The 2013 model year marked a major turning point for the X3, as the base inline-6 was dropped in favor of <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075298_2013-bmw-x3-xdrive28i-offers-class-leading-fuel-economy">a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine</a> with nearly identical power ratings to the outgoing engine and improved highway fuel economy. Then 2015 marked the introduction of a rear-wheel drive "base" sDrive28i, as well as a new xDrive28d turbodiesel model.</p>, <p>To keep things fresh, the 2015 X3 received exterior and interior design tweaks, including a new grille, a new headlight design, and some cabin trim updates. The X3 also received BMW's latest iDrive controller, which incorporates a touch pad, as well as some newly optional active-safety features. BMW also launched a coupe-SUV version of the X3, dubbed X4, for the 2015 model year. Like the X6 is to the X5, the X4 is a more stylish but less practical take on the traditionally styled X3.</p>, <p>For 2016, a new Enhanced USB and Bluetooth connectivity kit brought mobile-office capability, Bluetooth sync for a second phone, and voice control for contacts and music. X3 xDrive35i models got the Harman Kardon surround sound system. The SUV was largely unchanged for 2017.</p>]

The 650i gets a twin-turbocharged, 4.4-liter V-8 engine rated at 400 hp, and the range-topping M6 uses a sharper version of the 4.4-liter to generate a massive 560 hp and 500 pound-feet of torque. The coupe was initially available in either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, while the Convertible was initially limited to rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>
BMW grew the 6-Series lineup for the 2013 model year with a new body style, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1070470_2013-bmw-6-series-gran-coupe">6-Series Gran Coupe</a>. This slinky sedan is BMW's first entry into the so-called four-door coupe segment pioneered by Mercedes-Benz's CLS-Class. It's a cross between a 5-Series sedan and a 6-Series coupe, with a wide track and a long hood. The Gran Coupe was initially launched as a 640i with the turbocharged inline-6; V-8 and all-wheel-drive versions were added shortly after.</p>, <p>In the standard 6-Series coupe and convertible, both 6-speed manual and 8-speed automatic transmissions are available.</p>, <p>
The current BMW 6-Series also offers a wide range of luxury and technology features, including a 10.2-inch LCD display, the fourth-generation iDrive infotainment system, a highly detailed and sculpted interior design, and 2+2 seating. Twenty-way adjustable power seats, LED headlights, BMW Night Vision with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning, lane-change warning, and a high-end Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system are also available options.</p>, <p>
An immense array of exterior paint, interior color, upholstery, trim, and other aesthetic options are available to personalize the range of BMW 6-Series models.</p>, <p>
For 2013, BMW 650i models received a new twin-turbo V-8 engine, incorporating Valvetronic variable valve timing and making 445 hp and 480 lb-ft of torque. Otherwise, 2013 brought a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079909_bmw-announces-special-edition-x6-and-6-series-coupe">BMW 6-Series Coupe Frozen Silver Edition</a>—a model distinguished by its Frozen Silver paint, 20-inch M Performance Wheels with contrasting black center caps, and other upgrades like a sport exhaust, Alcantara headliner, and custom door sills.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083132_2014-bmw-6-series-6-series-gran-coupe-and-m6-preview">2014 model year</a> brought an optional 6-speed manual transmission for M6 models, an updated version of the iDrive infotainment system, and a range of color and equipment updates. A Harman Kardon sound upgrade was introduced for 2015. Also in 2015, the 6-Series lineup upgraded to a Dynamic Digital Instrument Cluster display and enhanced iDrive touch-pad controller; meanwhile 650i and 650i xDrive models gained a standard M Sport exhaust system, and the Sport automatic transmission gained a Launch Control feature.</p>, <p>BMW has bestowed a very mild refresh on the 6-Series lineup for 2016. Changes are very subtle on the exterior—and the M6 models actually go without visual updates—and there is also some mild freshening of the interior. The previously optional full-LED headlights are updated and have been made standard on all models.</p>, <p>The 2017 version added BMW's newest version of its infotainment, but carried on largely unchanged from the year before it.</p>, <p>For 2018, the 6-Series coupe lineup—that is, the hardtop two-door—has been axed. Gran Coupe and convertible models remain available with both 6- and 8-cylinder power.</p>, <p><strong>BMW 6-Series history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>From its introduction as a 1976 model to the end of the first generation in 1989, the 6-Series was available only as a coupe and shared underpinnings with the 5-Series sedans of its time. The first 6er saw many changes over its long run, with its 3.2-liter inline-6 growing to 3.5 liters by the end. There also were incremental improvements to the interior, performance, and power over time, and BMW also created the first M6, which offered power and handling upgrades beyond what the standard car could provide.</p>, <p>After a hiatus, the 6-Series returned for its second generation in 2003, taking a spot vacated by the 8-Series. This time around, the 6-Series again took its basis from the 5-Series' core mechanical underpinnings, but was offered as a coupe and convertible. A 4.4-liter V-8 engine was the standard powerplant, generating a stout 330 hp. In 2006, midway through the second generation's model run, a new 4.8-liter V-8 was introduced, raising output to 362 hp. Debuting in 2005, the new M6 received a 500-hp V-10 engine paired with the SMG III automated manual gearbox, yielding impressive 0-60 mph acceleration of 4.1 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph—though the car was capable of 194 mph.</p>]

[<p>The BMW M5 is a performance luxury sedan that is rarefied—sometimes even deified—among its followers.</p>, <p>Part of the BMW lineup since 1985, the M5 has evolved from a lightly upgraded mid-size sedan, to its current form—a 600-horsepower monster than can out-corner and out-accelerate some supercars.</p>, <p>New for 2018, the M5 competes against rivals like the Mercedes-AMG E63, Cadillac CTS-V, Lexus GS F, Audi S6 and should it come, the RS 6.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_m5_2018">2018 BMW M5 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW M5</strong></p>, <p>The 2018 redesign, dubbed F90 is based on the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_5-series_2017">new BMW 5-Series sedan</a>. For the first time, the M5 features an all-wheel-drive system, called M xDrive, that can be disengaged for performance driving or for shredding tires. Output jumps by 40 horsepower and torque is up by 53 pound-feet to 553 lb-ft. An 8-speed automatic replaces both the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and the 6-speed manual. The jump in output and the traction of all-wheel drive drop the 0-60 mph time to a scant 3.2 seconds, besting the previous generation by almost a full second. The top speed is 189 mph with the M Driver's package.</p>, <p>BMW's new structure employs more aluminum and uses carbon fiber for the roof for the first time. The hood and fenders are also aluminum. The suspension features dual wishbones up front and a five-link independent rear, with adaptive dampers at all four corners. An electronically controlled limited-slip differential helps the car hook up when exiting corners.</p>, <p>Inside, the M5 is sporty, luxurious, and spacious, with 20-way power-adjustable seats up front and two-passenger seating in the rear. High-quality materials mark it as a luxury car, while an M-specific head-up display and gauges add to the performance character. It's loaded, too, with such amenities as gesture control, navigation, automatic climate control, satellite radio, a Harmon Kardon surround sound audio system, and a power trunklid. As usual, BMW offers plenty of options. Performance enthusiasts will want the carbon ceramic brakes, while luxury-minded buyers will prefer the Executive package and its ventilated and massaging front seats, wi-fi hotspot, automatic parking, wireless cell phone charging, and four-zone automatic climate control.</p>, <p>Standard safety equipment consists of forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors, lane-departure warning, and front and rear parking sensors. BMW offers safety options, too, but the M5 hasn't been crash tested.</p>, <p><strong>BMW M5 history</strong></p>, <p>The M5's story began in 1980 with a car wearing a different badge, the M535i. As the official motorsport version of the 5-Series at the time, the E12 M535i was considered the first full production car released by the BMW Motorsport division. This 3.5-liter, 215-hp sport sedan offered Recaro seats, a limited-slip differential, larger brakes, and other performance enhancements.</p>, <p>The first vehicle to be badged an M5 was the E28-generation model introduced in 1985 and sold until 1988. Only 2,200 of them were made, about 1,300 of which were brought to the U.S., but the car still managed to start a legacy for itself and the M brand. Power came from a version of the inline-6 that powered the M1 supercar, packing 256 hp in the U.S. version. European cars had about 26 hp more due to less-restrictive exhaust; they were not required to have the catalytic converters that choked cars that came here.</p>, <p>The E34 M5, built from 1989 to 1995 (but sold in the U.S. only during the 1991-1993 model years), truly established BMW's reputation in the sport sedan world, however. Over 12,000 units were sold worldwide and the car set a new benchmark for performance and luxury in its era. Again, power for U.S. models was reduced in comparison to its European cousins, but less markedly; U.S. E34 M5s were rated at 307 hp, a loss of just 4 hp compared to the freer-flowing models in the Old World. This generation also saw the first station wagon to wear an M badge, the M5 Touring, introduced in 1992, although none were brought here. In U.S. trim, the M5 was good for 0-60 mph in about 6.4 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph.</p>, <p>
As the M5 evolved, it grew not only larger and more powerful, but also more high-tech. Among the equipment featured on the car during its model run was front and rear Park Distance Control, a wireless car phone, solar-sensing automatic climate control, and DVD-based navigation. The E39 M5, built from 1998-2003, sported an S62 V-8 engine rated at 394 hp, fitted to a Getrag 6-speed manual transmission. Unlike the E28 and E34 before it, however, the E39 M5 was no longer hand-built by the M Division, but based on a series-produced chassis with modifications from M. The changes included lower, stiffer springs; revalved dampers; a limited-slip differential; quicker steering; stiffer anti-roll bars, and other performance upgrades. This M5 was even quicker than the last, despite its increased size, hitting 60 mph in just 4.8 seconds, but still topping out at the same electronically limited 155 mph. A Touring model was also built for this generation, sharing its equipment with the sedan.</p>, <p>
In 2005, a new M5 joined the fold, and this was the largest and most high-tech yet. With the world's first production V-10 engine in a sedan, the E60 M5 produced a sound unlike anything else, and quickly won fans around the world. Rated at 500 hp and paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed Getrag SMG III single-clutch, semi-automatic transmission. The SMG transmission was often maligned for its jerky operation, but for its time, it was an innovative addition to a relatively affordable performance sedan, with features like launch control, paddle shifters, downshift rev-matching, and 65-millisecond shift times. The 6-speed manual was introduced largely to meet American demand, and while slower in acceleration tests, offered greater driver engagement. A Touring version was built for European markets, but was never officially sold in North America. Top speed was once again limited to 155 mph (later 170 mph), though unrestrained models could hit speeds in excess of 200 mph.</p>, <p>The F10 generation began its life in the U.S. in 2012 as a 2013 model. Reducing the cylinder count for the first time in the M5's history, the F10 M5 returned to a V-8 configuration, but added a pair of turbochargers.</p>, <p>The result was a monstrous 560 horsepower, enabling 4.4-second 0-60 mph runs and a top speed of 190 mph with the M Driver's Package (electronically limited to 155 mph otherwise). This performance, despite its nearly 4,300-pound curb weight, placed the M5 sedan among the highest-performance sedans in the world, regardless of price. A new M DCT 7-speed dual-clutch transmission was the only offering at launch, bringing with it launch control and paddle shifters once again.</p>, <p>In 2013, BMW added a 6-speed manual offering to the car at the North American International Auto Show—again to service American demand. No M5 Touring model was offered, though Europeans did get the option of a diesel-powered M Performance model called the M550d xDrive Touring.</p>, <p>For the 2014 model year, BMW added a new Competition Package that increased the output to 575 hp, as well as enhancing the suspension with new coil springs, damper calibrations, and anti-roll bars. The electronic stability control system was remapped for higher thresholds before intervention, and the exterior of Competition Package models received black-tipped exhaust outlets, and unique 20-inch alloy wheels. Updates across the line for 2014 included available LED headlights, revised taillights, and an updated kidney grille; interior tweaks included a new M Sport steering wheel, updates to the iDrive system, and minor trim updates.</p>, <p>For 2015, BMW celebrated three decades of the M5 with a 30th Anniversary edition. This limited-release car—only 30 were to be sold in the U.S.—included everything from the Competition Package and added a 600-hp version of the twin-turbo V-8 engine, as well as matte gray paint, black wheels, black chrome detailing, and a slew of 30 Jahre M5 logos scattered around the exterior and interior.</p>, <p>The M5 carried over into 2016 with only very minor changes. It skipped the 2017 model year, in advance of the new 2018 model.</p>]

[<p>The BMW i3 is a compact hatchback and the automaker's most environmentally conscious vehicle produced. It's BMW's first electric car, has a body formed from carbon fiber, and can be outfitted with an optional range-extending 2-cylinder engine (REx) that kicks in when its batteries' charge is depleted.</p>, <p>With the i3, BMW launched a vehicle very different from its carefully honed traditional lineup of sporty sedans and crossovers. It's so different, the i3 got its own sub-brand. The i3 was the first entry in what the brand is making a range of "BMW i" vehicles, joined initially by the i8 hybrid sports car.</p>, <p>For 2018, BMW has slightly redesigned the i3 and offered for the first time a "sport" version, the BMW i3s. Sport is relative here, the i3s receives a modest 14 hp boost over the normal i3, gets a more aggressive front end appearance, and adds wider tires and a stiffer suspension. Also for 2018, BMW has dropped the 22-kwh battery in favor of the 33-kwh version that extends the electric driving range to as much as 114 miles.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_i3_2018">2018 BMW i3 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The shape of BMW's i3 is unlike that of anything currently within the BMW or Mini fold because it's been conceived as a dedicated electric car. The i3 is offered in several different Worlds, as BMW calls the model's trim levels.</p>, <p>The i3 can trace its roots to BMW's MegaCity concept car. The architecture that concept spawned is called LifeDrive—it's a passenger (Life) module set atop a powertrain (Drive) module, for a modern twist on the old body-on-frame idea. In a first for a mass-produced vehicle, the passenger cell is produced from carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, while the rolling chassis is made of aluminum.</p>, <p>The i3 is designed and styled for urban environments. The tall hatchback has plenty of glass all around, though short rear glass compromises rear vision. The rear doors are hinged at the rear to keep it short and provide a coupe-like look. Like the iconic Toyota Prius and the more recent Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3 is instantly identifiable—with looks that provoke strong reactions, one way or another.</p>, <p>The i3 is primarily an electric car, with a 170-horsepower (184 in the i3s) rear-mounted electric motor system providing 97-114 miles of driving range. Separately there’s the option for a REx—a 650cc gasoline 2-cylinder engine making 38 hp.</p>, <p>In the BMW i3, the REx only functions to provide electricity, not supplemental tractive power, like in the Chevrolet Volt. With its tiny 2.4-gallon fuel tank and an estimated 33-42 mpg, it nearly doubles the effective range to 180 miles, curbing range anxiety to an extent. The i3 will charge fully in about 4.5 hours at 220 volts, or get to a full charge in 30 minutes using an SAE standardized DC fast-charger.</p>, <p>The lithium-ion battery that powers the i3's rear-mounted electric motor is sandwiched into the car's floor. Initially, the battery's capacity was 22-kwh, but a 33-kwh variant was added for the 2017 model year and became standard for 2018. The body is made of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), so strong that there are no pillars required between the front and rear doors on each side. </p>, <p>Although modest, the system's output is enough to move the i3 in a sporting way; BMW claims a 0-60 mph time as low as 6.8 seconds, and the little city car can top out at 99 mph. The rear-drive layout and near-50/50 front/rear weight distribution help it to outdo the dynamics of other small electric cars, although the tall body, boosted electric steering, and skinny tires all work to the detriment of handling. The weight-saving measures also pay dividends here, as well as with energy consumption. The i3's tall and narrow tires measure 155/70R19 and are of the low-rolling-resistance variety to improve mileage. The i3s gets 175/55R20s up front and 195/50R20s at the rear; still skinny, but handling is improved thanks to the extra traction and a 0.4 inch lower ride height.</p>, <p>The i3 has a very upright cabin layout that helps make the most of available space. Cabin upholstery includes recycled materials—even the wood has been sustainably sourced—and with the tall roof, there's just enough space for adults in back.</p>, <p>Four different trim levels of the i3 are offered, although BMW has chosen to call them Worlds instead. They include the Deka World, Mega World, Giga World, and Tera World. Navigation, ConnectedDrive, LED headlights and running lamps, an alarm system, and a 7.4-kw charger are included on all levels. The Giga World adds leather and wool upholstery, contrast stitching, and satellite radio, while the Tera gets special trims, a full-leather interior, and its own unique wheels. Beyond the trim level and a few color choices, BMW offers few options or packages offered on the i3.</p>, <p>Pricing in the U.S. started at $42,275 when the i3 went on sale in May 2014. After a short initial model year, the 2015 model arrived with few changes—heated seats, satellite radio, and the DC fast-charge port were made standard, and base prices rose about $1,000 as a result of the added equipment.</p>, <p>For 2017, the big change was the availability of a higher capacity battery that extended the electric driving range from about 90 miles to up to 114 miles. Additionally, the REx's fuel capacity was increased from 1.9 to 2.4 gallons.</p>]

[<p>The BMW X5 luxury mid-size SUV is a stalwart in a class it helped create.</p>, <p>The newest X5 will debut for the 2019 model year with more creature comforts, more technology, and presumably more efficient powertrains.</p>, <p>It's a rival for vehicles such as the Mercedes-Benz GLE Class, Range Rover Sport, and Porsche Cayenne.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_x5_2018">2018 BMW X5 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW X5</strong></p>, <p>Built in BMW's U.S. factory in Greer, South Carolina, the X5 is considered by the automaker to be a mid-size "sports activity vehicle."</p>, <p>BMW didn't change the X5's smart silhouette much for this generation. Sculpting down the sides balances out the big front air intakes. The cabin features a horizontal design trimmed in black leatherette or neutral leathers.</p>, <p>The least-expensive X5 is powered by BMW's tried-and-true turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6, making 300 horsepower in both the rear-drive sDrive35i and all-wheel-drive xDrive35i. A diesel is again available in the xDrive35d. There's still a V-8 option in the xDrive50i, which is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter engine making 445 hp. The new plug-in hybrid's engine and electric motor team to produce 308 hp, and the motor can power the vehicle alone for up to 13 miles. All models have electric power steering, which is very light and offers only hints of the feedback the older models supplied. A smooth 8-speed automatic improves efficiency, but also includes a more aggressive "Sport" mode for those who want it. There's also an available adaptive suspension setup, as well as air springs for the rear that are best for towing applications.</p>, <p>The X5 can seat up to seven. The front seats aren't BMW's best efforts, but the second-row seat can now be split 40/20/40 for more flexibility, and each section is adjustable individually for rake. The optional third-row seats have an "easy entry" function but little space. The cargo hold can be opened from the keyfob or the driver's seat; the lower piece drops like a truck tailgate, while the upper glass powers open like a minivan hatch.</p>, <p>The X5 is long on advanced safety technology, including a lane-departure warning system and a pedestrian collision-avoidance system with automatic braking. A Traffic Jam Assistant maintains following distance and keeps the vehicle at the center of its lane by providing steering input. The NHTSA gave the X5 a five-star rating overall for safety and it received top "Good" ratings in the categories it has been rated in by the IIHS. The agency also gave a "Superior" score to the X5 for front crash prevention, when optionally equipped.</p>, <p>There was only one notable change for 2016: the addition of a plug-in hybrid. Prices for the 2016 BMW X5 range from about $55,000 to more than $80,000 when trimmed out with Dakota leather, Bang &amp; Olufsen audio, a rear-seat entertainment system, and more.</p>, <p>For 2017, BMW gave the X5 a touchscreen infotainment system to complement the sometimes-finicky iDrive puck. For the 2018 model year, relatively few and minor changes were made.</p>, <p>BMW also offers the high-performance X5 M. Powered by an upgraded version of the twin-turbo 4.4-liter massaged by M, the X5 M once again brings a torque-vectoring rear differential (which is otherwise unavailable elsewhere in the X5 lineup), making it a real track monster and plenty of fun in snowy weather. It receives a more aggressive exterior, of course. Also available is the X6 M for those who just don't like all of that utility in the back of the X5.</p>, <p><strong>BMW X5 history</strong></p>, <p>The BMW X5 has been around for a decade and a half now. When it was developed, BMW also owned Land Rover, and because of this, the first-generation X5 shared much of its design with that legendary brand’s off-roaders, as well as the BMW 5-Series sedan. The original X5 also sported a range of engines, including a 3.0-liter inline-6 and a number of 4.4-liter to 4.8-liter V-8 engines paired with 5- or 6-speed automatic transmissions.</p>, <p>For the second generation, BMW designed a new platform, with a new range of engines—including a diesel and a hybrid—and a new high-performance X5 M, while a new 6-speed automatic transmission that was used in all models.</p>, <p>Model names for the BMW X5 lineup were changed to reflect more iterations of the 'ute. With the second generation, the new names adopted a different format: the X5 xDrive30i, for example, denoted the standard all-wheel drive (xDrive) and a 3.0-liter inline-6. In addition to that model, BMW offered a 3.0-liter turbodiesel as the X5 xDrive35d, a 4.8-liter V-8 engine in the X5 xDrive48i, and a 555-hp, <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1072514_2013-bmw-x5-m-pricing-details-and-new-video-released">twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine in the new X5 M</a>. In 2011, the standard models received engine upgrades and name changes: the 6-cylinder was fitted with a turbo and the xDrive35i name, while the V-8 model received a pair of turbos and the xDrive50i badge.</p>, <p>All X5s of this generation featured the same basic five-seat interior layout, with leather upholstery, BMW’s iDrive infotainment system, advanced stability and traction electronics, plus a wide range of optional upgrades. The X5 M offered extreme performance with a big price tag to match—base prices hit $85,500—delivering near-sports car performance with near-supercar power. The X5 xDrive35d was one of the few diesel luxury SUVs on the market, and it scored with 265 hp and a 26-mpg EPA highway rating.</p>, <p>For 2012, BMW didn’t make any major changes to the X5 range, aside from minor appearance tweaks. Changes in the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_x5_2013">2013 BMW X5</a> included a temporary end to the diesel model, some cosmetic updates, and a new M Performance Package, available on X5 xDrive35i and xDrive50i (with M Sport Package) models. The new M Performance upgrade added to the X5's sporty edge through engine tuning, with 15 horsepower and 30 pound-feet of torque gained in the 6-cylinder model, and another 40 hp and 30 lb-ft of torque for the V-8 X5.</p>]

Additionally, BMW introduced a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081637_2013-bmw-320i-entry-level-luxury-starting-at-33445">new 320i sedan</a> that year, which offers a detuned version of the 328's turbo-4 making 180 hp and 200 lb-ft; the least-powerful 3 is still able to get to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds.</p>, <p>The new-generation 3-Series Sports Wagon also returned to the U.S. market in early 2013, offered as the 240-hp 328i or the 181-hp diesel 328d Sports Wagon. Both come with xDrive all-wheel drive and the automatic transmission as standard equipment, but they remain available with the M Sport package for those looking for a sportier sports wagon. The wagon includes a power tailgate, a separate flip-up rear window, and a Comfort Access opener that allows you to use a wave of your foot to activate the tailgate.</p>, <p>Another new model joined the 3-Series range in late 2013 as a 2014 model: the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082171_2014-bmw-3-series-gran-turismo-preview">2014 BMW 3-Series Gran Turismo</a>. Available in both 328i and 335i forms, the 3-Series GT is longer, taller, and roomier than the sedan, and its hatchback-like looks should suit buyers needing more room, but not keen on the look of a wagon. Beginning in the 2014 model year, coupe and convertible models were carved away and placed under the 4-Series badge along with a new 4-Series Gran Coupe. Then the 2015 model year brought only minor feature changes otherwise, with some new trim materials and Bluetooth audio streaming now included on the entire model line.</p>, <p>BMW added <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1029524_2016-bmw-3-series-plug-in-hybrid-prototype-first-details">a plug-in hybrid version of the 3-Series</a>, called the 330e, for this generation. Dubbed eDrive, the system pairs a turbocharged 4-cylinder with an 8-speed automatic with an integrated electric motor. Power is sent to the rear wheels to keep the feeling of a standard 3er. The eDrive 3-Series arrived for the 2016 model year, and the powertrain was offered on the X5 sport utility as well.</p>, <p>A handful of changes were made to the 2016 3-Series. The car received a light visual refresh, with new bumpers and lighting elements at both ends; LED headlights will be an option. The Sport appearance package will now be standard on all models save for the base 320i. BMW has retuned the chassis for better responses, and the 335i and its N55 turbo-6 have been replaced by a B58 engine making 320 hp and badged as the 340i.</p>, <p>For 2017, the most notable change to the 3-Series was under hood. The 328i was replaced with a newer, more potent turbo-4 that produces 248 hp and badged as the 330i. An updated infotainment system is available that includes Apple CarPlay and navigation. The car was largely unchanged for 2018.</p>, <p><strong>3-Series history</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation 3-Series, the E21, was launched in 1975. It served as the replacement for the 2002 and was originally only available as a two-door and with 6-cylinder engines. The E21 3er was launched in the U.S. for 1977, the same year the first straight-6-powered models came online.</p>, <p>The E21 was replaced by the E30 3-Series in 1982. This second-generation model initially came in a two- or four-door sedan body style with both 4- and 6-cylinder engines. This model was also available as a wagon, which was introduced in 1987 but didn't come to the States, and as a convertible, which did make it to the U.S. Another highlight of the E30 BMW 3-Series was the addition of the vaunted M3 in 1988, which came packing a 192-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and many other unique, motorsports-influenced pieces.</p>, <p>The E36 chassis code was applied to the third-generation BMW 3-Series, which arrived in the U.S. in 1991. Its appearance was similar to the E30's, but it was slightly larger and the design more angular. The E36 brought with it a new hatchback model, sold here as the 318ti. The E36 M3 used a straight-6 engine.</p>, <p>The follow-up was the E46 3-Series, which came for the 1999 model year and was very successful, selling a total of 561,249 copies worldwide in just the 2002 model year.</p>, <p>The fifth-generation E90 BMW 3-Series came onto the market in the 2006 model year and was face-lifted in the 2009 model year. It was based on a completely different platform to the outgoing E46, including changes to engines, transmission, the passenger compartment, and suspension technology, as well as the addition of a host of high-tech features and options. Coupe and Convertible models were launched in the 2007 model year and were updated for the 2011 model year. The E90 BMW 3-Series also saw the M3 model pick up a new V-8 engine. Other engine options available in the U.S. included a pair of 6-cylinder gasoline units as well as a turbodiesel (in the 335d sedan). Both rear-wheel- and all-wheel-drive configurations were offered.</p>]

[<p>The BMW X6 is a coupe-like four-door SUV. It shares much of the body and running gear with the BMW X5, with a slightly sharper focus on street manners versus off-road ability. </p>, <p>With the X6, BMW has few true rivals, due to its unusual combination of performance and design over utility. Mercedes-Benz now sells a coupe version of its GLE-Class, and BMW also uses the same idea with its X3-based X4.</p>, <p>The X6 asks for a few compromises for its dramatic roofline. Interior space isn't significantly better than a comparable-size sedan, and compromised rear vision means that it's tricky in parking lots.</p>, <p>The X6 gets some unique features over the X5, aside from its distinctive shape, including an available torque-vectoring rear differential. It also is offered in a high-performance edition, the X6 M. For 2018, it's largely carried over aside from some option package shuffling on most models.</p>, <p><strong><strong><em>MORE: See our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_x6-series_2018">2018 BMW X6 review</a></em></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW X6</strong></p>, <p>A new model in 2008, the X6 is now in its second generation and continues to get its power from a range of forced-induction 6- and 8-cylinder engines, with the top V-8 found in the massively powerful X6 M. Considering its range of performance and base price tags of about $60,000 to almost $90,000, the X6 has its chief rivals in the Porsche Cayenne, Infiniti QX70 (formerly the FX), and Land Rover Range Rover Sport.</p>, <p>For 2015, the BMW X6 received a moderate redesign, sharpening its lines and updating its themes to better match the rest of the recently refreshed BMW lineup. Other changes for the 2015 model year included an available rear-drive version of the 6-cylinder model, called the X6 sDrive35i; while the X6 xDrive50i’s 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 gained 45 hp for a total of 45 hp. The 2015 X6 also offered some new advanced technology features, including night vision with pedestrian and animal detection, a head-up display, and adaptive headlights.</p>, <p>BMW also revamped the X6 M (and its X5 M sibling) for 2015. Powered by an uprated version of the last X6 M's V-8 engine, this new version has become the quickest X6 yet. Output now stands at 567 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque. All of that is put to the ground through an 8-speed automatic equipped with launch control and standard all-wheel drive. It offers the torque vectoring differential as standard equipment.</p>, <p>In addition to the X6 M, BMW is offering a full complement of M Performance parts for the X6. Items include purely aesthetic upgrades, aero kits, wheels, interior trim, and suspension parts.</p>, <p>The 2015 model arrived in U.S. showrooms in late 2014. The 2016 version offered few changes. For 2017, BMW added its touchscreen version of iDrive in addition to the touch puck controller and in 2018 the automaker shuffled a few options around.</p>, <p><strong>BMW X6 history</strong></p>, <p>From its initial launch, the X6 was available in two configurations. The xDrive35i featured BMW's turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6, that generated 300 horsepower. The xDrive50i used a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 making 400 hp. Both used a 6-speed automatic transmission through 2010, and both sent power to all four wheels through a BMW xDrive all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>Subsequent model years saw the introduction of additional variants. First was the X6 M in 2009, which turned up the power by way of a re-engineered twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8, for a total of 555 hp. Upgraded suspension, larger wheels and tires, more capable brakes, and advanced performance-tuned traction and handling electronics combined to make an impressive performance vehicle despite its size and weight. For the 2010 model year, the ActiveHybrid X6 offered a combination of power and efficiency that erred on the side of performance. Rated at 480 hp, it was an upgrade of 80 hp over the standard V-8 X6, yet delivered one more mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>Upgrades for the 2011 model year saw the introduction of a new entry-level 6-cylinder engine that went to a single-turbo, twin-scroll configuration with direct injection that maintained the same performance levels as the previous twin-turbo engine while reducing complexity and cost. Also on the docket for the 2011 model was a three-passenger rear seat option, which increased the X6's capacity to five in total from the prior four-seat configuration. An 8-speed transmission became standard equipment for all but the X6 M, which retained its robust 6-speed drivetrain. The new 8-speed's smooth shifting and slightly improved fuel economy made it a noticeable upgrade.</p>, <p>The X6 returned for the 2012 model year, though the ActiveHybrid model was dropped from the lineup. None of the X6 family were particularly efficient, however, with ratings of 16 mpg city/23 mpg highway for the 2013 xDrive35i, 14/20 mpg for the xDrive50i, and thirsty 12/17 mpg ratings for the X6 M. For the 2013 model year, the X6 range received a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1072172_2013-bmw-x6-preview-new-m-performance-package-styles">mildly updated exterior look</a>, as well as an additional M Performance trim level, new paint colors, and available adaptive LED headlights. For the 2014 model year, the X6 saw only minor updates and equipment changes.</p>]

[<p>The BMW X1 is the smallest crossover SUV sold by the German automaker and related to the X2.</p>, <p>Introduced in 2012 as a rear-wheel-drive-based luxury crossover, the X1 is now in its second generation. This time it rides on a front-drive architecture borrowed from Mini, which makes it the first front-wheel-drive BMW. Both front- and all-wheel drive are available.</p>, <p>Rivals for the X1 include the Buick Encore, the Audi Q3, Acura RDX, and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. It even competes against the showroom against the X2.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_x1_2018">2018 BMW X1 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW X1</strong></p>, <p>With its recently redesigned X1, BMW finally has a subcompact SUV with usable interior space. It also features a more efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.</p>, <p>The second-generation X1 launched for 2016 with only all-wheel drive, but the 2017 model added a front-wheel-drive model.</p>, <p>The new X1 looks a bit more like a utility vehicle than the previous version. The new vehicle is almost two inches taller, and an extra inch of width and a 2-inch-wider track give the X1 a more rugged stance, but it manages to avoid typical macho tones.</p>, <p>Only one powertrain is offered. It's a 228-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters and three drive modes. BMW says it will accelerate to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds, and the EPA quotes a highway fuel economy rating of 32 mpg with front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The X1 has gutsy power, quick steering, and fairly agile handling, but it doesn't feel special like a traditional rear-drive BMW.</p>, <p>There's plenty of room for four adults, with ample head room all around and good leg room, especially with an optional reclining/sliding rear seat that has 5 inches of travel. The front seats are not impressive, though, lacking shape or support. Behind the rear seat, there is 27.1 cubic feet of cargo space; that expands to 58.7 cubic feet with the rear seat down. Those figures are good for the class.</p>, <p>The feds haven't yet tested the X1, but the IIHS gave the car "Good" ratings in all crash tests and an "Advanced" rating for its forward collision prevention system. A rearview camera was made standard for 2018. Other available safety features include lane departure warning, forward collision warnings, pedestrian detection with low speed braking, automatic high beams, front and rear obstacle detection, and a self parking system.</p>, <p>As an entry-level luxury vehicle, the X1 has a decent standard feature set, but the standard upholstery is synthetic leather. Buyers will want to option up the X1 with such features as leather upholstery, navigation, premium audio, and an M Sport package with sport-tuned transmission and suspension, sport seats, and a body kit. Be careful, though, as prices rise quickly.</p>, <p>While the larger X3 and X5 crossovers (as well as their X4 and X6 cousins) are built at the BMW plant in South Carolina, the X1 is imported from the company's Leipzig plant in Germany.</p>, <p><strong>BMW X1 history</strong></p>, <p>The X1 had been on sale for three years in other markets by the time it arrived in the U.S. late in 2012. Based on the previous-generation 3-Series wagon (of the time), the X1 borrowed the xDrive all-wheel-drive system from that car as well.</p>, <p>The first X1 bore a strong resemblance to the bigger X3, but the overall look was tauter and the vehicle was noticeably more compact. Inside, the front seats and the overall cockpit design were tailored to provide a good driving position.</p>, <p>The U.S. was the only market to get a 6-cylinder in addition to the 4-cylinder X1. Rear-wheel drive was standard on the 4-cylinder model, while the inline-6 was all-wheel-drive only. All configurations used an 8-speed automatic transmission. The rear-drive sDrive28i and all-wheel-drive xDrive28i were propelled by a 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, while the pricier xDrive35i used a 300-hp, 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6. BMW fitted the X1 with technology aimed at improving fuel economy—both an engine start-stop function and brake-energy regeneration.</p>, <p>There were very few changes to the X1 since its introduction. More of a special edition, the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1083944_2013-bmw-x1-powder-ride-edition-driven">2013 Powder Ride Edition</a> offered integrated overhead ski storage and special exterior graphics, among other dress-ups.</p>]

[<p>The BMW X2 compact crossover is a sleeker version of the X1 and blurs the line between butch hatchback and small SUV.</p>, <p>Together with the X1, the X2 provides an entry point for BMW crossovers, and both vehicles use a front-wheel-drive-based architecture borrowed from Mini, though all-wheel drive is also offered.</p>, <p>The X2 competes against the Mercedes-Benz GLA, Audi Q3, Jaguar E-Pace, Volvo XC40, and even BMW's own X1.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_x2_2018">2018 BMW X2 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>At 172.2 inches from bumper-to-bumper, the X2 is 3.2 inches shorter than the X1 and its roofline is 2.8 inches lower. While the X1 casts a more conventional crossover shadow, the X2's roof slopes more noticeably aft of the passenger compartment. Its most unique design element is arguably the rearmost roof pillar, a hefty chunk of sheet metal formed in the brand's Hofmeister kink and emblazoned with the signature blue-and-white roundel, a first for a BMW crossover.</p>, <p>But the X2's design changes over the X1 aren't limited to its roof. Unlike the approach BMW took with its X4 and X6 compared to their roomier X3 and X5 siblings, the X2 features its own front and rear fascias and considerable dark-gray painted trim with the M Sport X package. Park the two together and their detail changes are obvious, particularly the large twin kidney grille on the X2 flanked by standard LED headlights.</p>, <p>Inside, the X2 shares most of its design and trim elements with the X1. With the second row upright, cargo space maxes out at 21.6 cubic feet. Fold the three-piece rear bench and that room grows to a hair over 50 cubes. Those figures are down about 6 and 8 cubic feet over the X1, respectively. That's the price you'll pay for the X2's sleeker styling, but the X2 still has more cargo space than its Mercedes and Audi competitors.</p>, <p>BMW's iDrive infotainment displays through a standard 6.5-inch screen that's upgradeable to a hefty 8.8-inch display. A head-up display is optional, as is Apple CarPlay compatibility.</p>, <p>Synthetic leather upholstery is standard and BMW offers real leather in five shades as an option. Glossy black, aluminum, and matte wood trim finishes are available as well. A panoramic moonroof is also on the options list. With standard front-wheel drive, the X2 sDrive runs about $37,000.</p>, <p>Under the X2's hood sits BMW's 2.0-liter turbo-4 rated at 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. Paired to a standard 8-speed automatic with three modes (Comfort, Eco Pro, and Sport), the inline-4 is good for a 0-60 mph sprint of 6.3 seconds, according to BMW. All-wheel drive is optional, but the system apportions most of its power to the front wheels on dry roads. A multi-plate clutch helps send power rearward when needed.</p>, <p>Though its 7.2 inches of ground clearance and hefty overhangs will limit its off-road usefulness, the X2 is available with hill-descent control.</p>, <p>On the safety front, the X2 offers lane-departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, and adaptive cruise control that can bring the vehicle to a halt and start it up again.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_i8
[<p>The BMW i8 is a two-door sports car with a conscience.</p>, <p>With the i8, BMW looks at the future of the supercar and recasts it for an energy-conscious age. No twin-turbo V-10 engines here; the i8 sports a 1.5-liter 3-cylinder engine shared with the Mini lineup, and combines it with batteries and electric motors for a total output of 357 horsepower.</p>, <p>Its lightweight construction and all-wheel-drive system serves two masters: near-sportscar performance with relatively low energy consumption. It does either task in equal turns, if that's what you're into.</p>, <p>The i8 has remained largely unchanged after a short 2014 model year. In 2017, a striking Protonic Red edition with various trim accents is newly available. The year before, BMW got permission to offer its laser headlights, which are breathtakingly effective.</p>, <p>The 2019 model year brings a new Spyder model to the lineup. The convertible model sports a small retractable-hardtop panel for open-air driving.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_i8_2017" title="2017 BMW i8 - review">2017 BMW i8 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The i8 is the second vehicle to come out of the automaker's "i" sub-brand, following the i3 city car to market. The i8 can be considered the current technology flagship for BMW and with a base price of more than $140,000 its near the tops for entry price as well.</p>, <p>Though the two are related in some ways, the i8 coupe appeals to a different audience than the i3—those who want fast performance in a light car without the bulk and fuel consumption of a V-8 or V-10 engine. It's less practical than the i3 of course, and uses the weight savings and other technologies for a combination of performance and efficiency. </p>, <p>First unveiled as the Vision EfficientDynamics concept car at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, the i8 sports coupe is fitted with two entirely separate powertrains. Up front, an electric motor draws energy from a battery pack to drive the front wheels; a 1.5-liter turbo-3 powers the rear wheels.</p>, <p>Two years later, the car had evolved into the BMW i8 Concept, which appeared at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. The company has also shown an i8 Concept Spyder, indicating that the i8 may be offered both as a fixed-roof coupe and an open-air convertible—although the droptop version may be a few years out.</p>, <p>For the 2011 car, which was much closer to the production version, the original concept's diesel engine had been replaced by a gasoline engine. That is BMW's new 1.5-liter 3-cylinder engine, which is used in the new generation of Mini Coopers and pegged for a new front-wheel-drive BMW model.</p>, <p>The i8 uses a 7.1-kwh lithium-ion battery pack that runs between the two seats; its low placement keeps the center of gravity close to the ground for better handling. The i8 can travel at moderate speeds for as many as 20 miles on its electric charge, with a 129-hp motor driving the front wheels. Once the pace picks up, and in certain modes, the 3-cylinder engine sends 228 hp and 236 pound-feet of torque to the rear wheels. When the two power sources combine, total output reaches 357 hp, and the i8 is able to accelerate to 60 mph in a claimed 4.4 seconds. Its top speed is limited to 155 mph.</p>, <p>For maximum acceleration and output, both powertrains can operate in concert, making the i8 an all-wheel-drive coupe that some have called a "supercar." In this mode, the i8 becomes what engineers call a "through-the-road" hybrid, meaning that each powertrain operates a different set of wheels. Though the powertrains don't share an axle, the electric motor is tuned to make up the power lost during the gasoline engine's gear changes, ensuring a smooth and continuous flow of power.</p>, <p>The i8 is a very different take on a two-door sports car, and its looks are easily as groundbreaking as the power concept. The i8 borrows many cues from a recent concept that was itself an homage to the M1 supercar. There is also design language and some specific elements shared with the i3 EV that's launching alongside it, but the two are strikingly different. Where the i3 five-door is tall and large inside, with a stubby footprint, the i8 is low, sleek, and sexy, with beautiful flowing details along its flanks that culminate in a cantilevered wave over the rear haunches. The i3, on the other hand, is meant to move people and stuff in comfort throughout urban areas, packing an underfloor battery that will allow 80-100 miles of EV driving per charge.</p>, <p>Both cars are built in two parts: an aluminum platform holds the battery, electric motor, and other powertrain components, while a body shell made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic sits on top. The combination is light, durable and cutting-edge. The total weight of the BMW i8 is 3,455 pounds.</p>, <p>To go along with the nonstandard powertrain, BMW offers the i8 in different "Worlds" instead of what would normally be referred to as trim levels. Basically design-and-options packages, the worlds act like curated paths for the buyer to follow. At the top, the Pure Impulse world includes all of the otherwise optional features, with a final price just north of $150,000.</p>, <p>After a brief 2014 model year, the i8 returned for 2015 with one small change: Comfort Access has now been made standard on all models. For 2016, laser headlights were made available on American-market cars.</p>]

[<p>The BMW M3 is the performance compact four-door sedan that launched a cult for BMW. It's a fast, trackable, powerful, but comfortable and convenient car.</p>, <p>Only offered as a sedan, the M3 previously had been available as a two-door coupe or convertible—but never a wagon. It's been an icon for decades, with a wide span of powertrains that have included inline-6, V-8, and now a turbo-6.</p>, <p>Available as a sedan, the M3 lineup used to include two-door coupes and convertibles as well. In recent years, those models were spun off into a separate M4 model that's the same under the skin as the M3.</p>, <p>In the 2018 model year, it added a standard rearview camera, a touchscreen for its infotainment system, and swapped its xenon headlights for LEDs. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_m3_2018">2018 BMW M3 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>With the M3, BMW has a rival for some of the best cars on the road including the Cadillac ATS-V, the Mercedes-AMG C63, the Audi S4, and the Lexus RC F.</p>, <p><strong>The new BMW M3</strong></p>, <p>Today's M3 was new for the 2015 model year. For 2015, BMW refocused the M3 on performance, keeping its weight in line while giving it a leaner, touring-car-champion driving feel. The key piece of equipment was the new twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6. It produces 425 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque, revs to 7,600 rpm, and carries its peak output from 5,500 rpm to 7,300 rpm.</p>, <p>To go along with the new engine, BMW developed a new rear differential, called the Active M Differential. The system is able to vary its locking percentage from one wheel to the other between 0 and 100, all within milliseconds. The variable locking helps improve traction, allows the car to rotate nicely in turns, and put the most power down in a straight line. Coupled to the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, the current M3 leaps to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds, or 4.1 seconds with the standard 6-speed manual. Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph.</p>, <p>A lighter chassis also helps the new M3's overall performance. Up to 176 pounds lighter than its predecessor, the M3 makes more extensive use of aluminum, including in the front fenders and hood, as well as carbon fiber in the trunk lid, driveshaft, and roof—a first for the M3 sedan. An Adaptive M suspension system offers Comfort, Sport, and Sport+ modes that are made possible by variable-rate dampers. The same three mode settings also control the electric power steering in all M3s, increasing or decreasing the steering force and feedback to suit the mission.</p>, <p>The M3 received some mild updates for 2016, coinciding with changes being made across the 3-Series line. The front and rear fascias were tweaked, and the taillights became LEDs arranged in an L shape. Keyless access, satellite radio with a one-year subscription, and a Harman Kardon sound system were now standard equipment. Inside, it got additional touches of chrome, ambient lighting around the center stack, and new navigation unit hardware with faster startup, over-the-air map updates, better overall performance, and more realistic presentation of city details.</p>, <p>In 2017, BMW made standard its Adaptive M suspension and added an available Competition package to boost horsepower from 425 hp to 444 hp. According to BMW, the package shaves a tenth of a second off the 0-60 mph time and includes beefed up suspension components, a quicker steering ratio, new settings for the stability control and Active M Differential, 20-inch wheels, blacked-out badges and grille, and lightweight seats. </p>, <p><strong>BMW M3 history</strong></p>, <p>It all started with the E30 edition of the BMW 3-Series in 1986. That original M3 was a small, relatively light two-door coupe (and later a convertible in other markets). Power came from a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder, and though output hovered around 200 hp—with most of that delivered near peak engine speeds—the car quickly won fans and followers. The E30 M3 was only offered with a manual transmission. It saw wide use in racing, which continues to this day in vintage circles.</p>, <p>
The second generation of the M3 arrived along with the next generation of the 3-Series: the E36. Bowing in 1992, the new model upgraded to a 3.0-liter inline-6 (and then expanded to 3.2 liters in 1996) rated at 240 hp. A sedan version of the M3 was introduced for the E36 generation. Both 5-speed manual and automatic transmissions were available. That model ran through 1999.</p>, <p>
In late 2000, the E46 M3 came on the scene, with a much more potent 3.2-liter S54 inline-6 rated at 333 hp. It offered a choice of the 6-speed manual transmission or a new, stiff-shifting SMG automatic transmission with a single electrohydraulic clutch, and steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.</p>, <p>
Next came the E90-series (E90, E92, and E93) M3, first sold in 2007. A V-8 engine, displacing 4.0 liters and generating 414 hp, raised M3 performance to new levels. At the same time, the E90 M3 gained considerable weight, pushing it more into the realm of grand tourer than sports car. A wave of technology also brought the M3 more fully into the modern era, with advanced traction and stability-control programs to enhance performance, a new optional dual-clutch transmission, and other advances. A number of special editions were offered, primarily in the form of appearance packages. The overall level of the M3's luxury and equipment also rose with this generation, wrapping in more advanced navigation, entertainment, and creature comforts. The fourth M3 was offered here as a coupe, sedan, and hardtop convertible.</p>]

[<p>The BMW M2 is a two-door sports car based on the automaker's 2-Series range of coupes.</p>, <p>Introduced for the 2016 model year, the M2 is the follow-up to the low-volume BMW 1-Series M coupe. It's also a spiritual successor to the vaunted E30 M3 coupe from the 1980s.</p>, <p>With the M2, BMW has rivals for the Audi S3/RS 3 and Mercedes-AMG CLA45.

It was first unveiled at the 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit and went on sale later that year.</p>, <p>Starting with a 2-Series as the base, the M2 gets flared fenders to handle wider tires and axles. The overall effect is a stubby two-door coupe that looks visually distinct from the rest of the 2-Series range, but isn't as aggressive as the M3 or M4.</p>, <p>Powered by a turbocharged inline-6 that made 365 hp at 6,500 rpm and 343 lb-ft of torque between 1,400 and 5,600 rpm, the M2 isn't as heavily armed as its bigger brothers either. An overboost function raises torque to 369 lb-ft between 1,450 and 4,750 rpm and a precise 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic handles shifting duties.</p>, <p>According to BMW, the M2 can run up to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds with the DCT or 4.4 seconds with the manual.</p>, <p>Unlike many modern performance cars—and most BMW performance cars—the M2 lacks an adjustable suspension and infinite settings for throttle and steering. Most of the car's charms are in its simplicity and its ability to predictably run and gun without much fuss.</p>, <p>An Active M Differential resides at the rear. It is a multi-plate limited-slip differential that’s electronically controlled. It can fully lock in just 150 milliseconds, helping prevent excess wheelspin for the inside wheel in a turn or when one wheel is on a slicker surface.</p>, <p>As charming as the M2 is during performance driving, it doesn't try to charm everyone. Its ride can feel jittery on mottled surfaces, even though it seems to take some of the hardest impacts from the pavement in stride. And road noise is an ever-present whoosh on smooth highways, more of a boom as the surfaces are coarser.</p>, <p>The interior is a mixed bag of performance materials, cost-cutting surfaces, and some oddities. Standard M buckets make their appearance in the M2, along with BMW's customary iDrive and controller, but the instrument cluster isn't much different from a 2-Series short of a couple M badges and the driver's seat is oddly canted toward the left—a byproduct of the car's production process kept to keep costs low. As a result, the BMW M2 costs about $54,000 to start, which made its intoxicating performance accessible to many—with plenty of character along the way.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the M2 added an M Driver's package that included an increased top speed of 168 mph and a day at a BMW performance driving school. For 2018, the adaptive xenon headlights become LEDs and a rearview camera becomes standard.</p>]

[<p>The BMW 7-Series is a full-size, luxury four-door sedan that's the luxury flagship of the BMW lineup. </p>, <p>It has been a stalwart for the automaker, spanning six generations, and has been offered with a wide range of engines. This generation is no different: it's available with a plug-in hybrid turbo-4, all the way up to a fire-breathing twin-turbo V-12 that produces 600 horsepower.</p>, <p>With the 7-Series, BMW shows off everything it's capable of doing as a car company. Carried over for the 2017 model year, mostly, the 7er offers a lineup that includes the V-12-powered M760i xDrive, the performance-oriented BMW ALPINA B7, an all-wheel drive 740i (740i xDrive), and the 740e xDrive iPerformance plug-in hybrid. Prices easily soar above $150,000.</p>, <p>Rivals include the Audi A8, the Jaguar XJ, and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.  </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111526_2018-bmw-7-series">2018 BMW 7-Series review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW 7-Series</strong></p>, <p>A sixth-generation version of the BMW 7-Series arrived for the 2016 model year. It placed supreme importance on weight reduction and took advantage of carbon-fiber expertise gained from the company's work on the i3 and i8 electrified vehicles. Lighter weight materials such as aluminum, magnesium, and composites cut nearly 300 pounds from the overall mass.</p>, <p>There's already a range of powertrains for the new 7-Series, including turbocharged inline-6, V-8, and V-12 engines, plus the turbo-4-powered plug-in hybrid. The 740i and 740i xDrive have an inline-6, while the 750i, 750i xDrive, and ALPINA B7 xDrive have twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8s. The B7 xDrive also has Integral Active Steering, which combines variable ratio electric steering system at the front axle with active steering on the rear axle. It can get to 60 mph in just 3.6 seconds and has various other performance upgrades. The M760i xDrive features a V-12 making 600 hp and 590 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>The new plug-in hybrid 740e xDrive iPerformance model teams a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with a 111-hp electric motor and a 9.4 kwh lithium-ion battery pack for a total of 332 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. It has 14 miles of all-electric range, a 64 MPGe rating, and a 27 mpg combined city/highway rating from the EPA.</p>, <p>The latest 7-Series adds many new features, including the ability to park and retrieve itself from tight spots with the driver outside the vehicle. The iDrive infotainment interface also gains a touchscreen—finally—in addition to the now-customary controller and touchpad.</p>, <p>There's a possibility the new 7er will get an ultra-luxury model to sit above the V-12 model and below the 7-Series-based Rolls-Royce Ghost sedan; this new model would go after the recently unveiled Mercedes-Maybach S-Class.</p>, <p><strong>BMW 7-Series hi</strong><strong>story</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The first 7-Series was introduced in 1977 and was sold through the 1986 model year. A large, roomy four-door, the original "7er" came to America in three versions: 733i, 735i, and L7. The U.S. models were outfitted with power features, leather and wood trim, and a sunroof, as well as bigger bumpers to satisfy crash requirements, and they were marketed as luxurious competitors to the most expensive Mercedes four-doors. Some versions of the European-market, turbocharged 745i were sold in the U.S. in the gray market—technically not illegal, but not imported by BMW itself. The L7 was a version of the 735i fitted with more leather trim and more standard features, as well as an automatic transmission and a driver-side airbag—making it the first vehicle sold in America with that safety feature.</p>, <p>For the second-generation 7-Series, which was sold from 1987 to 1994, BMW added a new engine. The 730i sported a 3.0-liter inline-6; the 735i carried on with its 3.5-liter inline-6; and the new 750i arrived with a 300-hp V-12 under its hood. The new sedan's styling was more sleek and yet still dynamic, with the quintessential BMW twin-kidney grille tilted forward at the front and inside, a functional—almost austere—cockpit that still featured a manual gearbox on some versions. An "L" version added length to the wheelbase, and late in life the 7-Series gained a new 3.0-liter inline-6 and a 4.0-liter V-8.</p>, <p>The third-generation 7er underwent a styling change that brought clean and crisp styling that some found underwhelming. That said, the 1994-2001 7-Series still looks fresh today. This generation did without 6-cylinder power, instead offering 740i and 740Li models initially featuring a 4.0-liter V-8 and later receiving a 4.4-liter replacement. There was also a V-12-powered 750Li. These cars all used a 5-speed automatic. The third-gen 7-Series was treated to the usual mid-cycle face lift and also had a brief role in the 1997 film "Tomorrow Never Dies," where James Bond drives the car remotely using an early smartphone.</p>, <p>The fourth-generation 7-Series changed dramatically, and with that change came controversy. This 7-Series, sold until 2008, brought with it a radically "flame-surfaced" style that was said to have been a response by chief designer Chris Bangle to a BMW board demand that their cars become more expressive. Expressive they were, but critics contended the high roofline, big glass areas, and oddly tiered styling didn't work well, and disrupted the company's focus on "Ultimate Driving Machines." BMW would go on to sell more of this generation 7-Series than any before, but sales grew thanks to expansion in new markets, particularly China. Over its lifespan, this generation would include short- and long-wheelbase variants, rear- and all-wheel-drive versions, but no manual-gearbox versions.</p>, <p>Perhaps the most disliked feature of the new 7-Series was iDrive. BMW pioneered the round controller on the center console, which takes the place of dozens of buttons and switches in its cockpits. iDrive proved difficult for many users to master, even with haptic feedback and a large LCD screen for navigation. Changing radio stations could be an exercise in frustration; even redundant voice controls for the car's navigation system proved to be a hurdle. Widespread dissatisfaction with both the car's styling and iDrive didn't temper enthusiasm for its handling nor for its brisk acceleration, however. In 2006, BMW upgraded the V-8 engine to a 4.8-liter version with 360 hp, and changed the car's nomenclature to 750i/750Li. It had boosted the V-12 to 6.0 liters and 438 hp in 2004, making it the 760Li. In 2007 it reintroduced an ALPINA B7 with the 4.4-liter V-8, with output rated at 500 hp.</p>, <p>BMW introduced the fifth-generation version of the 7-Series in 2009. With a revamped look that greatly muted the prior car's humps and crests, the new car turned out much more attractive, particularly inside, where iDrive lost the battle to control every function, and the dash was clarified into a more logical, handsome piece. The iDrive system itself received an entire rethink, more logical action, with intuitive icons, along with more redundant buttons that "bookmarked" settings for audio, climate, and navigation—whatever the driver's preference. Performance came initially from a range of V-8 engines for the first model year, with a 6-speed automatic the norm in the 750i and long-wheelbase 750Li; for the 2010 model year, BMW added 6- and 12-cylinder (740 and 760) versions, as well as a hybrid teamed with lithium-ion batteries, and new all-wheel-drive versions—and wait, there was also a new ALPINA edition. The V-12 version brought with it a new 8-speed automatic transmission, which eventually made its way through to the rest of the lineup. BMW also offered bulletproof versions of that latest 7.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_7-series_2013">2013 BMW 7-Series lineup</a> brought <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1076474_2013-bmw-7-series-preview">an extensive mid-cycle refresh</a>. While the exterior design didn't change significantly (a new grille and front fascia were the most noticeable parts), the 2013 7-Series sedans packed next-generation turbocharged V-8 engines in the 750i variants, plus xDrive all-wheel drive offered on most of the lineup and an 8-speed automatic for all models, with both power and fuel economy figures rising for all of these models. Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system arrived for these models; iDrive received a revised menu structure and voice-command system, while the navigation system offered faster rendering and 3D maps. Also in 2013, BMW <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079079_2013-bmw-760li-v-12-25-years-anniversary-edition-sells-out">very quickly sold out</a> of a limited-edition <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079021_bmw-celebrates-25-years-of-v-12s-with-special-edition-760li">25th anniversary version of the 2013 BMW 7-Series</a>, and rumors of a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079408_bmw-m-performance-7-series-to-be-named-m750i">possible M Performance version</a> began to stir.</p>, <p>The 2014 model year saw few changes to the 7-Series line. For 2015, BMW left most things alone again but added a diesel model, the 740Ld. Only available as a long-wheelbase sedan, the compression-ignition 7er drew its power from a 255-hp turbodiesel inline-6 with 413 lb-ft of torque. LED headlights were available on the 2015 model.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_m4
[<p>The BMW M4 two-door sports coupe may be a newcomer the German automaker's family of high-performance vehicles, but it's not a new concept. In 2015, BMW split its 3-Series sedans and wagons off from their coupe and convertible kin—and rechristened the two-doors the 4-Series.</p>, <p>In 2015, the M3 coupe became the M4, which is the pinnacle of the 4-Series lineup. Along with the new badge, the M4 has a new body, suspension setup, and powertrain. The coupe was quickly joined by a convertible version. </p>, <p>BMW made only very minor changes to the M4 for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read</strong></em> <em><strong>our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_m4_2018">2018 BMW M4 review</a><br/></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW M4</strong></p>, <p>The M4's twin-turbocharged, inline-6 recalls some of the M3 coupe's history, as several generations used 6-cylinder engines in the past. This six puts out 425 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque, offering a very wide powerband thanks to the twin turbochargers. The two-door M car once again offers a choice between a 6-speed manual transmission and the latest version of BMW's M-DCT dual-clutch automatic.</p>, <p>An M Active Differential in the rear can vary locking between 0 and 100 percent, doing so in just milliseconds, to help the car put down power no matter the situation. The company 0 to 60 mph of 3.9 seconds for the M4 when equipped with the M-DCT transmission. Top speed is limited electronically to 155 mph. Like the M3 coupe before it, the M4 hardtop is available with a carbon-fiber roof to further save weight. This generation M4 is lighter than the last, but the coupe body style adds more than 500 pounds.</p>, <p>That convertible retained a retractable hardtop design. The top stows neatly in just 20 seconds—as well as a standard wind blocker—the convertible allows top-down enjoyment with nearly the same driving experience as the M4 coupe. With available neck warmers, folding rear seats, a ski pass-through, and a cargo shelf, you won't make any big sacrifices in versatility in the convertible, while performance numbers are nearly as good, although weight will be a bit higher as a result of the top and its mechanism.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, BMW only made minor adjustments to the M4's features and equipment packages. Both body styles gained keyless access, a Harmon Kardon sound system, and a year of satellite radio; the convertible model added a pass-through for the trunk.</p>, <p>For 2017, BMW made standard its Adaptive M suspension in the M4 and added an available Competition package that boosts output to 444 hp.</p>, <p><strong>BMW M4/M3 history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>Before the switch to the 4-Series name, the M3 coupe and convertible were some of the hallmark efforts from BMW's M Division. The BMW M3 was first launched to the world as a coupe in 1985 with the now-famed E30 model. Packing a high-revving, peaky 2.3-liter 4-cylinder normally aspirated engine, the original M3 made 192 horsepower (for models with the catalytic converter). Despite the modest-by-today's-standards output, the car's relatively low curb weight (about 2,800 pounds) made it quick, and its M-tuned suspension made it handle impressively, too.</p>, <p>An "Evolution" version (offered in Europe only) of that first M3 was available with an extra 25 horsepower, lighter glass and bodywork, and unique aerodynamics. This M3, the ur-M3 as it were, was only available as a two-door coupe in the U.S., though Europeans also had the choice of a two-door convertible. The E30 M3 was only sold with a standard-pattern manual transmission in the U.S.</p>, <p>
BMW's next generation of the M3 coupe didn't arrive in the U.S. until 1995, with the E36 generation of the 3-Series. This time around, the M3 was also available as a convertible and as a four-door sedan, but those were only part of the major changes to the M3. Riding on an entirely new (and considerably heavier, at more than 3,200 pounds) chassis, the E36 M3 was also significantly more powerful, rating 240 hp and 240 pound-feet of torque from either a 3.0-liter inline-6 (1995 only) or a 3.2-liter version of the same engine (1996–1999). The 3.2-liter engine scored the same horsepower rating, but torque rose to 240 lb-ft from the 3.0-liter's 225 lb-ft of twist. A 5-speed manual gearbox was standard.</p>, <p>
The third generation of the M3, the E46 generation, arrived in the U.S. in 2001. A new chassis underpinned the car, and the engine was upgraded, this time using a 3.2-liter inline-6 rated at 333 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque. The weight of the new M3 grew with its power, now up to about 3,450 pounds. The E46 car came with a standard 6-speed manual but was also available with a single-clutch SMG (sequential manual gearbox) transmission, which basically automated the clutch and gear shifting for quicker responses and an automatic mode.</p>, <p>
For the fourth generation of the M3, BMW decided to add two more cylinders once again, but this time, in a V-configuration. The new 4.0-liter V-8 put out 414 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. Once again, the extra power was needed to combat the extra weight, since the E92 M3 Coupe tipped the scales at 3,483 pounds. In addition to the first V-8 for the M3, the E92 generation also offered the first dual-clutch transmission for the model, a 7-speed M-DCT. Real-world testing showed the fourth-gen M3 coupe could hit 60 mph in under four seconds when equipped with the new M-DCT gearbox, though BMW's claimed estimate was 4.5 seconds with the M-DCT and 4.7 seconds with the 6-speed manual.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_4-series
[<p>The BMW 4-Series is a line of mid-size luxury sedans, coupes, or convertibles that is related to the 3-Series.</p>, <p>As new as it is, the 4-Series still draws its lineage and design cues from the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_3-series">3-Series family</a> that has been in production for decades—and like those cars can even trace its roots back to the famed 2002 models.</p>, <p>With the 4-Series, BMW has a rival for cars such as the Audi A5, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe, and the two-door Cadillac ATS.</p>, <p>For 2018, BMW changed the front and rear bumpers and stiffened the 4-Series suspension for a sportier ride.</p>, <p><em><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1108539_2018-bmw-4-series">2018 BMW 4-Series review</a></strong></em></em></p>, <p>When the 4-Series was new for 2014, it included models with 4- and 6-cylinder engines. In due time, those were joined by an M4 model, as well as a sleek sedan spin-off, the 4-Series Gran Coupe. For 2017, the lineup sees the arrival of two new engines—and the nomenclature to match. Last year's 428i becomes 430i and the 435i is now known as the 440i.</p>, <p>At first, the 4-Series lineup consisted only of two-door versions of the latest 3-Series sedan. Sculpted front fenders and far more aggressive styling treatments for the front and rear give this model more of a high-performance look compared to the 3-Series, while the smoothly arched roofline matches up well with a taller greenhouse. As with the latest 3-Series, the 4's cabin is a bit roomier than in the coupe it replaces, although the 4-Series models get a new 2+2 layout, with bucket seats in back. The 4-Series gets seriously charming with its more ritzy interior trim packages (although perhaps too splashy in others that attempt to be sporty or ultra-modern), and its seats give grip just where it's called for in sporty driving. The backseat is somewhere we'd stay out of, which admittedly is often the case with small two-doors.</p>, <p>At launch, the engine lineup included both the 240-hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 and the 3.0-liter turbo inline-6, in 428i and 435i models—both with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. Rear-wheel-drive and xDrive all-wheel-drive models are a part of the mix, and the 4-Series gets BMW's latest electric power steering system, tuned slightly differently from how it is in the 3-Series for a more sporting feel.</p>, <p>Despite significant gains in comfort, safety (as already proven in crash-test ratings), and fuel economy (of up to 34 mpg highway)—and despite an ever-greater number of high-tech options—the 4-Series cars remain among the most confident, dynamically engaging models in their class. Name change aside, the 4-Series continues as the yard stick by which others in the segment are measured.</p>, <p>For the 2015 model year, the Gran Coupe edition arrived, as did the fearsome <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_m4">BMW M4</a> coupe and convertible, which carry the torch for the former two-door M3 performance variants. The Gran Coupe, like the 6-Series version, is a sort of coupe-sedan, although the 4-Series Gran Coupe is actually a hatchback, while the 6-Series has a conventional trunk.</p>, <p>The new M4 is powered by a twin-turbo version of the classic inline-6 that makes 425 hp. It's one of the best-driving BMWs in recent memory, making improvements over the last-generation M3 coupe and adding more power to boot. Its hugely upgraded power comes with a choice between 6-speed manual and 7-speed M Double Clutch gearboxes. With an available Active M limited-slip differential, and an available Adaptive M suspension, the newest BMW M4 takes after the larger M6 in ride and sophistication, yet it keeps its weight down, to enable a supercar-league 0-60 mph time of just 4.2 seconds (in DCT form).</p>, <p>The rest of the 4-Series lineup saw some minor changes for 2015, mostly dealing with interior trim and feature availability. Notably, Bluetooth audio streaming was made standard across the board, and the so-called Enhanced Bluetooth (with a USB port) is now a standalone $500 option.</p>, <p>Changes announced for the 2016 3-Series migrated to the 4-Series for 2017. They included a new turbocharged six to replace the 335i's N55 engine. This new engine, dubbed B58, makes 320 hp. The entry-level 430i, meanwhile, saw its new 4-cylinder rated at 248 hp compared to last year's 240 ponies. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_2-series
[<p>The BMW 2-Series is a family of compact two-door coupe and convertible models, with rear-wheel drive, reasonably luxurious interiors, comprehensive feature sets, and sporty driving manners.</p>, <p>For 2018, the BMW 2-Series stays largely the same following an engine shuffling last year.</p>, <p>The current 2-Series is the spiritual successor—perhaps not the lineal successor—to the vaunted BMW 2002 that catapulted the automaker into America as a luxury brand.</p>, <p>Although technically it’s the 3-Series that’s the descendant of that enthusiast icon, the 2-Series comes closest to its size, simplicity, and sharp, communicative driving experience. With the 2-Series, BMW has a competitor for the Mercedes-Benz CLA, Audi A3, and Acura ILX, yet it’s the only model among those peers to have an entirely two-door lineup.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111108_2018-bmw-2-series">2018 BMW 2-Series review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW 2-Series</strong></p>, <p>Prior to the current generation of the 2-Series, this model line, as it’s sold in the U.S., was called the 1-Series. Overseas, there’s a 2-Series Active Tourer model that’s unrelated to the rest of the 2-Series models and built on a separate front-wheel-drive platform.</p>, <p>The 2-Series was introduced for the 2014 model year, and while related to the 1-Series that preceded it arrived longer, wider, and better-proportioned than the 1-Series, as well as more upscale in its cabin appointments and better-handling than its predecessor.</p>, <p>There are 228i and M235i models, with the former featuring a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, making 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, and the latter getting a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 good for 320 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque. Most of the lineup offers a choice between a 6-speed manual and 8-speed automatic, although the BMW 228i Convertible model sticks with an automatic only.</p>, <p>BMW 228i models are available with all-wheel drive and can be optioned with an Adaptive M Suspension system including upgraded brakes, summer performance tires, and a stiffer, lowered suspension, as well as variable sport steering, while the M235i is the lean, engaging performance model of the lineup, offering steering and handling as fun and communicative as 3-Series models of the past and 0-60 mph times of 4.8 seconds (versus 5.4 for the 228i).</p>, <p>Across the lineup the 2-Series has ample front-seat space, with some cupholders and small storage spaces that BMW models haven’t always offered, yet back-seat space is definitely tight. Cargo space is decent, at 13.8 cubic feet, and the rear seats flip forward to access a pass-through. The top on Convertible models raises or lowers in just 20 seconds, at up to 30 mph.</p>, <p>The 2-Series definitely doesn’t heap on the comfort-oriented luxury items and tech features quite in the way that BMW’s other models do—it does a delicate dance in keeping lean and purposeful, yet luxurious—however you can get things like Harman Kardon premium audio and various appearance and performance packages; and BMW’s iDrive interface is included across the model line.</p>, <p>The BMW M2 arrived in 2016 after making its debut at the 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The M2 offers a 365-hp, 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 and a choice between a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. It accelerates to 60 mph in as little as 4.2 seconds and reaches an electronically limited 155 mph. Upgrades include lightweight 19-inch wheels, stouter disc brakes, a limited-slip differential, and a completely retuned suspension and steering system.</p>, <p>For 2017, the 228i and M235i became the 230i and M240i, respectively. The nomenclature change marks the arrival of new turbocharged 4- and 6-cylinder engines. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_m6
[<p>The BMW M6 is a high-performance luxury car, offered at times in coupe, convertible, and four-door sedan body styles.</p>, <p>The M6 has its origins in the 1980s, as does its M5 sibling. However, while the M5 has been a constant in the BMW lineup, the M6 has been sold more sporadically. It's appeared in the U.S. lineup in three distinct generations: from 1983 to 1989, from 2005 to 2010, and from 2012 to the present.</p>, <p>In 2018, BMW dropped the coupe and only offered the M6 in convertible and Gran Coupe body styles. The writing may be on the wall for the 6-Series in general; the automaker is preparing a long-legged two-door coupe in the form of the 8-Series, which may bow sometime in 2018.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_m6_2018">2018 BMW M6 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new BMW M6</strong></p>, <p>The current M6 brings the car into its third generation. Launched at the Geneva Motor Show in 2012, the F12/F13 M6 was available from the start in both coupe and convertible forms, with the drop-top gaining about 110 pounds in addition to its folding roof. An M6 Gran Coupe was added later, adapting the big engine to BMW's four-door coupe. Despite the coupe's more than 4,200-pound curb weight, the M6's potent 560-hp, 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine enables 0-60 mph runs in the low four-second range and an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph—which can be raised to 190 mph with the M Driver's Package. The dual-clutch, 7-speed M DCT transmission was standard in the first year, with a manual option added later.</p>, <p>
While the second-generation M6 wasn't well-loved for its aesthetic, the latest M6 has regained some of the E24's appeal, though in an entirely different manner. Large, wide, and low-slung, the new M6's look is tough and completely modern, inside and out. Despite the overarching differences in shape and style, some of the original M6's "shark nose" theme bleeds through.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1084733_2014-bmw-m6-gran-coupe-first-drive">BMW M6 Gran Coupe</a>, a new four-door coupe variant of the M6, was introduced to the fold in 2013 as a 2014 model. Widely praised for its handsome looks and long, lean proportions, the M6 Gran Coupe shares its specification and most of its design details with the two-door coupe.</p>, <p>The F12 M6 coupe and F13 convertible saw a few updates for the 2014 model year. The 6-speed manual became available on all M6 models, while M-branded carbon-ceramic brake rotors also were added to the options sheet. The carbon rotors are lighter than their steel counterparts and also resist fade better under heavy use, such as in a track situation.</p>, <p>For 2015, the entire 6-Series lineup was refreshed, and that applied to the M6 as well. While the standard sedans, coupes, and convertibles received a more substantial update, the M6 models skipped the new front end and instead made do with new headlight elements. The interior was massaged a bit, and several infotainment features were modified or added.</p>, <p>The 2016 and 2017 versions were largely unchanged from 2015.</p>, <p><strong>BMW M6 history</strong></p>, <p>The first generation of the M6, known to BMW aficionados as the E24, was the only model to offer a manual transmission until the most recent M6 added the option in 2013. This original M6 was widely praised for its aggressive "shark nose" styling, its handling, and its level of luxury equipment. Upgrades from the standard E24 6-Series included the M88/3 engine, rated at 256 horsepower in the U.S., a revised bodywork package including a larger front air dam and rear spoiler, BBS wheels, and M badges. Acceleration was a bit less than brisk by modern standards, with the M6 officially hitting 60 mph in 6.8 seconds, though contemporary tests often showed the car to be more in the low-six-second range.</p>, <p>For the second-generation E63/64 M6, which arrived after more than a decade's hiatus, BMW used the powertrain from the M5. This 500-hp, 5.0-liter S85 V-10 engine was matched with the SMG III semi-automatic single-clutch gearbox, enabling 0-60 mph times of 4.4 seconds and a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph. A cabriolet (convertible) version of the M6 was also offered in addition to the coupe.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_x4
[<p>The BMW X4 is a coupe-like crossover supplement to the brand's similarly sized X3 SUV. Both share drivetrains and general dimensions, but the X4's sleeker roofline gives it a more dramatic profile.</p>, <p>It's the same idea applied to BMW's larger SUVs—the X5 and the derivative X6.</p>, <p>Like the X6, the X4 asks for compromises for its seductive shape. Interior space isn't as plentiful as the related X3, and rear vision is compromised because of the hatch's deeply sloped rear end.</p>, <p>With the X4, BMW has a rival for SUVs such as the Porsche Macan and Range Rover Evoque, and perhaps the Mercedes GLC.</p>, <p>A new version of the X4 is on the way for the 2019 model year.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1113391_2018-bmw-x4">2018 BMW X4 review</a></em><br/></strong></p>, <p>The new X4 shares the mid-size X3's mechanicals, but wraps them in a sleeker shape, one with a sporty stance and a lower roofline—and less cargo room in back. It also has a slightly sportier tune than its conventionally shaped sibling.</p>, <p>While the X4 doesn't have much different a footprint from the X3, BMW says its owners see it very differently—as a design statement. The X4 is 1.3 inches wider, 1.5 inches lower, and exactly the same length as the X3, but the proportions are very different, as are many of the details.</p>, <p>The X4's low, arched roof earns it its claim to coupe-likeness, while strong, dynamic character lines along the side add further hints of athleticism not normally seen on crossovers. At the nose of the X4, you'll find a very familiar version of BMW styling, with SUV cues, including a set of wide, deep air inlets, an apparent skidplate (or skidplate-mimicking design), and, of course, the signature kidney grilles. The headlights of the X4—twin round units—are quite dramatic, and complemented by LED fog lamps. Toward the rear, the X4 has the "signature swage line" alongside—split in two here, for a more dynamic look—while in back the X4 is probably at its most conventional, with a treatment that looks quite car-like, only lifted upward.</p>, <p>BMW offered three powertrains in the X4, all with standard with xDrive all-wheel drive. The xDrive28i is powered by a turbocharged 240-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, while the xDrive35i model uses a turbocharged 300-hp, 3.0-liter inline-6. All X4s get an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission that provides smooth and quick shifts just like it does in many other BMW models.</p>, <p>For 2017, BMW dropped the xDrive35i in favor of a much brighter performance version, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1093743_2016-bmw-x4-m40i-m-performance-model-makes-debut">uprated and upgraded BMW X4 M40i</a>. It presses the turbo-6 for another 55 hp, bringing the total to 355 hp, and bumps torque to 343 pound-feet. With a standard 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive, the new model's good for a 0-60 mph run in 4.7 seconds, and a governed top speed of 150 mph. There's a unique calibration for the all-wheel-drive system and the automatic; a distinct sport suspension tune; more responsive steering; 20-inch wheels and tires; and a sport-tuned exhaust system with a resonator that pumps some engine noise into the cabin. The cockpit also gets a leather steering wheel, gear shift lever, sports seats, door sills and instrument cluster.</p>, <p>Since underpinnings are largely carried over from the X3, much of that model's driving experience extends here—meaning that the X3 rides tall like a crossover, but launches with every bit of the authority of a sport sedan, and without the squat and nosedive that are pretty typical in bigger vehicles. The variable sport steering system is standard here, as are steering-wheel paddle shifters. Suspension and steering are both tuned slightly more sporty than in a comparable X3. And while the X4 really doesn’t look that trail-focused, it at least has an advanced enough all-wheel-drive system to handle most situations, although tires and ground clearance are limiting factors.</p>, <p>The X4 offers comfortable seating for four adults, with the area between the two well-bolstered outboard positions acting as an occasional spot for a child or adult on a short trip. Cargo space in the X4 ranges from 17.7 cubic feet with the rear seats up to 49.4 in full-on cargo mode. All X4s include a power hatch mechanism, while choosing Comfort Access also brings the Smart Opener feature, which provides hands-free opening by waving a foot below the rear bumper.</p>, <p>
Features and equipment follow the mold of BMW's existing X vehicles, including a wide array of exterior and interior color options and upholstery styles; advanced electronics and entertainment gear; and high-tech safety features. Like other modern BMWs, the X4's infotainment functions are manipulated through the brand's latest iDrive controller; it incorporates a touchpad, allowing users to trace out individual characters when choosing a destination in the navigation system or selecting names from a phonebook. Rear Park Distance Control is a standard feature as well, made somewhat necessary by the short rear window. An available M Aerodynamics Package will bring a collection of sporty BMW M finishing touches to the look, both on the outside and in the cabin.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/bmw_8-series
[<p>Built from 1989-1999 worldwide, and sold during 1990-1997 model years in the U.S., the BMW 8-Series represented the height of style, luxury, and performance for BMW. As the brand's flagship grand tourer during its run, the 8-Series exemplified sleek, sporty looks and fierce power, and remains a sought-after example of the German brand's engineering today.</p>, <p>
Ahead of its time in many ways, the 8-Series, or E31 as it was designated internally, was positioned above the less expensive, less powerful 6-Series, and as a result, saw relatively low production numbers despite its good looks and impressive powertrains. A total of just over 30,000 8-Series were built worldwide, with about 7,000 of those sent to North America.</p>, <p>
Over the 8-Series' model run, a sequence of V-8 and V-12 engines were offered. At launch in the U.S., a 4.0-liter M60 V-8 was standard in the 840Ci, rated at 282 horsepower. Later in the model run, the 840Ci was updated to a new 4.4-liter M62 V-8 rated at the same 282 horsepower figure.</p>, <p>
The V-12-powered 850i and 850Ci started with a 5.0-liter M70, rated at 296 horsepower, eventually upgrading (in 850Ci form) to the 322-horsepower 5.4-liter M73 V-12. The 850CSi offered from 1993-1995 used a 372-horsepower 5.6-liter S70 V-12. the 8-Series offered a range of 4- and 5-speed automatics and a six-speed manual transmission over its model run. It was also one of the first cars to be fitted with a "fly-by-wire" electronic throttle.</p>, <p>
Despite the obvious focus on powertrains, the 8-Series was also about luxurious touring capabilities, rather than outright performance. Electronically controlled dampers, leather upholstery, heated electric-adjust seats, wood trim, a range of in-car phones (it was the '90s), and a range of M Division upgrades were available.</p>, <p>
Since the early 2000s, the 8-Series has risen in collectibility, in part due to its low volume, but also due to its unique style and impressive (particularly in 850Csi V-12 form) engines and performance.</p>, <p>A modern analogue of the 8-Series has returned to the BMW range in the form of the BMW i8. With an equal emphasis on performance and luxury, but a new-found focus on ecological sanity, the i8 uses a plug-in hybrid drivetrain. With style that echoes, but doesn't directly draw from, the 8-Series, the new i8 promises to fill a similar niche, updated for modern mentalities. The i8's hybrid drivetrain promises quick sports car performance with gas mileage well above the 50 mpg mark when it arrives on the market in 2014.</p>, <p><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/bmw_i8_2015"><em><strong>Read here for more details on the 2015 BMW i8.</strong></em></a></p>]

[<p>The Buick Envision is a five-seat crossover SUV, the automaker's first offering in the fast-growing mid-size segment.</p>, <p>Introduced late in the 2016 model year with a limited lineup, the Envision range grew for 2017 to include a new base engine and five trim levels and a choice of powertrains. There are no changes to the Envision for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p>The Envision is the first Chinese-built vehicle to be sold by an American brand in the U.S., although a specific version of the Volvo S60 beat the Buick on the China-to-America boat. </p>, <p>With the Envision, Buick fleshes out its crossover-SUV lineup. The Envision slots between the bigger Enclave and the smaller Encore.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/buick_envision_2018">2018 Buick Envision review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Envision fills a void in the Buick lineup and suits up to take on some important and successful rivals such as the Mercedes GLC-Class, the Audi Q5, the Acura RDX, and the Lincoln MKC.</p>, <p>Styling fits in the crossover-SUV mainstream, with a small Buick grille dressing a front end without any truck-like SUV lines. It's quite a car-like vehicle, with muscular fenders flowing into a sideview that's clearly influenced by the BMW X5. Inside, the Envision's cockpit has a curvaceous and dramatic look, with big swaths of woodgrain trim and ambient lighting on some versions.</p>, <p>The sole powertrain for the 2016 Envision was a 2.0-liter turbo-4. It's rated at 252 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 6-speed automatic is the only transmission paired with the turbo-4. The Envision is sold in both front- and all-wheel-drive form; the all-wheel-drive system is a new twin-clutch system.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, an inline-4 joined the lineup.</p>, <p>Other mechanical details include electric power assist that factors in counter-steering measures to mitigate crosswinds and road surface variations, and front and rear disc brakes. The suspension is designed for comfort, with front struts isolated with hydraulic bushings, and a four-link independent rear.</p>, <p>The Envision is somewhat smaller than GM's current compact to mid-size SUVs: the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain. It's about two inches shorter than those vehicles, at 183.7 inches long, and has a wheelbase about four inches shorter, at 107.9 inches. It shares a useful feature with Terrain and Equinox: a sliding second-row seat that allows more flexibility when carrying passengers and cargo. Behind the rear seat, the Envision can carry 26.9 cubic feet of cargo.</p>, <p>The IIHS calls the Envision a Top Safety Pick after it received top "Good" scores in testing and its front crash prevention systems earned an "Advanced" rating. The Envision comes standard with a rearview camera and active lane control. Other standard features include power heated front seats; automatic climate control; Bose audio; an infotainment system controlled via an 8.0-inch touchscreen; and remote start.</p>, <p>Major options include remote keyless ignition; ventilated front seats; surround-view cameras; a hands-free power tailgate; automatic parking assistance; OnStar with 4G LTE connectivity and an in-car wireless hotspot; and a panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>Fuel economy figures are competitive, and the Envision comes with active grille shutters and stop-start to improve gas mileage. It also weighs in at about 4,000 pounds and is rated to tow up to 1,500 pounds.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/buick_verano
[<p>The Buick Verano is a compact four-door sedan. New for the 2012 model year, the Verano heads off into the sunset with a short 2017 run before being dropped from Buick's lineup. The model lineup is simplified for those final few cars, and the likeable turbocharged engine is no longer available.</p>, <p>The Verano shares architecture and some running gear with the last-generation Chevrolet Cruze, but the more finished, entry-luxury Verano gets premium features and its own 4-cylinder engine choices—with the requisite higher sticker price.</p>, <p>Since it introduced the Verano, Buick hasn't made many major changes, save for adding a turbocharged model the following year and dropping it for 2017. It is, however, no longer the smallest vehicle in the Buick lineup. With the addition of the tiny Encore crossover for 2014, the Verano almost looks like a large car in the showroom.</p>, <p>Though the Verano has few direct rivals, it's sized and priced reasonably closely to the Audi A3, Lexus IS 250, Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class, and even the rear-drive BMW 1-Series. The Acura ILX, a similarly sized car based on the Honda Civic, is a closer competitor.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/buick_verano_2017">2017 Buick Verano review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>From a styling standpoint, inside is where the Verano truly pleases, with a very upscale feel for such a small car, and luxury touches such as the voice-activated IntelliLink system and a heated steering wheel. From the outside, the Verano has somewhat conservative styling, making it look like a smaller, rounder Regal with a bit less character. The Buick ventiports are merely vestigial at this point, sitting as appliques atop the hood, and it would be OK if they disappeared from Buicks sooner than later. The overall shape of the Verano is pleasant and makes the car appear larger than it is.</p>, <p>Buick's Quiet Tuning ethos brings a well-controlled ride yet surprisingly deft handling—with quick-ratio steering—compared to some cushy luxury-sedan alternatives. In drives of the base model, we've found it to be impressively refined, with one of the quietest interiors of any compact or even mid-size sedan. All models feature strong four-wheel disc brakes.</p>, <p>For 2012, there was only one powertrain: a 180-horsepower, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, with front-wheel drive. That powertrain continues to this day. For 2013, the Verano added a new turbocharged engine. The 2.0-liter turbo-4 with 250 hp and 260 pound-feet of torque was coupled to either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. Acceleration was brisk, with 0-60 mph times of less than 6.5 seconds compared to 8.6 for the 2.4. The manual transmission was an interesting option, giving the Verano a hint more of a sporty feel, but ultimately it seemed less in character than the good automatic gearbox. While suspension tuning and steering effort were dialed to a more sporting level in the Verano Turbo, it remained a quiet, comfortable ride.</p>, <p>Interior space is generous for front seat passengers, and the comfortable seats work for a variety of body types. The rear seat is contoured for adults, though the need to compromise leg room with front-seat occupants and a somewhat narrow rear bench do reveal it as a compact. The 14.3 cubic feet of trunk space is great, however.</p>, <p>The Verano quickly earned Top Safety Pick status from the IIHS. However, the agency hasn't performed its newer small-overlap crash test on the Verano, which means it no longer qualifies for the best Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick+ ratings. It's also rated at five stars overall for safety by the NHTSA. All Veranos get 10 standard airbags; a rearview camera is standard on models above the base trim. Buyers can opt for rear park assist, blind-spot monitors, forward collision warnings, lane departure warnings, and rear cross traffic alerts.</p>, <p>Pricing starts around $22,000. Add in features such as a nine-speaker Bose audio system; leather seating surfaces; heated seats and a heated steering wheel; navigation; a sunroof; and the aforementioned active safety features, and the price tops $30,000.</p>, <p>That navigation system includes Buick's IntelliLink, a connectivity interface that we find simpler than Lexus's Enform. IntelliLink also offers Pandora and Stitcher audio streaming when paired with a smartphone.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/buick_regal
[<p>The Buick Regal has been rebooted for 2018 as a mid-size, five-door hatchback and a station wagon that straddles the line between car and crossover.</p>, <p>The Regal nameplate dates back decades. Under the nameplate, Buick has sold vehicles of many sizes and shapes. In the 2011 rebirth of the Regal, the name came applied to a European-bred sedan.</p>, <p>The Regal Sportback is a roomy fastback-shaped vehicle that boasts a large tailgate instead of a conventional trunk, while the Regal TourX guns for outdoorsy types with its slightly increased ground clearance and rugged styling cues. </p>, <p>With this sixth-generation Regal, Buick has in the Sportback a more practical rival for sedans like the Acura TLX, Lincoln MKZ, and Volvo S60; the TourX has been shaped in the mold of the Subaru Outback and the Volvo V60 Cross Country. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116953_2019-buick-regal">our 2019 Buick Regal review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Buick Regal</strong></p>, <p>For 2018, the Sportback comes standard with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional on the sedan and it's standard on the TourX. Both models use the same 2.0-liter turbo-4, rated at 250 horsepower. A 9-speed automatic is included with front-wheel drive, while an 8-speed automatic is included with all-wheel drive. That all-wheel-drive system features two clutches integrated into the rear differential to apportion power from side to side. </p>, <p>The Regal GS comes with the Sportback body fitted with ground effects and other aggressive styling elements. It features a 310-horsepower 3.6-liter V-6, the 9-speed, adjustable shocks, more aggressive suspension tuning, and sport seats.</p>, <p>Both body styles share essentially the same styling, to a point. The Sportback sits lower to the ground and lacks the TourX's bulky fender flares. And, of course, the Sportback is a few inches shorter since the TourX is a station wagon. Either one is roomy inside, with the Sportback offering more than 30 cubic feet of luggage space with the rear seat upright. The TourX is exceptionally cavernous, with 73.5 cubes of maximum capacity when its second row is folded. </p>, <p>A 7.0-inch infotainment system is standard, while an 8.0-inch system with navigation and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto is an extra-cost option. Buick offers a wide range of safety tech—automatic emergency braking, lane departure warnings, lane change assist, and more—but it's all optional. </p>, <p><strong>Buick Regal history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The Regal nameplate dates back to the early 1970s. In 1973, GM introduced the Regal as a two-door coupe spun off the Century sedan, a sort of "personal luxury" car along the lines of the Ford Thunderbird. The Regal later gained a four-door sedan model, and both were sold with V-6 and V-8 powertrains.</p>, <p>The second-generation Regal arrived in 1978 and garnered a reputation for being a little bit sporty thanks to its 3-speed manual. Upping the performance ante were turbocharged models sold as the Regal T-Type, Grand National, and GNX. These are now easily the most collectible of all Regal models.</p>, <p>The third generation of the Regal was launched in 1988, this time on a brand-new, front-wheel-drive platform. This version both departed from and returned to Regal tradition—the name was applied to a front-wheel-drive car for the first time but it was once again offered only as a coupe. Performance fans looked elsewhere as there wasn't a V-8 or turbocharged V-6 option available, and eventually sales started to decline. A sedan variant was reintroduced by 1990.</p>, <p>When the fourth generation of the Regal arrived in 1997, Buick was no longer offering a coupe and there was still no V-8 option. However, a new supercharged model with 240 hp on tap was launched bearing the GS name. A dealer upgrade—labeled the GSX SLP Performance Package—was offered, boosting output to 270 hp and adding an assortment of performance accessories. Production of the fourth-generation Regal eventually ended in 2004.</p>, <p>The Regal came back for 2011, an Americanized version of the Opel Insignia. Initially, it offered a choice between a naturally aspirated 2.4-liter inline-4 and a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that made 220 hp. In a nod to the model's heritage, Buick revived the Regal GS nameplate for 2012, with that car powered by a higher-output version of the turbo engine tuned to produce 270 hp. The GS also received its own exterior and interior treatments as well as an adjustable suspension that could be tuned for comfort or sportier driving.</p>, <p>Late in that model year, a version with a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1064405_2012-buick-regal-eassist-priced-from-29530">mild-hybrid system called eAssist</a> was added; it featured a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder teamed with lithium-ion batteries that recaptured energy from regenerative braking to add some torque and to improve fuel economy to 25 mpg city, 36 highway, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>All powertrains featured direct injection and came paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift control; the GS offered a manual transmission in addition to the auto.</p>, <p>Buick changed the powertrains in the Regal for the 2013 model year. Buick dropped the entry-level 4-cylinder and the eAssist engine <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1076901_2013-buick-regal-36-mpg-eassist-system-comes-standard">became the standard powertrain</a>. The 220-hp Regal Turbo and 270-hp Regal GS remained, both using turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4s.</p>, <p>Since the 2014 model year, the Regal Turbo and GS have shared an engine—a 259-hp version of the turbo-4—and are differentiated by trim and chassis tuning. All-wheel drive was made available on both turbocharged Regals that year as well. The 2014 update also brought new infotainment systems across the lineup, as well as safety upgrades, such as a now-standard rearview camera, available adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, and forward-collision warning.</p>, <p>An LCD touchscreen-driven IntelliLink interface controls phone, audio, and vehicle settings—and could be ordered with navigation. Buick offered 4G LTE connectivity that can turn the car into a wi-fi hotspot for mobile devices and also speeds up the link to OnStar.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, Buick brought back the base 2.4-liter, normally aspirated 4-cylinder and demoted the eAssist Regal to fleet-only sales. For 2017, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto became standard equipment.</p>]

Buick's first application of GM's 8-speed automatic transmission was the only gearbox on offer in 2017, but a 9-speed replaced it for 2018. Additionally, the 2018 model added a 194-hp mild hybrid 4-cylinder powertrain as the base engine.</p>, <p>The new car is marginally longer and lower than the 2016 model, but the wheelbase and front and rear track grow considerably, opening up more cabin space and giving the car a more stable footprint. It comes in at a lithe 300 pounds lighter, thanks to more high-strength steel in the body and lighter but more effective sound-deadening materials.</p>, <p>The independent rear suspension changes from a four-link to a five-link setup and the front suspension is MacPherson struts in lower end models and GM's HiPer Strut design in higher line versions. Adjustable dampers also will be offered.</p>, <p>Inside, the 2017 Lacrosse is completely redesigned and features a new 8.0-inch center touchscreen with the latest generation of the IntelliLink infotainment system. This version uses fewer hard buttons and comes with Android Auto and Apple Car Play.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Lacrosse was updated heavily, a surprise for what's only a two-year-old vehicle. A new base powertrain offers mild-hybrid technology; a 9-speed automatic is now offered, and all-wheel-drive availability has been expanded. At the top of the range, Buick's added a Lacrosse Avenir trim level.</p>, <p><strong>Buick LaCrosse history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>One of the first vehicles to usher in the latest era of Buick style and size, the Lacrosse effectively replaced the old LeSabre sedan when it was new in 2005. That first version was quite different from today's car. It was much like a smaller version of the Lucerne, epitomizing the old American view of a floaty, conservatively styled luxury Buick. Powered by a 3.6-liter V-6, a 3.8-liter V-6, or a 5.3-liter V-8, the first-generation Lacrosse was neither sporty nor fuel efficient, though the V-8 model packed some solid highway muscle. In any of three trims—CX, CXL, and CXS—the car was front-drive only and offered features that came up somewhat short of the competition.</p>, <p>To help remedy that problem, Buick added the Super trim in 2008, featuring magnetic adjustable shock absorbers, larger brakes, a revised suspension, projector-beam fog lights, wood grain interior trim, and new leather seating surfaces. The 2009 model year was the end of the first-generation Lacrosse's run.</p>, <p>The second-generation Lacrosse was a completely different prospect, with a striking design and much-improved materials, build quality, features and ride. Introduced to the market in 2009 as a 2010 model, the new Lacrosse quickly garnered praise for its looks. It featured a new range of engines, including a 3.0-liter V-6 and a 3.6-liter V-6. A 2.4-liter 4-cylinder was added in the second year of production to grab great fuel-economy figures for Lacrosse, while the V-6s were meant to provide some thrust for the large sedan.  </p>, <p>Initially, the second-generation Lacrosse was available in the same CX, CXL, and CXS as the first generation. The base CX featured standard OnStar and a 255-hp 3.0-liter V-6 engine. The CXL stepped up with more equipment, while the CXS got the 280-hp 3.6-liter V-6. The all-wheel-drive Lacrosse was only available in CXL trim with the 3.0-liter V-6. All of these Lacrosse sedans featured a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>For 2011, GM axed the 3.0-liter V-6, leaving the more powerful and similarly efficient 3.6-liter V-6 as the lone step-up engine. It remains the optional engine to this day, now making 304 hp. In the same year, the 182-hp, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder became the Lacrosse's base engine. It was a stopgap measure, lasting just a year until the Buick Lacrosse eAssist was introduced for the 2012 model year.</p>, <p>GM's eAssist 4-cylinder in the Lacrosse was a mild-hybrid that made use of a belt-driven starter/generator. It was more refined than the unassisted 4-cylinder it replaced, provided more power and also returned better mileage figures, according to the EPA: 25 mpg city, 36 highway. The electric motor allowed the engine to shut off at stoplights and restarts it when the driver lifted off the brake, and also provided some boost when accelerating. The 4-cylinder engine was only available with front-wheel drive. The much higher fuel-economy gains of full hybrids like the Honda Accord Hybrid competed against eAssist's milder gains, and the GM system was dropped.</p>, <p>Buick's IntelliLink touchscreen connectivity system was new to the Lacrosse lineup for 2012 and combined phone and media-player connectivity with the capability to stream audio through the Pandora or Stitcher apps; it was <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/buick_lacrosse_2013">made standard for 2013</a>. At the same time, Buick integrated the navigation system with IntelliLink, and topped off the GPS' features list with SiriusXM Travel Link services, including real-time traffic reports.</p>, <p><a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083129_2014-buick-lacrosse-breaks-cover-ahead-of-new-york-reveal">For the 2014 model year</a>, Buick gave the Lacrosse a mild facelift, added LED running lights and taillights and reshaped the hood and dash. New interior trim options included an Ultra Luxury package with wood and lightly treated leather, while a Bose audio system became an option. The powertrains were carried over, while 20-inch wheels and tires were a new option. The IntelliLink system was also upgraded to add more functionality.</p>, <p>The Lacrosse was offered with packages that carry no on-vehicle badging. There's the base Lacrosse, then a Lacrosse with Leather Group, Lacrosse with Premium I Group, and Lacrosse with Premium II Group. Each adds more equipment, while both of the Premium groups include the V-6 as standard equipment.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Lacrosse added modern technology such as a standard rearview camera and Siri Eyes Free to go with the IntelliLink system. The 2015 Lacrosse also added a 4G LTE connection, which includes the ability to broadcast a wi-fi data connection inside the vehicle for an extra monthly fee.</p>, <p>Upgrades for 2016 were minimal. They included a new 8.0-inch screen for IntelliLink with two USB ports and more intuitive controls.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/buick_encore
[<p>The Buick Encore is the small end in the Buick SUV trifecta. The five-seater Encore sits below the Envision and the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/buick_enclave_2013">large, seven-seat</a> Enclave.</p>, <p>The Encore was new in 2013, and received an update for 2017. At its inception, it was something of a revelation: an upmarket, subcompact crossover and it has been a hit for Buick.</p>, <p>As Buick's smallest vehicle, the Encore goes up against competitors such as the BMW X1, Mini Countryman, Audi Q3, and Mercedes-Benz GLA, all of which are more expensive and fancier than the little Buick. Mainstream competitors include the Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, Fiat 500X, and Jeep Renegade.</p>, <p>The 2019 Encore is unchanged from the year before it.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116678_2019-buick-encore">2019 Buick Encore review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Buick Encore</strong></p>, <p>Buick aims the Encore at urban families who want a vehicle that scoots around town, is easily maneuverable, and fits into tight parking spots. At just 168.4 inches long, with a wheelbase that's 100.6 inches, the Encore has a footprint a little larger than those of subcompact cars like the Chevy Sonic and Honda Fit, but it is considerably taller. Passengers sit at crossover height, giving good forward visibility and little of the sense of vulnerability that much lower-riding cars of that size can induce.</p>, <p>The Encore's hallmarks are luxury, comfort, and interior appointments. It seats four adults comfortably, while the back seat can accommodate three across if those folks are all smaller or willing to get cozy. The Buick Quiet Tuning measures—extra sound deadening including an acoustically treated headliner, as well as active noise cancellation—make it one of the more peaceful subcompacts for traveling. Cloth/synthetic leather or leather seats come in rich, warm colors, and interior trims mostly look and feel luxury-grade.</p>, <p>The Encore is powered by the same 1.4-liter turbo-4 that's available in Chevy's Cruze and Sonic, as well as the Trax crossover. It puts out 138 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. An uprated version that is available in Sport Touring models adds direct injection, 15 more horsepower, and 29 more lb-ft of torque. The extra power makes merging and passing easier, and it offers more pickup from a stop as well.</p>, <p>A tall sixth gear for the standard 6-speed automatic helps the base engine return 27 mpg combined with all-wheel drive and 28 mpg with front-wheel drive, according to the EPA. The direct-injected engine gets 28 mpg combined with AWD and 30 mpg with FWD.</p>, <p>To make it more of a Buick, the Encore has a cushy suspension. This tall and small crossover is not terribly sporty, instead focusing on decent fuel economy. The Sport Touring model has firmer suspension settings for better handling.</p>, <p>Safety is up to the standards set by recent GM small vehicles like the Buick Verano, Chevrolet Cruze, and Chevy Sonic. The Encore has 10 standard airbags, while forward collision warning, front and rear park assist, and lane-departure warning systems are available, along with a standard rearview camera.</p>, <p>The Encore netted top "Good" ratings in all of the IIHS tests. In federal testing, the small Buick earned a five-star overall rating for both front- and all-wheel drive versions.</p>, <p>Available features include remote vehicle start, dual-zone climate control, and rain-sensing wipers. Just as in most hatchbacks or crossovers, the rear seats fold down, to make 48.4 cubic feet of cargo space available (or 18.8 cubic feet with them up in place). A few items remind passengers of the Encore's less luxurious origins, including "power seats" where only the bottom portion is powered—the backrest adjustment is done via a standard lever—and the same control stalks as found in a Chevy Sonic.</p>, <p>The Encore was mostly unchanged for 2015, with the exception of OnStar's new 4G LTE data connection being made available; the system has the ability to create a wi-fi network inside the car and also speeds up communication to OnStar's systems.</p>, <p>For 2016, Buick added the Encore Sport Touring with the uprated engine. The Sport Touring also has a rear spoiler, its own 18-inch wheels, and engine stop/start.</p>, <p>A 2017 updated involved the styling and interior. The front end gained a new grille that lost the waterfall look and added a chrome strip with a wing shape flanked by available LED headlights with a sharp lighting signature. The overall effect softened up the Encore’s steeply raked nose and blended it better with the rest of the body. At the back, the Encore’s taillights went LED, too.</p>, <p>The cabin is where the more important changes took place. The dash looked less cluttered than before. The center stack was cleaned up and pared free of dozens of buttons, as the Encore adopted a new infotainment system. The setup featured an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Encore also gained a 4.2-inch display screen between its gauges, as well as keyless ignition. Those updates carry over into 2018.</p>, <p>Chevrolet has its own lower-priced version of the Encore, which it calls the Trax. In European markets, the Encore is known as either the Opel Mokka or Vauxhall Mokka, and is a subcompact entry-level crossover.</p>, <p>After a modest update in 2017, the 2018 Encore was essentially left alone aside from a newly optional air ionizer and a capless fuel filling system.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/buick_enclave
[<p>With the Enclave, Buick has a vehicle to rival SUVs such as the BMW X5 and Mercedes Benz GLE-Class.</p>, <p>A surprising success when the nameplate first debuted in 2008, the Enclave was finally redesigned for the 2018 model year. The 2019 model year added a standard heated steering wheel on some trim levels, but was largely the same as the year before it.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116945_2019-buick-enclave">2019 Buick Enclave review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Buick Enclave</strong></p>, <p>Fully redesigned for the 2018 model year, the new Enclave evolves on the previous generation's sleek, handsome exterior design while adding new luxury features and a beautifully crafted interior. The 2018 Enclave also introduces the first example of Buick's new Avenir luxury sub-brand, elevating the brand's three-row CUV to a proper flagship position among GM's three-row crossovers (at least until Cadillac gets around to releasing a car-based full-sizer).</p>, <p>As with the last Enclave, the new model shares its 3.6-liter, direct-injected V-6 engine with certain versions of the upcoming Chevrolet Traverse and the second-generation GMC Acadia, although only the Buick and Chevy get GM's new 9-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The 2018 model's 3.6-liter produces 310 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. The Enclave now returns 17 mpg city, 25 highway, 20 combined with front-wheel drive. Adding the optional twin-clutch all-wheel-drive system sacrifices 1 mpg on both the freeway and combined figures, although the city stat carries over.</p>, <p>Interior room is improved in the new Enclave; its third-row seat can hold adults in good comfort. The Enclave has not yet been crash-tested.</p>, <p><strong>Buick Enclave, 2008-2017</strong></p>, <p>Buick introduced the Enclave at the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1008481_2006-detroit-auto-show-index">2006 Detroit Auto Show</a> as the indirect replacement for its aged Terraza minivan and Rendezvous crossover. A more attractive, much more satisfying effort, the Enclave immediately earned kudos for its handsome styling. The three-row SUV might be our favorite of all the big GM crossover designs, just slightly edging out the GMC Acadia and a few well-detailed steps ahead of the plainer Chevy Traverse. Curvaceous fenders and glamorous detailing are matched inside by a subdued, luxurious design.</p>, <p>In its first year of production, the Enclave was fitted with a 275-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. With this combination, the vehicle offered decent acceleration and reasonable fuel economy of 16 mpg city, 22 highway, according to the EPA. For 2009, the Enclave's engine was upgraded with direct injection technology that offered 288 hp.</p>, <p>All first-generation Enclaves featured three rows of seating, with a total of seven places for passengers standard. The second row was fitted with a pair of captain's chairs, while the third had a three-person bench; the latter was notable for its ability to accommodate adults of medium stature—not just small children. Behind the back row, the Enclave offered 19 cubic feet of cargo space, or 23.3 cubic feet of space with the cargo management system removed. When properly equipped, the Enclave could tow up to 4,500 pounds, which should be good enough for most weekend duties.</p>, <p>Crash scores remained excellent even as testing criteria changed. The NHTSA gave the Enclave five stars overall, with a four-star rating in rollover and five stars for front and side impacts. It also received top "Good" scores in all categories by the IIHS; it was not put through the new small front overlap test, something added since the Enclave debuted.</p>, <p>One note for buyers: The Enclave's former trim levels were jettisoned midway through its lifespan. Later models offered option packages that added on features like a sunroof and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Since the big crossover already was well equipped, the arrangement made a bit more sense.</p>, <p>The Enclave received a light update for the 2013 model year, with upgraded infotainment features, a new grille, and some new interior trim, as well as improved struts for better ride control, and new programming for its automatic transmission to relieve some gear-hunting.</p>, <p>As of the 2015 model year, all Enclaves included a standard rearview camera.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/buick_cascada
[<p>The Buick Cascada is a Euro-style four-seat soft-top convertible that was new for the 2016 model year.</p>, <p>This year, the Cascada carries over unchanged from last year.</p>, <p>With direct competitors such as the Chrysler 200 and Sebring, Volvo C70, Volkswagen Eos and Toyota Solara out of production, the nearly mid-size Cascada has this small niche mostly to itself. The Cascada is the only affordable, comfort-oriented convertible available as other four-seat convertibles on the market like the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, and BMW 2-Series are smaller, sportier and/or more luxurious.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115757_2019-buick-cascada">2019 Buick Cascada review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Buick Cascada indirectly competes with the Audi A3 Cabriolet, BMW 2-Series, Mini Cooper Convertible, and even Ford's open-top Mustang.</p>, <p>The Cascada is powered by a 200-horsepower, 1.6-liter turbo-4. The engine is paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. According to the EPA, the Cascada is rated at 21 mpg city, 29 highway, 24 combined, putting it in the middle of the pack compared to other convertibles such as the Mini, BMW and Volkswagen.</p>, <p>This front-wheel-drive car is related to the Chevy Cruze and incorporates both the HiPer Strut front suspension design of the older Buick Verano and the Watts Z-link rear setup used on both models. Like those cars, the Cascada's steering uses electric power assist. Four-wheel disc brakes and big, 20-inch wheels complete a package that should be just sporty enough for this model’s mission.</p>, <p>Officially a 2+2, the Cascada sets rear seat expectations low, and barely offers enough space for kids in back. A power rear-seat entry system returns the front seat exactly where you started, and the rear seatbacks do fold forward for more trunk space when you need it. There’s 13.4 cubic feet of cargo space with the top up, but folding it down—done in as little as 17 seconds, at speeds up to 31 mph—limits the space to 9.8 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Buick’s reputation for a quiet ride is intact, thanks to multi-layer thermal and acoustic insulation for the top.</p>, <p>At the center of the Cascada’s cockpit-like dash layout is a version of the Buick IntelliLink infotainment system, with a touchscreen, text-message alerts, navigation, and Siri Eyes Free compatibility. OnStar 4G LTE data service with a built-in wi-fi hotspot is available, with a free trial included.</p>, <p>Safety-wise, there are active, automatically deploying rollover protection bars. Other safety aids include lane-departure warnings, a rearview camera, rear parking assist, and rain-sensing wipers.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, Buick added a Sport Touring model, which gained special blue paint and a black top, as well as newly designed 20-inch wheels and a flat-bottom sport steering wheel.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_cts-v
[<p>The Cadillac CTS-V takes the stock CTS sedan and performs some performance magic with it. The mid-size four-door sedan is one of the best performance sedans we've driven, thanks to upgrades to its powertrain and running gear.</p>, <p>The CTS-V has been offered in a wide range of body styles, including a wagon or coupe. The latest iteration is sedan-only, and it's a heat-seeking four-door that faces off against some of the best four-doors in the world.</p>, <p>With the CTS-V, Cadillac has a rival for sport sedans such as the BMW M5, the Mercedes-AMG E63, the Audi RS7. The Cadillac stands alone as the best-performing American luxury sedan.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_cts-v_2018">2018 Cadillac CTS-V review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Cadillac CTS-V</strong></p>, <p>In 2015, the third-generation CTS-V was introduced, this time offered—initially, at least—only as a four-door sedan. Updates for 2017 are relegated to a trick new rearview mirror that's actually a high resolution display for a camera integrated into the car's trunk, and a new Carbon Black package that adds an aerodynamic body kit composed of lightweight woven carbon fiber.</p>, <p>The latest CTS-V packs the Chevrolet Corvette Z06's drivetrain, with only minor modifications, generating 640 horsepower and 630 pound-feet of torque. Based on the latest version of the CTS, the Cadillac CTS-V offers a more aggressive design, greater luxury, and extensive performance enhancements.</p>, <p>Among the upgrades are third-generation magnetorheological dampers, a Cadillac-tuned take on the Performance Traction Management system that provides stability and control in environments ranging from snow and ice to all-out attacks on lap times at the track. An electronically actuated limited-slip differential, a quick-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission (with paddle shifters), and high performance tri-compound tires are also included.</p>, <p>Cadillac claims 0-60 mph times for the CTS-V at 3.7 seconds, with a top speed of 200 mph. </p>, <p><strong>Cadillac CTS-V history</strong></p>, <p>The CTS-V was first launched in the Cadillac lineup in 2004. Based on the CTS sedan, but with much more horsepower, a more advanced and track-tuned suspension, upgraded brakes, and unique aerodynamic and interior styling elements. The CTS-V rapidly gained credence as a serious performance/luxury sedan.</p>, <p>Rated at 400 hp from its original 5.7-liter LS6 engine, updated in 2006 to a 6.0-liter LS2 V-8 engine also rated at 400 hp, the large and relatively heavy (3,850 pounds) sedan nonetheless offered very brisk acceleration, reaching 60 mph in just 4.6 seconds and reaching a top speed of 163 mph. A 6-speed manual transmission was the only offering in the first-generation CTS-V. Over its four-year model run, the CTS-V gained various trim and appearance options, but stayed essentially the same mechanically aside from the engine change.</p>, <p>
The second-generation CTS-V launched in 2009, based on the then-new CTS sedan, offering a new 6-speed automatic transmission in addition to the 6-speed manual and an all-new engine. The new engine was a 6.2-liter LSA V-8, supercharged to reach 556 hp and 551 lb-ft of torque. Acceleration improved significantly with the added power, shrinking the 0-60 mph time to 3.9 seconds and raising the top speed to 198 mph.</p>, <p>The second-gen car used an adaptive suspension with magnetorheological dampers, which does an excellent job of retaining comfort and sport attributes simultaneously. A set of brakes from Brembo brought the 4,250-pound car to a halt with immediacy. The second CTS-V also improved on its predecessor's cabin, with Alcantara accents throughout, available sport seats, and racing-inspired details to go along with the usual Cadillac luxuries.</p>, <p>A wagon version of the CTS-V was introduced in 2010, as a 2011 model. Sharing the same core mechanical underpinnings with the sedan, the CTS-V Sport Wagon was one of the few truly high-performance luxury wagons available in the United States.</p>, <p>
The CTS-V Coupe also arrived in 2010 as a 2011 model, sharing the same wheelbase and core mechanical elements as the sedan, but with a much more dramatic, low-profile look, including a more raked windshield and lower roofline. The CTS-V Coupe otherwise shared roughly the same key performance statistics with the sedan and wagon.</p>, <p>
Although the CTS sedan was new for 2014, the existing CTS-V models carried over for one more year as 2014 models. For the 2015 model year, only the coupe model was carried over.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_xt5
[<p>The Cadillac XT5 is the crest-and-wreath brand's mid-size luxury crossover. In 2017, it replaced the long-running SRX nameplate.</p>, <p>Cadillac says the name stands for "Crossover Touring 5." It carries over essentially unchanged into 2018. The new utility vehicle comes with a single powertrain, and a choice between front- and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Rivals for the XT5 include the Lexus RX, Jaguar F-Pace, Mercedes-Benz GLE, and Audi Q5.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_xt5_2018">2018 Cadillac XT5 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The XT5 takes on a considerably more daring look than its predecessor. It's meant to break with the recent past, where the SRX showed its relationship to the Chevrolet Equinox a little too closely. The XT5's outline is edgier and pronounced at the fenders, with the distinctive Le Mans-style headlights that work so well on the CTS sedan. Inside, Cadillac delivered a more sophisticated cabin that's related to the one in the upcoming CT6 sedan. Aligned on a broad horizontal theme, the dash is highlighted by a central touchscreen that displays everything from camera displays to infotainment functions through the CUE interface.</p>, <p>Buyers have a choice of five different cockpit trim colors and trims, from wood to aluminum to carbon fiber, and dash panels will be wrapped in cut-and-sewn trim. A new Platinum model delivers trim and materials along the lines of those offered in the gargantuan Escalade Platinum.</p>, <p>The XT5 offers different levels of performance for big Cadillac markets around the world. In China, the crossover SUV will be offered with a version of GM's latest turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. For American buyers, the standard powertrain for the 2017 model year is a 3.6-liter V-6 also used throughout Cadillac's sedan lineup. Output is rated around 310 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque, about equal with the outgoing SRX, but fuel economy improves thanks to standard cylinder cut-off and stop/start. The V-6 is mated to an 8-speed automatic with electronically controlled shift actuation.</p>, <p>Front-wheel drive is the default setup for the XT5, but all-wheel drive is available. Cadillac says it's a new system that uses twin clutches to deliver up to 100 percent of available torque to either the front or rear wheels. It can also split torque between the rear wheels for superior traction and a measure of torque-vectoring control. The rear drive axle can also be disconnected from the drivetrain to improve efficiency when traction is available.</p>, <p>The XT5 offers stronger performance than the SRX, above and beyond its powertrain. Cadillac says the new suspension on the XT5 has been designed for better agility and balance. It incorporates a strut front setup with a five-link independent rear end. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard, while 20-inch wheels are an option; the 20s come packages with a set of adaptive shocks, while a new Platinum model gets more compliant bushings for a better rear-seat ride.</p>, <p>Some of the most important work done on the XT5, in terms of performance and space, comes in the design of its body shell. Cadillac says by using high-strength steel and other materials, it's shaved 278 pounds from the curb weight of the old SRX, while increasing length and interior space. By the numbers, the XT5 is 189.5 inches long, with a 112.5-inch wheelbase, with a net 3.2-inch gain in rear-seat leg room over the SRX. Cadillac noted that the rear seat also slides and reclines. Curb weight is estimated at about 4,000 pounds in base trim, and nearly 4,300 pounds for all-wheel-drive models.</p>, <p>The IIHS called the XT5 a Top Safety Pick in 2017 and federal testers gave the all-wheel-drive version a five-star overall rating. The XT5 sports a new rearview camera system shared with the CT6 sedan. It uses the traditional rearview mirror to display output from a rear-mounted camera, which Cadillac says improves vision of that field of view by up to 300 percent by zooming and formatting the resulting image, and displaying it in high resolution. A color head-up display is an option, as is a surround-view camera system. Other safety features and options include forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking; blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts; adaptive cruise control; active lane control; and automatic parking assistance.</p>, <p>Along with the usual standard power features, the XT5 also has the CUE interface, with performance enhancements, as well as wireless phone charging, 4G LTE connectivity, and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. LED headlights and a gesture-controlled power tailgate are available.</p>, <p>The XT5 is built at the GM factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, once home to the Saturn division, as well as a factory in China for that market.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_xt4
[<p>The Cadillac XT4 small crossover takes GM’s all-American luxury brand into new and uncharted waters.</p>, <p>It’s a direct challenge to the hordes of compact premium crossovers fielded by brands such as Lexus and Audi–and it’s also Cadillac’s smallest vehicle in a generation.</p>, <p>With the XT4, Cadillac competes against the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC, and others—including smaller competitors. The XT4 will be available in Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Sport trim levels. Every XT4 will offer LED headlights and taillights, 18-inch wheels, rear parking sensors, an 8.0-inch touchscreen and other common accoutrements.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115974_2019-cadillac-xt4">2019 Cadillac XT4 preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p>As its name might suggest, the XT4 joins the Cadillac family as the smaller companion to the XT5. Unlike Cadillac’s sedan lineup, the visual similarities between these SUV siblings are minor. The XT4 wears blade-style headlights and boasts the same sharp angles and prominent grille.</p>, <p>It distinguishes itself with a wreathless badge and a more steeply raked rear window. More expressive taillights stand out from not just the XT5, but other members of the Cadillac family. The primary styling cues here are hard to miss—sharp , almost tactile lines that contribute to the same refined, modern styling we’ve grown to expect from Cadillac.</p>, <p>All XT4s get a 2.0-liter, turbocharged 4-cylinder with 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. It works alongside a standard 9-speed automatic, which sends power to either the front wheels or to GM’s twin-clutch all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>The powertrain should be thrifty. Cadillac claims the XT4 can return up to 30 mpg on the highway, as well as 25 mpg city and 27 mpg combined. Standard cylinder deactivation and stop/start technology, along with the 9-speed auto, help achieve those numbers.</p>, <p>MacPherson struts in front and a five-link independent rear underpin the XT4, while adaptive dampers can be fitted for a more controlled ride and sharper handling on the XT4 Sport.</p>, <p>Despite its American heritage, the XT4 is on the small side for this class. It’s shorter, both in overall length and the distance between the axles, than the comparable German crossovers. And yet, Cadillac claims 39.5 inches of second-row legroom, a class-leading stat that could make the XT4 useful for carrying four adults.</p>, <p>The sacrifice required for that impressive stat—a smallish cargo hold—hurts the baby Cadillac. With just 49.5 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume, the XT4 simply can’t haul as much stuff as some of its rivals.</p>, <p>The Cadillac User Experience (CUE) infotainment system features a rotary controller for managing information on its standard 8.0-inch display It provides a welcome alternative to the occasionally recalcitrant touchscreen.</p>, <p>The XT4 seems like a natural companion to an iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy S9. It features a new Bluetooth pairing procedure that uses near-field communications—the same principle that Apple Pay and Samsung Pay are founded on—to make setup easier, while a 15-watt wireless charging system allows for faster charging without cables.</p>, <p>Active safety systems will be available, but Cadillac limits them to the Premium Luxury and Sport trims, and even then, they’re optional extras.</p>, <p>Cadillac will build the XT4 at Fairfield Assembly, in Kansas City, Kansas. Sales start in fall 2018.</p>]

[<p>The Cadillac CT6 takes over the top spot as General Motors' luxury and technology flagship sedan. Overlapping the slightly smaller CTS in price and style, the CT6 rivals vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5-Series.</p>, <p>The CT6 is bigger than the CTS and ATS sedans, but not quite as large as the XTS. Its lightweight construction gives it a footprint on par with mid-size sedans from Mercedes-Benz and BMW, but its interior space is closer to the full-size offerings from both automakers.</p>, <p>The CT6 was new for the 2016 model year. A plug-in hybrid version was added halfway through the 2017 model year, and the main change for 2018 was the addition of the SuperCruise option, an advanced version of adaptive cruise control that keeps the car centered in its lane and permits hands-off operation under certain circumstances. Other 2018 changes were limited to a more capable Park Assist function and new paint colors.</p>, <p>The 2019 model year sees subtle styling updates to the front and rear fascias that bring the CT6 more in line with newer Cadillac models. The big change? A new 4.2-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 550 hp in a top V-Sport model, or 500 hp in the CT6 Platinum. Other engines should return to the lineup, but Cadillac hasn't confirmed anything beyond the new powertrain, which pairs that new V-8 with a 10-speed automatic.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_ct6_2019" title="2017 Cadillac CT6 - review">2019 Cadillac CT6 preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Other than the new engine and transmission, five powertrains are offered. Three are conventional engines: a  3.6-liter V-6, a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4, and a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. The latter engine generates 404 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. All three deliver power through an 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The CT6 Plug-In model uses a high-efficiency version of the 2.0-liter engine paired to a two-motor hybrid transmission similar to that in the Chevrolet Volt, with a 17.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack delivering 31 miles of EPA-rated electric range. Total output of the powertrain is also 335 hp, but the battery infringes on trunk space to a considerable degree. The plug-in is the only model not made in the U.S.; it's imported in low volumes from China, destined for California and a few other states where plug-in electric cars have proven popular.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is standard on all 6-cylinder models, delivered through an on-demand system that infinitely varies power delivery between front and rear wheels. As with Cadillac’s other luxury offerings, advanced electronic chassis controls enhance performance and safety, while Magnetic Ride Control dampers provide variable ride comfort and enhanced performance.</p>, <p>A new feature of the CT6 is auto brake hold, which aims to reduce stop-and-go traffic fatigue by holding the car in place when the driver releases the brake; the function also aids starts on steep hills. It is new to GM vehicles but has been offered by other luxury automakers for quite some time.</p>, <p>On the technology front, a 10.2-inch high-definition screen sits front and center in the dash, offering Cadillac’s CUE infotainment interface for control of the car’s main systems. A touchpad control in the center console offers an alternative to the haptic-response touchscreen for inputs. Wireless phone charging, 4G LTE with wi-fi hotspot, and OnStar are also included.</p>, <p>Safety features are also high-tech in the CT6, with a surround-view camera system eliminating blind spots, an night vision system that can identify people and large animals among other obstacles, a rearview camera that uses the full surface of the rearview mirror to deliver a combined image that enhances visibility for maneuvering, and a surround-view recording system that triggers when the vehicle’s alarm is activated.</p>, <p>Cadillac engineers worked to deliver luxury and comfort with the CT6 on top of technology and performance. Leather upholstery, wood and carbon fiber trim elements, ambient LED lighting, massaging seats, reclining rear seats, and woven-in seat heating elements are among the CT6’s prime features. An available adjustable rear seat adds 3.3 inches of adjustable seat travel, plus lumbar adjustment, tilting cushions, massage, seat heating/cooling, an armrest with media controls, plus HDMI and USB ports.</p>, <p>An available rear seat infotainment system offers 10-inch screens which retract into the setbacks; a four-zone climate control system uses a secondary full heating/cooling system to deliver personalized temperature control; the air in the cabin is purified by an ionizing system; and a Bose Panaray audio system routed through an astonishing 34 speakers.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_cts
[<p>The Cadillac CTS slots above the compact ATS and below the CT6 in the GM luxury brand's sedan lineup. The four-door, mid-size luxury sedan is also smaller than the XTS, which sits off in left field, delivering old-school goodness while these other Caddy sedan chase after the German sedan stalwarts.</p>, <p>The last dramatic redesign for the CTS happened in 2014, when it shed its wagon and coupe body styles for a simplified four-door approach. The high-power CTS-V sedan returned, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_cts-v">which we cover separately.</a></p>, <p>With the CTS, Cadillac has real competition for sedans like the Audi A6, BMW 5-Series, Lexus GS and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year, changes were limited to a new shade of gray, a heated steering wheel, and an available sunroof on VSport models.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_cts_2018">2018 Cadillac CTS review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Cadillac CTS</strong></p>, <p>A third-generation CTS was unveiled for the 2014 model year, bringing an updated look to the model. It has grown into the mid-size class, finally making it a competitor for sedans such as the BMW 5-Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Today's larger model is also more expensive as a result.</p>, <p>The styling of the new CTS has moved further away from the blunt edges and angles of the model's past. The LED trim on its vertical headlights makes a stunning visual display at night. Inside, the dash is wrapped in attractive trim, dominated by the touchscreen CUE interface.</p>, <p>The base 2.0-liter turbo-4 is rated at 268 horsepower, and it's coupled to a 6-speed automatic with rear- or all-wheel drive. Cadillac's ever-present 3.6-liter V-6 checks into the mid-line CTS with 335 hp and 285 pound-feet of torque, again with a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. A new 8-speed, paddle-shifted automatic is the transmission for rear- and all-wheel drive models of the CTS equipped with the 2.0-liter four or 3.6-liter V-6.</p>, <p>The CTS Vsport is fitted with a twin-turbo 3.6-liter V-6, good for 420 hp and 430 lb-ft of torque. It's rear-drive only, and comes with a paddle-shifted 8-speed automatic, its own 18-inch Pirelli tires, a track mode, an advanced electronic limited-slip differential, and Brembo brakes.</p>, <p>A stiffer body structure and extensive attention to weight keeps the CTS feeling trim and lively. Handling is superior, even to the Germans, especially in the Vsport edition and with Cadillac's magnetic adaptive dampers.</p>, <p>The CTS has gained an array of tech-intensive safety features, including rearview cameras, forward-collision alerts, adaptive cruise control, cross-traffic alerts, and lane-departure warnings. The CTS also gets the clever haptic system that vibrates the driver seat when the vehicle senses an imminent obstacle or a lane departure.</p>, <p>Changes for 2015 were relatively minor. Like many other General Motors vehicles, the CTS now offers a data connection over AT&amp;T's 4G LTE network, which can provide an in-car wi-fi network to mobile devices. Wireless charging called DockSpot is available to charge those devices, and the active parking system now can put the car into perpendicular spaces. Cadillac's new wreathless crest now adorns the CTS as well and is set in a new grille that dispatches the vertical chrome bars.</p>, <p>The range-topping <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_cts-v_2016">Cadillac CTS-V</a> arrives for 2016, and features the most powerful engine of any modern Cadillac. A version of the V-8 used in the new Corvette Z06, this 6.2-liter supercharged engine produces 640 hp and 630 lb-ft of torque. All CTS-V models will now use an automatic transmission, a new 8-speed developed by GM. The manual option is gone, although the new ATS-V will carry the three-pedal torch for the brand's high-performance models.</p>, <p>The current-generation CTS has managed respectable fuel economy numbers. The middle-road 3.6-liter V-6 manages 20 mpg city, 30 highway, 24 combined according to the EPA—likely down to the new engine's cylinder deactivation system. That's a marginal penalty from the base 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, which manages 21/31/25 mpg, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>For 2017, Cadillac gave the front and rear bumpers a light touchup, including vertical exhaust ports in the rear and one more horizontal bar in the grille. A rear camera mirror borrowed from the CT6 is available now, and the trim lineup has been simplified to base, Luxury, Premium Luxury, V-Sport and V-Sport Premium Luxury.</p>, <p><strong>Cadillac CTS history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The CTS succeeded the Catera, a blandly styled sedan about the same size that, while pleasant to drive, had unremarkable interior appointments and reliability and quality issues to boot. Produced at a new plant in Lansing, Michigan, the CTS has always achieved much better ratings, and quality has been praised.</p>, <p>While the CTS when first introduced for 2003 made a strong statement on the outside and was quite well received in that respect. Its interior—in particular, its drab, plasticky instrument panel—was almost universally panned. On introduction, the CTS was powered by a 220-hp, 3.2-liter version of the V-6 that had been used in the Catera. For 2004, that engine was joined by a new 255-hp, 3.6-liter DOHC V-6 that had made the CTS feel much more lively without negatively affecting fuel economy. Later, the 3.2-liter was replaced by a smaller 2.8-liter version of the DOHC V-6. When introduced, it was also the first Cadillac in many years to offer a 5-speed manual transmission, but the linkage was a bit balky for a luxury car; the 6-speed manual that was introduced for 2005 is an improvement.</p>, <p>In 2004, Cadillac introduced its V performance sub-brand, similar to AMG for Mercedes or the M Division at BMW. The first CTS-V used a 5.7-liter V-8 and later a 6.0-liter, both making 400 hp and 395 lb-ft of torque, but the larger engine providing a wider, more usable powerband. Other upgrades to the CTS-V included chassis and suspension improvements such as larger brakes, as well as styling differentiation inside and out.</p>, <p>Although the interior was an eyesore that was tough to look past, the 2003-2007 Cadillac CTS models, especially with the stronger engine, are enjoyable to drive, with excellent steering and a tight, responsive feel that's very different than Cadillacs of the past. The CTS has had good crash-test ratings and a full roster of safety features from the start.</p>, <p><strong>Second generation</strong></p>, <p>Cadillac made good with a redesigned 2008 CTS that, while keeping the former version's basic silhouette, doorlines, and roofline, was substantially changed throughout. Slightly more width and length plus well-detailed front and rear-end styling helped the CTS stand out, and the CTS received a stunning new interior—incorporating vastly improved materials and surfaces and a innovative retracting navigation screen—that together finally made the whole package right.</p>, <p>In this version of the CTS, GM introduced a new direct-injected version of the 3.6-liter V-6, making 304 hp. In 2009, Cadillac replaced the lower-output engine with a 3.0-liter version of the direct-injection V-6, making 270 hp. The 2008-2010 CTS offered 6-speed manual or automatic transmissions, and all-wheel drive was available.</p>, <p>A new 2009 CTS-V harnessed a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8, making 556 hp, with huge brakes to match and GM's Magnetic Ride Control allowing a tolerable ride plus track-ready capability.</p>, <p>For 2010, a CTS Wagon and CTS Coupe joined the lineup. Both were offered in CTS-V spec.</p>, <p>For the 2012 model year, a new version of the 3.6-liter V-6 became available, with 318 hp. Bluetooth also was made standard across the lineup. For <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_cts_2013">the 2013 model year</a>, a new adaptive remote start system was added to all CTS models, while a trio of new color options and a slightly revised grille updated the look. CTS-V models received new two-piece front brake rotors.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_escalade
[<p>The Cadillac Escalade full-size SUV is distantly related to parent-company General Motors' full-size pickup trucks—not that it looks anything like them. It's opulent, high-brow, and the kind of SUV that begs for attention. While doing so, it confidently hauls up to eight passengers and tows up to 8,000 pounds.</p>, <p>The big, powerful Escalade is even more refined now than in past generations and offers three rows of seats in a choice of two body lengths. It is available in either standard or long-wheelbase editions—just like its mechanical cousins, the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL and the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_escalade_2018">2018 Cadillac Escalade review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Aside from the addition of a trick rearview mirror that's actually a monitor linked to a high-resolution backup camera, the Escalade stood pat for 2017. The 2018 Escalade adopted a 10-speed automatic transmission, which helped fuel economy slightly and made the 6.2-liter V-8 feel stronger.</p>, <p><strong>The new Cadillac Escalade</strong></p>, <p>The current Escalade is now a rival for the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, Lincoln Navigator, and Infiniti QX80—even some Range Rover models.</p>, <p>The latest Escalade is a heavily revamped and restyled continuation of the previous version. New in 2015 and largely carried over for 2017, it's a crisp, handsomely styled SUV that makes no bones about its size, going so far as to highlight it with full LED lighting. The cabin is filled with leather and suede and open-pore wood, if you like, with the front row dominated by Cadillac's CUE touchscreen interface.</p>, <p>Power comes from a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 engine that produces 460 pound-feet of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission for some 2015 models, and upgraded to an 8-speed on vehicles built later in the model year and continued through 2017.</p>, <p>As in the previous generation, the Escalade comes in rear- and four-wheel-drive versions. Cadillac's sophisticated Magnetic Ride Control suspension is standard, and a new four-wheel-drive system has a two-speed transfer case. The Escalade can tow as much as 8,300 pounds, depending on configuration. Two lengths are offered, with the standard Escalade and the Suburban-sized Escalade ESV.</p>, <p>Although the newest Escalade has a bit less interior room than the previous model, overall comfort has been improved. The rearmost row of seats can be folded independently with power assist. There's lots of space available in the standard-length Escalade, and even more in the extra-long ESV version, which is the same size as a Chevy Suburban.</p>, <p>Prices start in the low-$70,000 range and can escalate quickly past $100,000. Some of the price increase comes from added safety gear, including forward-collision warning, blind-spot monitors, and adaptive cruise control. Other options include a rear entertainment system that plays Blu-ray movies on a single 9.0-inch screen that descends from the roof on the standard Escalade, or on two separate 9.0-inch screens on the longer ESV model.</p>, <p>As a running update, the Escalade received a new, cleaner grille design with Cadillac's new wreathless crest adorning it, midway through the 2015 model year. The brand's new logo sits higher up on the chrome blades than did the more circular logo before it, giving the Escalade an even more modern look. It also received the aforementioned 8-speed automatic, as well as the OnStar 4G LTE in-car wi-fi with an included 3 GB/three-month trial. The LTE connection also speeds up the connection to OnStar services.</p>, <p>For 2016, the Escalade added Apple CarPlay to its CUE infotainment system, while the 2017 brings with it a rearview mirror that's actually a high-resolution display for a camera integrated into the rear hatch.</p>, <p>Fuel economy has stayed largely the same for the current generation. The current model, equipped with an 8-speed automatic, manages 15 mpg city, 21 highway, 17 combined, according to the EPA. The ratings for the 6-speed automatic sold on some 2015 models was roughly the same.</p>, <p><strong>Cadillac Escalade history</strong></p>, <p>The Escalade showed up late and lost the first round of the American luxury SUV battle to the Lincoln Navigator—Cadillac's entry bowed in 1999, while the Lincoln arrived the prior year. The Escalade felt half-baked, too—it was a scant cosmetic makeover of the then-new GMC Yukon Denali, with a re-molded front end that didn't look like the product of either brand. A 255-hp V-8 teamed up with a 4-speed automatic and standard four-wheel drive. GM sold this Escalade only for the 1999 and 2000 model years. Leather trim, an upmarket stereo, and badges were about all that separated this version from its Chevy and GMC cousins.</p>, <p>The Escalade took a pass on the 2001 model year entirely, with Cadillac instead focusing on a 2002 makeover for its largest model. The plan worked, as it emerged with three body styles, a far better-knit kit of Cadillac styling cues, and a swank interior with a new third-row seat. Rear-wheel-drive versions came in 2002 as well, joining the logical but curious Escalade EXT—an odd hybrid of four-door SUV and pickup, with a midgate separating the two for cargo flexibility.</p>, <p>The 2003 model year brought the longer ESV edition, giving the Escalade a size competitor for GM's own Suburban XL 'utes. A Platinum trim package emerged in 2004. A 285-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 came in most versions for the first two years; a new engine with 10 more hp arrived in 2004. For the entire run of this generation, a 345-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 came as an option on some versions. This generation shared mechanicals with the entire GM truck and full-size SUV lineup, but also the new Hummer H2 'utes.</p>, <p>A new Escalade hit the road in the 2007 model year, with ESV and EXT editions coming with the standard-length Escalade. GM pressed the introduction of the trucks ahead of schedule—but sales still fell, and fell hard once the country slipped into a deep recession in 2008. Nonetheless, this has been the most satisfying Escalade yet. Very crisp, angular styling looks quite handsome on all versions, and lots of chrome make the Escalade a styling standout—whether you agree with its take on luxury or not. Amazing power emanates from the 6.2-liter V-8, and a special all-wheel-drive system and an 8-speed automatic are notable improvements.</p>, <p>Magnetic Ride Controls quells the worst road impacts, while the optional 22-inch wheels can add road noise to the otherwise calm cabin. The seating is quite comfortable, but the third row isn't so easy to reach, and the seats don't quite fold flat—but Escalade ESVs hardly have to worry with their tremendous interior space, with or without the third-row bench folded.</p>, <p>A new Escalade Hybrid SUV was added to the lineup for 2009. With a price of nearly $75,000, it was extremely slow-selling, but the hybrid technology and its advanced two-mode transmission improve fuel economy from miserable mid-teens to the respectable low-20-mpg range. All versions of the Escalade can be fueled with E85 ethanol blend.</p>, <p>Otherwise, the Escalade changed very little over the last several model years of this generation.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_ats-v
[<p>The Cadillac ATS-V sports coupe puts high-performance on the front burner for GM's luxury brand and its lineup of sedans and coupes.</p>, <p>New in 2015 as a 2016 model, the latest ATS-V was initially offered in two- and four-door variants. For 2019, that was pared back to a two-door. The differences between them are few, though coupes have a wider rear track for better handling.</p>, <p>Essentially a replacement for the Cadillac CTS-V, which grew in its latest generation, the ATS-V is now Cadillac's entry-level performance car, and it squares off against the BMW M3/M4 and the Mercedes-AMG C63.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/cadillac_ats-v_2018">2018 Cadillac ATS-V review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The latest ATS-V takes the same shape from the Cadillac ATS and adds more horsepower, sharper styling, and a plusher interior for a focused and luxurious performance variant.</p>, <p>Both models wear wider front and rear fenders; new front and rear end designs, including lower, more aggressive aerodynamic elements; new rear spoilers; and V-series badges. Unique wheels and wide, high-performance tires complete the exterior look.</p>, <p>Inside, the ATS-V models get carbon fiber-look trim (optional) or the standard wood/metal available in other ATS models, as well as leather and, optionally, sueded leather.</p>, <p>The real story with Cadillac's ATS-V line isn’t the look—it’s the performance. Leveraging lessons learned in the development of the new Corvette Stingray for performance traction control and rear differential tuning, the ATS-V coupe and sedan also receive a new engine: a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V-6 rated at 464 horsepower and 445 pound-feet of torque. That engine can be mated to either an 8-speed automatic (also shared with the Corvette) or a 6-speed manual gearbox.</p>, <p>The resulting performance is brisk, indeed: 0-60 mph takes just 3.8 seconds, and top speed is 189 mph.</p>, <p>Handling is also a strong suit of the ATS-V, with magnetic dampers adjusting for on-road comfort, crisper handling, or track-rated duty. It's not just capable, but very fast, and satisfying to drive in a way that even the vaunted BMW M3/M4 duo are not. Thanks to the advanced Performance Traction Management system, the ATS-V is also very approachable and confidence-inspiring, too, something that’s rare in the nearly 500-horsepower range.</p>, <p>Under all of the V-series glitz and glamour, however, there remains what is fundamentally a very well-built and well-specified luxury sedan (or coupe). Like the standard ATS, the ATS-V line offers Cadillac’s CUE infotainment system, which, while much-maligned in its earliest variants, has become quicker to respond and easier to use—though it still has another development cycle or two to catch the more mature German infotainment offerings.</p>, <p>Because of that shared foundation with the standard ATS range, the ATS-V, while not separately tested in crash ratings, shares a five-star score by the NHTSA for overall, frontal, side-crash, and rollover protection. The IIHS hasn’t yet rated the ATS or ATS-V for its crashworthiness.</p>, <p>The ATS-V is predictably thirsty for a performance car, managing around 19 mpg depending on transmission and model year. </p>, <p>For 2017, changes to the ATS-V were limited to an optional Carbon Black Sport Package that brought with it a revised front fascia and dark finish wheels, as well as suede trim for the steering wheel and gear shift lever. In 2018, Cadillac updated the ATS-V's infotainment system but otherwise left things alone. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_xts
[<p>The Cadillac XTS full-size sedan sat at the top of the luxury brand's sedan lineup—that is, until the CT6 came along.</p>, <p>The XTS now sits somewhere in left field on its own. It's a shame in some ways; the XTS is a representation of old-school luxury in many respects. While the rest of Cadillac's sedans chase German cars in terms of performance, the XTS delivers a smooth, quiet ride with plenty of interior space.</p>, <p>The XTS still is a good choice for drivers that might choose an Infiniti Q70, an Acura RLX, or a Lincoln Continental.</p>, <p>The 2019 version is identical to the 2018 model.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116370_2019-cadillac-xts" title="2017 Cadillac XTS - review">2019 Cadillac XTS review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Available in front- or all-wheel-drive models, the XTS is more affordable than German or Japanese luxury entries. It effectively replaced the former full-size DTS four-door, which supplanted the longstanding DeVille name, when it was introduced for the 2012 model year.</p>, <p>The Ontario, Canada-built XTS is based on GM's beefiest front-drive car architecture, sharing some of its underpinnings with the Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse. It's longer than both of those models, with a longer wheelbase, which means more interior space, especially in the rear. It's being marketed to the livery drivers who recently lost their rear-drive Lincoln Town Cars, bringing with it much more modern looks and Cadillac's latest design language stretched over GM's biggest front-drive architecture.</p>, <p>The XTS was initially offered with a single drivetrain, a 3.6-liter V-6 with 300 horsepower and 264 pound-feet of torque, coupled to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is rated at 17 mpg city, 28 highway for the front-drive XTS, while all-wheel-drive models are rated at 17/26 mpg. A twin-turbo XTS VSport was soon added, with a 410-hp forced-induction version of the same engine, standard all-wheel drive, and revamped suspension tuning. That model fairs only slightly worse in testing by the EPA despite the power boost, with ratings of 16/24 mpg.</p>, <p>As for ride and handling, the XTS bridges the gulf <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1076501_2013-cadillac-xts-first-drive">between the old DTS and the crisper Caddys</a> with a new suspension that features standard Magnetic Ride Control, a set of adaptive shocks that use a magnetically charged fluid that changes shock response according to road conditions. Performance struts and Brembo brakes are included on some versions.</p>, <p>Overall interior space of the XTS matches many full-size sedans, though in certain dimensions it's more comparable to some mid-size four-doors. In the rear seat, for example, the XTS has 40 inches of leg room—less than today's VW Passat but more than a short-wheelbase Jaguar XJ. The XTS's trunk is large, at 18 cubic feet, though it's down a few cubes from the Ford Taurus, which checks in at 20 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Cadillac has also rated this big sedan for fleet service. Certain upfitters can transform the four-door into a hearse, flower car, or limousine; jobs the biggest and best Cadillac sedans have been taking on for decades.</p>, <p>The XTS has some of GM's most advanced infotainment technology built into its cabin. It was the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1067246_2012-cadillac-xts-cue-includes-best-brightest-touch-screen-yet">first Cadillac to offer CUE</a>, which uses a haptic touchscreen with proximity sensing and multi-touch gestures like those used with smartphones and tablets to control secondary functions. CUE has received some criticism for its complexity, and Cadillac has released a few updates to make it more user-friendly.</p>, <p>Along with the in-cabin electronics, Cadillac introduced new <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082567_cadillac-tech-aims-to-increase-safety-on-daily-commute">short- and long-range radar systems</a> with the XTS. These systems are used for adaptive cruise control, front and rear sensing for automatic braking, and rear cross-traffic alert. The XTS also features a driver alert system that vibrates the seat in the direction of an object behind them. Perhaps the most useful example would be backing out of a parking spot with crossing traffic. The XTS also features 10 standard airbags. </p>, <p>The XTS will remain on sale for a few years, but it's been strongly hinted that the XTS will have a short future. The CT6 is a new full-size sedan with a lightweight body and the dimensions of a BMW 7-Series. The CT6 went on sale in early 2016.</p>, <p>For 2017, the XTS adopts a new gauge cluster, as well as a teen-driving protection system that can give visual and audible warnings when the car goes over a set speed limit, and can display how and where the vehicle was driven during a certain time period.</p>, <p>For 2018, the XTS has a slightly revised look outside, some new trim options inside, and a few upgrades to its infotainment system.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/cadillac_ats
[<p>The Cadillac ATS is GM's smallest luxury sedan, but still one of the best-performing cars it builds.</p>, <p>The entry-level Cadillac emerged new in the 2013 model year. In 2015, it gained a two-door companion model. For 2019, only the two-door survived as the sedan was discontinued.</p>, <p>The ATS spans a wide range of performance and covers traditional luxury-car bases: efficient, high luxury, and high performance in the ATS-V, which we cover separately.</p>, <p>Rivals for the ATS include vehicles such as the Audi A4/A5, BMW 3-Series/4-Series, Infiniti Q50/Q60, Lexus IS/RC, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116940_2019-cadillac-ats" title="2016 Cadillac ATS - review">2019 Cadillac ATS review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Like the one-size-up CTS, the ATS sports the latest evolution of Cadillac's Art &amp; Science design vocabulary. Here, the angular forms of the first CTS have been toned down, with more gently integrated headlights and softer character lines along the body. That lets the ATS blend in easily with its luxury competitors, while still standing distinctively on its shorter wheelbase. The interior of the ATS focuses on the driver, with a flowing design highlighted by ambient lighting and a range of available interior trim finishes, from wood to metal to carbon fiber.</p>, <p>The ATS rides on a platform that's shared with the larger CTS and the latest Chevrolet Camaro. The ATS sedan comes in rear- or all-wheel-drive form. The sedan's base powerplant was a 2.5-liter direct-injection 4-cylinder with 202 horsepower and 191 pound-feet of torque that was retired for 2017; a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 is rated at 272 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. The top engine choice for standard models is GM's 3.6-liter direct-injection V-6, rated at 333 hp and 285 lb-ft of twist.</p>, <p>Six-speed manual and automatic transmissions are available, although the manual is reserved for 4-cylinder models. The base model delivers fuel economy of 21 mpg city, 33 highway and a 0-60 mph time of 7.5 seconds, according to Cadillac. The turbo-4 returns similar fuel economy, while its 0-60 mph time drops to 5.7 seconds. With the 333-hp V-6, 60 mph arrives in 5.4 seconds, and gas mileage checks in at 20 mpg city, 30 highway. In part, the strong fuel economy and acceleration figures are due to the ATS's relatively low curb weight of about 3,400 pounds. The suspension is fully independent, and the ATS's weight is balanced 50/50 front to rear. Handling is not just on par with its primary German competition—we think it's superior in many ways. The ride does lose some suppleness as a result, though.</p>, <p>Like all current Caddys, the ATS features Cadillac's new CUE infotainment system. CUE uses an 8.0-inch haptic touchscreen on the dash and a 5.7-inch configurable screen in the gauge cluster to control everything from navigation and audio, to climate control and vehicle settings. Like Ford's MyFord Touch, CUE can be operated by voice commands. The instrument panel also has touch-sensitive buttons that can control main audio and climate-control functions quickly. It's a controversial setup that has its glaring flaws and technical hiccups.</p>, <p>The ATS backs up the in-cabin tech with myriad safety features including eight standard airbags and StabiliTrak. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn't yet rated the ATS, but <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080973_2013-cadillac-ats-rates-five-stars-in-nhtsa-crash-testing">the NHTSA gave the new luxury sedan five stars overall</a>, an excellent score for a compact sedan. Optional technology includes full-speed, range-adaptive cruise control; intelligent brake assist, automatic collision preparation, and more. Cadillac's ATS courts the tech savvy crowd and safety-conscious buyers equally.</p>, <p>Changes for 2015 included the addition of an ATS coupe model. It shares most of the sedan's styling but has a slightly wider track and sheet metal to match. The base 2.5-liter inline-4 is not available in the coupe, which instead starts at the turbo-4 and offers the 3.6 V-6 as an option. The manual is available on the turbo-4 as it is on the sedan, and both rear- and all-wheel drive will be offered on automatic-transmission models. The ATS coupe was the first model to wear Cadillac's new wreathless crest logo.</p>, <p>Also for the 2015 model year, the turbo-4 received a significant upgrade to 295 pound-feet of torque—an increase of 14 percent; horsepower remained constant at 272 hp.</p>, <p>On the feature sheet, the ATS starts out well in base form, with a host of available upgrades to take the sedan or coupe well into high-tech luxury territory. The ATS can be fitted with navigation; expanded media connectivity including USB, SD, and Bluetooth audio streaming; wireless phone charging; wi-fi hotspot; CUE infotainment.</p>, <p>For 2016, the big addition to the ATS lineup was the long-awaited V-Series model, which packs a 450-hp version of the brand's twin-turbo 3.6-liter V-6. Upgrades include plenty of stiffening hardware, big Brembo brakes, performance-tuned Magnetic Ride Control dampers, and a carbon-fiber hood, while other carbon add-ons will be available for the exterior. The rear-drive ATS-V is offered in both sedan and coupe bodies, with the choice of either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. The more powerful CTS-V moves to an automatic-only lineup in its new generation, meaning the ATS-V will be the choice for manual-shifting Cadillac enthusiasts.</p>, <p>For 2017, the ATS shed its base, milksop inline-4 in favor of a simplified powertrain lineup that consists of a very good turbo-4 and a potent V-6. The number of trims was significantly reduced to be more direct: base, Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Premium Performance. Changes for 2018 are few, but include some infotainment updates and a heated steering wheel option.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Traverse is a full-size crossover SUV that seats up to eight with room for cargo. For families who can't live with sliding doors, the Traverse is the un-minivan, minivan.</p>, <p>With the Traverse, Chevy has rivals for mega-selling SUVs that include Honda's Pilot, the Nissan Pathfinder, and the Buick Enclave, as well as the new VW Atlas and the Toyota Highlander.</p>, <p><em style="font-weight: bold;">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_traverse_2018">2018 Chevrolet Traverse review</a></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevy Traverse</strong></p>, <p>For 2018, Chevrolet has fully redesigned the Traverse for the first time in nearly a decade. It's slightly larger than its predecessor, with all of that extra girth going toward interior space. Its looks are both a little more angular and a little more SUV-like. From a distance, it could almost be a Chevrolet Tahoe but the two are wholly unrelated vehicles. Where the Tahoe is a traditional body-on-frame SUV with a relatively low-tech suspension that's designed for towing and hauling, the Traverse features a unibody design and a car-like suspension.</p>, <p>The Traverse was redesigned for the 2018 model year. It's a ground-up redo of a model that first hit the market in 2009, but its predecessor aged remarkably well. This latest model adopts some styling cues from Chevy's sedan lineup, most notably its sharper grille and sculpted side profile. Even though it's a couple of inches longer than the old model, it hides its extra size well.</p>, <p>Inside, the Traverse features some updated safety and convenience tech, plus improved cargo and passenger room. A new High Country trim level arrives for 2018 as the range-topping model with its own styling touches and more premium features. </p>, <p>Under the new Traverse's hood sits a more powerful 3.6-liter V-6 that now puts out 305 horsepower, a 20 hp improvement over the 2017's same-size V-6. A new 9-speed automatic is the only gearbox on offer, but buyers again have a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. An RS model is also now part of the lineup with its own 2.0-liter turbo-4 rated at 255 hp; it's an odd choice given it is only rated at 23 mpg highway compared to the 25 mpg of the front-wheel drive V-6. </p>, <p><strong>Chevrolet Traverse history</strong></p>, <p>The Chevy Traverse entered the automaker's lineup for the 2009 model year. At the time, it was engineered as a replacement for both the Chevy minivan at the time, the Uplander, and the mid-size TrailBlazer sport-utility vehicle. Since then, it's become a perennial bestseller for Chevy, in a niche somewhere between the five-passenger Equinox crossover and the big Tahoe and Suburban truck-based utility vehicles.</p>, <p>The first versions of the Traverse were powered by a competent 3.6-liter V-6 with direct injection. Models equipped with a dual exhaust put out 288 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque, while single-exhaust Traverses make do with 281 hp and 266 lb-ft. The engine offers good low-end torque, making 90 percent of the peak number available from 2,500 to 6,000 rpm. Acceleration was solid, and the Traverse is even a good option for those with occasional towing needs.</p>, <p>The powertrain also affords it good fuel economy and performance. Despite weighing around 5,000 pounds, the Chevrolet Traverse achieved fuel economy of 15 mpg city, 22 highway, 18 combined in front-wheel-drive guise—much better than the more truck-like TrailBlazer it succeeded. All-wheel-drive versions fare slightly worse, achieving ratings of 15/22/17 mpg, according to the EPA. The impressive figures (for such a big vehicle) are helped by the Traverse's 6-speed automatic transmission. Upshifts are very smooth, although the transmission can hesitate when called upon to downshift.</p>, <p>There's seating for up to eight in the three-row Traverse; second-row captain’s chairs are also available, which reduce carrying capacity to seven. The Chevrolet Traverse is also one of the safer vehicles in its class, scoring well in independent crash testing and in NHTSA crash tests as well. It's one of very few models to offer an airbag between the front two occupants.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/traverse">Chevrolet Traverse</a> was available in three trims—LS, LT, and Premier—as well as front- and all-wheel-drive configurations. All models have four-wheel independent suspension and StabiliTrak stability control, as well as wheel sizes measuring 17, 18, or 20 inches. Some of the vehicle’s options include a rearview camera, a power liftgate, a DVD player and XM Satellite Radio, plus heated and cooled front seats. Higher trims can also be fitted with a rear spoiler, 20-inch aluminum wheels, a dual-exhaust system, perforated leather, and a panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>The 2013 Chevrolet Traverse <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1075228_2013-chevrolet-traverse-walkthrough-video">was given a refreshed appearance</a>, with a new front end more like the one on the Malibu sedan, as well as taillights similar to those on the Camaro. Also new to the Traverse lineup was the Chevrolet MyLink system, which includes a 6.5-inch touchscreen, smartphone integration and easy streaming—with a smartphone and data plan—of Pandora and Stitcher smartphone-based entertainment.</p>, <p>More brightwork was used on the outside, and interior materials were significantly improved, but other than that the design was mostly unchanged. The powertrain got some new programming, although the V-6 and 6-speed automatic remain mechanically the same. Blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alerts were included on the LTZ; and the front center airbag was made standard on all models.</p>, <p>For 2015, Chevy altered the Traverse's 18-inch wheel design, added Siri Eyes Free functionality to the infotainment system, and changed some exterior colors. A new interior color combination was also added to the list of available treatments. Few changes were made for the 2016 and 2017 model years as Chevy prepared to replace the Traverse with a new crossover for the 2018 model year.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_camaro
[<p>The Chevrolet Camaro is a two-door performance coupe or convertible with a long pedigree. Like its decades-long rivals, the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger, the Camaro is recognizable even by those who don't follow or have much enthusiasm for cars.</p>, <p>The classic formula hasn't changed: business in the front, party in the back. Wait, that's "Camaro hair." The Camaro's automotive formula is power up front, driven wheels in the back—performance and style come first.</p>, <p>A new Camaro was introduced for 2016. The lineup includes a turbo-4, as well as V-6 and V-8 models, in both coupe and convertible form.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_camaro_2018">2018 Chevrolet Camaro review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>The latest Chevy Camaro rides on GM's Alpha rear-drive architecture, shared with the Cadillac CTS sedan and ATS sedan and coupe.</p>, <p>The new Camaro is significantly lighter and smaller than its predecessor, which gives it a more nimble feel and improved fuel economy. Styling is reminiscent of the last-generation model with fewer sharp creases and a tidier overall package, as well as a much more attractive cockpit, albeit one with a smaller back seat.</p>, <p>Coupe and convertible body styles are offered with a choice of four powerplants. They include a 275-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbo-4; a 335-hp, 3.6-liter V-6; a 455-hp, 6.2-liter LT1 V-8; and the new 650-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter LT4 V-8. With each of these engines, there’s a choice between a 6-speed manual gearbox or an automatic transmission. The LT4 comes with a new 10-speed automatic, while the others get an 8-speed auto. For the turbo-4, GM estimates a 5.4-second 0 to 60 mph time. That drops to 5.0 seconds with the V-6. With the V-8-powered SS, it's pegged at 4.0 seconds. The ZL1 is even quicker.</p>, <p>Inside, the sixth-generation Camaro has good front seat room, but a very tight rear seat. Chevy offers 7.0- and 8.0-inch versions of its MyLink infotainment system, both with Apply Car Play and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The Chevrolet Camaro SS was named <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/bestcartobuy"><em>Motor Authority's</em> Best Car To Buy 2016</a>, over rivals like the Ford Shelby GT350 Mustang.</p>, <p>For 2017, Chevy adds the supercharged, 650-horsepower V-8 Camaro ZL1 for both the coupe and the convertible. Also new are the 1LE handling package, a 50th Anniversary Edition package, a “FIFTY” badge on the steering wheel of all models, and a Teen Driver feature that allows parents to set controls and review driving habits.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Camaro history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>Introduced in 1967 as a response to the stunning success of the Ford Mustang, the Camaro has had its ups and downs in its 50 years on the car scene. Paired until the early 2000s with a companion Pontiac Firebird, the Camaro has been offered in six different generations as a two-door sports coupe, with V-6 or V-8 power and rear-wheel drive. Special editions have included the Camaro RS, Camaro SS, and Camaro IROC-Z, and convertible and T-top body styles.</p>, <p>Until 2002, GM had built the Camaro in each model year for 35 consecutive years, but GM decided to kill the muscle car in 2002, ending production of the then-composite-bodied Camaro in Canada.</p>, <p>The Camaro nameplate wasn't revived until the 2010 model year, when the car was relaunched as a coupe. It retained the same basic setup—a choice of V-6 or V-8 engines, manual or automatic transmissions, and rear-wheel drive—but was somewhat larger than the car that preceded it. It used a rear-drive architecture that was originally planned for use throughout GM, including in Buick and Cadillac luxury vehicles, but only found a home under the Pontiac G8, a handful of Holdens, the Chevy Caprice fleet vehicle, and Chevy's SS sedan. GM built this Camaro at its factory in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada.</p>, <p>The fifth-generation Camaro took its cues from classic 1960s models. The homage pieces included vent-like indents in front of the rear wheels and the brow over the headlights. The interior of the Camaro used square gauges and additional meters at the base of the center stack, as well as a deep-dish steering wheel that recalled the 1967 model.</p>, <p>Base editions of the fifth-generation Camaro got a 323-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 used in other GM cars, coupled to 6-speed manual or automatic gearboxes. The Camaro SS borrowed the previous-generation Corvette's 6.2-liter V-8, offering it in two detuned strengths—a 400-hp version with a 6-speed automatic, and a 426-hp variant teamed to the 6-speed manual. Convertible versions were available for both the SS and V-6 models.</p>, <p>New for <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1072064_2012-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-first-drive">2012 was the ZL1</a>, a 580-hp beast that rode on magnetic dampers and bore an even fiercer look than the SS. It was joined in the 2013 model year by a convertible edition.</p>, <p>Older Camaros have been derided for clunky handling from live-axle rear ends; the fifth-generation Camaro rode on an independent rear suspension and simply drove better, smoother, and with less twitchiness than ever before. That was even more the case with the SS and with its <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078078_2013-chevrolet-camaro-1le-priced-from-37035">1LE package</a>, which received tires sized identically front to back, stiffer anti-roll bars, and other suspension revisions to give it neutral, track-ready handling. This Camaro even offered a special <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080122_chevrolet-camaro-hot-wheels-edition-can-be-yours-video">Hot Wheels edition</a> for the nostalgic collector.</p>, <p>An updated 2014 Camaro brought slightly redefined looks, including a rather significant visual re-working of the front end, with a narrower headlight and grille opening adding a dose of aggression. (ZL1 models kept the older front end for better cooling.) The 2014 Camaro also saw the return of the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083204_2014-chevrolet-camaro-sees-the-return-of-the-z-28">famous Z/28 model</a>—in a more fiercely track-inspired form than ever.</p>, <p>The 2015 Camaro carried forward 2014's updates essentially unchanged. Chevy offered several special editions, including the Green Flash and Commemorative Edition models, which played with the aesthetics and added various options to create new packages.</p>]

The latest Equinox is 5 inches shorter than the outgoing model and more than 400 pounds lighter in an effort to better compete with rivals like the Ford Escape, Subaru Forester, Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4.</p>, <p>A trio of turbocharged engines is now available: a 170-horsepower 1.5-liter turbo-4, a 252-hp 2.0-liter turbo-4, and a 1.6-liter turbodiesel rated up to 40 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>An updated interior in the 2018 models included a 7.0- or 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and softer interior materials. While the overall length and wheelbase was significantly reduced, interior size didn't change much in to the new generation.</p>, <p>The exterior styling was updated significantly for the 2018 model, and the Equinox was made sharper, although not as dramatic as the mechanically related GMC Terrain. </p>, <p>The new Equinox comes with more available advanced safety features than before. In addition to GM's rumble safety seat that alerts drivers of potential crashes, the Equinox comes with an available surround-view safety system, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, blind spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert, and a teen driver feature that reports on guest driver behavior.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Equinox history</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation Equinox debuted in 2005, one of four then-new crossover vehicles that used the same underpinnings. Only the Equinox survives; the other three have passed into history (they were the Saturn Vue, Pontiac Torrent, and Suzuki XL7).</p>, <p>That 2005 Equinox was positioned as a "just right"-sized crossover utility vehicle—a little larger than compact crossovers like the Ford Escape, but a little smaller than three-row mid-size entries like the Toyota Highlander.</p>, <p>The first generation of the Equinox was offered with front- or all-wheel drive, and 4- or 6-cylinder engines, through the 2009 model year. While reviewers appreciated the interior room of the first Equinox, its antiquated, coarse V-6 engine and bland styling were outdone by competitors from Honda, Ford, Toyota and Subaru. </p>, <p>In 2008, Chevrolet added a smoother, more powerful V-6 to the Equinox lineup (and to the Pontiac Torrent as well).</p>, <p>The last-generation Equinox debuted for 2010. Power came from either a 182-horsepower inline-4 or a 301-hp V-6. Both were mated to 6-speed automatic transmissions with front-wheel drive standard or optional all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Equinox saw few major changes from 2010 to 2016, although it received some of the latest connectivity and active-safety features. Those include lane-departure warning and forward collision alert, plus Chevy's MyLink system, for easier hands-free calling and media access. In 2013, the Equinox introduced a combination of MyLink and touchscreen navigation, while a new 301-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 replaced the 3.0-liter V-6 as the top-level powertrain.</p>, <p>A refreshed Equinox arrived for the 2016 model year. The formula changed very little, and there were no major mechanical updates. Instead, the 2016 Equinox receives revised front and rear styling, with a new grille and headlights and resculpted lighting units in the rear. Inside, the materials have been improved, and the 2016 model added a few new options, including the advanced safety features already offered on the GMC Terrain Denali. Since the 2018 arrived as an all-new model, the Equinox didn't change substantially for a shortened 2017 model year. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_volt
[<p>The Chevrolet Volt is a compact plug-in hybrid hatchback that is the only range-extended electric car sold in high volumes in the world. It functions in a few different ways: at first it operates as electric car off battery power—from 35 to 53 miles, depending on model year—and then switches into a hybrid mode where a gasoline engine and its electric motors jointly power the car.</p>, <p>Chevrolet has wavered on clearly explaining those systems, but one thing is clear: the Volt was the first of its kind from General Motors. It helped ease some owners into electric-car ownership and set the table for the Bolt EV to come later.</p>, <p>With the Volt, Chevy has rivals for vehicles including the Toyota Prius Prime, Hyundai Ioniq, and Kia Niro.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 are limited mostly to a few new paint colors and the deletion of a formerly standard leather-wrapped steering wheel on LT models.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_volt_2018">2018 Chevrolet Volt review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevrolet Volt<br/></strong></p>, <p>The latest version of Chevy's extended-range electric vehicle retains all of the Volt's strongest attributes while fixing most of the shortcomings of the previous model. Not only does it have that 53-mile electric range, but also its EPA fuel-efficiency rating when the engine switches on is 42 mpg combined. It's slightly less expensive than the previous Volt, though its starting price before incentives is still more than $30,000.</p>, <p>The styling may be the biggest departure from the outgoing model, with smoothed-over, flowing lines taking the place of the somewhat slab-sided and crisp design of the original. The overall Volt silhouette stays relatively similar, ensuring continued aerodynamic slipperiness that's needed to achieve big fuel-economy numbers, although with the softer curves the drag-reducing rear slope is much better integrated and even attractive now.</p>, <p>The second-generation Volt uses an 18.4-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack that gives a stellar EPA rating of 53 miles of electric range, about one-third more than the 38-mile rating for 2013-2015 Volts. That range will let Volt owners cover nine of every 10 trips solely on grid power, Chevy says, up from about 80 percent previously.</p>, <p>Its range-extending engine is a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder model from GM's latest global family of 3- and 4-cylinder engines. It delivers 101 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, and runs on regular (87-octane) gasoline. After the Volt's battery pack has been depleted, the engine generates electricity by turning one of the two motor-generators to flow electricity to the battery pack. Total output from the two motors is 111 kilowatts (149 hp) and a remarkable 294 lb-ft of torque. An 8.9-gallon fuel tank and the larger battery give a rated range of 430 miles, substantially higher than the last Volt's 340 or so miles.</p>, <p>The blending of electric motors and gas engine has been optimized around GM research that says 80 percent of cars in the U.S. travel less than 40 miles a day. If you use the Volt that way and recharge it overnight, you may go weeks without the engine ever switching on. But if you need to take a road trip, you can do so without the fear of running out of juice. Volt owners who recharge regularly average almost 1,000 miles between visits to the gas station, which happen less than once a month.</p>, <p>Mounted under the load floor of every second-generation Chevrolet Volt is a charging adapter that connects the car to a standard 120-volt home outlet. Using this charging method, the battery takes between seven and 10 hours to top up a depleted battery. Level 2 charging is also available at public sites and can be installed in a user's garage or parking spot at home or work, with costs usually no higher than $2,000; this method cuts charging time to around four hours.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Volt added optional adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking to its roster of features. </p>, <p><strong>Chevy Volt history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The first Volt was new for the 2011 model year, and took home several major awards, including the North American Car of the Year award.</p>, <p>The first-generation Chevrolet Volt didn't change much over its five years, though its lithium-ion battery saw two small increases in capacity. Other than some trim changes, and the roof and tailgate now painted in body color rather than glossy black, the last Gen 1 Volt was pretty similar to the 2011 model that launched GM into the business of selling electric cars in volume.</p>, <p>When the first Volt started out with a fully charged battery, it could travel an EPA-rated 38 miles on electricity alone; once the battery was nearly exhausted, the gasoline-powered generator kicked in to recharge it, extending the driving range for another 300 miles or more. After that, occasional stops at a gas pump could extend the range even farther. The Volt's 38 miles of electric range was delivered by a lithium-ion battery pack located in the tunnel between the front seats and below the two rear seats. After the pack was depleted, the car seamlessly switched on its 1.4-liter gasoline engine, which generated electricity to power the electric motor that actually drove the front wheels. Those fundamentals haven't really changed in the second-generation Volt.</p>, <p>Over time Chevy's specs for the first Volt inched ahead. In 2013, Chevy slightly increased the energy capacity of the lithium-ion battery pack, from the original 16 kilowatt-hours to 16.5 kwh, and the usable portion of that energy from 10.3 to 10.8 kwh. That boosted the Volt's EPA-rated electric range from 35 to 38 miles, and it raised the 2013 Volt's efficiency rating from 94 to 98 MPGe, or "miles per gallon equivalent"—the distance the car can travel electrically on the amount of energy contained in a single gallon of gasoline. For 2015, the battery capacity rose again—though this time the ratings stayed the same.</p>, <p>The EPA assigned the first Volt a rating of 98 MPGe over a standard test cycle that blends both pure electric and range-extending gasoline modes.</p>, <p>GM took criticism for the Volt's unadventurous exterior styling, but the interior was seen as more modern, with an Apple-like feel to its glossy plastic control panel. Packaging in the first Volt was another area of concern for some: The Volt's lithium-ion battery pack sits in the tunnel between the seats and under the rear seat. The first Volt could hold four people and some luggage comfortably, but had less interior space than Chevy's similarly-sized Cruze compact four-door sedan.</p>, <p>The options list of the Volt gradually expanded over the years, although 2011 models came with a richer selection of standard equipment than did the 2012s. No sunroof was offered, and there were limited color and wheel options. A low-energy Bose audio system was available, along with a navigation system, leather upholstery, and a selection of interior graphic treatments and finishes.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Bolt EV compact hatchback was launched in 2017 and is the first affordable electric car with a 200-mile range ever sold in the U.S.</p>, <p>It isn't the first electric car, nor is it the one with the longest range. It's not the least expensive, nor is it the most spacious. The Bolt EV's "first" is that it's the first to blend seamlessly into the roadways as "just another car" that's powered by an electric motor.</p>, <p>With the Bolt EV, Chevy has a competitor for the Tesla Model 3, Volkswagen e-Golf, and Nissan Leaf.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_bolt_2018" title="2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV - review">2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>All Bolt EVs are assembled in Michigan, although many of the car's powertrain and display components come from GM's development partner LG Chem in South Korea.</p>, <p>While it is built in the same Orion, Michigan assembly plant as the next-generation Chevy Sonic subcompact, the Bolt EV rides on its own dedicated platform, with a wide, flat lithium-ion battery pack under the cabin floor and an electric motor powering the front wheels.</p>, <p>But it's the 238-mile EPA-rated range that's really the Bolt EV's calling card. That's a capability otherwise available solely in cars with a Tesla badge, at prices of $70,000 and up. It's delivered by a 60-kilowatt-hour battery pack that powers a 150-kilowatt (200-horsepower) motor driving the front wheels. The Bolt's overall weight is about 3,580 pounds, according to the manufacturer. Official charging times haven't yet been announced.</p>, <p>Walking up to the Bolt EV, it appears a bit smaller than the Leaf on the road—perhaps due to its short overhangs—but the car is wide for its length and actually larger in person than it appears from a distance. The nose has a Volt-like "grille" blanking panel, flanked by light units that wrap around and sweep most of the way back to the base of the windshield posts. A larger opening below provides an air intake.</p>, <p>A body-side crease sweeps up toward the rear, with the bottom of the window line climbing even higher at its back end. The rear has a relatively vertical hatch opening onto a spacious load bay with 16.9 cubic feet of cargo volume.</p>, <p>The Bolt EV's cabin is light and airy, and the remarkably thin front seats give an extra inch of rear leg room compared to regular seats. Four adults can ride comfortably, though the "five-passenger" description is pushing it.</p>, <p>Passenger volume is 94.4 cubic feet, against 92.4 cubic feet for a Nissan Leaf—and only 94 cubic feet for the much larger Tesla Model S. The Bolt's interior is "two segments larger" than the car's exterior size would suggest, said development engineers.</p>, <p>The lack of an engine let Bolt EV designers move the windshield base down and forward, letting them rake the large glass at almost the same angle as its short hood. Frontal vision from the driver's seat is exceptional, which will make the Bolt easy to park.</p>, <p>The seats are comfortable, and all occupants sit upright, and higher than they do in the more rakish Volt. The slim dash and console and the car's flat floor make the front footwells especially wide, and outward visibility is excellent.</p>, <p>The dashboard has both a central 10.2-inch touchscreen built into the top of the console and a fully digital 8.0-inch instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. The Bolt EV also uses General Motors' new digital rearview mirror; its rear-facing camera gives a wide 80-degree image in the crisp digital display that replaces the mirror glass, against 22 degrees for a conventional mirror.</p>, <p>There's no spare tire, but neither is there an inflator kit; the electric Bolt will be the first car on the market to use the latest development of Michelin's self-sealing tire technology. A portable 120-volt charging cord is housed under the load bay, Chevy expects most Bolt EV users to recharge its large battery pack at 240-Volt Level 2 charging stations.</p>, <p>The Bolt accelerates confidently even with four adults in the car. GM quotes acceleration from 0 to 60 mph at less than seven seconds, and we found we could chirp the inside front tire under full power out of a turn. It corners relatively flat on its 17-inch alloy wheels, and the steering had a nice positive self-centering action. We didn't hear any motor or electronics whine, and the brake feel was consistent enough that the  transitions between regenerative and friction braking was imperceptible.</p>, <p>The standard Drive mode behaves just like a car with a conventional automatic transmission (minus the shifting), complete with idle creep. A paddle behind the left side of the steering wheel lets the driver increase the regenerative braking rate. Low mode, which many drivers will come to prefer, provides so-called "one-pedal driving," including the ability to slow right down to a full stop without touching the brake pedal. It's a smoother, calmer, more relaxing way to drive.</p>, <p>The base price of the Bolt EV is $37,500 before incentives, with higher trim levels and options pushing it above $40,000. The car qualifies for a $7,500 federal income-tax credit, as well as a $2,500 purchase rebate in California and other states with similar incentives.</p>, <p>Changes for the 2018 model year were minimal: The heated steering wheel now switches on automatically when the car determines cabin temperature warrants it. Otherwise, the Bolt EV's second model year is essentially identical to its first.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Corvette is a high-performance two-seater coupe or convertible and one of the most revered names in automotive history. The newest Corvette, dubbed C7, is a tribute to the cars that helped put Chevrolet on the map.</p>, <p>Even in base form, the new Corvette can brag of 0-60 mph runs in less than four seconds and almost 30 mpg on the highway. In Z06 trim, Chevrolet says the Corvette can run to 60 mph even quicker—less than three seconds. That's supercar territory for around $80,000.</p>, <p>That's a remarkable evolution from the Corvette's comparatively tame history. When it arrived in 1953, the first Corvettes were powered by an anemic 3.8-liter inline-6 and featured paleolithic solid axles. The new version? Up to 650 horsepower with advanced suspension magic via Magnetic Ride Control.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_corvette_2018">2018 Chevy Corvette review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevy Corvette<br/></strong></p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081612_2014-chevrolet-corvette-the-stingray-goes-high-tech">seventh-generation Corvette</a>, introduced in 2013 as a 2014 model, draws on GM's global resources for its new design—the first time the Corvette team has looked outside the U.S. for help shaping the iconic 'Vette. The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080043_2014-chevrolet-corvette-c7-gets-new-lt1-v-8">2014 Chevy Corvette Stingray received a new LT1 V-8 engine</a>, designed specifically for the sports car. The new engine makes 455 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque, with more than 400 lb-ft of torque available between 2,000 and 4,000 rpm.</p>, <p>The base Corvette Stingray can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds when equipped with the 8-speed automatic transmission—a figure that ties the 2012 Z06 Corvette’s time. The 8-speed was introduced for 2015; for 2014, the automatic was a 6-speed unit. Direct injection, cylinder deactivation, and tall gearing allow the V-8 to deliver decent highway fuel economy as high as 26 mpg.</p>, <p>Other improvements of the seventh-generation car over the previous iteration include a partially aluminum chassis even in base model vehicles, which helps torsional rigidity and sharpens handling even further. The standard manual-transmission car features a 7-speed gearbox with an automatic rev-matching function and can accelerate to 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds.</p>, <p>A <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082704_2014-chevrolet-corvette-stingray-convertible-live-photos-video-from-geneva-debut">Stingray Convertible</a> is also part of the seventh-generation fold, offering nearly identical performance thanks to a chassis design that included its eventual topless configuration from the start. For the first time ever, the Z06 is also available as a convertible, and even the standard Z06 coupe gets a removable roof panel like the Stingray. Previously, the Z06 was only available as a fixed-roof coupe.</p>, <p>A Z51 performance package is available for the C7 Corvette, adding an electronic limited-slip differential and dry-sump oiling for the engine, plus upgraded brakes among other upgrades.</p>, <p>The Z06, which joined the lineup for 2015, is a real budget supercar, and almost a combination of the previous ZR1 and Z06 ideals, with big power and even more focused track manners. GM claims that it will hit 60 mph in 2.95 seconds, with prices starting at around $80,000. The supercharged 6.2-liter V-8, code-named LT4, puts out 650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, making it the highest-output Corvette, or GM vehicle, ever produced. The 'Vette team also paid close attention to the Z06's aerodynamics, with an optional high-downforce package, adjustable wings, lots of carbon-fiber elements, and available carbon-ceramic brakes. The Z06 uses a version of the aluminum structure that debuted on the C7 Stingray coupe and convertible. It is sold with a removable roof or convertible top, and with the choice of either a 7-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Because the Corvette team never stops iterating, there were several changes for the 2016 model year. Both the Stingray and Z06 got a passel of new aesthetic options—new interior, stitching, and paint colors; an available carbon hood with a section of visible weave; and several new design packages. A power-cinch feature was added for the hatch/trunk latch, and a front curb view camera became optional on upper trim levels. On the Stingray, Magnetic Ride Control was made available without the Z51 package and with the Z51's wheels and spoiler. The Z06 was offered in a limited-run C7.R Edition package, too.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1105125_2017-chevrolet-corvette-grand-sport-first-drive-review">Corvette Grand Sport joined the lineup</a>. With the Stingray's naturally aspirated V-8 but most of the Corvette Z06's handling hardware, the Grand Sport became the track-ready 'Vette and, for most drivers, the real base car in the Corvette family. On other models, very few changes were made, mostly to trim and paint.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 aren't as extensive. All models now get 19- and 20-inch wheels instead of 18s and 19s for the base versions, HD radio becomes standard, Magnetic Ride Control becomes a standalone option, the available Performance Data Recorder can report more information, and a Spice Red convertible top is now available. To celebrate the Corvette's 65th anniversary, the Grand Sport and Z06 also get Carbon 65 Edition packages. Both come with carbon fiber on the rear spoiler, rear ducts, side skirts, and wheel center caps. Inside, they add sport seats, black suede trim with contrasting blue stitching, and carbon fiber on the steering wheel. A total of 650 will be built, all for a $15,000 premium. </p>, <p>A Corvette ZR1 model arrives for the 2019 model year, as the ultimate evolution of the C7 Corvette before an expected mid-engine version bows for the 2019-2020 model year.</p>, <p><strong>Corvette History</strong></p>, <p>The Chevy Corvette started its legendary run in 1953 and has seen years of nearly continuous production in Flint, Michigan, then St. Louis, Missouri, and now in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Over time it has constantly evolved to lead performance and value, with occasional lows and numerous highs along the way. Though it has little domestic competition, cars as disparate as the Audi R8, Porsche Boxster and 911, and Nissan's GT-R and 370Z can be considered rivals in terms of performance and/or price.</p>, <p>The Corvette wasn't always a spec-slayer. The first 1953 models featured solid rear axles and inline-6s, though in 1955, the V-8 became standard. When the second-generation "Sting Ray" model debuted in 1963, independent rear suspension was added and output was increased to 360 hp. A big-block 6.5-liter model was added in 1965, before the famous 427-cubic-inch (7.0-liter) engine joined in 1966. The third-gen car debuted in 1968, running for 13 years until 1982—the longest stretch for any of the various Corvette generations. The new, fender-flared body style was the biggest change to the line, along with a three-year run for the ZR-1 performance edition, though emissions and fuel regulations conspired to restrict power output and potential of Corvettes throughout the 1970s.</p>, <p>Corvette production somewhat famously skipped the 1983 model year. The fourth-generation car hit the street in 1983 as a 1984 model, bringing with it a complete redesign of the car aside from the engine, with a sleek, modern design and digital instruments, as well as the second ZR-1 performance version. The fifth-gen car, introduced in 1997, saw another major upgrade, with improved build quality, increased performance, and better handling the result. The Z06 model was introduced in 2001, and engines continued to be upgraded, producing up to 405 hp in the Z06.</p>, <p>The sixth Corvette generation began in 2005, bringing with it all-new bodywork and improved suspension. Power climbed to 400 hp for the base Corvette initially, then up to 430 hp for its 6.2-liter LS3 V-8 engine, and 505 hp for the 7.0-liter Z06 in that generation. The ZR1 was added back to the lineup (without the hyphen) in late 2007 as a 2008 model, producing 638 hp from a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine. The C6 was available in base Coupe and Convertible, as a Grand Sport version with upgraded brakes and special bodywork, as the track-ready Z06, and as the supercar-rivaling ZR1.</p>, <p>The Coupe and Convertible were the standard Corvettes, with 430 hp output and all the conveniences of a modern car, including available Bluetooth on some models, a choice of 6-speed manual or automatic transmission, and available leather interior. The Grand Sport was also available as both a coupe and convertible, though the coupe received a few performance upgrades over the soft-top, including a dry-sump oil system when equipped with the 6-speed manual transmission, plus the upgraded brakes and flared fenders that both variants get. The Corvette Z06 upped the performance ante with extensive use of carbon-fiber body panels and components, an aluminum frame, and a 505-hp engine. The ZR1 was king of the hill, its massive power output combined with Brembo ceramic carbon brakes, visible carbon fiber weave components, and a 205-mph top speed. Despite huge power and impressive performance figures, the brawny engines and tall gears in the Corvette enable it to achieve up to 26 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>While 2012 brought no major changes to the Corvette range, an updated interior, some new technology packages, and a selection of new exterior paint colors enhanced the offerings. The Corvette's high-performance Z06 and ZR1 models received updated performance packages as well. For the 2013 model year, a new 427 Convertible Collector Edition was added, pairing the Z06's LS7 V-8 engine with a Corvette Convertible body and unique 60th Anniversary touches. A 60th Anniversary Package was offered on all 2013 model Corvettes, adding a special touch to celebrate six decades of the nameplate. The sixth-generation (C6) Corvette set new benchmarks for the capabilities of a relatively affordable street-legal sports car, while its successor would take performance to even higher levels.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV with blue-collar roots. It's distantly related to a pickup truck, which means its ideally suited for towing and hauling lots of people and gear. It's not as big as the Chevy Suburban, but not many things are.</p>, <p>With the Tahoe, Chevrolet has a rival for vehicles like the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada, and Toyota Sequoia—not to mention GM's own family of Suburban, Yukon and Escalade utility vehicles.</p>, <p>In top luxe models, the Tahoe fights with full-sizers from Mercedes-Benz and others—no kidding. In some cases, the Tahoe can cost just as much as luxury-branded cars.</p>, <p><strong><em><em>MORE: Read our</em> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_tahoe_2018">2018 Chevy Tahoe review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevrolet Tahoe</strong></p>, <p>The Tahoe's been a survivor because of its no-nonsense design and its durability. Most recently redesigned for the 2015 model year, today's Tahoe is better focused on its mission of providing seating for eight in comfort, while able to tow up to 8,500 pounds. Nine-passenger seating is also available on base models equipped with an optional front bench seat in place of the standard buckets.</p>, <p>In the 2014 model year, GM introduced the first vehicles on its updated full-size SUV/truck architecture. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/gmc_sierra-1500_2014">2014 GMC Sierra</a> and <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_silverado-1500_2014">2014 Chevy Silverado</a> trucks adopted a new body structure, more angular looks, and received new powertrains including an updated 5.3-liter V-8 and a reworked 4.3-liter V-6.</p>, <p>The Tahoe shared many of those updates when it was new a year later, but it doesn't offer the V-6 engine. The Tahoe offers as base GM's 5.3-liter V-8, which is coupled to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The V-8 is rated at 355 hp and 383 lb-ft of torque. It can be had in both rear- and four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Coupled with the sharp new look and drivetrain are new technology options and improved comfort. The Tahoe's manners on the road are impeccable, especially with the newly optional adaptive shocks, and the cabin is also much quieter than the previous model's, matching nicely with the more comfortable seating and more stylish look. Third-row access is better because the second row of seats now folds flat, and there is a couple more inches of second-row leg room, which helps those in row two get comfortable and also makes climbing to the way-back a little easier. On models with front bucket seats, the Tahoe tops off a revised safety package with GM's new front-center airbags, which help keep front-seat occupants from striking each other during a collision.</p>, <p>The Tahoe is one of a number of GM vehicles to offer 4G LTE from AT&amp;T, which includes in-car wi-fi hotspot capability and a faster connection to OnStar. The functionality was added mid-way through the 2015 model year with a hardware update, and allows occupants to connect phones, tablets, and other devices to a super-fast LTE connection that beats the speed of mobile devices and also avoids using the data in your cellular plan.</p>, <p>New features added through the 2016 model year include a touchscreen infotainment system, lane-keeping assist, and Apple CarPlay. Changes for 2017 were minor—mostly trim and features repackaging—save for the addition of automatic emergency braking, a teen-driver alert system, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Tahoe lineup grows with the addition of the RST—or Rally Sport Truck—package that's optionally available. In addition to a more buttoned-down suspension with unique styling bits, the RST can be upgraded with a 6.2-liter V-8 and Brembo brakes. Also, a new Custom trim package lets buyers save thousands with the deletion of the otherwise standard third row of seats.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Tahoe history</strong></p>, <p>The Tahoe arrived in the 1995 model year, replacing the Blazer badge and was teamed with a four-door model. Based on the big GM trucks, the Tahoe was powered in most cases by a big 5.7-liter V-8. A turbodiesel version found few applications and few buyers. In this generation, sold until the 1998 model year, GM added a driver-side airbag and a luxury-trim Limited package, which was sold in the 2000 model year. This version overlapped with the entirely new "GMT800" Chevy Tahoe, which was new for the 2000 model year.</p>, <p>The 2000-2006 Chevy Tahoe again offered a choice of V-8 engines, either a 4.8-liter V-8 or a 5.3-liter V-8, separated only by 10 hp. A 4-speed automatic took care of shifting in all versions, and the Tahoe came in rear- or four-wheel-drive versions. A more genteel look wasn't quite matched by a lackluster interior, but with good towing capacity and additions like stability control and more airbags, the Tahoe rode the SUV wave of popularity to become a best seller in the Chevy truck lineup.</p>, <p>GM advanced its plans to replace the GMT800 trucks and SUVs with a GMT900 family of vehicles—and the 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe proved the move worthy in mechanical terms, even if SUV sales were about to fall off a proverbial cliff. The new Tahoe's crisp lines, and improved body rigidity lent it a mature, even sophisticated look—one matched by a handsome interior. All the towing and hauling capability carried over, with a more comfortable five- or six-seat interior package—but the powertrains got a fuel-economy boost that was offset on the marketing side by the addition of a 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8.</p>, <p>Chevy introduced a Tahoe Hybrid in the 2009 model year. It used a 6.0-liter V-8 making 332 hp backed by a two-mode transmission that was engineered with cooperation among General Motors, Daimler, and Chrysler. Fuel economy ratings were as high as 20 mpg in the city and 23 highway. The large battery pack was located below the second row of seats, which compromised space and interior flexibility, while towing was also down, to a max of 5,000 pounds.</p>, <p>Through 2013, changes were minimal to the Tahoe lineup. Trailer Sway Control was added for 2012, and Powertrain Grade Braking was a new addition for 2013; both enhance towing stability and safety. The Tahoe Hybrid was dropped after the 2013 model year.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck built for wide-ranging uses: workaday hauler, small family vehicle, even baja runner. It is related to the GMC Canyon.</p>, <p>Once virtually devoid of competitors, mid-size pickups are enjoying a resurgence thanks to skyrocketing prices for full-size models. With the Colorado, Chevy competes against pickups such as the Toyota Tacoma, Honda Ridgeline, and Nissan Frontier. A Ford Ranger isn't far off either, and others may follow soon.</p>, <p>The Colorado nameplate dates back more than a decade, but was benched for a couple of years while General Motors looked to its global operations for a redesign that debuted for the 2015 model year.</p>, <p>In 2017, Chevrolet gave the Colorado a new ZR2 model with a wider track, a lifted suspension, and a trio of lockable differentials. For 2018, it was unchanged.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: See our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_colorado_2018">2018 Chevrolet Colorado review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevrolet Colorado<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The Colorado is offered with a choice of 4- and 6-cylinder engines, with rear- or 4-wheel drive, and with manual or automatic transmissions.</p>, <p>The base engine is a 200 horsepower, 2.5-liter inline-4, available with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. Buyers can also opt for a 3.6-liter V-6 engine, which makes 308 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque and is paired solely to an 8-speed automatic. Both engines feature aluminum blocks and heads and are fitted with direct-injection technology, with the V-6 also featuring cylinder displacement that shuts down two cylinders to save fuel under light load situations.</p>, <p>Initially, the current Colorado debuted with a similarly sized V-6, but it lacked the cylinder displacement technology and it was only available with a 6-speed automatic. </p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, a 181-hp, 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel 4-cylinder was added to the Colorado lineup. It's the most capable version of the pickup truck, and the most fuel-efficient. The EPA rates it up to 25 mpg combined.</p>, <p>The modern body-on-frame underpinnings of the latest Colorado provide impressive payload ratings; diesels can tow up to 7,700 pounds, while 4-cylinder models can pull 3,500 pounds. Most models offer a choice between rear- and four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Inside, Extended Cab and Crew Cab versions both accommodate back-seat passengers, although it's little more than a token effort in the latter. The Colorado is offered in Base, Work Truck, LT, and Z71 trims, with LT models comfort-oriented and well-trimmed inside while the V-6-only Z71 takes on more of an off-road flavor. A Colorado ZR2 was added to the lineup late in 2017 and it's the most extreme mid-size off-road truck yet with its suspension lift, wider track, and three locking differentials.</p>, <p>Cabin comforts are definitely improved versus the last versions of the Colorado, with good audio and smartphone connectivity, available navigation, and in top models, a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system. There's also available OnStar 4G LTE data connectivity, which might help keep those who work out of their trucks.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Colorado history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The Colorado was originally introduced by General Motors back in 2004 as a replacement for the Chevrolet S-10. This version was produced through the 2012 model year and was also sold by GMC as the Canyon mid-size pickup, which replaced the GMC Sonoma. To complicate matters further, the Chevy Colorado and Canyon were developed together with Isuzu, which also sold a version of the pickup truck called the i-series.</p>, <p>Underpinning all three vehicles was the GMT355 platform, a variation of which was used for the Hummer H3 SUV. The platform offered standard, extended and four-door crew cab bodystyles for the Chevrolet Colorado as well as rear- and four-wheel-drive configurations. With a starting price in the teens, the Chevrolet mid-size pickup truck offered great value in this segment and was relatively unique in that a V-8 engine option is available. Its closest rivals, such as the Ford Ranger and Dodge Dakota, were cancelled a model year or two before the Colorado last went out of production.</p>, <p>The 2004 model came with a 2.8-liter 4-cylinder engine rated at 175 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque. For 2005, a new 3.5-liter inline-5 with 220 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque was added to the lineup. The 2007 model saw the base 2.8-liter inline-4 upgraded to a 2.9-liter unit and the 3.5-liter inline-5 growing to a 3.7 liters. Power and torque levels increased accordingly, rising to 185 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque for the four-cylinder and 242 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque for the 5-cylinder.</p>, <p>The biggest change came in the 2009 model year with the introduction of a new V-8 option and a minor facelift. The Vortec V-8 engine displaced 5.3 liters and developed peak output of 300 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque. This model understandably offered the best performance, achieving a maximum towing capacity of 6,000 pounds and a sub-seven-second 0-60 mph acceleration time. At the other end of the spectrum, the 4-cylinder variant offered the best fuel economy, returning an EPA-rated 18 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>Those previous versions of the Chevrolet Colorado were built in Shreveport, Louisiana; the current version is assembled at a plant in Wentzville, Missouri.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Malibu is the automaker's popular mid-size sedan with an available hybrid powertrain, but the name has been around much longer. </p>, <p>Chevy has used the Malibu name for some awe-inspiring land yachts since the 1960s. The modern interpretation is a mid-size stalwart with a decidedly less thirsty approach to fuel consumption—thanks, turbochargers—and touchscreens.</p>, <p>It competes in the savage race for mid-size money with the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, and Hyundai Sonata—just to name a few.</p>, <p>Chevy saw it fit to leave the Malibu as it is for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116128_2019-chevrolet-malibu">2019 Chevrolet Malibu preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevy Malibu</strong></p>, <p>Chevrolet introduced a <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_malibu_2016">new Malibu for the 2016 model year</a>. It wears much more dramatic styling and sits atop a wheelbase that's been stretched by 4 inches compared to the current model, which itself was shorter than its predecessor, something customers apparently didn't appreciate.</p>, <p>Standard models have a choice of turbo-4s, with a 1.5-liter for base models and a 2.0-liter available as an option. The 1.5-liter earns a 37-mpg combined rating. Despite the size increase, Chevy claims a weight loss of about 300 pounds on comparable models.</p>, <p>There's also a new Malibu Hybrid, this time with a system that goes beyond the mild-hybrid setups offered in years past. The new system is essentially based on the battery and motor set from the 2016 Chevrolet Volt. The EPA pegs fuel economy at 47 mpg city, 46 highway, 46 combined for its most efficient Malibu, which beats the ratings of the rest of the mid-size hybrids.</p>, <p>In its latest form, the Malibu was a finalist for the 2016 North American Car of the Year. It's handsome inside and out, and while it isn't a scorching performer, it’s nimble, confident, and responsive in all of its variants. The cabin is spacious and serene—and far more passenger-friendly than the previous model. And with a host of new features, including everything from blind-spot monitors to Apple CarPlay, the new Malibu offers a lot of value for the money.</p>, <p>For 2017, Chevrolet swapped in a 9-speed automatic for its top 2.0-liter turbo-4 engine, but base models make do with a 6-speed. A Teen Driver feature was added to notify parents of over-eager children—or perhaps valet drivers.</p>, <p><strong>Chevrolet Malibu history</strong></p>, <p>Chevy has sold a vehicle named Malibu since the 1960s, but it's evolved over time as tastes changed, from the V-8 and rear-drive Malibus of the 1960s and 1970s gave way to the downsized cars of the 1990s.</p>, <p>In 1997, the first modern Malibu was introduced. A replacement for the Chevy Corsica sedan, this Malibu was a smaller sedan than the most recent vehicle to wear the badge. It also was engineered around a front-wheel-drive architecture.</p>, <p>The 1997 Malibu was, by all measures, a bland car. Powered by an economical 150-hp, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine (a version of GM's much-maligned Quad Four) or 155-hp (later 170-hp), 3.1-liter V-6 (it felt much stronger, actually), the Malibu was only offered with a cushy suspension and 4-speed automatic—and its interior, though it had the comfort basics covered, was drab and dull. Chevy dropped the 4-cylinder engine completely in 2000.</p>, <p>The Malibu got a much-deserved full redesign for 2004. Built on a new global platform, the 2004-2008 Malibu was a bit more refined, handled better, and had a far nicer interior, though it still felt too plasticky on the cheaper trims. The Malibu was a half-step smaller than mid-size entries like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, yet its interior was surprisingly roomy and comfortable. Its powertrain lineup consisted of a nice, fuel-efficient 144-horsepower Ecotec 4-cylinder (with a manual gearbox possible), or a V-6 option. That 201-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 was a little disappointing, saved only by its prodigious torque. A 4-speed automatic was the only transmission, and the combination just didn't feel very refined.</p>, <p>Within this generation only, Chevy offered a hatchback version of the Malibu. It carried the odd name of Malibu Maxx and featured a longer roof and not-quite-wagon shape. While it wasn't terribly sporty, it was originally offered only with the larger engine, a 3.6-liter V-6. Chevy also added an SS variant of the Maxx later in its lifecycle, featuring a 3.9-liter, 240-hp V-6 that was pretty thirsty and not terribly thrilling.</p>, <p>The Malibu boredom was remedied for 2008, when GM completely redesigned the model, making it much longer to better match mid-size rivals. GM also gave it an interior and backseat space that outclassed many sedans its size. The interior wore vastly upgraded materials, and a design that was a clear step better than the layout of the former rental-car favorite. Powertrains included a 169-hp, 2.4-liter version of the Ecotec 4-cylinder engine and a 252-hp, DOHC 3.6-liter V-6, a version of the engine previously used in the Cadillac CTS and SRX, among others.</p>, <p>For a short time, a mild-hybrid version of the 2009 Malibu was offered; it offered very slightly improved fuel economy over the 4-cylinder versions and it failed to catch on. It was discontinued after a very short production run.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Malibu, 2013-2015</strong></p>, <p>The Malibu that's on the way out after 2015 was just introduced for 2013. That car made a bit of an about-face, to focus more on efficiency in packaging, and in fuel efficiency. Chevy chose to make it smaller than its predecessor—it was about 4.5 inches shorter in wheelbase than its predecessor—in order to make room for a new Impala that was launched for the 2014 model year.</p>, <p>Though smaller on the inside, the Malibu boasted advanced safety tech and new infotainment features that are big improvements over the car it replaced.</p>, <p><em dir="ltr" id="tinymce"></em>A new trio of drivetrains was launched with the latest Malibu, making it a 4-cylinder-only car, like the Hyundai Sonata and Ford Fusion. In 2013, the base engine was a 197-hp, 2.5-liter inline-4, but the first model to launch was the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1070609_2013-chevrolet-malibu-eco-first-drive-review">2013 Chevrolet Malibu Eco</a>. That high-MPG model teamed a 2.4-liter inline-4 with a 6-speed automatic and eAssist technology that uses an electric motor and a small lithium-ion battery pack to provide engine stop-start and electric assist for the gasoline engine. Active aero shutters and regenerative braking added up to better fuel economy of 37 mpg highway. At the top of the lineup was a turbocharged 4-cylinder with 259 hp, good for a 0-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds, according to Chevy, and a higher grade of trim, including standard 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Eight airbags, including knee airbags, were standard on this Malibu, and rear side airbags were an option. Bluetooth and a rearview camera were available, as were a forward collision alert system, and a lane-departure warning system. The Malibu offered navigation and smartphone connectivity that allowed streaming of Bluetooth audio and feeds from Stitcher and Facebook.</p>, <p>GM attempted to address several shortcomings of the relatively new Malibu for the 2014 model year. The car was given a mild exterior refresh, with a new grille, headlights, and taillights. Inside, the rear seat was reshaped to increase room for adults. The suspension was also retuned with the goal of supplying better ride control.</p>, <p>For 2015, Chevy further refined the Malibu's powertrain options. The Eco model was no longer offered, while the turbocharged 2.0-liter was reprogrammed to produce more torque. With the figure rising to 295 lb-ft, the Malibu was capable of a 0-60 time of about six seconds. The Malibu also offered a high-speed data connection through AT&amp;T's 4G LTE network, which also allowed owners to set up an in-car wi-fi network for mobile devices.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV that can seat a family of up to nine, stow their gear, and still tow heavy loads with ease. It's the automaker's largest vehicle and shares its running gear with the Chevy Tahoe; the GMC Yukon; and the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.</p>, <p>The Suburban even offers most of the creature comforts afforded by the pricier GMC Yukon XL and Cadillac Escalade ESV.</p>, <p>With the Suburban, Chevy competes most directly with the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada, and Toyota Sequoia. As Chevy's largest SUV, it also makes a good alternative to full-size vans.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_suburban_2018">2018 Chevy Suburban review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p>For 2018, the Suburban lineup added a new RST trim package with a blacked-out look and 22-inch alloy wheels but no performance upgrades. <strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevy Suburban</strong></p>, <p>In addition to being one of the largest SUVs on the market, the Chevy Suburban is also the oldest nameplate among them; the Suburban has been sold in one form or another since the early 1930s.</p>, <p>Chevy's Suburban continues to be a true workhorse. It has a spacious interior, big trailering capacities, a choice of four-wheel-drive systems, and a modern V-8 engine.</p>, <p>The Suburban is the longer version of GM's big SUVs, akin to the GMC Yukon XL, some 20 inches longer than a Tahoe. It can seat up to nine passengers.</p>, <p>The powertrain features a 6-speed automatic coupled to a 5.3-liter V-8 with 355 hp.</p>, <p>Like previous Suburbans, the latest model is spun off the architecture of GM's full-size pickups, specifically the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_silverado-1500_2014">2014 Chevy Silverado</a> and <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/gmc_sierra-1500_2014">2014 GMC Sierra</a>. Those trucks brought with them benefits that also find their way into the Suburban, including improved aerodynamics, better gas mileage, quieter and more highly styled interiors, and new infotainment and connectivity features such as Bluetooth with audio streaming and standard 4G wi-fi hotspot capability coupled with OnStar.</p>, <p>Other new features include active lane control, a power liftgate with programmable height, wireless phone charging, and remote control functions through the OnStar app.</p>, <p>New features added through the 2016 model year include a color touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay functionality. Changes for 2017 were minor—mostly trim and features repackaging—save for the addition of automatic emergency braking, a teen-driver alert system, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. The 2018 lineup added an RST package available on LT and Premier trim levels that's more about looking sporty than going any faster.</p>, <p><strong>Suburban history</strong></p>, <p>The Suburban is an American icon, and a bit of an automotive legend. Beginning in 1933, with only a few years skipped during World War II, the Chevy Suburban has been in production longer than any SUV on the market. It hasn't always been offered with four-wheel drive, but it's always married a wagon body with a truck chassis to meet the needs of big families and small businesses alike. Other car companies, like Chrysler, used to sell vehicles dubbed "Suburban," all with the same theme in mind; GM even sold the Suburban under its GMC and Holden brands over the years, before consolidating the name under Chevrolet in the current generation (GMC's was rebadged the Yukon XL). Only Chevrolet's version has endured.</p>, <p>The first Chevy Suburbans featured wood-paneled bodies, with full metal shells coming on line for 1935. The look of these early models was used as inspiration for the compact Chevy HHR, which was introduced for the 2006 model year. The Suburban took a hiatus from 1943 to 1945 while GM concentrated its manufacturing capacity on the war effort. Beginning in 1948, the Suburban offered seating for eight in a package that's similar to today's, with V-6 and V-8 engines available. Four-wheel drive became an option for 1957, with a split happening in the 1960s that differentiated rear-drive "C" models from four-wheel-drive "K" models. Chevrolet built windowless, commercial-focused Suburbans through the early 1970s.</p>, <p>The 1973-1999 Chevrolet Suburban was one of the longest-lived models in all of automotive history. During that era, Chevy won the right to trademark the Suburban name (in 1988) and continued to update the SUV gradually until a new version was ready. All were four-door wagons, though GM did add a heavy-duty version during this time. Diesel engines, four-wheel drive with automatic locking hubs, anti-lock brakes, fuel injection, and a nine-passenger version were the major milestones of this long era, with a newly styled version marking the modern era for the Suburban in 1994.</p>, <p>The Suburban hit its stride in the 2000-2006 model years, as Americans turned to big SUVs in the era of cheap gasoline. With a choice of V-8 engines, an automatic transmission, a more rigid body and more safety equipment, the Suburban spanned a wide spectrum of duties and owners. Sales boomed; light-duty versions were loaded with rear-seat entertainment and climate-control systems and leather interiors. Heavy-duty versions counted fewer seats but gained impressive towing capacity. GM moved forward a revamped Suburban after the 2006 model year, banking on a big hit—but it arrived just as sales of all big trucks began to plummet.</p>, <p>Few changes were made to the last generation of Suburbans, sold from 2007 to 2014. The model had updated styling, as well as some nifty tech updates for towing that you couldn't: Trailer Sway Control, new for 2012, and Powertrain Grade Braking, added for 2013, both do a lot to keep a trailer-towing vehicle safely under control.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_impala
[<p>The Chevrolet Impala is the automaker's full-size sedan. It's larger than the Malibu, but not by a large margin.</p>, <p>The Impala name has been in the Chevrolet lineup for more than 50 years. Today's version shares its underpinnings with the Cadillac XTS and Buick LaCrosse, and is charged with providing lots of interior space and comfort, inside a very handsomely drawn body.</p>, <p>Its future is uncertain, like many full-size sedans. Buyers are flocking to crossovers and leaving automakers in the lurch for updates and improvements to their stalwart sedans.</p>, <p>With the Impala, Chevy has a rival for the Toyota Avalon, Ford Taurus, and Hyundai Azera in the full-size and mid-size segments. It offers a range of 4- and 6-cylinder engines, excellent handling, a comfortable ride, and a spacious interior.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_impala_2018">2018 Chevrolet Impala review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevy Impala</strong></p>, <p>The 2014 Chevrolet Impala, shown for the first time at the 2012 New York Auto International Show, went on sale in spring 2013. This model is related mechanically to the Cadillac XTS and Buick LaCrosse, and it makes a tremendous leap on all fronts versus the Chevy sedan it replaced.</p>, <p>In its first year on the market, the new Impala offered a choice of three powertrains. The base version was a 2.5-liter inline-4 rated at 195 horsepower, teamed with a 6-speed automatic transmission sending power to the front wheels. GM's eAssist mild-hybrid technology appeared in a gas-saving Eco model, with a 182-hp, 2.4-liter inline-4 that added electrical assist in some operating conditions. The most powerful Impala featured the carryover, 303-hp, 3.6-liter V-6.</p>, <p>Chevrolet trimmed the engine lineup for 2015, removing the mild-hybrid Eco model from the options list. To compensate somewhat, engine stop-start functionality was added to the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine. The base inline-4 scores 25 mpg in combined testing by the EPA, which is lower than the departed Eco's 29 mpg rating.</p>, <p>The current Impala is a spacious, sleek, athletic performer when equipped with the V-6. Handling and comfort are balanced, and the new Impala has earned some great crash-test scores thus far, including a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA. And it should, with all the safety gear it has on board: 10 airbags in all, standard OnStar, and a suite of available advanced features like blind-spot monitors; a lane-departure warning system; adaptive cruise control; a rearview camera; rear parking sensors; and a forward-collision alert system.</p>, <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The infotainment system is improved too. The Chevy MyLink system uses an 8.0-inch touchscreen and steering-wheel controls to interact with Bluetooth audio streaming, available navigation, and smartphone-linked apps. For 2015, the also includes GM's new 4G LTE system, which speeds up the connection to OnStar and also brings quick wi-fi to devices in the car for an extra monthly fee. There were few other changes for the 2015 model year.</p>, <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A new Midnight Edition of the Impala was added for 2015. Based on a SEMA chow car, the package can be added to 1LT, 2LT, and LTZ models and features Jet Black paint, body-color mirror caps, a rear spoiler, 19-inch wheels with black accents, a black grille and grille surround, blacked-out bowtie emblems, a Jet Black interior treatment, and Sport pedals.</p>, <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For 2016, Apple CarPlay has been woven into the Impala's infotainment system. It allows drivers to mirror some phone functions on the vehicle's screen.</p>, <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In 2017, CarPlay and Android Auto were made available on a wider range of trim levels in the Impala and in the following year, Chevy dropped the base infotainment system in favor of an 8.0-inch touchscreen across all models.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Impala: The early years</strong></p>, <p>
Originally introduced in 1958, the Chevrolet Impala has seen ten generations over its lifespan. From finned land yacht to clean rectilinear cruiser, wire wheels to steel hubcaps, the Impala was at the leading edge of sedan design through the late 1950s and all through the 1960s—with some of the most memorable, timeless designs—while the 1970s and 1980s were some of the more forgettable.</p>, <p>The seventh-generation car—which was basically just the high-performance variant of the Caprice sedan—was sold as the Impala SS and remains one of the most easily recognized cars of its era, its smooth and rounded shape at once unassuming and unique. (It has recently been succeeded by the simply named SS sedan, a rear-drive high-performance four-door.) The Impala name took a brief hiatus when the seventh generation went out of production in 1996; the name was revived for an eighth-generation standalone model for 2000-2005, bringing with it a front-wheel-drive layout and a more restrained look.</p>, <p>
<strong>Chevrolet Impala, 2006-2013</strong></p>, <p>The ninth-generation Impala first hit the roads in 2006, offering a 211-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine in the standard car and a 5.3-liter V-8 engine in the Impala SS. Later in the 2006 model year, a new 3.9-liter V-6 was added to the range. In 2007, flex-fuel capability was added for the 3.5-liter engine, and in 2009, the Impala SS was discontinued.</p>, <p>In its waning years, three trim levels were available: LS, LT and LTZ. The LS and LT came standard with a six-speaker audio system, cruise control, OnStar, power driver's seat, sixteen-inch steel (LS) or alloy (LT) wheels, and more. The LTZ added 18-inch alloy wheels, power heated front seats, auto dimming rearview mirror, universal home remote and more. Through 2011, the Impala used a four-speed automatic transmission, with the LS and LT getting power from the 3.5-liter V-6 standard (the LT could be upgraded to the 3.9-liter V-6 engine, which was standard on the LTZ).</p>, <p>Standard safety features included front and side-impact, curtain and rear side airbags, plus front safety belt pretensioners, stability control, and four-wheel disc anti-lock brakes.</p>, <p>For 2012, the Impala soldiered along with the same underpinnings and configuration, but received a number of minor cosmetic improvements, newly standard alloy wheels, and Bluetooth. The bigger news was its new 302-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 and 6-speed automatic transmission, with much improved performance, paired with EPA ratings of 18 mpg city, 30 highway. It's this model that lived on in fleet sales even as Chevy prepared to launch its 10th-generation Impala.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is the automaker's full-size, light-duty pickup truck. It's locked in a perennial fight with its crosstown rival, the Ford F-150, for sales supremacy. The Silverado is related to the GMC Sierra full size pickup.</p>, <p>Competition for the Silverado includes the Ram 1500, Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_silverado-1500_2018">2018 Chevrolet Silverado review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Variety is the hallmark of any good pickup, and the Chevy Silverado keeps pace. It's available in a wide number of configurations that include work-based models all the way up to high-dollar High Country versions. It was last redesigned in 2014 and is a more efficient and pleasant pickup now.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Silverado eAssist mild-hybrid is available nationwide on both LT and LTZ trim levels and a rearview camera is newly standard.</p>, <p>A new Silverado is on the way for 2019. Chevy introduced the pickup at the 2018 Detroit auto show and <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1114784_2019-chevrolet-silverado-revealed-full-size-chevy-gets-leaner-meaner">detailed a host changes for the new truck including a new turbodiesel</a> and a Trailboss off-road edition that will add a 2-inch lift from the factory.</p>, <p><strong>The new Chevrolet Silverado 1500</strong></p>, <p>The Chevy Silverado was extensively refreshed for 2014, with an upright, chiseled look inside and out; a stronger yet more fuel-efficient lineup of engines; quieter, more refined cabins; and a noteworthy set of safety and infotainment technology. The beefier visage nods to the looks of Chevy's HD trucks while adding a luxury-car feature set to the top of the lineup.</p>, <p>Under the hood, the Silverado has been fitted with a new generation of GM V-6 and V-8 engines, all with a common architecture, direct injection, cylinder deactivation, and continuously variable valve timing. Gas mileage, power, and torque are all improved. The base engine is a 285-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6, the mid-level is a 5.3-liter V-8 good for 355 hp, and the top choice is a 6.2-liter V-8 making 420 hp. All used 6-speed transmissions at the beginning, though the 6.2-liter was upgraded to a new 8-speed auto for 2015, and high-line versions of the 5.3-liter V-8 got it in 2016. The new trucks are truly modern and very competitive with their domestic counterparts.</p>, <p>Chevy has added several active-safety features as options on the latest Silverado, including lane-departure warning and collision warning. For 2016, it also got IntelliBeam headlights and active lane keep. The infotainment system uses Chevy's latest MyLink software, which can stream audio from Pandora, connect to Bluetooth phones, and accept voice commands or inputs through its 8.0-inch touchscreen. The processor has been upgraded for 2016, and a version with a 7.0-inch touchscreen has been added for lower line models. The extended-cab trucks have switched to front-hinged short doors, with longer doors available and tied to more rear-seat room on crew-cab models. The tailgate is damped for a soft landing when opened, there are lights in the cargo bed, and the rear bumper has small steps integrated into its corners for easier access to cargo.</p>, <p>Updates were few for 2015. In addition to the new transmission, they included available LTE connectivity for OnStar, which could also be used as a wi-fi hotspot. Chevy also offered a Black Out package for WT (work truck) models, which did exactly what you'd expect to the trim and wheels. The Silverado Custom was also added as an LS double cab with 20-inch wheels, chrome bumpers, chrome mirror caps, and a few other dress-up items, creating what can be referred to as a special-value package.</p>, <p>Other 2016 changes include the addition of wireless phone charging for models with front bucket seats, new power-articulating side steps for the High Country, and an available remote locking tailgate.</p>, <p>For 2017, automatic emergency braking was added to top trim levels, and a teen driver safety feature was added to all trims that can notify parents if teens are speeding, driving too far, or triggering automatic safety systems. Marking 2018, the eAssist mild-hybrid system is now available in every market.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Silverado history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The Silverado has been on sale since 1999, when General Motors gave the name to its C/K pickup trucks developed under the code name GMT800. In that first generation, the Silverado carried on with the rugged look and capability that GM's trucks used to battle the Ford F-150, their sales arch-rival. From the 1999 to the 2006 model year, the Silverado was sold in hundreds of configurations—nearly all of them powered by a V-8 engine teamed to a four-speed automatic transmission. A 5-speed automatic came later, as did GM's first hybrid—which in this case was a very "mild" hybrid which simply stored some recouped energy to feed electrical systems, including a power point in its pickup bed.</p>, <p>In 2007, GM introduced the first of the "GMT900" trucks—the project was accelerated as GM hoped strong sales would lift it back into profitability. While that didn't quite pan out, the GMT900s were an instant success, receiving good reviews for their more upscale styling, rich interiors, and improved drivetrains. The Silverado remained one of the best full-size trucks for its seemingly endless variety of configurations: three body styles that offered seating for up to six in front of a bed that came in short and long variants.</p>, <p>This Silverado shared its running gear with many vehicles across the GM brands. The Chevrolet Silverado, Avalanche, Suburban, and Tahoe all were related, as were the heavy-duty versions of the Silverado and Suburban. GMC's Sierra, Suburban, and Yukon were almost identical to them, spun from the same architecture, as was the Cadillac Escalade. The Hummer H2 was also a distant cousin of these trucks and sport-utility vehicles.</p>, <p>This Silverado also offered a plainer and a quite nice interior design; a choice of four gas engines and a Two-Mode Hybrid model; and rear- or four-wheel drive. The most powerful, 403-hp V-8 Silverado had fuel economy of 12 mpg city, 19 highway, but the Hybrid edition earned ratings of 20 mpg city, 23 highway, according to the EPA. Towing topped out at more than 10,700 pounds. While the Silverado's rear seats were a little too vertical, the interior was as comfortable as the competitors', save for the Ram 1500. Advanced features ranged from a trailer-sway mode in the stability-control system, to dealer-installed wireless internet access.</p>, <p>Changes were minimal going through 2013. Powertrain Grade Braking—to improve stability on hills, when towing—was included for 2013 in all models with the 6-speed automatic.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_trax
[<p>The Chevrolet Trax is a compact crossover that stretches our definition. It's a tall hatchback—or a short wagon—with available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With the Trax, Chevy expanded its utility-vehicle lineup in 2015. It was updated for the 2017 model year with updated looks, a new interior, and better safety gear. A sunroof was made standard on the Trax Premier for the 2018, and Chevy also introduced a new Redline LT trim.</p>, <p>The Trax competes with a growing list of rivals that include the Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3, and the Mini Countryman, and the Subaru Crosstrek. More distant competitors might include the Fiat 500X and Nissan Juke.</p>, <p>The Trax is a close relative of the Buick Encore. The two share drivetrains, architecture and safety systems, but the Buick has more expressive styling and more standard features to appeal to buyers willing to spend a bit more.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_trax_2018" title="2018 Chevrolet Trax - review">2018 Chevrolet Trax review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Trax fits right in with the rest of the Chevrolet small-car lineup, with a rather tall hoodline and blunt snout, showcasing the Chevrolet dual-port grille and bowtie design. That tall nose meets a body that otherwise looks like an elevated hatchback, with some body-side sculpting helping to avoid too much of a slab-sided look. Yet faux skid plates and rubberized wheel-well liners hint at a more rugged side that really isn't there.</p>, <p>For 2017, the front fascia, grille, and headlights take on the look of recent vehicles, such as the Cruze, Volt, and Malibu. The rear fascia is new, too, and LED signature lighting and taillights are available on higher-end models. However, the base model still has budget-grade black door-mirror pedestals, and it lacks roof rails and some chrome trim. Inside, the instrument panel and dashboard have been redesigned for 2017, trading a motorcycle-style instrument display with digital readouts for a more flowing dashboard design with analog gauges, extra bits of chrome trim, and available dashboard contrast stitching.</p>, <p>Somewhat surprisingly, the Trax benefits from some of the so-called Quiet Tuning that went into making the Encore a bit more refined than your average small crossover SUV. Among these measures are thicker window glass and added sound deadening in the dash.</p>, <p>Five seating positions are available, and four adults can fit comfortably in the Trax. It also has hatchback/crossover versatility. In back, you get 60/40-split folding seats that lay flat, and even the front passenger seat will fold flat to accommodate longer items. Cargo space expands from 18.7 cubic feet with the rear seatbacks up, to 48.4 cubic feet with them folded forward, and there are plenty of cubbies for smaller items.</p>, <p>The Trax feels confident but not lively or particularly fun in its handling. Suspension underpinnings are pretty typical for this type of vehicle. A column-mounted electric power steering unit provides maneuverability and responsiveness.</p>, <p>A 138-horsepower, 1.4-liter turbo-4 powers the Trax. It makes 148 pound-feet of peak torque at just 1,850 rpm and is hooked up to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel-economy ratings are 25 mpg city, 33 highway, 28 combined for the front-drive model and 24/30/27 mpg for the all-wheel-drive version. It should be noted that all ratings beat those of an Encore with the same powertrain by 1 mpg, likely due to the Buick's greater weight.</p>, <p>For the U.S. market, the Trax includes 10 standard airbags and a rearview camera system, as well as an electronic stability control system with rollover mitigation, electronic brake force distribution, and brake assist. For 2017, it is available with blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alerts, forward collision alert, and lane departure warning.</p>, <p>The Trax has received a top five-star overall rating from the NHTSA, and earns good scores from the IIHS.</p>, <p>The Trax was originally offered with LS, LT, and LTZ models, but for 2017 the LTZ gives way to the Premier. All models come with OnStar telematics services and MyLink connectivity, which includes a 7.0-inch touchscreen, a USB port, and SiriusXM satellite radio services.</p>, <p>MyLink is compatible with Siri Eyes Free connectivity for iPhone models, and with the BringGo navigation app, which allows smartphone users with the installed app to project maps and directions to the vehicle’s display screen. For 2017, it added Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Chevrolet’s OnStar 4G LTE embedded vehicle data system is also offered in the Trax, potentially turning the vehicle into a wi-fi hotspot when needed.</p>]

[<p>The Chevrolet SS is a four-door sedan with a very small following, but with some serious performance credentials—including rear-wheel drive, a manual transmission, and a V-8 engine.</p>, <p>A lightly reworked Australian-market Holden Commodore sedan, the SS is the next generation of the car once sold in the States as the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/pontiac_g8">Pontiac G8</a>. After Pontiac's demise, the Holden returned with a bowtie.</p>, <p>The SS is the brand's 415-horsepower return to the rear-drive sedan market. With its 6.2-liter V-8 borrowed from the the last-generation Corvette, some say the SS is the equivalent of a Camaro sedan.</p>, <p>The SS will be discontinued after the 2017 model year.</p>, <p><em><strong dir="ltr" id="tinymce">MORE: See our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_ss_2017">2017 Chevrolet SS review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Limited in production, the SS is a relatively rare sight on the roads. It is sold as a halo car for a sedan lineup that now includes the Sonic, Cruze, Malibu, and Impala. Since its time as a Pontiac, the car has gone on a bit of a diet, using aluminum in places such as the hood and fenders to shed weight. It has also finally been gifted with modern telematics, including the navigation system that the G8 lacked.</p>, <p>The SS's look is somewhat generic within the Chevrolet lineup. Look closer, though, and you see traits of a classic rear-drive sedan. It's still a handsome shape, years after similar body panels were introduced on the G8, with a light upkick to its tail and squat muscle-car proportions. The cockpit gets the most updates compared to the Pontiac, with blue interior lighting and other new surfaces and features to bring it up to a more modern pace.</p>, <p>There's only one engine offered in the SS: a 415-horsepower, 6.2-liter small-block V-8 lifted from the Camaro and the last Corvette. For 2014, only a 6-speed automatic was available, while a 6-speed manual was made a no-cost option for 2015. The big V-8 sends its output to the rear wheels, and GM says the SS will run to 60 mph in about 4.7 seconds.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a hyper-miling sedan, perhaps you've missed the point. The Chevrolet SS equipped with a manual manages 14 mpg city, 22 highway, 17 combined, according to the EPA. The automatic manages 14/20/16 mpg according to the agency.</p>, <p>The heavy emphasis on performance extends to the Chevy SS's ride and handling. With a close to ideal 52/48 weight distribution and a multi-link rear suspension, the SS is set up more like a sports car than a typical large sedan. It rides on Z-rated tires for great grip and comes with Brembo brakes that provide fantastic stopping power. Steering-wheel shift paddles are included on automatic models.</p>, <p>On the safety front, each Chevy SS has eight airbags as standard equipment, including a pair of knee airbags for front passengers. A rearview camera, lane-departure and forward-collision warning systems, and blind-spot monitors are all included as well. The SS hasn't been, and likely will not be, tested by either of the national safety agencies given its low sales volume.</p>, <p>Leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated-and-ventilated front seats, keyless access, push-button start, remote start, a head-up display, and 220-watt Bose audio are all included. So is Chevrolet MyLink, which is controlled through an 8.0-inch touchscreen and can help manage hands-free conversations, media, and infotainment apps on a connected smartphone.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1091740_2015-chevrolet-ss-preview">2015 Chevrolet SS</a> added some notable new features. Among the key ones for enthusiasts: an available 6-speed manual transmission and standard adjustable dampers. It also received Brembo brakes at all four corners; the 2014 SS had Brembos only at the front. Other upgrades for 2015 included <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1089475_chevy-announces-4g-lte-capable-models-and-launches-new-appshop-at-ces">OnStar 4G LTE connectivity</a> and a built-in wi-fi hotspot.</p>, <p>Changes for 2016 mostly involved the exterior. It received a revised front fascia with vertical ducts at its outer edges, LED front signature lights, functional hood vents, and 19-inch alloy wheels with painted pockets. Inside, it got a standard navigation system. The 2017 model year sees only two new colors: Orange Blast and Nightfall Gray Metallic.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_sonic
[<p>The Chevrolet Sonic is a compact hatchback or sedan aimed at affordability.</p>, <p>The Sonic replaced the old Korean-built Aveo back in the 2012 model year. Since then, it's held up well with fun styling and performance and a back seat that's usable by adults with some negotiation.</p>, <p>With the Sonic, Chevrolet has a pint-size rival for the Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, Hyundai Accent, Nissan Versa, and Toyota Yaris, especially the Yaris iA sedan (nee Scion iA). </p>, <p>For 2017, the Sonic acquired revised exterior styling, a redesigned and more adult dashboard, and available forward collision alert and lane-departure warning. Chevy left the Sonic mostly alone for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_sonic_2018" title="2018 Chevrolet Sonic - full review">2018 Chevrolet Sonic review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>The Sonic sedan and hatchback arrived for the 2012 model year. Both are comfortable and relatively refined, with road noise noticeably squelched compared to the sound levels in most cars this size. Going from the old Aveo to this Sonic, Chevy practically leapfrogged the whole subcompact segment, offering a better package than most of its competition.</p>, <p>The Chevy Sonic is now one of the larger "subcompacts" in a class that's suffered quite a lot of bracket creep in its dimensions. This resizing left room below the Sonic range for a new nameplate: the Spark minicar, the smallest car sold with a Chevrolet badge in decades. Given modern safety standards and feature requirements, it's not surprising that the Sonic is a bigger and heavier car than the Aveo. It's also more substantial in a good way, and considerably more entertaining to drive.</p>, <p>The Sonic comes standard with a naturally aspirated 1.8-liter inline-4 that's efficient and good enough, but it's the optional 1.4-liter turbo-4 that really wakes this little Chevy up. It's more powerful, more refined, and just plain smoother, and actually returns better fuel-economy ratings thanks to its smaller displacement. Either engine can be had with a choice of 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. All Sonics have electric power steering with nice weighting that provides a reassuring feel on the road.</p>, <p>Gas mileage for the Sonic is also much better than with the former Aveo. With highway ratings by the EPA that hit the 40-mpg sweet spot with the 1.4-liter turbo-4, the Sonic rivaled the best in class when it launched. A new Honda Fit in 2015 and a 2017 adjustment of the EPA fuel-economy calculations knocked the bloom off the rose, and the Sonic's larger sibling the Cruze now gets better ratings even before its high-mileage diesel variant.</p>, <p>While the Sonic still doesn't have a package that's as intensely space-efficient or versatile for cargo carrying as that of the Honda Fit, the interior comfort is good and there is adequate space inside. Sonic sedans are about a foot longer—at 173 inches, the length of a compact, really—and in our opinion their styling doesn't look like an afterthought as do many four-doors in the category. Trunk space for the sedans is surprisingly vast (19 cubic feet) although the versatility of the hatchbacks is hard to beat. Our only letdown in the hatchback is that its load floor is quite high and that makes it somewhat less useful and versatile than the Fit. But the Sonic is more entertaining to drive than the latest Fit, and most would probably agree that the Chevy wins the styling comparison as well.</p>, <p>The Sonic is one of the safest small-car picks, especially among value-leading subcompacts. Current Sonics receive top five-star federal safety ratings, and top "Good" scores in all tests, according to the IIHS, which have resulted in a Top Safety Pick honor by the agency in previous years.</p>, <p>Standard equipment in the Sonic includes keyless entry and air conditioning. At the middle of the lineup, the Sonic LT gets an upgrade to satellite radio and six-speaker sound, plus power windows and power heated mirrors. To get some tech essentials, like a USB audio input and Bluetooth, you'll need to reach up to the LT or LTZ, but prices remain affordable, at less than $20,000 even for a loaded LTZ.</p>, <p><strong>Chevrolet Sonic history</strong></p>, <p>In late 2012, Chevy also unveiled a new, production-ready version of the Sonic sedan, dubbed the Chevrolet Sonic Dusk which had previously appeared <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1067712_chevrolet-bringing-customized-cruze-and-sonic-lineup-to-sema">as a concept model in 2011</a>. The idea behind the Dusk was to add luxury touches to the Sonic.</p>, <p>For 2013, Chevrolet introduced <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1078664_2013-chevrolet-sonic-rs-priced-from-20995">a sporty Sonic RS</a> variant, initially offered only in five-door form, that keeps the same 138-hp 1.4-liter inline-4, but has a number of visual cues to give it more of a "hot hatch" look. On the outside, there are different front and rear fascias, rocker-panel extensions, and special fog lamps, plus 17-inch wheels and a tuned exhaust. The car also receives a shorter final-drive ratio to improve engine response and rides on a lowered, sport-tuned suspension. Inside, vinyl-and-faux-suede sport seats with red stitching, special trim, and piano-black accents, and the Chevrolet MyLink touchscreen interface is standard. Chevy added an RS sedan for 2014.</p>, <p>MyLink availability expanded to some other Sonic models in 2013; it is optional on LS and LT trims and standard on the Sonic LTZ. The same year, Chevy added six-speaker sound systems and blind-spot mirrors to the Sonic and also included remote start capability on all models equipped with the automatic transmission. MyLink also now works with a smartphone-based navigation app.</p>, <p>The 2014 model year brought the RS sedan and several more minor changes. The biggest change for 2015 was the addition of 4G LTE connectivity for OnStar and onboard data with wi-fi hotspot capability, while LTZ models now come standard with the 1.4-liter inline-4 and MyLink is no longer available on LS models.</p>, <p>For 2016, the Chevy Sonic gets a few new colors and some minor feature changes. In 2017, the Sonic received a mild cosmetic update, as well as a standard rearview camera and available new safety technology like forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning. Changes for 2018 involved only tweaks to trim options and a new paint color.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_silverado-2500hd
[<p>The Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is the automaker's three-quarter ton, heavy-duty truck. It is related to the Silverado 3500HD (one-ton) and GMC Sierra lineup of heavy-duty trucks.</p>, <p>The Chevy Silverado heavy-duty truck range is powered by a standard 6.0-liter V-8 gasoline engine, or an optionally available 6.6-liter turbodiesel V-8. The Silverado is available in regular, extended, or crew cab configurations with rear- or four-wheel drive.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1112720_2018-chevrolet-silverado-2500hd">review of the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Silverado is mechanically related to the GMC Sierra HD range, but whereas the GMC heads upmarket in Denali trims, the Chevy version skews more toward professional or fleet buyers willing to trade some creature comforts for a lower price tag.</p>, <p>The Silverado HD competes with the Ford Super Duty lineup, the Ram heavy-duty roster, and perhaps the GMC Sierra HD lineup.</p>, <p><strong>The new Chevy Silverado HD</strong></p>, <p>The latest iteration of the Chevrolet Silverado HD series made its debut as a 2015 model year, complete with upgrades to the infotainment, stiffer high-strength steel, and some aluminum components to help shed weight for fuel economy.</p>, <p>Chevy offered the Silverado HD series with a 6.0-liter V-8 gas engine as standard, or an optional 6.6-liter turbodiesel V-8. A newly available High Country trim offered bigger wheels and more creature comforts on the Silverado HD range, although stopped short of Denali-grade opulence found in the related GMC Sierra Denali HD models.</p>, <p>In 2017, the Silverado HD received an updated grille and bumpers, and a new hood to help feed an updated turbodiesel that could make up to 910 pound-feet of torque. Certain configurations of the diesel-equipped Silverado HD were rated to tow more than 18,000 pounds with a fifth-wheel trailer attached. The standard 6.0-liter V-8 was rated for a payload capacity of more than 3,500 pounds in some models, which made it the in-bed king.</p>, <p>All engines are paired to 6-speed automatic transmissions; Chevy stopped offering manual transmissions in heavy-duty pickups more than a decade before the new models arrived.</p>, <p>The Silverado HD is still offered in WT (work truck) configurations that pack vinyl seats, no floormats, and bench seats, although the pickup market skewed heavily toward more opulent features.</p>, <p><strong>Chevy Silverado HD history</strong></p>, <p>The Chevy Silverado HD's history reads similarly to the GMC Sierra HD's tale—the two have been mechanically related for more than five decades.</p>, <p>Chevy's heavy-duty truck range goes back longer, but direct predecessors can be traced to the 1960s when Chevy offered "C" and "K" models in 20 and 30 series for three-quarter and one-ton configurations, respectively. The "C" denoted "conventional" trucks that were rear-wheel drive; "K" confusingly stood for "four-wheel drive," which was newly available from the factory.</p>, <p>The next generation of heavy-duty trucks from Chevy still tended to focus on commercial and professional users; no four-door models were offered in the 1970s, and most of the heavy-duty range used a solid front axle when equipped with four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The third generation of Chevy's heavy-duty lineup carried them all the way into the late 1980s and marked the first appearance of the word "Silverado," which was used on top-trim pickups. Chevy still didn't offer a four-door version of these heavy-duty trucks, although crosstown rival Ford started offering the types around this time.</p>, <p>After 1987, Chevy began offering its heavy-duty trucks with more features including independent front suspension, automatic four-wheel drive, and improved gasoline V-8s.</p>, <p>The C/K moniker was dropped in the late 1990s, and Silverado was introduced in 1998 as the new name for Chevy's trucks.</p>, <p>Three generations of the Silverado have been on sale in the U.S. since 1999, and while light-duty variants have come and gone (performance, hybrid) the heavy-duty range has stayed relatively work focused. The manual transmission was finally quietly killed from the Silverado 3500HD in 2007.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_cruze
[<p>The Chevrolet Cruze is a compact sedan or hatchback with mainstream appeal and size.</p>, <p>This year's biggest news started last year. The addition of a diesel engine into the sedan body and a hatchback model to last year's Cruze lineup finally join in holy mileage matrimony this year.</p>, <p>With the Cruze, Chevrolet has a credible contender in one of the most challenging new-car niches. It's an alternative to vehicles like the Ford Focus, Honda Civic, and Toyota Corolla, as well as the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Mazda 3, Subaru Impreza, and Volkswagen Golf.</p>, <p>The 2019 Chevrolet Cruze adds active safety features, a new nose, and updated tech.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116131_2019-chevrolet-cruze" title="2019 Chevrolet Cruze - review">2019 Chevrolet Cruze review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Chev</strong><strong>rolet Cruze</strong></p>, <p>The second-generation Cruze has a racier and more wedge-shaped look than the slab-sided older car, and looks very similar to the second-generation Volt plug-in hybrid hatchback introduced the same year. The new 2016 Cruze sedan will be offered as a five-door hatchback as well in 2017.</p>, <p>The first powertrain is a new and more powerful 1.4-liter turbo-4. A 6-speed manual is standard on all but the top-level Premier version, though a 6-speed automatic is far more popular.</p>, <p>All models deliver better fuel efficiency than any versions of the first-generation Cruze, with EPA ratings for the automatic version of most models coming in at 30 mpg city, 42 highway, 35 combined. Chevy also added a 1.6-liter turbodiesel engine for 2017, which delivers even higher fuel efficiency ratings.</p>, <p>The Cruze has confident roadholding and a remarkably smooth ride, though it's no sports sedan. Despite appearing smaller than the more upright design it replaced, the new Cruze has more interior room and a remarkably large trunk. A standard touchscreen on every model and options like 4G LTE connectivity with a wi-fi hotspot mark it as truly up-to-date, though a few active-safety systems were missing for 2016, notably automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>For 2017, Chevy added a hatch to the Cruze lineup, a first in the U.S. The hatch keeps the same style as the sedan from the rear doors forward, including a curvy roofline. The hatch is 8 inches shorter overall than the sedan, and cargo area improves from 13.7 cubic feet from the sedan to 23.7 cubic feet in the hatch with the rear seats up. With the seats down, the cargo area balloons to a 47.2 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Marking the 2018 model year, the hatch and diesel engine are finally available together.</p>, <p><strong>Chev</strong><strong>rolet Cruze</strong> <strong>history</strong></p>, <p>The first generation of Cruze—sold from 2011 through 2015, and then as the Cruze Limited for 2016 as well—was one of the better options in its segment. It had a tall task to provide a vehicle good enough to erase memories of the outdated Cobalt compact it replaced.</p>, <p>The Cruze was Chevrolet's first global compact, designed in South Korea, but comprehensively updated before it came to the States.</p>, <p>The first Cruze was more conservative in styling than many competitors, but its interior was one of its strongest points. The feel was upscale, the materials of the twin-cockpit dash design were rich, and in some ways they elicited memories of the best Volkswagen products of yore. The Cruze was better, frankly, than the contemporary version of the Jetta, which lost some of its luxury in the quest for lower sticker prices.</p>, <p>The Cruze was far from the sportiest contender in its class, though. The base LS, with a 136-hp, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine, was adequately quick but noisy and harsh when pushed; Eco, LT, and LTZ models stepped up to the 1.4-liter turbo engine, which made 138 hp and more torque at lower rpm, making it feel like the perkier, smoother choice with either transmission.</p>, <p>Both gas engines could be equipped with either a 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission; the star of the lineup was arguably the Cruze Eco model, which achieved up to 42 mpg on the highway with the manual. The Eco employed several weight-saving measures, making it the lightest of the bunch and also the most enjoyable to toss around, even with its low-rolling-resistance tires.</p>, <p>For 2014, Chevrolet launched a diesel Cruze model based on the one had sold in Europe for several years. The Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel model (confusingly badged Cruze 2.0 TD) came with a direct-injected and turbocharged 2.0-liter diesel engine producing 148 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque. It was paired only with the 6-speed automatic transmission, and rated at 33 mpg combined (27 mpg city, 46 highway), according to the EPA. It's worth noting that <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1019256_volkswagen-jetta-tdi-much-more-mileage-than-epa-admits" title="Volkswagen Jetta TDI: Much More Mileage Than EPA Admits?">diesel cars often deliver better real-world fuel economy</a> than their EPA ratings. In part because of a base price approaching $25,000, the diesel Cruze didn't sold in huge numbers.</p>, <p>Take into consideration the wide range of adjustability and excellent seats, along with its huge trunk, and this first Cruze felt almost like a mid-size sedan. Just a few years ago, its 181-inch overall length would have been called mid-size.</p>, <p>The Cruze had a good safety record even before reaching our market, and that continued with U.S. sales. The Cruze received the Top Safety Pick honor from the IIHS and was rated five stars for overall safety by federal testers.</p>, <p>The Cruze’s feature set was also more in step with those of mid-size sedans than with other compacts; even the base LS included keyless entry, air conditioning, power accessories, and a six-speaker sound system. LT models offered USB, Bluetooth, and remote start, while the LTZ included items such as automatic climate control, heated mirrors, and park assist. Heated seats and touch-screen navigation were on offer in the LTZ.</p>, <p>New for 2013 was a touchscreen and voice-based MyLink system, which provides Bluetooth audio streaming, hands-free communication, and apps for Pandora and Stitcher streaming audio, plus Gracenote playlist and album art capability. And for the 2013 model year, Chevrolet bolstered that impression even further by offering blind-spot monitors with cross-traffic alerts, together in a new <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1077060_2013-chevrolet-cruze-gets-mylink-infotainment-active-safety-options">Enhanced Safety Package</a> that also includes rear park assist. A rearview camera system was also added.</p>, <p>For 2015, 4G LTE connectivity was added as well, providing a quicker connection for OnStar as well as wi-fi hotspot capability. Also for 2015, the Cruze received a facelift that echoed the look of the Malibu sedan.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/chevrolet_spark
[<p>The Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback and is the smallest car General Motors sells in America.</p>, <p>With the Spark, Chevy has a city car to rival vehicles like the Mitsubishi Mirage, Smart Fortwo, and the Fiat 500. It sets itself apart by its ability to hold four adults, sitting comfortably if not spaciously, inside an extremely small footprint.</p>, <p>Chevy sold both gas- and electric-powered Sparks through the 2016 model year. The automaker redesigned the Spark for 2017, but the electric version dropped out of the lineup after the arrival of the Bolt EV.</p>, <p><strong><em><em>MORE: Read our</em> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_spark_2018" title="2018 Chevrolet Spark - Review">2018 Chevrolet Spark review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chevy Spark</strong></p>, <p>The second generation of Chevy Spark went on sale early in 2016, and continued essentially unchanged for 2017. Its design uses more grown-up styling without the previous model's cartoonish characteristics. It has a more powerful, 98-horsepower, 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, giving it 16 percent more power than the 84-horsepower, 1.2-liter inline-4 used in 2013-2015 Sparks.</p>, <p>As before, the engine drives the front wheels through either a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission. Its combined 2016 fuel-economy rating of 35 mpg took a hit for 2017 due to new EPA calculations that brought it down to 33 mpg combined.</p>, <p>New camera-based safety systems, rarely found on cars this small, are offered as an option on the top trim level, and include lane-departure warning, blind-spot monitors, and forward-collision warnings.</p>, <p>There's also a "Spark Activ" package that adds trim items and raises the car slightly to make it resemble a tiny crossover. The powertrain is unchanged, without all-wheel drive an option, but the taller stance, different wheels, body cladding, and tougher grille do change the appearance. Changes for 2018 are confined to one new paint color.</p>, <p><strong>Chevrolet Spark history</strong></p>, <p>The Spark has always been one of the smallest cars on sale with four doors, which helped distinguish the first generation (sold in 2013 through 2015) from other extra-compacts like the Scion iQ and Smart ForTwo. It's a minimalist's car with modern amenities, and a happy little car to boot. The shape looks cheerfully designed; inside, the dashboard is simple, with a large speedometer flanked by a digital gauge with extra information.</p>, <p>It's a small vehicle—the next-largest General Motors vehicle sold in the U.S. is the Chevy Sonic, which is more than a foot longer than the Spark. But as the only five-door in its size category, the current Spark wins the practicality war against cars like the Fiat 500 and Mini three-door hardtop. (The slightly larger Mitsubishi Mirage five-door is a competitor as well, but sits somewhere between the minicar and subcompact.)</p>, <p>The Spark is also taller than its main competitors, giving both driver and passenger a better view out, which aids visibility when ensconced in a sea of SUVs. It's much easier to get people and things in and out of the back seat with the Spark's extra doors, even if the interior is just about as tight as in those rival models. Four adults can fit inside, but they'll likely want to keep the journeys short since their elbows will be touching.</p>, <p>Chevy offers the gas-powered Spark in three trim levels, starting at about $13,000. All Sparks come standard with a version of the Chevrolet MyLink connectivity system, offering apps for Pandora internet radio and Stitcher Smart Radio.</p>, <p>The base LS model comes standard with air conditioning, power windows, a rear wiper, a trip computer, 15-inch alloy wheels, a flip-forward 60/40-split folding rear seat, and OnStar built in.</p>, <p>The mid-level 1LT model includes power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, an audio system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, steering-wheel audio controls, Bluetooth pairing, and satellite radio. The top-of-the-line 2LT trim level adds different alloy wheels, trim upgrades, and even heated seats. Chevrolet also added the GogoLink embedded navigation and real-time traffic application later in the Spark's first model year.</p>, <p>Chevy made one important change after the Spark's first year on the market. In 2013 only, a 4-speed automatic was available for an extra $925; that transmission was slow-reacting and didn't do the small car many favors. From 2014 on, however, the two-pedal option has been a CVT, which is a better match for the car. The standard 5-speed manual makes for the most fun in a Spark, however, and also requires no added investment.</p>, <p><strong>Spark EV</strong></p>, <p>Chevy also offered an electric version of the first-generation Spark (get it?) in California and Oregon only. It's known as the Spark EV, and was sold only in small quantities.</p>, <p title="Electric Cars: Some Are Real, Most Are Only 'Compliance Cars'--We Name Names">The <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1083482_2014-chevrolet-spark-ev-on-time-unaffected-by-a123-failure">Chevy Spark EV</a> is what our sister site, <em>Green Car Reports</em>, calls a "<a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1068832_electric-cars-some-are-real-most-are-only-compliance-cars--we-name-names" title="Electric Cars: Some Are Real, Most Are Only 'Compliance Cars'--We Name Names">compliance car,"</a> which is an electric car built to satisfy coming California clear-air regulations that require automakers to sell battery-powered electric cars in order to continue doing business in the state. That means that while you may see a disproportionate volume of media and advertising on the all-electric Spark, you shouldn't pay it a great deal of attention. It's by far the most powerful Spark, and its lack of a transmission delivers the electric power in one single rush of acceleration, but volumes are very low—only about 100 cars a month.</p>]

[<p>The Chrysler Pacifica minivan is the replacement for the Town &amp; Country minivan. The Pacifica offers V-6 and hybrid powertrains, three rows of seats (two of which can fold into the floor), and luxury features such as a panoramic sunroof, leather, power-folding seats, and twin-screen entertainment systems. </p>, <p>The Pacifica name was previously used for a mid-size crossover utility vehicle that was sold from the 2004 through 2008 model years. Prior to that, Pacifica name had been used as a trim level or appearance package on some Chrysler and Dodge vehicles.</p>, <p>In the Pacifica, Chrysler has a van that can stand up against the best in the class. It's better for functionality than the Honda Odyssey, if not a better performer. Other minivans in the class include the Nissan Quest, Toyota Sienna, and Kia Sedona.</p>, <p>We like the Pacifica quite a bit, so much so that we named it our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/bestcartobuy">Best Car to Buy 2017</a>. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chrysler_pacifica_2018">2018 Chrysler Pacifica review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>As for the latest Chrysler Pacifica, it follows up on the Town &amp; Country with a new emphasis on styling and design, more interior technology, some evolution in Chrysler’s always-segment-leading seating arrangements, and a newly available Hybrid model that’s actually a plug-in hybrid good for up to 30 miles of all-electric driving.</p>, <p>That Hybrid includes a 16-kwh battery, packaged under the floor, and a two-motor hybrid system capable of delivering up to 80 MPGe in city driving. Meanwhile, the rest of the lineup comes with a 287-horsepower version of the company’s V-6, and a 9-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The design of the Pacifica is a good deal more flamboyant than Chrysler minivans of the recent past, and for the most part that’s due to some heavy sculpting of the surface sheetmetal, which is no longer flat and slab-sided but quite expressive.</p>, <p>Packaging highlights of the new Pacifica include a new Stow ‘n’ Go Assist feature that powers the front seats out of the way, for easier stowing of the second-row seats. The second row also features an Easy Tilt feature to get to the third row easily—even when there’s a child seat in the second row.</p>, <p>The new Pacifica includes a new rear-seat entertainment system with Blu-ray; an 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen system, including navigation, voice command, and Uconnect Access information streams; and an available integrated vacuum system.</p>, <p>The IIHS rated it a Top Safety Pick for 2018 after it earned top "Good" ratings on its crash tests and its advanced safety systems were rated "Superior" by the agency.</p>, <p>For 2018, Chrysler added a new Pacifica L model to the family. The new base model comes with a 7.0-inch touchscreen audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a rearview camera, air conditioning, 17-inch wheels, blind-spot monitors, and rear parking sensors. It does not have fold-away second-row seats, same as the Hybrid model.</p>, <p><strong>The 2004-2008 Chrysler Pacifica</strong></p>, <p>The previous Pacifica, the one from the last decade, was conceived to go up against the likes of the Lexus RX, but with seating for up to six it delivered a more useful, versatile interior than most other models with which you might compare it.</p>, <p>The Pacifica established a strong reputation for interior space and safety—and it had probably the nicest interior appointments of any Chrysler vehicle from the past decade—but never failed to satisfy in refinement or fuel economy. It was also subject to some mismanaged marketing, and a price that critics said was too high.</p>, <p>Early model years of the Pacifica had a 200-hp, 3.8-liter V-6, while a 253-hp, 4.0-liter V-6 was subbed in for 2007. Both were paired to a 4-speed automatic, and fuel economy ratings were just 14/22 mpg with the bigger engine and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Front- and all-wheel-drive versions were offered, and for the most part the Pacifica had a great combination of all-weather traction. a comfortable ride, and responsive handling.</p>, <p>Top trims of the later model years included a rearview camera, and the Pacifica offered a rear entertainment system, Infinity premium sound, and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>]

[<p>The Chrysler 200 is a 4-door, mid-size sedan. In the past, the name has also been applied to a 2-door convertible—and prior to that, the same model line was known as the Sebring.</p>, <p>With the 200, Chrysler competes with a slew of excellent family sedans—vehicles such as the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Nissan Altima, as well as the Ford Fusion, Subaru Legacy, Hyundai Sonata, Chevy Malibu, and Mazda 6. </p>, <p>The Chrysler brand has struggled to carve out market share in this class, and despite the 200's style and features, it has largely suffered the same fate. The 200's days are numbered; 2017 will be its last year before parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles cancels production. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chrysler_200_2017" title="2016 Chrysler 200 - review">2017 Chrysler 200 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The current Chrysler 200</strong></p>, <p>Today's Chrysler 200 faces tough competition from ever-more-competent mid-size sedans offered by the rest of the major players. In many ways, the current 200 is really the car that Chrysler should have had years ago in such a critical segment. While the car isn't perfect, it will suit style-conscious buyers who value comfort and features—and it offers optional all-wheel drive, found elsewhere only on a few rivals.</p>, <p>The current 200 uses an architecture that was derived from an Alfa Romeo platform. It has been Americanized and also underpins the Jeep Cherokee and the smaller Dodge Dart. While the prior 200 was offered as both a four-door sedan and a two-door convertible, the current Chrysler 200 is sold just as a sedan. At this stage in its evolution, low-volume convertible models aren't a luxury in which Chrysler can afford to indulge.</p>, <p>The 200 has a very refined grille and front-end appearance, an elongated roofline, and a nicely tapered tail. The design serves to disguise its compact car roots, though the inboard wheels give it away. The interior's design is along the same lines as the attractive cabins in the Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Durango, on plush models it's swathed in top-grade materials, and it sports an innovative center-console design that includes a pass-through storage area beneath, as well as sliding cupholders and versatile cubbies.</p>, <p>Two engines are available, an inline-4 and a V-6, with front-drive being the standard configuration and all-wheel drive available with the V-6. The 2.4-liter inline-4 makes 184 horsepower and is refined but not terribly perky. The optional 295-hp V-6's 262-lb-ft torque rating is enough to easily break traction on front-wheel-drive versions. We recommend all-wheel drive to prevent this and torque steer.</p>, <p>Handling is underwhelming but at least predictable. The 200 lies somewhere between the comfortable players like Altima and the sportier Ford Fusion—it's pleasant enough, but not an exciting car to wheel.</p>, <p>Where the 200 falls short of the mid-size standard is in rear-seat space. The front seats are roomy enough, with a low driving position, but in back the low roofline makes entry and exit a little difficult for anyone but small kids.</p>, <p>Available safety equipment includes forward collision warnings with emergency braking, lane departure warnings and prevention, and blind spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts. A rearview camera is standard but most of the other features are only offered on the top model.</p>, <p>The lineup consists of five models: LX, Touring, Limited Platinum, 200S, and 200C Platinum. The Chrysler 200S model gets a sportier look that includes fog lamps, bigger 18-inch wheels, a sport suspension, and other upgrades. Meanwhile, the top 200C model adds such niceties as dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a 7-inch configurable instrument panel display, and remote starting.</p>, <p>The 200 receives top safety ratings, including five stars overall from the NHTSA and a Top Safety Pick+ nod from the IIHS.</p>, <p>In January 2016, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles boss Sergio Marchionne indicated that the Chrysler 200's days may be numbered. In announcing the five-year plan for the automaker, Marchionne said the 200 and related Dart would "run their course," without an update. The 2017 model year will be its last. Predictably, changes for 2017 are minor, including equipment shuffling and the addition of a Dark Appearance package for the Touring model that adds 18-inch Jet Black Gloss wheels, halogen headlights with black moldings, and a gloss black exterior treatment.</p>, <p><strong>Chrysler 200 history</strong></p>, <p>The Chrysler 200 nameplate first arrived for the 2011 model year. In reality, the car it was applied to was a warmed-over version of the Chrysler Sebring sedan, the last models of which tarnished that badge with their low quality and poor reliability. This Sebring-turned-200 was sold for four years, using underpinnings that were themselves that old when the model launched, making the outgoing 200 the oldest among its competitive set when it was finally replaced.</p>, <p>That first Chrysler 200 offered a choice of two engines: a base 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, paired with either a 4- or 6-speed automatic, or a Pentastar V-6 displacing 3.6 liters and available only with the 6-speed auto. The 2.4-liter engine produced a feeble 173 hp and 166 lb-ft of torque, but managed respectable gas mileage of 20 mpg in the city and up to 31 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The V-6 delivered a healthy 283 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque with a fuel economy of 19 mpg city, 29 highway. The 6-speed automatic did a great job of getting the most out of either engine, but the 4-speeder used for the smaller engine was downright archaic against the competition.</p>, <p>The 2011-2014 Chrysler 200 was most at home on straight highways, where its hydraulic power steering offered nice weighting and some actual road feel. It wasn't so enjoyable on rough surfaces or curvy roads; if you sent too much power through those front wheels, its tendency to torque-steer—to pull to one side or the other—left the 200 flustered. For 2012, Chrysler offered a sportier 200S package, and then for 2013 that special appearance was offered as a package for any of the three sedan trims. The Limited model also added Boston Acoustics speakers and 17-inch alloy wheels as standard items for 2013.</p>, <p>This mid-size Chrysler had a good record with respect to safety, but it wasn't quite top-tier. The federal government gave it four stars overall, with four-star scores for frontal impact and three stars for side impact. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave it top "Good" scores in all areas, earning Top Safety Pick status. And in the new IIHS small overlap frontal test, it performed well enough ("Acceptable") to qualify for the new IIHS Top Safety Pick+ accolade.</p>, <p>Chrysler's 200 convertible was unique among droptops, as it offered a choice of a soft top (in vinyl or cloth) or a folding hardtop. The 200 suffered from cowl and body flex, making the ride pleasant enough but hurting handling considerably. It also felt heavy, due in part to the complex top mechanisms that had been added. Rear-seat space was impinged upon by the packaging of the roof, as it is in most convertibles, but there was still more room than in most competitors.</p>]

[<p>The Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan that's not just old school, it's just old.</p>, <p>The sedan has been around for a decade, and offers V-6 or V-8 engines. It skips the high-powered V-8s—it once had an SRT offering, though—but can be fitted with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Big-car, old-school styling and its choices in drivetrains make the 300 a rival for vehicles like the Buick LaCrosse, Ford Taurus, Hyundai Azera, and Toyota Avalon, as well as the Charger.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 were limited to reshuffled feature content.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chrysler_300_2018" title="2014 Chrysler 300 - review">2018 Chrysler 300 review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Chrysler 300</strong></p>, <p>In 2011, most of the first-generation car's deficiencies were remedied with the launch of a considerably redesigned version of the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/300">Chrysler 300</a>. While the 300C's rip-roaring V-8 was carried over, the revised 300 gained a new look inside and out, plus Chrysler's excellent 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, making 283 horsepower. They also got a much-upgraded interior—in both materials and refinement—and features like a standard USB port, an available navigation system with Sirius Travel Link services, and a Uconnect Web wi-fi hotspot option.</p>, <p>For 2012, Chrysler introduced a new 8-speed automatic transmission for V-6 models that further improved performance and boosted highway fuel economy to 31 mpg. The high-performance 300 SRT8 offered up the latest, 6.4-liter high-output version of the Hemi, making 470 hp, while also introducing an adaptive suspension and many other extras. </p>, <p>For the 2013 model year, a new <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=glacier%20edition%20chrysler%20300%20motorauthority&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorauthority.com%2Fnews%2F1078922_2013-chrysler-300-gets-upscale-trim-new-glacier-edition">300 Glacier Edition</a> was introduced, with all-wheel drive plus a special set of appearance extras. There was also a new <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081290_chrysler-celebrates-motown-spirit-with-special-300-video">2013 Chrysler 300 Motown Edition</a> with chrome accents, 20-inch aluminum wheels, blacked-out Chrysler wing badges, and Motown badges on the front fenders. The 300S upped the V-6's output to 300 horsepower through a cold-air intake and sport-tuned exhaust, and there was a new black-painted roof option. At the 2013 Chicago Auto Show, Chrysler introduced a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082193_srt-adds-core-performance-models-to-its-catalog">new SRT8 Core model</a> from its in-house high-performance brand, SRT, offering the big engine with cloth seats, fixed dampers, and fewer options, all for a smaller pricetag than the standard SRT model.</p>, <p>Chrysler gave the 300 a refresh for the 2015 model year. Freshened designs for the front and rear accompany an upgraded interior. The most obvious changes are up front, where the 300 wears updated headlights and a wider grille; the Chrysler winged badge has been moved down from the top edge of the opening into the field. V-8 models also received the 8-speed automatic that the V-6 cars had offered for a while. Chrysler also added a few safety features, including forward-collision warning, as well as a new Platinum model at the top of the range. The interior was given a once-over, with a freshened design and better materials.</p>, <p>The SRT model was dropped for 2015, and is not likely to return to the U.S. market—with or without the insane Hellcat engine available in the large Dodge cars. For now, it's at least off the table. Chrysler does still build an SRT version of the 300 for export.</p>, <p>The 2016 Chrysler 300 received some updates to its technology and suspension, and added a new 90th Anniversary Edition option package to celebrate 90 years of Chrysler automobiles. Tech changes included a new drag-and-drop menu bar on the 8.4-inch touchscreen, the addition of Siri Eyes Free voice control, and a newly available safety package that can prevent or mitigate forward collisions and keep the car in its lane. The base suspension became a bit firmer, and S models added performance suspension with summer performance tires.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Chrysler 300 got some updates to its infotainment system and added three new option packages for the 300S model. The Uconnect infotainment system featured upgraded processing power, with faster reactions, sharper graphics, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and the addition of pinch, tap, and swipe gesture controls. Interior and exterior Sport Appearance packages were new, as was a 300S Alloy Edition.</p>, <p><strong>Chrysler 300 history</strong></p>, <p>Launched way back in 2005, the Chrysler 300 marked the return of rear-wheel drive to Chrysler's sedan lineup, replacing the front-wheel-drive Chrysler Concorde and 300M. The automaker took advantage of its Daimler ownership at the time, borrowing some components from an older version of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Appearance-wise, the 300 and 300C (the more luxurious version, which came with the Hemi V-8) were a breath of fresh air to the Chrysler lineup, with a taller, boxier look overall and a high beltline that gave these models a macho yet classy look. It was a complete about-face compared to the front-drive "cab forward" designs that Chrysler had followed through the 1990s and up until then.</p>, <p>Over the years, the Chrysler 300 lineup changed little. Fleet-oriented base models included a 190-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 that was just barely adequate for the 300; a much better choice was the 250-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, which could move the 300 with more enthusiasm while not getting any worse real-world mileage. The 300C Hemi versions came with a 340-hp 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. Both of the V-6 models were paired with a 4-speed automatic, while the V-8 got a 5-speed automatic. Both the V-6 and V-8 models were available with an all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>Chrysler also offered the performance-oriented SRT-8 (written as SRT8 in later years), which sported a 425-hp 6.1-liter version of the Hemi V-8 along with upgraded brakes and suspension. Overall, the SRT8, and to a lesser extent the 300C, provided the performance of a muscle car, with a gruff, forceful responsiveness to the powertrain and reasonably good handling, though not a lot of finesse in the steering.</p>]

[<p>The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is the automaker's plug-in minivan with seating for up to seven.</p>, <p>If the Pacifica name sounds familiar but the shape doesn't, you're not alone. The name used to apply to a crossover made by Chrysler more than 10 years ago, but times are changing, we here.</p>, <p>With a new electrified powertrain that pairs a 3.6-liter V-6 with a 16-kwh battery pack, the Pacifica Hybrid followed the new Pacifica (which we <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chrysler_pacifica_2018" title="2018 Chrysler Pacifica - review">cover separately</a>) after it was launched in 2016. For 2018, the plug-in van is offered in Touring Plus, Touring L, and Limited trims; other changes are limited to the addition of blind-spot monitors and rear parking sensors as standard safety features, joining a rearview camera.</p>, <p>The Pacifica Hybrid competes against the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Kia Sedona, and Nissan Quest, although none of those vans have hybrid powertrains—at least not yet. It may also compete with plug-in hybrid versions of the Volvo XC90 and Mitsubishi Outlander SUVs.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chrysler_pacifica-hybrid_2018" title="2018 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid - review">2018 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>With seating for up to seven and more interior technology than previous Town &amp; Country models, the Pacifica Hybrid is situated for families that prioritize fuel economy and comfort and are willing to pay up to $7,000 more than a comparably equipped Pacifica Touring L model—although the hybrid version qualifies for up to $7,500 back from the federal government and any applicable state hybrid incentives.</p>, <p>The Pacifica Hybrid has only a few styling cues that separate it from the gas-powered version. A unique front grille, exterior badges, and blue interior accents are visual indicators that the Pacifica Hybrid is the "green" version, as well as a dash-mounted indicator that indicates battery charge when the van is plugged in.</p>, <p>The Pacifica Hybrid marries the company's 3.6-liter V-6 (modified to run on an Atkinson cycle) with a 16-kwh lithium-ion battery that can power the van up to 30 miles on a charge before starting the engine. The EPA rates the van at 84 mpge, which is the combined equivalent of how far an electrified powertrain can travel on the equivalent of one gallon of gas. Without the batteries, the Pacifica Hybrid is rated at 32 mpg combined by the EPA.</p>, <p>The Pacifica Hybrid's transmission uses a pair of electric motors paired to an automatic gearbox to simulate a continuously variable transmission.</p>, <p>The batteries are stored underneath the second row of seating in the Pacifica Hybrid, which means those vans aren't equipped with Chrysler's useful Stow 'n Go seating arrangement. Otherwise, interior space for passengers between the Pacifica and Pacifica Hybrid is identical. The Pacifica Hybrid can be fitted with updated infotainment systems including the latest version of Fiat Chrysler Automobile's Uconnect system and rear-seat entertainment systems. A convenient in-car vacuum system is also available.</p>, <p>Although federal testers and the IIHS haven't specifically rated the Pacifica Hybrid separately from the Pacifica, the gas-powered van was an IIHS Top Safety Pick+ for 2017 and federal testers gave the van a five-star overall score, including a four-star rating for rollover protection.</p>, <p>Production of the van halted in summer 2017 for a battery diode recall and related fix.</p>, <p>The Pacifica Hybrid is built alongside the Pacifica at FCA's minivan plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/dodge_challenger
[<p>The Dodge Challenger is a two-door coupe that's a muscle-car throwback to the past. It's related to the Charger sedan and Chrysler 300.</p>, <p>Despite its roofline, the retro-styled, two-door four-seater has a back seat big enough to beat some sedans. </p>, <p>With the Challenger, Dodge counts among its rivals the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro. Unlike those two, the Challenger is a coupe only. FCA doesn't sell a convertible version of the Challenger at all.</p>, <p>This year, the Challenger heads to the drag strip with the purpose-built, 840-horspower Challenger SRT Demon. It holds numerous Guinness World Records and is the only car you can buy that only has a single seat. The rest of the lineup sees a bunch of minor trim and package changes.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_challenger_2018">2018 Dodge Challenger review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>For most of us, the zenith of the lineup remains the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. With 707 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque on tap, it's the most powerful production muscle car ever, dwarfing the former Shelby GT500 and its 662-hp rating.</p>, <p>The awesomely powerful 6.2-liter supercharged HEMI V-8 in the Challenger SRT Hellcat won’t always make it a complete handful to drive, thanks to a dual-key-fob system. The black fob limits the car’s output to a mere 500 horsepower; opt for the red fob, and you’ll get the full 707 hp. The same potent powerplant also makes its way into the 2016 Charger SRT Hellcat sedan.</p>, <p>An optional 8-speed transmission (a manual is standard), uprated suspension and brakes, and classic, 1971 Challenger-inspired interior design are also part of the Hellcat package.</p>, <p>Dodge also continues to sell an SRT model powered by a naturally aspirated 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 called SRT 392, as well as a pair of Scat Pack models with the same engine, and versions with the 5.7-liter Hemi and 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6. All engines benefit from an 8-speed automatic transmission, and all but V-6 models can be had with a manual transmission. Although the Hellcat steals most of the attention, the Scat Pack is an interesting option, combining the biggest SRT engine with standard R/T components for a significant savings compared to the SRT 392 and an appealing horsepower-per-dollar figure.</p>, <p>Partway through the 2015 model year, Dodge added a shaker hood option back into the Challenger lineup. It is available on both the R/T and Scat Pack models. Like the original shaker Challengers and those offered in a limited run for 2014, these cars have the eponymous scoop peeking through a hole in the hood, with the inlet able to visibly shake compared to its surroundings when the engine revs.</p>, <p><strong>The revived Challenger</strong></p>, <p>The current generation of the Challenger was reintroduced in 2007, with a simplified lineup and engine range: the SE, a base V-6 model with 250 horsepower; the R/T, with a 5.7-liter HEMI rated at 375 horsepower; and the SRT8, with a 6.1-liter Hemi rated at 425 horsepower. This new range was styled to look much like the classic Challenger, though it was considerably larger, weighing more then 4,000 pounds and featuring 17- to 20-inch alloy wheels. Nevertheless, it provided classic muscle-car feel and performance.</p>, <p>For the first years of its revival, the Challenger was available with a five-speed automatic or pistol-grip six-speed manual (on R/T and SRT8 only). Key features standard across the range included front and side-curtain airbags, a power-adjustable driver's seat, a four-speaker CD/MP3 stereo, cloth seating, and power accessories. The R/T model, in addition to upgrading the engine, added a unique appearance package, an advanced traction-control system, fog lamps, dual exhaust tips, and electronic stability control. The SRT8 built further on this package with more aggressive exterior styling, its own chassis tuning, upgraded interior elements, and SRT8 badges inside and out.</p>, <p>For 2011, the Dodge Challenger gained a new base engine—Chrysler's excellent corporate 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, making 305 hp—as well as some improved interior materials and standard automatic climate control. The options list also grew to include a Garmin navigation system, Sirius Travel Link, and a UConnect Web option.</p>, <p>Top Challenger SRT8 models also got a big boost for 2011, with their engine expanded to 6.4 liters (392 cubic inches, for those who keep tabs that way), making 470 hp and 470 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>For 2012, a new 900-watt Harman Kardon audio system option was added. <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1063179_2012-dodge-challenger-srt8-392-first-drive">Challenger SRT8 392</a> models for the 2012 model year also offered an adaptive suspension with normal and sport modes; a heated steering wheel and steering-wheel shift paddles were added as well. </p>, <p>Rolling into 2013, a new <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1074509_2012-dodge-challenger-rally-redline-preview">Rallye Redline edition</a> was introduced, with red exterior accents and a Radar Red Nappa leather interior, plus black chrome 20-inch wheels, a performance suspension, and a shorter axle ratio. Also, the available UConnect system offered improved Garmin navigation.</p>, <p>At the 2013 Chicago Auto Show, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082074_2013-dodge-challenger-r-t-redline-chicago-auto-show-preview">2013 Dodge Challenger R/T Redline</a> was introduced, bringing a somewhat edgier and more aggressively styled spin on the Challenger R/T.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Challenger saw its first truly major update since it was relaunched as a 2007 model. With subtly refined exterior styling, new powertrains, upgraded suspension, and an all-new and far more pleasant interior, the Challenger took a leap that kept it competitive with the Camaro and Mustang.</p>, <p>For 2016, the Challenger added a new Blacktop Appearance group with black accents, available Plum Crazy paint, and, for the UConnect infotainment system, a drag-and-drop menu, Siri Eyes Free, and "Do Not Disturb" feature.</p>, <p>Changes for 2017 were limited to some updates to the Challenger's already impressive infotainment system, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Additionally, a new Challenger GT variant was added to the lineup with the model's first application of all-wheel drive—but the GT was only available with an automatic and with the V-6 engine, slightly dimming its sporty appeal.</p>, <p>Model year 2018 will go down in history: Dodge's new Challenger SRT Demon is the first purpose-built, street-legal drag racing car in decades, and it's unlike anything else you'll find on the market.</p>, <p><strong>Dodge Challenger history</strong></p>, <p>The first Challenger dates back to 1970, though there was a long hiatus between that model and today's. Sold through 1974, the original Challenger was available in four hardtop models: Challenger Six, V8, T/A, and R/T. Convertibles were offered in 1970 and 1971 only. Engines ranged from a 225 cubic-inch V-6 to a 230-hp, 318 cubic-inch V-8; a 340 cubic-inch V-8; and the 290-hp, 383-cubic-inch V-8. All models came standard with a three-speed manual transmission except for the 383 cubic-inch V-8, which was only available with a TorqueFlite automatic.</p>, <p>The R/T featured a 383 cubic-inch Magnum V-8, rated for 335 hp initially, but later revised to 300 hp. The R/T could also be upgraded to a 440 cubic-inch Magnum, a 440 cubic-inch Six-Pack and a 426 cubic-inch Hemi.</p>, <p>Dodge also sold a Challenger-badged version of the Mitsubishi Sapporo from 1978 through 1983. It had front-wheel drive, was much smaller than the original, and was powered only by four-cylinder engines.</p>]

[<p>The Dodge Durango is a butch, three-row crossover SUV that can tow a family or boat—or both.</p>, <p>The Durango is related somewhat to the Jeep Grand Cherokee, although the Jeep doesn't offer three rows of seating. It counts as a distant cousin the Mercedes-Benz GLE Class, one of the last remnants of the Daimler-Chrysler days.</p>, <p>With the Durango, Dodge has an SUV that appeals to families that need towing capability thanks to its rear-drive bias. Bonus? There's an optional 5.7-liter V-8 and an even larger 6.4-liter V-8 in the Durango SRT. It's the closest thing to a sports car with room for the whole family that you'll find on the market. </p>, <p>This year, the 2018 Durango adds a new, high-po SRT variant that makes it by far the most muscular SUV suited for the school run. The Durango R/T gets a new look, and other trim levels see minor optional equipment shuffling.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_durango_2018">2018 Dodge Durango review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Dodge Durango</strong></p>, <p>After a one-year hiatus for the badge, the current-generation version of the Durango was introduced for 2011. Even though it’s not all that much smaller than the version it replaces, it’s worlds apart. With a newfound focus toward on-the-road performance—as well as fantastic refinement and a warm, top-notch interior including conveniences like adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, keyless ignition, a heated steering wheel, and Sirius Backseat TV—the 2011 Durango took after German luxury SUVs without completely turning its back on ruggedness and towing. Powertrains include a V-6 that shoppers no longer need shy away from—a 290-hp version of Chrysler’s 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6—along with a snarly 5.7-liter Hemi V-8.</p>, <p>Sharing its underpinnings with the Jeep Grand Cherokee and owing some of its engineering influence to former Chrysler owner Daimler (you can see it in some of the details and interior packaging), the latest Durango shares its mechanicals with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, but is longer to allow a third row of seating. The current Mercedes M- and GL-Class SUVs are built on the same architecture as the Grand Cherokee and Durango.</p>, <p>Dodge made just a few but significant changes to the Durango lineup for 2013. Second-row captain's chair availability was opened up to all models and leather upholstery became standard across the board as well. A new Rallye appearance package borrowed the R/T's looks for V-6 models. Safety tech got a boost with the addition of a blind-spot monitors and cross-path detection that gets activated when the vehicle is reversing—great for parking lots.</p>, <p>For the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083231_battle-of-the-suvs-2014-dodge-durango-toyota-highlander-and-nissan-pathfinder-hybrid">2014 model year</a>, the Durango adopted a version of the new ZF eight-speed automatic now found in the Ram 1500 and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. On the outside, the Durango got projector-beam headlamps plus hockey-stick-shaped LED running lamps on all but the base SXT. Top R/T and Citadel models got HID headlights, while projector fog lamps and the slimmer new textured crosshair grille, in combination with a sculpted hood and lower front fascia, made the Durango look brawnier. New wheel designs, including a Hyper Black finish, helped punctuate the look, but it's in back where the Durango's look changed most. LED racetrack lighting, as seen on the Dodge Dart, formed a ribbon of light across the tail, with 192 individual lamps in all.</p>, <p>Inside, the instrument panel was reshaped and redesigned, so as to fit right in alongside the recently refreshed Dodge Charger, and new five-inch or 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreens are housed in the center stack; the Durango also got a new SD card slot, USB outlet, and aux input, with a redesigned media storage bin. The Durango added a 7.0-inch configurable digital gauge to customize info displays.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Durango got wider availability of the Rally and Blacktop appearance packages, newly available red Nappa leather seating, and a Beats by Dre sound system as a new option.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Durango comes in SXT, GT, R/T, and Citadel trims. The GT takes the place of the former Limited. Otherwise, a new Citadel trim package gets nappa leather seats and a wrapped instrument panel; there's a trailer view for the rearview camera; and standard 5-passenger seating on the Durango SXT, with an option for a third-row seat.</p>, <p>The 2018 Durango lineup sees its biggest underhood upgrade yet: a 475-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 plucked from the Dodge Challenger SRT and Charger SRT.</p>, <p><strong>Dodge Durango history</strong></p>, <p>The Durango was originally introduced in 1998. Those first-generation models were relatively simple, truck-based SUVs with underpinnings and styling borrowed directly from the Dakota pickup, and they didn’t make much effort to hide their truck roots. Models with V-8s under the hood—either the 5.2-liter or 5.9-liter—were more popular than those with the wheezy, slow-revving base engine, a 3.9-liter V-6. A 4.7-liter V-8 later joined the lineup and offered somewhat better gas mileage.</p>, <p>Overall, these first-generation versions of the Durango could be quite luxuriously equipped—and they offered a pretty pleasant ride considering their truck underpinnings—but these models had somewhat clumsy handling and roadholding. In an early drive of this Durango we noted that Dodge had promoted the model as “Not too big, not too little, but just right,” and we pronounced that “despite the same story line, the 1998 Durango is no fairy tale.”</p>, <p>In 2004, Dodge delivered what the market might have been hungrier for had it come out in 1998: a true full-size SUV. Arriving at a time when Americans were just starting to fizzle out on the most monstrous of SUVs, this Durango’s timing was unfortunate. The 2004 Durango, as the new Dakota that came out around that time, had much more in common with the larger Ram and rode on a new coil-spring rear suspension with a Watts linkage—which greatly improved handling over rough surfaces, even though it was larger and heavier than its predecessor.</p>, <p>When introduced, this generation of Durangos was offered with a 210-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 or a choice of V-8s: a 4.7-liter worth 230 hp and a 5.7-liter HEMI that made 330 hp; six-cylinder models used a four-speed automatic transmission, while the V-8 models received a five-speed. There was also a choice of rear-drive, four-wheel drive with a low-range, and an automatic all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>For 2007, the Durango got a slight refresh, then for 2008, both V-8 engines in the Durango got more power—303 hp for the 4.7-liter and 376 hp for the 5.7-liter. And that was much-welcomed; for all of these second-generation model years, we found the 5,000-plus-pound Durango to feel heavy and a bit sluggish—even with its V-8 engines. But tow ratings we impressive (up to 8,500 pounds), and toward the end of its run (around 2008) Dodge introduced more tech and entertainment features—such as the MyGig infotainment system, which was pretty advanced for its time.</p>, <p>EPA ratings for some of these models landed in the low teens, and we saw single-digit mpg figures in a couple of drives of the earlier HEMI versions. A few 2009 Dodge Durango Hybrid models are out there—reviews noted reasonably improved performance and much-improved fuel economy—but the model was costly and a hard sell, and eventually fell victim to Chrysler's bankruptcy.</p>]

[<p>The Dodge Viper is the brand's front-engine, rear-drive, V-10-powered halo car. It's a legend in its own time, but its days are numbered. </p>, <p>Over 25 years, the Dodge Viper has evolved from a crude throwback to muscle car days, to a more supple supercar with tolerable street manners and stunning track capability. Unfortunately, the 2017 model year will be the last for the Viper. At least it's going out at the top of its game—as raw as ever and delightfully unrefined. </p>, <p>The Viper is a rival for just about every sports car that thinks it can knock it off, including the Chevrolet Corvette, Mercedes-AMG GT, Chevy Camaro Z/28, and Ford Shelby GT350 Mustang.</p>, <p>Model year 2017 marks is the end of the line for the Viper; several special editions will help it close out a storied run. </p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_viper_2017">2017 Dodge Viper SRT review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The final Dodge Viper</strong></p>, <p>After a two-model year hiatus, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075087_2013-srt-viper-makes-debut-with-640-horsepower-v-10">third-generation Viper</a> arrived for the 2013 model year as a coupe. With a new version of the venerable pushrod V-10 engine (making 640 horsepower) and Tremec 6-speed manual—plus an evolution of its curvy, bulbous supercar styling-—the latest Viper has truly evolved into an all-around sports car. Credit goes to the addition of traction and stability control, launch control, an adjustable suspension, better seats, a more spacious interior, modern connectivity features, and vastly upgraded trims, all combining for <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080567_2013-srt-viper-first-drive">a far superior experience in most kinds of driving</a>. Fortunately, it delivers on all fronts.</p>, <p>After spending 2014 under Chrysler's SRT banner, the Viper returned mid-year to the Dodge stables with many more customization options. The Viper TA (Time Attack) model was also added for 2014.</p>, <p>
Updates for the 2015 model year included a 5-hp bump for the 8.4-liter V-10, a different sixth-gear ratio for upper trim levels, a new GT model to slot between base and GTS Vipers, a Viper TA 2.0 Special Edition model, and several new colors.</p>, <p>Shortly after the 2015 models were introduced, Chrysler announced a big price cut of $15,000 to help spur the car's flagging sales.</p>, <p>Dodge offered a special one-of-one program for the 2015 Viper, with a new GTC model—the C standing for custom. For a starting price of $96,995, buyers got a choice of <span>8,000 exterior colors, 24,000 hand-painted custom stripe designs, 10 different wheel options, 16 interior trims, and six aerodynamic packages. This overwhelming number of choices was to ensure that no two cars came out the same and that Viper owners received treatment similar to those in line for a Rolls-Royce.</span></p>, <p>The Viper ACR returned for 2016, bringing back the top track-focused trim from years past. The new package included meaty tires, carbon-ceramic Brembo brakes, adjustable Bilstein coil-over suspension, a unique steering wheel, and a faux-suede-lined interior. Weight savings came from thinner carpets and a stereo downgraded to just three speakers. An optional Extreme Aero package added ten adjustable or removable pieces, including dive planes, the rear wing, and a front splitter extension.</p>, <p>Dodge celebrated the Viper's 25th anniversary by announcing that <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1104605_dodge-viper-to-die-after-2017-model-year">2017 would be the car's final model year</a>. To send it out in style, however, Dodge announced five special edition models and later added a sixth. These include the Viper 1:28 Edition ACR, Viper GTS-R Commemorative Edition ACR, Viper Snakeskin Edition GTC, Viper Snakeskin ACR Edition, Viper VoooDoo II Edition ACR, and Viper Dodge Dealer Edition ACR. The GT model does not return, but, otherwise, there are no changes for 2017.</p>, <p>While the Viper has ended production, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne has said there is still a possibility that <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1101850_new-dodge-viper-possible-says-sergio-marchionne">a new Viper will return in the future</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Dodge Viper history</strong></p>, <p>In 1988, the Chrysler Corporation was still independent, and the smallest among the Detroit Three. Its products were about to change forever under the direction of new leaders like Bob Lutz and Francois Castaing. The company decided to design a concept car—an outrageous two-seat roadster with a monster V-10 engine and a plastic-paneled body. The resulting concept car grabbed so much attention at the 1989 Detroit Auto Show that Chrysler decided to build it—as the Dodge Viper RT/10.</p>, <p>The Viper's been a brashly styled supercar from the moment it was born. It initially looked like little more than a kit car, first as a roadster and then also as a coupe.</p>, <p>The first-generation car arrived as a 1992 model. That original RT/10 was inspired by the 1960s Cobra, but at its heart was a rough, rumbly 8.0-liter V-10 engine derived from those used in Dodge pickup trucks. With 400 horsepower and a 6-speed manual transmission, the rear-drive Viper proved unbelievably fast—and, many reviewers said, notoriously skittish. With so much engine weight on its nose, and such a short rear end sitting over its wide rear tires, the Viper could snap into oversteer very easily. With a good launch, testers estimated its 0-60 mph times at about 4.5 seconds, and the top speed reached nearly 165 mph.</p>, <p>That original Viper was unabashedly raw, and its out-there look attracted all sorts of admirers, from the children who first saw it at auto shows to the execs who gave it the green light for production. In the real world, some found the details, specifically the interior, lacking. The roll-up roof panel was difficult to install and transport, as were the drop-in plastic side windows, and the cabin's air circulation wasn't very good. There was also a good chance of burning a leg on the side exhausts when getting in or out, and the heat they transmitted into the cabin was not always enjoyable.</p>, <p>The first round of updates came in 1996, when the V-10 was bumped up to 415 hp and the car lost a little weight, both of which helped improve 0 to 60 mph times to about 4 seconds flat. A coupe version, dubbed GTS, was also added that year. Later, the engine was updated to reach 450 hp, the exhausts were modified to exit at the rear, and the interior was improved.</p>, <p>In 2003, a second-generation Viper arrived in showrooms, parented by DaimlerChrysler—the corporate result of a merger between the company and the German parent of Mercedes-Benz. Along with the new look, the Viper lineup took on the SRT-10 designation. The 2003-2010 Viper wore the imprint of that merger. It was more lithe-looking and far nicer inside, but less exuberant than the original. The engine's displacement rose to 8.3 liters, and the Viper chassis grew more rigid and lost more weight. With up to 510 hp, this generation of Viper could accelerate to 60 mph in less than 3.9 seconds, while hitting a top speed of 190 mph. Handling improved greatly, though the car still kicked out vivid oversteer when provoked.</p>, <p>The final round of changes to that generation of the car brought the 2008-2010 Viper an 8.4-liter V-10 with 600 hp. Acceleration times of 3.5 seconds to 60 mph were clocked by enthusiast magazines, and the Viper's top speed was a claimed 197 mph. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/dodge_charger
[<p>The Dodge Charger is a four-door, full-size sedan available with a V-6- or V-8, with rear- or all-wheel drive. Related to the softer Chrysler 300 sedan and burnout-hero Dodge Challenger, the Charger is the most practical of the bunch—maybe.</p>, <p>With the SRT Hellcat model, the Charger has staked its claim as the fastest four-door in the world. Powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 making an astronomical 707 horsepower, the Hellcat is capable of topping 200 mph. Thanks to its superior aerodynamics, the Charger SRT Hellcat is faster even than its Challenger Hellcat sibling, even though the Challenger is a somewhat lighter car.</p>, <p>Dodge also offers the 485-hp, 6.4-liter naturally aspirated SRT engine in the Charger SRT 392 and R/T Scat Pack models, the 370-hp 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 in other R/T models, and a 3.6-liter V-6 with as much as 300 horsepower in SE and SXT models. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and V-6 models can be ordered with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>For 2018, Dodge created new model lines, SXT Plus and GT Plus, but didn't make major mechanical changes.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_charger_2018">2018 Dodge Charger review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>Today's Dodge Charger</strong></p>, <p>After a major refresh for 2015, the latest Charger rolls with a new version of its Uconnect infotainment system, one that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. Changes were more substantial in 2016, when the Super Track Pack became available for V-6 models, a new Plum Crazy "heritage" color was added, a revived Blacktop Appearance package returned, additional equipment was added on the SRT 392 model, and some new tech features like Siri Eyes Free arrived. </p>, <p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1093858_2015-dodge-charger-srt-hellcat-the-fastest-sedan-in-the-world">Charger SRT Hellcat</a> was 2015's big news and it continues to draw admiration today. With a supercharged V-8 under the hood, the Hellcat accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds, officially, on its way to a top speed of 204 mph.</p>, <p>The Charger SRT Hellcat has a Drive Modes feature, with Sport, Track, Default, and Eco settings that alter transmission shift points, paddle-shifter behavior, traction controls, and suspension. It also comes with a red and black keyfobs, with the black one offering reduced engine output to a mere 500 horses. There's also a Valet Mode, as there should be for a sedan priced over $60,000.</p>, <p>The Charger SRT 392 and R/T Scat Pack are no slouches, either, with a 0 to 60 mph time around four seconds. The SRT 392 also benefits from some of the upgrades made for the Hellcat version, while the Scat Pack gets big brakes and a starting price around $40,000.</p>, <p>The 2015 model year also brought revised styling inside and out to all Chargers, SRT or otherwise. Dodge managed to make a pretty significant change to the Charger's look without touching the middle of the car. The doors and body shell carried over, while the front and rear saw big modifications. The exterior is a combination of classic and modern influences, with elements from the Dodge Dart's styling. The interior features quality materials, and a fresh, modern look.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Charger added a Hellcat-inspired Daytona package and underwent a number of major infotainment updates such as the addition of Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p><strong>Dodge Charger history</strong></p>, <p>The Charger name is steeped in history, though it was attached to performance two-door models for much of its past. The original Dodge Charger was built in 1965 as an option package for the Dart GT, then from 1966 to 1978 as a rear-wheel-drive, two-door muscle car. It was built in four generations over that 12-year run, though the second-generation car, built from 1968 to 1970 is the most recognizable. This version was, and still is for many, the iconic Charger. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Charger was available with the same engines as the Challenger, including the 426 cubic-inch Hemi, the 440 Magnum, and the 440 Six-Pack V-8s.</p>, <p>From 1983 to 1987, the Charger was re-envisioned as a compact hatchback, a popular seller spun off from Mitsubishi mechanicals. Whether or not it was a true Charger is still up for debate. From the end of that model's run, the Charger name was put on ice until it returned in 2006.</p>, <p>Based on the same platform as the Dodge Challenger muscle car, the 2006 Charger sedan made legitimate claims to the Charger heritage, with design cues that reinforce those ties. In base SE form it featured a not-so-muscular 2.7-liter V-6 engine paired to a 4-speed automatic, but still delivered the size and comfort of a large sedan. The SXT trim level substituted a 3.5-liter V-6 and added satellite radio, traction and stability control, a power driver's seat, and other options. The R/T package added a 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 engine rated at 368 horsepower, a special AutoStick automatic transmission, a performance exhaust, steering wheel-mounted audio controls, power/heated front seats, and power heated folding side mirrors. The range-topping SRT8 featured a 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 with output of 425 horsepower. It was capable of hauling the big sedan to 60 mph in the low-five-second range.</p>, <p>For 2011, Dodge gave the Charger a redesign, with a more outrageous take on the exterior styling, combined with a more modern and contemporary dash that felt far better detailed that the old interior. Chrysler's Pentastar V-6 was introduced as the base engine, making 292 hp, while Hemi-powered models were bumped up to 370 hp and the top SRT8 was boosted to 6.4 liters and 470 hp. The Charger also became more tech-proficient, with a new Garmin navigation system, an in-car wi-fi system (using USB dongles), and some new safety-related systems like active cruise control and blind-spot monitoring.</p>, <p>More powertrain changes came for 2012, with V-6 models switching to a much more tractable 8-speed automatic transmission. The gearbox not only aided refinement but boosted fuel economy compared to the five-speed unit it replaced, managing up to 31 mpg on the highway. For 2013, Dodge added Rallye and Blacktop appearance packages that also included a 300-hp version of the V-6. The extra power came by way of a performance exhaust and cold-air intake. The same year, a Beats by Dre sound system was made available as an option, as was a black-painted roof, and the Garmin-based navigation system received an enhanced feature set.</p>, <p>For 2013, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081177_2013-dodge-charger-awd-sport-announced">new Charger AWD Sport edition</a> became available on both the V-6 and V-8 (non-SRT) versions, with added power for the V-6 car and 19-inch wheels and tires. Dodge also launched the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080656_2013-dodge-charger-daytona-preview-2012-los-angeles-auto-show">2013 Charger Daytona edition</a> with new graphics, a more aggressive exterior look, and small tweaks to gearing and suspension for sharper performance. </p>, <p>For 2014, a new Redline Package emerged with a tuned version of the 3.6-liter V-6. It was packaged with a few styling tweaks and an upgraded audio system.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/dodge_grand-caravan
[<p>The Dodge Grand Caravan is the latest descendant of the original minivan, the Dodge Caravan. Its future is uncertain: originally slated for a somewhat-compulsory retirement for 2018 (it lacked federally mandated side curtain airbags) it was given a new lease on life thanks to a small overhaul.</p>, <p>Spawned in the 1980s, the Caravan was the first minivan to be sold in the U.S. when Chrysler picked up an idea first pitched to Ford Motor Company—that of a smaller van based on car, not truck, running gear. </p>, <p>The Grand Caravan retires soon, but it's worth considering as a budget-friendly van with some nice convenience features. It's unchanged for 2018, while FCA focuses its sales efforts on the wonderfully advanced Chrysler Pacifica.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_grand-caravan_2018">2018 Dodge Grand Caravan review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Over the years, the Caravan was offered in "Grand" long-wheelbase form for several years before it became the official, full name of the Dodge minivan.</p>, <p>The Grand Caravan has lost some features, like all-wheel drive and manual transmissions and turbocharging, while it's gained others, such as fold-away seats and dual sliding side doors.</p>, <p>It's also lost a couple of stablemates: both the Plymouth Voyager and later the Chrysler Voyager, and now the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, have passed into the history books.</p>, <p>The newest Grand Caravan remains one of the most flexible, and most affordable, family haulers available though its safety scores have sagged.</p>, <p><strong>The new Dodge Grand Caravan</strong></p>, <p>In 2008, Chrysler updated the minivans with more upright styling, which seemed to be more appropriate for the Dodge Grand Caravan. A flex-fuel version that could run on E85 fuel was added, and a new Swivel 'N Go option added a picnic table and rotating seats to the popular minivan--though that option proved unpopular and was later dropped. The short-wheelbase Caravan disappeared with the new generation--replaced by the crossover-like Dodge Journey instead--and the new vans were saddled with a plasticky, inexpensive-looking interior as Chrysler struggled to avoid bankruptcy. Stability control became standard, along with curtain airbags; options included satellite radio and TV, provided by Sirius. Three V-6 engines made up the engine lineup, and a new six-speed automatic joined the powertrain roster.</p>, <p>For the 2011 model year, the Dodge Grand Caravan continued to resonate with families on the go, more than 25 years after the minivan first rolled out of showrooms. Chrysler's new owner Fiat gave it a new interior with much nicer finishes than that of the 2008-2010 models, plus a new 283-horsepower V-6 coupled to a six-speed automatic—which became the only powertrain. Safety features and flexible seating continued to lead the class of minivans, and it was awarded almost perfect crash-test scores. Mild handling and sheet metal updates were less dramatic. Fuel economy approached best in class, at 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway.</p>, <p>Through the 2012 model year, Chrysler built a version of the Dodge minivan for VW, which sold it as the Routan. The Routan was basically a rebadged Grand Caravan with mid-level equipment but no Stow n' Go second-row seating. It's since been discontinued.</p>, <p>The Grand Caravan was largely unchanged from 2011 to 2015. In 2013, the Grand Caravan added an optional entertainment system with Blu-Ray compatibility and with two separate screens that let rear-seat passengers watch two different video programs. The 2015 model year brought only a few minor packaging changes with value in mind.</p>, <p>Chrysler introduced its new minivan at the 2016 Detroit auto show as the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chrysler_pacifica_2017">2017 Chrysler Pacifica</a>. For 2017, the Dodge Grand Caravan remains on sale as a lower-priced alternative, offered in four basic configurations.</p>, <p><strong>Grand Caravan history<br/></strong></p>, <p>First conceived for Ford as early as the 1970s, the original Voyager and Caravan were moved across town to Chrysler and unveiled as 1984 models. Those two short-wheelbase vans would be considered compact cars today, based as they were on front-wheel-drive K-Car underpinnings, but a car-sized vehicle with the practicality and volume of a traditional van proved an instant hit with consumers—especially those with families. Early models were powered by four-cylinder engines, with the powertrain lineup soon expanding to turbo fours and V-6s as well. They came mostly with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, though some of those early Caravans were built with four- and five-speed manual gearboxes.</p>, <p>Despite what now seems incredibly primitive equipment—no airbags, no anti-lock brakes, no rear-seat entertainment, no power doors or hatch— the first minivans offered three rows of seating for up to seven occupants, and a single sliding door on the passenger side that made access to back-seat kids easier for parents in parking lots. A long-wheelbase Grand Caravan variant joined the range in 1987, and a small number of cargo-panel bodies were sold as Ram commercial vans as well.</p>, <p>The second-generation Dodge Caravan, sold from 1991 through 1995, brought many improvements. It still ran on K-Car running gear from a decade earlier, albeit significantly updated. All-wheel drive appeared as an option for snow-belt buyers, anti-lock brakes were added, and safety features came to include dual front airbags and integrated child safety seats. Too few mourned the end of artificial woodgrain, an option on more luxurious versions of the first-gen Caravan. The faux wood option would hang on for a few years on the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, however.</p>, <p>For 1996, Chrysler introduced new minivans on an all-new chassis, with novel new engineering and a fresh design. The rounded look outside had hidden sliding-door tracks, while the interior had its own set of innovations. In this generation, Chrysler introduced the driver-side sliding door to the market as an option and included anti-lock brakes on all models. The second door became standard equipment by the time the third-generation vans went out of production in 2000.</p>, <p>While Chrysler kept a four-cylinder engine around for the more frugal, low-impact buyers, and likely to attract fleets, the majority of buyers went for a V-6 backed by an automatic transmission. Chrysler also added roller wheels to the second- and third-row seats for easier removal and repositioning. This generation improved on the previous van's safety record, although it was not without reliability problems in the early years; there were reports of transmission failure from a variety of consumer-group sources.</p>, <p>In the 2001 model year, a re-skin of the previous generation minivan added more distinct grilles for the Chrysler and Dodge versions. The Plymouth version left the lineup as the brand was shuttered. The Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan gained a crosshair grille that would find its way across the brand lineup. Wider and longer, the new minivans added features like power operation for the sliding side doors. A cargo version reappeared in 2003, and for 2005, the company revamped the vans with a new feature: Stow 'N Go seating, which allowed drivers to hide the second and third-row seats under the floor, or to use the allotted space for storage. The feature was planned in as Chrysler spun a new crossover, the Pacifica, from the same architecture. The seating flexibility remains among the best in the class, five years later. Side airbags also were added as an option.</p>]

[<p>The Dodge Journey is a value-oriented crossover available with seating for up to seven. It's distinctly dated, but its low price tag means it shows up on many cost-conscious buyers' shopping lists.</p>, <p>With the Journey, Dodge competes with models such as the Chevy Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, and Toyota RAV4.</p>, <p>Among mid-size crossovers, the Journey is relatively aged. Technically a three-row crossover, the Journey is best when it seats five—wayback passengers need not bring their legs. </p>, <p>This year, the Dodge Journey is unchanged for what may be its final model year.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/dodge_journey_2018">2018 Dodge Journey review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Introduced for the 2009 model year, the Journey brought a new five-door shape to a Dodge lineup that was in the process of shedding its larger but lower Dodge Magnum wagon. The styling evoked other Dodge vehicles in its aggressive front end while carrying more than a hint of the Jeep Grand Cherokee in its rear hatch. The interior proved to be more of a dated mess: the Journey's canted instruments and boxed gauges called up unhappy memories of the Dodge Omni hatchback of the 1980s. </p>, <p>Despite some miscues, the Journey came to market with a strong variety of configurations. It offered front- or all-wheel drive, with a choice of 4- or 6-cylinder engines—a competitive-sounding package that fell short on performance and lacked refinement. Carried over largely unchanged through the 2010 model year, the Journey had a 173-horsepower 4-cylinder, a flat performer, and a 235-hp V-6 that wasn't much more encouraging in low-speed driving, though it was much more capable of passing maneuvers with less noise and angst. Decent ride quality matched up with acceptably responsive steering for a moderately pleasant driving experience. Fuel economy hit 19 mpg city, 25 highway on 4-cylinder models, and the V-6 front-drive Journey wasn't far behind at 16/24 mpg. The V-6 with AWD dropped to 15/23 mpg, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>Chrysler retuned the Journey's chassis for the 2011 model year. It also replaced the aging 3.5-liter V-6 with the then-new Pentastar 3.6-liter, making a respectable 283 hp and mated to an equally new 6-speed automatic. The interior was also redone, with a cleaner and more modern design. The sheet metal was untouched, although the grille and headlights did receive some freshening.</p>, <p>Functionally it was carried over and remains a flexible compact crossover to this day. The Journey can seat up to seven passengers, but adults will fit best in the front two rows. The optional third-row bench is for two children, max. Elsewhere, the Journey does a minivan-like job at storing stuff. The second row slides for more legroom, and the front passenger seat has storage built in beneath the seat cushion--there are also lots of bins and cubbies under the seats and between passengers, as well as in its door panels and under the floor of the second row. The second-row floor bins can double as coolers, as well.</p>, <p>The Journey scores well in safety testing, at least initially. The IIHS formerly gave it Top Safety Pick status, although it has not run the Journey through its new small overlap test to be able to keep that award, while federal testers have given it a rating of four out of five stars overall—scores that are much less competitive now than when the Journey was new. Standard safety items are plentiful, including four-wheel ABS disc brakes, active head restraints, stability and traction control, and a full load of airbags. The Journey also offers common add-ons like a rearview camera, as well as some rarer features, such as integrated second-row child seats.</p>, <p>Chrysler's UConnect multimedia controller is available, as is Bluetooth, while a USB port is standard. For 2013, 17-inch wheels were made standard even on the base AVP and SE models. The Journey used to offer in-car satellite TV, but those systems faded away when few buyers opted for them and the service was discontinued.</p>, <p>Late in the 2012 model year we drove the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1078061_2012-dodge-journey-sxt-driven">updated Dodge Journey SXT</a> and found it to be well-packaged, well-performing, and improved to the point of being a very strong contender even against the likes of the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.</p>, <p><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1065015_chrysler-drops-prices-on-several-2012-models">Chrysler dropped prices significantly</a> on the base 2012 Journey SE; and confusingly, from 2011 to 2012, and again from 2012 to 2013, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1061411_wading-through-dodges-changing-trim-names-for-2012">Chrysler changed its trim levels</a> for the Journey as well as other models.</p>, <p>For 2014, Dodge introduced a Crossroad trim level for the Journey. Its name and design are supposed to evoke more of an Audi Allroad-like crossover wagon theme, but mechanically it is the same as the other trim levels. The Crossroad gets dark trim up front, with darkened headlight units, front and rear fascias that mimic the look of skidplates, and its own 19-inch wheel design, as well as unique upholstery with leather trim and mesh cloth seat inserts. Few changes were made to the Journey for the 2015 and 2016 model years. A Journey GT topped the model range for 2017.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ferrari_f12berlinetta
[<p>The exotic Ferrari F12 Berlinetta is a design-focused, super-performance 2+2 sports car. It was the Italian brand's fastest and most powerful production car before the LaFerrari was introduced.</p>, <p>The Berlinetta's rear-wheel drive, front-engine layout ties it to Ferrari's classics, but the technology found within is decidedly modern. It combines some of Ferrari's best design and performance in a stunning grand touring body.</p>, <p>Introduced for the 2013 model year, the 2017 F12 carries over this year in berlinetta and tdf forms.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ferrari_f12berlinetta_2017">2017 Ferrari F12 Berlinetta preview</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Ferrari's <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1073509_ferrari-f12berlinetta-supercar-revealed">F12 Berlinetta's design</a> is both typically Ferrari and completely modern, almost avant-garde. The dramatic, sculpted bodywork along the car's flanks has been controversial, drawing both praise and criticism, but above all, a great deal of attention. The overall proportions are classic front-engine Ferrari, with a low-slung stance, long hood, a set back passenger compartment, and sleek, organic curves flowing over the wheels.</p>, <p>Under the long, low hood is a similarly long 65-degree V-12 engine that displaces 6.3 liters. Power output is a staggering 730 horsepower at 8,500 rpm, with torque maxing out at 509 pound-feet at a lofty 6,000 rpm, though Ferrari says at least 80 percent of peak torque is available as low as 2,500 rpm. Until the LaFerrari showed up, the F12 Berlinetta's V-12 was the most potent Ferrari road-car engine yet produced. All of that power delivers 0-to-60-mph times of 3.1 seconds and a top speed of 210 mph, which aren't too far behind the new range-topping LaFerrari and are better than the figures of many other supercars.</p>, <p>The F12 tdf joined the lineup in 2016, as an homage to the Tour de France of the 1950s and 1960s, in which Ferrari dominated other comers. The F12 tdf gets different intake plumbing, a larger throttle body, and solid lifters in place of hydraulic tappets. Power rises to 769 hp and 519 lb-ft of torque, and the redline rises to 8,900 rpm. With the additional power and shorter-ratio 7-speed dual-clutch, the F12tdf runs 0-60 mph in under three seconds, and hits a top speed of 215 mph.</p>, <p>
While speed is easy to achieve in this car, the F12 is also comfortable at a more relaxed pace, as is true of other current Ferraris. The paddle-shift 7-speed dual-clutch transmission can be dialed from comfortable, almost imperceptible shifts to extremely quick and even borderline violent gear changes when in a sporting mode. Even with the high-tech adjustable transmission and available engine stop-start, the F12 manages to consume plenty of fuel no matter how it's driven, with a combined rating of 13 mpg, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>As successor to the 599, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/f12berlinetta">F12 Berlinetta</a> is similarly a V-12-powered 2+2 grand touring super sports car, but it differs rather significantly in several respects. A shorter wheelbase, narrower overall width, and lower ride height make it almost universally smaller. Weight distribution is shifted rearward, with 54 percent of the mass riding on the rear axle. The F12 Berlinetta is also lighter than the 599, incorporating a total of 12 different aluminum alloys that help it tip the scales at just 3,362 pounds, while also increasing torsional rigidity compared to the 599 by 20 percent.</p>, <p>The F12 has plenty of new and racing-derived technology to keep all of that power in check and aid handling. The brakes use carbon-ceramic discs, the dampers are adaptive magnetorheological units, and Ferrari's latest electronic helpers are along for the ride: the E-diff differential, F1-Trac traction control, advanced stability control, and performance-focused ABS. The settings for these systems are controlled, like they are on other Ferrari road and race cars, by the "manettino" switch mounted on the steering wheel.</p>, <p>The F12 Berlinetta can be outfitted in an immense array of exterior colors, interior colors and materials, and other buyer-selected appearance and performance options. Ferrari's variety of personalization services, including the Tailor Made program, can realize nearly any desired modification. The cost of these services can be high, but then, that's not a problem for most F12 Berlinetta owners. In fact, the first F12 Berlinetta delivered to U.S. soil <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080547_first-ferrari-f12-berlinetta-delivered-to-u-s-sells-for-1-125-million">sold at auction for a price of $1.125 million</a>—for the benefit of Hurricane Sandy victims. The company recently unveiled another special edition F12, this one <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1096480_special-ferrari-f12-berlinetta-honors-250-gtos-victory-in-1964-tour-de-france-automobile">a tribute to the 1964 Tour de France Automobile-winning 250 GTO</a>, complete with silver paint and cross-bonnet yellow stripe.</p>, <p>To celebrate the brand's 60th anniversary in the U.S., Ferrari created the F12-based <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1094884_ferrari-f60-america-special-edition-revealed">F60 America</a>. It's an open-top car, and only 10 will be built for a reported price of $3.2 million. The U.S. remains Ferrari's largest market, and it's likely that all 10 of the cars were spoken for before it was even unveiled at the celebration in Beverly Hills. Ferrari is not expected to build a normal-production convertible version of the F12. </p>, <p>An update to the F12, or a successor with a different name, is likely to use a hybridized V-12 engine. Ferrari has said that future models will all need some sort of fuel-economy-enhancing powertrain, with the new V-8s now getting turbochargers and the twelve-cylinder powertrain in the LaFerrari hypercar benefiting from a new hybrid system. A version of the LaFerrari's engine, as well as other items pioneered on that car, is likely to make its way into the next big V-12 Ferrari coupe.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ferrari_california
[<p>The Ferrari California T was the automaker's "entry-level" sports car, if there is such a thing. It was replaced in 2017 with the Ferrari Portofino, which is an evolution of the same idea. It's a hardtop convertible that can seat four passengers—on paper.</p>, <p>For those familiar with Ferraris, the combination of comfort and speed might not be a surprise, but for those new to the brand, the California strikes a remarkable compromise between the company's race-bred heritage and the demands of comfortable daily driving.</p>, <p>Rivals for the California T include the Porsche 911 Cabriolet, the Maserati GranTurismo, Lamborghini's Huracan and the AMG-powered Mercedes SL-Class models.</p>, <p>The California received significant changes for 2015, including a new turbocharged engine and a T appended to its name to denote the change. In typical Ferrari fashion, the subsequent two years have been essentially carryovers. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ferrari_california_2017">2017 Ferrari California T review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>When Ferrari's first folding-hardtop convertible went on sale back in 2008, it was powered by a 460-horsepower, 4.3-liter naturally aspirated V-8 engine. This marked several other firsts: the first Ferrari engine to use direct fuel injection, the first use of the company's dual-clutch transaxle, and the first use of a multi-link rear suspension in one of the brand's cars. While most of those items have carried over, the powertrain saw big changes for the 2015 model year.</p>, <p>The California carried forward from its 2008 arrival to 2012 largely unchanged. In the spring of 2012, <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075413_2013-ferrari-california-hits-the-hills-of-maranello-video">Ferrari updated the California</a>, giving it 30 extra hp and removing 66 pounds as compared to the previous model. The weight savings came by way of more aluminum in the car's construction, while the extra power was enabled by revised exhaust manifolds and computer tuning. Ferrari also added an optional Handling Speciale package to the revised model, with a quicker steering rack and stiffer springs. The result was a more precise and powerful California that still retained the overall relaxed demeanor.</p>, <p>Inside the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075413_2013-ferrari-california-hits-the-hills-of-maranello-video">Ferrari California</a>, you'll find two comfortable and relatively spacious front seats, plus two compact rear perches best reserved for extra luggage with only occasional use by smaller passengers. The materials inside rise to typical Ferrari standards, and through Ferrari's highly personalized customization programs it can be made as opulent, sporty, or simply unique as you'd like. Exterior colors—and nearly any other feature of the car—can also be specially chosen through these programs.</p>, <p>An updated version called the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1026328_ferrari-f430-gt-california-22-cc-coming-to-detroit">Ferrari California T</a> arrived for the 2015 model year. Heavily revised and restyled inside and out, the California T gets a brand-new engine—upgraded from a 4.3-liter V-8 to a new twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-8 with 552 hp and 556 pound-feet of torque. Power again is shipped to the rear wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch transaxle. Ferrari estimates 0-60 mph times of under 3.6 seconds, while top speed rises to 195 mph.</p>, <p>New springs and latest-generation MagneRide magnetorheological dampers (more than 50 percent faster than before), combined with body-motion accelerometers, help reduce roll and pitch to deliver more precise handling while keeping the ride supple. The California T also boasts quicker steering courtesy of a new steering box and a modified suspension setup, while electronic systems such as the F1-Trac traction control and electronic stability have been upgraded to Ferrari’s latest spec.</p>, <p>A new infotainment system graces the California T's center stack. Its 6.5-inch touchscreen controls audio and navigation functions and is also compatible with Apple's CarPlay system, which allows control of a pared-down set of iPhone apps through any of the stereo's buttons, the touchscreen, or Siri-powered voice control.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ferrari_gtc4-lusso
[<p>The Ferrari GTC4 Lusso is an evolution of the Ferrari FF, a three-door luxury hatchback with an unmatched pedigree. It breaks new ground for the Prancing Horse; it's the first all-wheel drive vehicle from the world-renowned automaker.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our preview of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ferrari_gtc4-lusso_2017">2017 Ferrari GTC4 Lusso</a></strong></em> <strong><em>and</em></strong> <strong>Motor Authority's</strong> <em><strong><a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1097377_2015-ferrari-ff-quick-drive">review of the Ferrari FF</a>.</strong></em></p>, <p><strong>Ferrari GTC4 Lusso</strong></p>, <p>After the 2011 introduction of the FF, Ferrari embarked on a full model-line revamp. The 458 was replaced by the 488 GTB with turbo power, and the California T gained turbocharged power as well.</p>, <p>The revamped FF, renamed the GTC4 Lusso, bowed in 2016. Under the hood is Ferrari’s familiar 6.3-liter V-12, paired with the same 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. In this latest application, the engine delivers 680 horsepower and 514 pound-feet of torque, up from 651 hp. The engine is said to be much more tractable, with Ferrari claiming as much as 80 percent of the torque is produced from as low as 1,750 rpm.</p>, <p>To aid the handling, there is the four-wheel-steering system. This made its debut in the F12 tdf and here it is teamed with the 4RM all-wheel-drive system. The system also integrates a brake-based differential, adjustable dampers and Ferrari’s Slip Side Control feature to optimize handling, especially in poor conditions such as on snow-covered roads.</p>, <p>A revamped dash with a 10.25-inch screen for the infotainment system was the most notable feature change for the Lusso, which carried over for the 2017 model year with no changes.</p>, <p><strong>Ferrari FF history</strong></p>, <p>The FF made its debut at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, joining a full lineup that included the 458 Italia, 458 Spider, California, and F12 Berlinetta.</p>, <p>The styling was immediately deemed polarizing. Some called it beautiful, others found it too far from the Ferrari norm, and more still liked it despite its break with tradition.</p>, <p>In its first generation, the FF wasted little time with controversy. It bowed with a potent 651-horsepower, 6.3-liter V-12 engine, putting a top speed of 208 mph within reach; it enabled the FF to hit 60 mph in 3.7 seconds. The transmission was a 7-speed dual-clutch paddle-shift automatic, and power was sent to all four wheels.</p>, <p>Perhaps taking a cue from the body shape, the FF's four-wheel-drive system was itself a bit out of the ordinary. Instead of using a transfer case to route power to the front and rear, Ferrari hung a second transmission off the front of the engine to handle sending torque to the front axle. The system, called 4RM by Ferrari, uses a computer to decide when the front wheels get to join in and how much torque they get.</p>, <p>The front gearbox, which goes by the agricultural-sounding name of Power Takeoff Unit, employs just two gears plus reverse, enabling the full four-wheel-drive application of power in the main transmission's first through fourth gears through a system of constant-slip Haldex clutches—with no differential. A maximum of 20 percent of the engine's torque can be transmitted to the front wheels.</p>, <p>This unconventional layout allowed the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/ff">Ferrari FF</a>'s four-wheel-drive system to tip the scales at about half the weight of a traditional solution, as well as maintain an excellent-for-dynamics 47/53-percent front/rear weight distribution.</p>, <p>Even with its out-there styling and nonconformist drive system, the FF still was a real Ferrari with everything that goes along with it: a handcrafted interior made of the finest materials, a sporting ride that's not too rough, and modern details everywhere. Like nearly all Ferraris to date, the FF used a magnetorheological suspension to allow for adjustment between responsive and coddling, depending on driver wishes and road conditions.</p>, <p>The FF was certainly one of Ferrari's most useful cars, with up to 28.2 cubic feet of cargo space thanks to its shooting brake layout, and four seats. Few would make the megabuck super sports car their daily driver, but it was nevertheless up to the job—that is, if the driver could tolerate the 11 mpg city, 17 highway, 13 combined EPA fuel-economy ratings. Features appealed to the family but horrified some purists: an available rear-seat entertainment system offered two screens for DVD-watching, and a 1,280-watt, 16-channel, Quantumlogic Surround Sound audio system pumped out sound, while Apple CarPlay offered an infotainment environment.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ferrari_488-gtb
[<p>The Ferrari 488 GTB family, which includes the Ferrari 488 Spider, is a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive V-8 supercar. It follows closely to the form and layout of its predecessor, the Ferrari 458 Italia, but with a new turbocharged engine, a vastly improved interior, plenty of nods to Formula One racing, and sheet metal and details that are near-obsessive about improving aerodynamics.</p>, <p>The 488 GTB goes directly up against the McLaren 650S and Lamborghini Huracan, but it’s also a strong rival to the Porsche 911 and Aston Martin Vantage—as well as the Chevrolet Corvette.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ferrari_488-gtb_2017">2017 Ferrari 488 GTB preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p>A 3.9-liter turbocharged V-8 powers the 488 models, making 660 horsepower and 560 pound-feet of torque; it’s mated to Ferrari’s own 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The GTB can get to 60 mph in just under 3 seconds, or to 124 mph in 8.3 seconds, and Ferrari has worked hard to keep this engine essentially free of turbo lag so drivability is excellent. The engine also sounds properly inspiring, even though its peak power is achieved 1,000 revs lower in the rev band (8,000 rpm instead of 9,000 rpm). Fuel efficiency ratings aren’t bad for this kind of vehicle, at 15 mpg city, 22 highway, 18 combined, and ride, steering, and tracking are surprisingly docile for time on real (imperfect) roads.</p>, <p>On the road or out at the track, a new system called Side Slip Control 2 works with the active dampers and stability control system to help the driver be quicker out of corners—and even, potentially, to safely enjoy more of this model’s dynamic potential.</p>, <p>Ferrari’s mid-engine model took a step away from the curvaceousness of the 458 and became just a little sharper and more deeply sculpted—while managing some downright voluptuous proportions. Inside, while the dash design is an evolution from that of the 458, the cabin appointments of the are far better-detailed and modern in look and feel, with most of the controls either part of the steering wheel or in control pods on either side.</p>, <p>If you’re willing to pay a bit—okay, a lot—extra on the 488 GTB or 488 Spider, you can get various personalized appearance accessories, wheel and brake upgrades, and even a LaFerrari-style telemetry system. High-end 1,280-watt audio is offered, but all models come with Apple CarPlay compatibility, letting you share smartphone apps with a colorful screen interface.</p>, <p>Ferrari 488 Spider versions are joining the lineup later in the 2016 model year and include a special two-piece retractable hardtop arrangement with a glass rear window and a unique design treatment from the roofline back—including an extended (and aerodynamically functional) engine cover in place of the elongated rear window.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/fiat_500e
[<p>The Fiat 500e takes the Italian automaker's city-sized hatchback, guts its gas drivetrain, and installs batteries and motors, all in the interest of saving the planet.</p>, <p>With the 500e, Fiat keeps the same distinctive, cheerful Fiat looks as the rest of the range, all powered by gasoline, but replaces all the running gear with an electric motor that draws energy from a lithium-ion battery pack sited under the floorpan and rear seat.</p>, <p>The 500e arrived as a 2013, but only to California and Oregon. It's viewed as a "compliance car" for the automaker; it exists largely to meet fuel-economy standards and its significant costs may mean that parent-company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles loses money on each one driven off dealers' lots.</p>, <p>The Fiat 500e has been unchanged for two years leading into the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115319_2018-fiat-500e" title="2017 Fiat 500e - review">2018 Fiat 500e review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The 24-kwh lithium-ion battery pack sends its electricity to an electric motor that powers the front wheels; it's rated at 83 kilowatts of power (111 horsepower) and 147 pound-feet of torque. The EPA rates the Fiat 500e at 84 miles of range in combined city and highway driving, and a relatively high 112 MPGe for combined energy efficiency. (The Miles Per Gallon Equivalent, or MPGe, rating indicates how far an electric car can travel on the same amount of energy as contained in 1 gallon of gasoline.)</p>, <p>You have to be a Fiat 500 aficionado or owner to distinguish an electric 500 from the conventional versions, unless it's the one in a unique color combination of bright orange and shiny white. Aside from different frontal styling and an altered rear bumper (no exhaust cutout), the 500e uses the same body panels as any other 500 three-door. The recharging port is even housed behind the flap that usually covers a gasoline filler. The interior is only minimally modified as well. </p>, <p>On the road, though, the 500e is a more refined, smoother, and better-handling vehicle than the gasoline models. Even Chrysler's own engineers seemed slightly startled at just how much fun it was to drive, and indeed it's far more of a driver's car than the larger and more appliance-like Nissan Leaf (which outsells it at least 10 to 1). It retains the standard 500's "flingability" and road-hugging handling, but it's better balanced because more of its weight is lower down in the car and the battery distribution means it has more equal weight distribution front to rear.</p>, <p>Below 40 mph, the 500e is by far the quietest 500 model. The only noise you may hear, in fact, is tire squealing if you're driving it aggressively. Compared to its gasoline counterparts, it's sort of what a small urban runabout should be—without the compromises of having to work a small engine hard to keep up with traffic. In that respect, it's similar to the Smart ForTwo Electric Drive—which is a far better car than the gasoline version from which it was derived.</p>, <p>There have been relatively few changes to the Fiat 500e since its launch. In 2016, Fiat added a couple of new color choices and upgraded the infotainment system to the latest Uconnect 5.0 version. The 500e isn't offered in the two-door 500c Cabrio model, which has a roll-back cloth roof, but Fiat has nonetheless sold several thousand of the little electric cars in its several years on the market. The company refuses to release sales data, but based on a couple of recalls and other data, we estimate that Fiat may have delivered as many as 7,500 electric 500s through the 2015 model year.</p>, <p>The base price of the Fiat 500e is by far the highest of any 500 variant, even the hot-rod 500 Abarth model. But as with most electric cars, the bulk of them are likely to be leased—and three-year leases have historically been a very cheap way to reap the rewards of far cheaper driving on electricity without having to worry about any battery-pack loss of capacity down the road.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/fiat_500
[<p>The Fiat 500 is a subcompact hatchback responsible for reviving the Italian automaker's name in the U.S. market a quarter-century after the brand's withdrawal from the U.S.</p>, <p>With the 500, Fiat offers a range of models, everything from a convertible-esque 500C to an electric 500e, to a turbocharged hatchback, to the hot Abarth performance edition.</p>, <p>In following years after its arrival for 2012, Fiat has offered other 500 models that bear little to no resemblance to the original 500. The 500X is the automaker's crossover that's shares more similarities with the Jeep Renegade than the original 500, and a 500L is a tall wagon-shaped hatchback that's unrelated to any other car in the portfolio.</p>, <p>For 2018, Fiat made standard a 1.4-liter turbo-4 that makes 135 horsepower on base models that replaced the 100-hp, naturally aspirated version.</p>, <p><strong><em title="2016 Fiat 500 - review">MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115277_2018-fiat-500" title="2017 Fiat 500 - review">2018 Fiat 500 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>The Fiat 500 that went on sale in the 2012 model year was the first vehicle from the combined global maker now known as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. It is built in Mexico, using small 4-cylinder engines manufactured in Michigan.</p>, <p>Like the Mini Cooper it competes with, the Fiat 500 hearkens back to a beloved national automotive icon from the 1960s. In this case, it’s the Fiat 500 that was built from 1957 to 1975. And like the Mini Cooper, the new model is larger, faster, far better equipped, and immeasurably safer. The Fiat 500 is not, in other words, a competitor for econobox models like the Hyundai Accent or Toyota Yaris; it’s a lifestyle choice, a style accessory that also happens to be fun to drive and easy to park in crowded urban areas.</p>, <p>All gas-powered 500 models used 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engines that Fiat built in North America; they're shared with a growing array of new models from Dodge and Jeep. Fuel economy figures were 31 mpg city, 40 mpg highway—similar to those for the Mini Cooper. In early drives of the 500, we found the steering to be particularly enjoyable and lively, although straight-line performance was lackluster in the base model and a cramped interior plus big doses of engine and road noise dulled enthusiasm somewhat. Driver ergonomics are particularly peculiar in this car, with few able to get completely comfortable with the oddly placed pedals and steering column.</p>, <p>The three-door hatchback was later joined by more variants. The Cabrio, a convertible of sorts with a roll-back cloth roof, retains the sides of the hatchback. An Abarth hot-rod can be had in either hatch or Cabrio form. To please those in the middle, Fiat also added a 500T model, which uses a toned-down turbocharged engine that's not as nutty as the Abarth, but offers better acceleration than the standard 500.</p>, <p>As it did years ago, the Abarth model represents the hot-hatch option in the Fiat 500 lineup. Positioned to keep up with the Mini Cooper S, the Abarth offers a turbo-4 making 160 hp, as well as frequency-selective Koni dampers and 16-inch wheels and other dynamic upgrades. There are also styling differences for the most potent 500, including extra air inlets, scorpion badging, and several available stripe packages. The Abarth is characterized by a throaty exhaust and tight, nimble driving behavior, making it fun on a back road or just ripping through traffic.</p>, <p>For buyers who want Abarth performance in a more subtle package—no dressy body add-ons or scorpion badges—the 500T model used a 135-hp version of its turbocharged engine in an incognito wrapper. The Turbo is given away by a small opening in the front fascia, almost like a slit for a cartoon car's mouth, which feeds air to the intercooler. 500 Turbos ride better than the Abarth, and are altogether more relaxed in their handling, but still offer adequate power to charge on-ramps.</p>, <p>You can get a few more features in the Fiat 500 than you'll find in most other small cars, like leather heated seats and rear parking sensors, and there are some 500,000 different build combinations thanks to plenty of possibilities for trims, colors, and accessories. The basic Fiat 500 three-door hatchback is available in five trim levels: Pop, Easy, Sport, Lounge, and Gucci; Convertible models are only offered in Pop, Easy, and Lounge trims.</p>, <p>In 2013, Fiat added the 500e electric car. It's sold only in small numbers—and only in California and Oregon. That's because it's a "<a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1068832_electric-cars-some-are-real-most-are-only-compliance-cars--we-name-names" title="Electric Cars: Some Are Real, Most Are Only 'Compliance Cars'--We Name Names">compliance car</a>" required for Fiat Chrysler to meet California's zero-emission vehicle regulations. That's a shame, because it's fun to drive and perhaps the best-handling of all the electric car conversions produced by major automakers.</p>, <p>Few changes were made to the Fiat 500 for 2014 or 2015. The 2015 model was available in several special editions, including the extra-retro 1957 Edition offered in hatchback or cabrio (convertible) versions. It's a nicely done throwback, offered in pastels and sweating the details down to the '50s-era Fiat logo on the nose and the dog-dish-style wheel finishers—as well as Cattiva, GQ, and Gucci models.</p>, <p>For 2016, Fiat added a new trim level above Pop, dubbed Easy, which includes cloth buckets and the UConnect 5.0 stereo. But for 2017, it simplified the model lineup back down into three trim levels—base Pop, feature-rich Lounge, and sporty Abarth—each offered as a three-door 500 hatchback or a two-door 500c Cabrio.</p>]

[<p>The Fiat 500X is a five-seat compact crossover SUV that joined the Italian brand's lineup in the 2016 model year. The 500X is related to the Jeep Renegade—they share powertrains—and both are assembled in Italy.</p>, <p>In the 500X, Fiat gained a small crossover that it desperately needed to buoy the brand and its sales in North America.</p>, <p>In 2017, Fiat pared down the 500X lineup to just Pop, Trekking, and Lounge trim levels. The 2018 model adds a standard 7.0-inch touchscreen and rearview camera on all trims.</p>, <p>Competition comes from the Honda HR-V, Chevy Trax, and Mazda CX-3—not to mention the Renegade. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/fiat_500x_2018" title="2018 Fiat 500X - review">2018 Fiat 500X review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Audi-esque shape of the 500X comes from Fiat's design studio in Turin, where it was penned with the goal of taking the 500 hatchback silhouette and reshaping it into a bigger, more mature package. The 500X shares the "whiskers and logo" front-end look of the 500, and also has a clamshell hood and slitted nose like the smaller car as well as the 500L hatchback (a vaguely mechanically related five-door sold by Fiat, but built in Serbia). Though not as large inside as the awkward 500L, the 500X is easily the more attractive of the two, and a better scaled-up interpretation of the 500 hatchback's design.</p>, <p>Inside, the 500X wears body-color trim on the dash like other 500 models. A circular theme ties the interior together, from the gauges to the climate controls. A large 7.0-inch LCD touchscreen sits atop the dash on all models.</p>, <p>In America, the 500X is offered with a choice of two powerplants. A 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder comes paired with a 6-speed manual transmission on the base Pop trim level. Its output is rated at 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. The bigger-displacement, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder (also found in the Jeep Cherokee) makes 180 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque; it's offered only with a 9-speed automatic transmission. </p>, <p>A set of adaptive driving controls lets drivers choose between normal, sport, and traction modes to tailor the responses of the throttle, transmission, and stability control, as well as steering feel.</p>, <p>The 500X routes power to the front wheels on all models but can be equipped with optional all-wheel drive. The system disconnects from the rear axle when power is not needed, which helps lower the 500X's fuel consumption. The 500X isn't really built to be an off-roader, but it delivers enough capability to bounce up a dirt road to a hiking trail, for instance. </p>, <p>The Fiat 500X comes standard with seven airbags, stability control, and hill-start assist. Safety options include forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-path detection. The 500X has not been crash tested by the NHTSA, but it is a Top Safety Pick according to the IIHS when equipped with optional automatic emergency braking. </p>, <p>Initially, Fiat offered five trim levels for the 500X, but the Easy and Trekking Plus trims have been dropped. Trekking has unique front and rear fascia designs and satin silver accents for a distinctive appearance.</p>, <p>Features and options include an audio system with a 7.0-inch touchscreen; Bluetooth streaming audio; navigation; a digital display for vehicle functions in the gauge cluster; keyless ignition; and heated front seats and a steering wheel.</p>, <p>The Fiat 500X has distinct advantages when it comes to efficiency: all models achieve 30 mpg or better on the highway thanks to the smooth body shape.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/fiat_124-spyder
[<p>The Fiat 124 Spider is a two-door convertible that's related to the Mazda MX-5 Miata.</p>, <p>The roadster follows the 124 Sport Spider that was sold in the U.S. from 1968 until the mid-1980s. The classic model was inspiration for the ground-breaking Mazda MX-5 Miata that followed in that the Fiat was simple and small, with modest power and better handling.</p>, <p>Fast-forward 30 years and the Fiat 124 Spider owes its very existence to the latest Miata.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/fiat_124-spyder_2018">2018 Fiat 124 Spider review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Changes for 2018 are minor. A new Red Top Edition is comes with a red convertible top, and the options lists are tweaked.</p>, <p>The Fiat 124 Spider is wholly based on the Miata. The 124 Spider follows an agreement between Mazda and Fiat Group (now FCA) that assured Mazda the cashflow to justify the development of a new-generation Mazda while also giving Fiat a volume sports-car model to help meet its sales goals.</p>, <p>The Fiat 124 Spider shares much with the Miata—including the entire body structure, and fundamentals like steering gear, switchgear, and even dash details—yet it differs slightly in suspension tuning and it weighs about 100 pounds more.</p>, <p>There’s one more significant detail in which the 124 Spider strays significantly from the MX-5 Miata: its engine. Instead of getting the Miata’s free-breathing 2.0-liter inline-4, the 124 uses the 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that’s found throughout the Jeep, Dodge, and Fiat model lineups, making the same 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. It’s mated to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. On the road, the 1.4-liter turbo-4 has less grunt from a start and is slower in the 0-60 mph sprint, but it has more mid-range power for passing.</p>, <p>The profile is essentially the same tidy, classic roadster form as that of the Miata (just around 155 inches long, overall), yet the look is somewhat different on the outside. Its windshield header and frame are covered in brightwork, there’s “power dome” sculpting to the hood, and the combination of hex grille designs plus different front and rear lamp designs gives it a different look and feel altogether. The flared-up shoulder sheet metal just aft of the doors and flowing back to a sharp crease at the tail helps bring it back to its Italian heritage, too.</p>, <p>Inside, this model has a lot more in common with the Miata—including its freestanding touchscreen and infotainment setup. Bose premium audio is also offered.</p>, <p>The first 124 cars produced were Prima Edizione Lusso models, with a unique blue exterior, saddle leather seats, and number plates, among other extras.</p>, <p>The 124 is offered in base Classica, higher-content Lusso, and sportier Abarth models. The Classica comes with cloth seats, Bluetooth, and 16-inch alloy wheels. Move up to the Lusso for such features as heated leather seats, keyless entry, automatic climate control, and 17-inch wheels. The Abarth has 4 extra horsepower due to its exhaust system. It also gets a limited-slip differential, Bilstein shocks, a sport mode selector, a strut tower brace, and firmer suspension tuning.</p>, <p>Neither U.S. agency has crash tested the 124 and we don't expect they will. Safety equipment is minimal, but buyers can get rear park assist and blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/fiat_500l
[<p>The Fiat 500L is a five-passenger tall wagon (actually a five-door hatchback) that entered the Fiat model lineup as a 2014 model. In 2017, the lineup was rationalized down to three trim levels: Pop, Trekking, and Lounge. It received a very mild restyling and a host of interior upgrades for 2018.</p>, <p>With the 500L, Fiat has a rival for cars like the Honda Fit, the Kia Soul, and the Mini Countryman.</p>, <p>It may share a nameplate with other Fiats, but the 500L is entirely different. It's built (in Serbia) on a separate set of underpinnings than the 500 hatchback and cabrio, and the 500X crossover SUV.</p>, <p>The 500L hasn't been a huge success; its main strength is remarkable interior room compared to its small footprint.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/fiat_500l_2018" title="2018 Fiat 500L - review">2018 Fiat 500L review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The 500L's styling is tall, glassy, and distinctive when specified with the contrasting roof—especially effective when the roof is white and the lower body is black. The front end is the least successful aspect of the design, with high-set lights and a very tall approximation of the smaller and cuter 500 minicar's nose. The interior is pleasingly simple and intuitive, though, with excellent storage space in a multitude of bins, trays, containers, and pockets for all the loose items we carry with us on road trips these days.</p>, <p>At launch, the 500L came with a single engine and a choice of two transmissions that expanded to three. The 160-horsepower turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine came standard with a 6-speed manual, with an optional 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission available as well. The 6-speed dual-clutch was quickly dropped. It's only offered in front-wheel-drive form. A Fiat 500X that offers AWD arrived for the 2016 model year. Gas mileage is rated at 22 mpg city, 30 highway, 25 combined with the automatic.</p>, <p>For 2017, the trim levels on the 500L have been simplified to a base Pop, the outdoorsy Trekking, and a fully featured Lounge version. The basic Pop and all other models include standard air conditioning, cruise control, audio controls on the steering wheel, a tilting and telescoping steering wheel, and a six-speaker audio system with a 5.0-inch touchscreen display, Bluetooth audio streaming, and both audio and USB ports.</p>, <p>Some earlier model years included an intermediate level, Easy, with 16-inch alloy wheels, a front center console/armrest, cloth upholstery, an upgraded sound system, tinted rear glass, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.</p>, <p>The Trekking, as its name indicates, adds lots of rugged-look accessories that give it the appearance of being ready to go off road (but again, it's still front-drive only). Those include larger, 17-inch wheels; fog lights; fender flares; and tougher-looking front and rear fascias. Trekking models also add a unique two-tone black and brown interior.</p>, <p>Move up to the top-of-the-line Lounge model and you add power heated leather seats; a rear seat that slides back and forth, reclines, splits, folds, and tumbles; a dual-zone climate control system; and fog lights up front. Options are offered as various packages and individual items, including a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, and a fairly rudimentary navigation system. </p>, <p dir="ltr">In 2018, the 500L received a number of changes and updates. The front and rear were mildly redesigned, and it received both new wheels and daytime running lights. A rearview camera was finally made standard, and interior changes include a rearranged center console, gear shift, and parking brake; a new steering wheel; a digital instrument cluster; and LED ambient interior lighting. The latest Uconnect 4 infotainment system was updated with a 7.0-inch touchscreen in the dash center as standard, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity were added as well.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_mustang
[<p>The Ford Mustang is a two-door coupe or convertible that's become shorthand for Americana. Millions of Mustangs have been sold around the world in the decades it's been on sale.</p>, <p>With the Mustang, Ford coined the term "pony car." The Mustang made the two-door sporty coupe a permanent fixture on the American automotive landscape.</p>, <p>Although not its intended mission, the Mustang has evolved into a performance car with true track and racing potential, evidenced by its growing pedigree and superlative Shelby GT350.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_mustang_2018">2018 Ford Mustang review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new</strong> <strong>Ford Mustang</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>For 2015, the Ford Mustang underwent radical change, and though not even on sale a year, was already being gifted with faster versions, including the most high-performance pony car Ford has ever offered.</p>, <p>The newest Mustang was announced just before the nameplate's 50th anniversary celebration, which took place at the 2014 New York auto show. For the first time ever, Ford sells this Mustang globally, giving it sleeker looks and updating the chassis to finally include an independent rear suspension setup. The interior has been improved, and Ford added a turbo-4 back into the lineup to bring high performance and fuel economy together. The track is wider to accommodate the new rear suspension, and the front geometry has been reworked to match the performance front to rear. Crash structures have also been designed to accommodate the regulations in the various markets in which it will be sold.</p>, <p>Under the hood of the 2015 Mustang, buyers will find one of a trio of engines: the familiar 3.7-liter V-6, a new 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, and a more powerful 5.0-liter V-8. The V-6 delivers 300 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque; the new EcoBoost unit, which features turbocharging and direct-injection technologies, offers up 310 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque; and the V-8 is rated at more than 435 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission remains standard while a 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters is available. A convertible is also available in this first year of production.</p>, <p>High-tech features available in the new Mustang include driver-adjustable stability, steering, throttle, and transmission systems; launch control; a line lock function for burnouts and improved launches; and SYNC with MyFord Touch. Ford massaged the Mustang's silhouette to provide a larger trunk and engineered the new car to meet crash standards in countries around the world to allow for the expanded global sales.</p>, <p>The 2015 models were offered in a Mustang 50 Year limited edition package to celebrate the half-century of pony cars. It included extra badging, louvers over the rear side windows, and some unique interior touches. All 50 Year cars were coupes with the 5.0-liter V-8, available with either a manual or an automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Ford used the 2014 L.A. auto show to debut one of its most potent new Mustangs, the Shelby GT350. Stepping back from the last Shelby's big supercharged V-8, the GT350 uses a more modestly sized, normally aspirated 5.2-liter V-8 with a flat-plane crank, promising over 500 hp and an 8,000-rpm redline. The package also includes serious chassis upgrades, like magnetic shocks, as well as a completely unique front clip and other Shelby-specific styling details.</p>, <p>Building on the GT350, Ford has also announced a GT350R version that competes with the world's best cars. It's lighter than the standard GT350, with extensive use of carbon fiber, including the material's first use in wheels on a mass-produced car. Other R upgrades include deletion of the rear seat and stereo, a lack of trunk lining, and aluminum used in strategic locations, all of which will help the car shed pounds.</p>, <p>So as not to leave a good thing alone, Ford brought several updates and new options to the 2016 Mustang. GT models get a new hood with turn-signal indicators integrated into the hood vents, a throwback to second-gen Mustang models. There's also a new California Special package available, similar to the appearance packages of the past, available on the GT. And EcoBoost 'Stang buyers can opt for the Pony pack. Upper trim levels also get the new Sync 3 infotainment system that is beginning to roll out across Ford products. </p>, <p>For 2016, Ford's Mustang Convertible is available with the Performance Package. That model includes a standard multi-layer insulated cloth top that gives the car a more upscale appearance and a quieter cabin, according to Ford. The new top also lowers twice as fast as before, and has a sleeker profile when down.</p>, <p>The Mustang Shelby GT350 returned to the lineup in the 2016 model year, powered by a flat-plane-crank 5.2-liter V-8 with 526 horsepower. It makes the most of the Mustang's finessed chassis dynamics—and introduce a series of aero and chassis upgrades, including Ford's first application of magnetically controlled dampers.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the Track Package has been made standard on the GT350. In the 2018 model year, the Mustang adopted some mild style updates, gained new transmission and suspension features, and added a digital display. Left on the cutting-room floor: the long-running V-6 option.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Mustang history</strong><em><br/></em></p>, <p>The Mustang was the unexpectedly, wildly popular response to the rise of the sporty compact car in the early 1960s. GM had the Chevy Corvair in its stable already when Ford, under the direction of auto legend Lee Iacocca, conceived of its own "personal car"—one that would appeal to buyers looking for an image. By reskinning the existing Falcon runabout with a stylish, enduring new body, Ford had a hit.</p>, <p>The Mustang made its world debut at the 1964 World's Fair in New York on April 17, 1964. Within four months, Ford had sold 100,000 copies, and by 1966 the Ford Mustang coupe and convertible logged more than a million sales. Most early Mustangs were powered by 6-cylinder engines, but V-8 versions grew in popularity as the Mustang developed a muscle-car personality in models like the Shelby GT350 and GT500 and the Mach 1.</p>, <p>Basic Mustangs were affordable transportation; the V-8 cars quickly escalated the muscle-car wars, pitting Ford's best against the Chevy Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, and the Plymouth Barracuda. A fastback body style added a graceful new look to the stable in 1967, and trim and performance packs of every stripe greeted each new model year in the Mustang's infancy.</p>, <p>As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, the Mustang began to lose traction. By the time a new took shape in 1971, safety and emissions rules were eviscerating all the muscle cars. Power peaked with the 1971 Mustang Mach I, and fell each year until Ford took the drastic step of downsizing the car into the 1974 Mustang II. Lighter and much shorter, this Mustang also shared some running gear with the Ford Pinto. A sales hit at first, the Mustang II dented the name and the reputation—and Ford quickly planned a new car, spun from the new Ford Fairmont's rear-drive platform.</p>, <p>The "Fox" platform Mustang arrived in showrooms in 1979, and soldiered on in that basic form until 1993. Along the way, Ford experimented with a 4-cylinder Mustang alongside V-6 and V-8 companions. The V-8 became the GT in 1983, convertibles returned to the lineup that same year, and a turbocharged SVO began its short life in 1984. In the late 1980s Ford planned a front-drive Mustang replacement, but before it launched the vehicle it changed direction. The rear-drive Mustang got revised sheet metal, while the front-drive coupe emerged as the 1989 Ford Probe. Performance models included the Cobra R and SVT editions, as Ford progressively rebuilt the Mustang's reputation for performance.</p>, <p>In the 1990s, the Mustang migrated from the by-then outdated look of the 1993 model, to the heritage-themed styling of the 1994-2004 edition. It also rode on a heavily revised chassis that eventually settled on V-6 and V-8 engine combinations. The 5.0-liter V-8 went away, replaced by the durable, powerful 4.6-liter V-8—but the Mustang retained its live-axle rear end. Reshaped and refined in 1999, the Mustang drove on and on until it had outlived the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird—both of which ended production in 2002—and until a new Mustang was ready for the 2005 model year.</p>, <p>With the 2005-2009 Mustang, Ford finally exorcised the Mustang's reputation for clumsy live-axle handling and dated structural engineering. The new car proved tight and well-built, not to mention great-looking, an ideal blend of modern and heritage styling themes. With revamped 6- and 8-cylinder engines, new automatic and manual transmissions, a new convertible model, and Shelby and Bullitt editions along the way, this Mustang sold hundreds of thousands of copies each year while competitors like the Nissan 370Z and Hyundai Genesis Coupe emerged from their respective drawing boards.</p>, <p>For 2010, Ford carried over most of the Mustang's mechanicals, while smoothing its sheet metal with a more forward-canted grille and by installing a much better interior. In 2011, the Mustang received new powertrains—with the V-6 earning a 31-mpg highway fuel economy rating, and the V-8 bringing back the "5.0" badge, along with 412 hp. Supercharged Shelby GT500 editions of this V-8 represented the most powerful Mustangs of this generation, but a special racing edition <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1068728_2013-ford-mustang-boss-302-live-photos-2011-l-a-auto-show">brought back the Boss 302 designation</a>—and charged ahead with a 444-hp, normally aspirated 5.0-liter V-8, less curb weight, and a TracKey package that let drivers dial up performance on closed circuits.</p>, <p>The Mustang carried over into 2011 and 2012 with only minor changes, but the 2013 model year brought some more modern details to the Mustang's look—including HID headlights, flanked by two strips of LED lighting, plus LED lights with a dark-tinted look, as well as a blacked-out area in between. Inside, the Mustang got a new TrackApps feature that times acceleration or quarter-mile times. The electric power steering also gained three-stage, driver-configurable settings. Powertrains along with most else were carried over, although the V-8 was boosted to 420 hp. Also new for 2013 was an even more potent version of the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1076342_2013-ford-shelby-gt500-first-drive">Shelby GT500</a>—packing a 662-hp, 5.8-liter V-8, in coupe and convertible forms, with the hardtop capable of a claimed 200 mph top speed.</p>]

[<p>The Ford F-150 full-size pickup truck is one of America's favorite vehicles to own, and it’s something of an institution in parts of the country.</p>, <p>As popular with fleet buyers looking to get the best bang for their buck from a rugged truck and those who want something flashy that won’t look at out of place driving up to, say, the tony Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, the F-150 has one of the broadest buyer bases imaginable. </p>, <p>This year, the F-Series is celebrating 70 years in Americans' driveways. It's a milestone for the automaker and for American transportation.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_f-150_2018">2018 Ford F-150 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Though it’s not new for 2018, the Ford F-150 sees some big improvements over its predecessor. Ford made its best-selling truck look a little fresher inside and out, it revamped the pickup’s engine room with new gas and, for the first time, diesel engines, and it brought a bunch of big safety upgrades to the table.</p>, <p>The biggest news is a new 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 engine, which should help the F-150 square off well against the popular Ram 1500 EcoDiesel. Rear-drive Ford F-150 diesels return up to 30 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>But Ford hardly ignored the truck’s gas engine lineup. A new 3.3-liter V-6 replaces last year’s 3.5-liter as the truck’s base engine. Its 282 horsepower and 253 pound-feet of torque, but the new engine makes use of direct injection that should reduce fuel consumption.</p>, <p>Next up is a new 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6 that Ford says will be both more powerful and less thirsty than before. The automaker also revised the optional 5.0-liter V-8, which although declining in popularity against the boosted V-6s has been a solid choice for many buyers (a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 is largely carried over into 2018).</p>, <p>For 2018, all of those engines except the base V-6 are mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission co-developed with General Motors. Rivalries only go so far, it turns out.</p>, <p>With the F-150, Ford has adopted fresher looks inside and out for 2018, with new front and rear end styling and detailing plus a choice of 6 revised wheel designs in diameters ranging from 17 to a hefty 22 inches. The truck’s interior has some new colors and some switchgear has been revised. A high-end B&amp;O Play audio system has been added to the options list.</p>, <p>Depending on the trim level, the F-150 will now be available with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control that can bring the truck to a stop in traffic and then start up once the vehicle ahead begins to move.</p>, <p><strong>Ford F-150 history</strong></p>, <p>Although Ford had previously built passenger-car-based trucks, the company sold its first true full-size pickups in 1948. Throughout much of the next decades its F-Series pickup trucks came with 6- or 8-cylinder engines; 3-, 4- and 5-speed manual transmissions; and a single two-door body style. By 1960, the "F-100" had been christened at the entry level, with F-250 and F-350 versions available with an early kind of four-wheel drive. As most trucks of the era were designed as "flareside" models, Ford added a plain-sided Styleside version that would dominate sales from then on.</p>, <p>For the fourth-generation F-100, Ford added a "Ranger" trim level and briefly built some trucks with unibody construction, returning to body-on-frame designs in the mid-1960s. Four-door models were offered, as were versions that adopted camper tops easily. A fifth generation arrived in 1967, with plainer sheet metal but the essential truck features intact: V-8 or inline-6, two- and four-door body styles, and payload capacity into heavy-duty territory. The sixth-generation truck is known primarily for adding the 302 V-8 to the lineup, spawning a new two-door Bronco SUV, and bringing the F-150 badge to the lineup; the latter was a higher-payload version of the existing F-100.</p>, <p>The F-150 grew more upright and more capable in the next three generations of trucks sold from 1980 to 1996. Diesel engines and new automatic transmissions joined the lineup, and the Ranger name was split into its own compact-pickup truck lineup. An "Explorer" trim level joined the F-150 lineup and would be spun off into its own SUV range in the same decade. In the eighth-generation truck that arrived in 1987, fuel injection became the norm, and flareside bodies went away for a time; rear anti-lock brakes were standard, for the first time on a full-size pickup truck. The ninth-generation truck went on sale in 1992 and brought with it a driver-side airbag and slightly smoother styling.</p>, <p>The 10th-generation F-150, sold from 1997 to 2004, marked a sea change in pickup trucks. Ever more the choice of commuters and daily drivers, the F-150 grew far more shapely and rounded in this generation—mimicking the lines of some of Ford's passenger cars. The old, squared-off truck was continued for a while, until Ford could tell if pickup-truck drivers would approve of the new looks. They did: The F-Series retained its best-selling title and grew even more popular. New engines came with the new body style, including versions of the Ford "modular" 4.6-liter and 5.4-liter V-8 that would prove very durable. The usual two- and four-door and extended-cab versions were available, as were four-wheel drive and a 4-speed automatic, along with heavy-duty F-250 versions. Special editions introduced in this generation included the SVT Lightning, the Harley-Davidson F-150, and the King Ranch edition. Safety ratings were poor, though, and while this F-150 had good reliability, its cruise-control system was involved in a major recall for the potential of causing a fire. This F-150 spawned a short-lived Lincoln Blackwood version, along with the longer-living Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs.</p>, <p>The 11th-generation F-150 arrived in 2004 and began to revert the truck's shape to its more angular past. A more upright grille, and more squared-off window openings were the hallmarks of the design. While it didn't change much mechanically, it did introduce standard curtain airbags and stability control to the full-size pickup range at Ford. The company put special attention into reducing the truck's cost and complexity, making it easier to build—and even more reliable. By some measures, it was considered the most reliable pickup truck ever built. Ford attempted another Lincoln pickup from this generation—the Lincoln Mark LT, which like the Blackwood before it, was a sales flop.</p>, <p><strong>The last of a long line</strong></p>, <p>The 12th generation of the Ford F-150 arrived in 2009, with its sheet metal even more crisply folded than earlier models—bearing many cues of a Ford F-350 Tonka concept truck from the late 2000s. The 12th-generation F-150 wore a very large, very bright, very tall grille to emphasize its "truck"-ness. It's somewhat redundant, since the F-150 was one of the most capable towing and hauling light-duty trucks available in America.</p>, <p>In 2011, the F-150 received its most comprehensive powertrain update. To go with its cutting-edge technology—including Bluetooth, SYNC voice control, even ventilated front seats—the F-150 gained four new engines, all teamed with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A 302-horsepower V-6 rejoined the lineup for the first time in more than a decade, and delivers the F-150's best gas mileage, at 17/23 mpg; turbocharging a version of the engine created the EcoBoost, with 365 horsepower and a towing capacity of 11,300 pounds. A 5.0-liter V-8 with 360 hp brought Mustang-style engine noises to the full-size truck, along with 15/21-mpg fuel economy. Finally, there was a 6.2-liter V-8, with 411 hp and 13/18 mpg fuel economy, offered in the most upscale F-150s as well as the off-road Raptor.</p>, <p>For the 2012 model year, Ford added a new automatic all-wheel-drive mode to some 4x4 F-150s, and swapped out limited-slip differentials for an electronically simulated limited-slip function. Then on the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1078027_next-ford-f-150-to-get-aluminum-body-for-better-gas-mileage">2013 Ford F-150</a>, the automaker added MyFord Touch's suite of voice, steering-wheel, and LCD touchscreen controls to the pickup, with other minor changes to the front end, including high-intensity discharge headlights to some models. The King Ranch model returned as well, with a new black interior choice and standard MyFord Touch, for a base price of more than $44,000.</p>, <p>In this generation, the F-150 came in a host of cab, bed, powertrain, and suspension variations. Three cab configurations with multiple wheelbases and box lengths each were offered, providing choices to satisfy just about any trucker's need with the F-150. Properly outfitted, this F-150 could tow 11,300 pounds—while earning top crash-test scores (including IIHS Top Safety Pick status and a "Good" rating in the roof-strength test). Unlike GM's pickups, there was no Hybrid edition, and the F-150 fell behind the Ram's excellent ride quality. However, this F-150 had a well-built cabin, excellent shift quality and comfortable seats—as well as the off-road-ready Raptor model and some of the most up-to-date luxury features found on any truck.</p>, <p>Over the years, the F-150 has been mechanically related to the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, though those SUVs now only share powertrains with the trucks.</p>, <p><strong>Switch to aluminum in 2015</strong></p>, <p>It may not have looked all that different from the outgoing F-150, but in 2015 Ford updated its truck with an aluminum body designed to save weight—and thus increase fuel economy. It was one of the boldest moves ever made in the pickup segment. In many ways, the 2018 is a major update of the 2015. </p>, <p>Inside, the look was not a great departure from previous versions of the pickup, though there was a new level of upscale design and nicer materials on premium trims. Blocky shapes and sturdy structures were the visual theme to back the F-150’s chosen mission. Ford also added a long list of standard and optional features, including massaging seats, a surround-view camera system, and several nifty in-bed storage solutions.</p>, <p>Engines were another area of innovation for the F-150. Four engines were available from the start, and while three were familiar, the new 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 was an unusual choice; Ford saw it as the go-to for gas mileage in the new F-150. Also available was an updated 3.5-liter V-6 engine, which replaced the outgoing truck's 3.7-liter, as well as the familiar 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 and 5.0-liter V-8.</p>, <p>The F-150’s front suspension is a coil-on-shock independent arrangement, while the rear retains the Hotchkiss-type solid axle riding on leaf springs and outboard shock absorbers. The rear suspension got a significant rework, however, with a switch to staggered shock placement among other changes. Improved electric-assist power steering and four-wheel-vented ABS disc brakes round out the key mechanical specs.</p>, <p>Ford used the 2015 Detroit auto show to announce a new Raptor based on the aluminum F-150. The new super-truck, which arrived in the 2017 model year, featured an upgraded suspension, a new four-wheel-drive system, and a high-output Ford Performance 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 that makes more power and torque than the outgoing 6.2-liter V-8 engine. Ford says the second-generation truck weighs 500 pounds less than the previous Raptor, as well.</p>, <p>Ford also announced that the F-150 is be available with natural-gas and propane fuel options. Beginning with the 2016 model year, the F-150 equipped with the 5.0-liter V-8 is available with a gaseous-fuel prep package. Vehicle upfitters will then be able to install the necessary tanks and other hardware to convert the truck after sale.</p>, <p>For 2017, Ford outfitted its top-end F-150 models with a next-generation version of its 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine, which added 10 hp and 50 lb-ft of torque. It paired the new engine with a new transmission too: a 10-speed automatic jointly developed with General Motors.</p>]

[<p>The Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV for full-size friends and full-size toys. It's designed to do what crossovers can't: haul people and big trailers simultaneously.</p>, <p>The Expedition is offered in both short-wheelbase and long-wheelbase (Max) versions.</p>, <p>A new Expedition bowed for the 2018 model year. It shares the Ford F-150's aluminum-intensive construction and twin-turbo V-6 powertrain.</p>, <p>With the Expedition, Ford is equipped to take on vehicles such as the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL, the Nissan Armada, and the Toyota Sequoia.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our</strong></em> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_expedition_2018"><em><strong>2018 Ford Expedition review</strong></em></a></p>, <p><strong>The new Ford Expedition</strong></p>, <p>The newest Ford Expedition that went on sale in late 2017 boasts new features to match its new body. Under the hood, Ford planted its 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 to handle propulsion duties, while the automaker's advanced 10-speed automatic handles shifting duties. They combined for best-in-class towing  for the full-size SUV at 9,300 pounds. That rivals some full-size trucks in capability. Base output is 375 hp, but special versions make up to 400 hp.</p>, <p>Like the outgoing model, the new Expedition comes in standard- and long-wheelbase variants, the latter being called Expedition Max. The interior still boasts sitting for up to eight, including driver, and sports some of the latest interior tech including multiple USB power ports, upgraded audio, and Ford's latest infotainment system.</p>, <p>The cavernous cabin sports 172 cubic feet of space in Max versions, and behind the third-row seat it has 36 cubic feet of space. The seats fold flat, and the middle row slides fore and aft. It can even be flipped forward to access the third row without removing a car seat. The third row has a power-folding option, and is suitable for adults. </p>, <p>Like the F-150 on which it's based, the Expedition uses more aluminum in its construction that makes the SUV lighter overall. Those figures yield slightly better fuel economy in the high teens on the EPA combined cycle.</p>, <p>The Expedition offers a huge range of equipment from blind-spot monitors to forward-collision warnings. Comfort features on the list include heated and cooled seats, six USB ports, 15 cupholders, and a 12-speaker B&amp;O Play audio system. A loaded Expedition can cost more than $80,000.</p>, <p><strong>Expedition history</strong></p>, <p>Introduced for the 1997 model year, the Expedition entered its second generation in 2003, with the third-generation version arriving in 2007. The 2015 model brought further upgrades to the third-generation SUV; some might even consider it the fourth generation since so much was changed.</p>, <p>At first, the Expedition was an indirect follow-up to the old Ford Bronco, a two-door 'ute that was sold through the 1991 model year. Similarly based on truck running gear but offering an extra set of doors, the Expedition proved popular even while Ford's smaller Explorer saw its sales collapse in the wake of a major tire recall.</p>, <p>The first-generation Expedition was produced from 1997 through 2002 and was built on the F-Series platform of the day. The first Expedition could seat up to nine passengers. Buyers had a choice of either a 4.6-liter V-8 or a 5.4-liter V-8, both coupled to a 4-speed automatic. For the 2000 model year, the smaller engine's power output of 215 horsepower rose to 240 hp; the larger V-8 saw power rise from 230 hp to 260 hp at the same time. The upgrades coincided with revised front- and rear-end styling, the addition of side airbags as an option, and the availability of rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>The second-generation Expedition was sold from 2003 to 2006. With its upgraded architecture came an independent rear suspension that vastly improved the SUV's ride quality. It also helped increase cargo space in the rear, enabling Ford to add a power-folding third-row seat. This Expedition's styling was smoothed and refined almost to the point of anonymity, especially inside, though the impression of quality construction grew with better-fitting trim. The drivetrains—including available four-wheel drive—carried over, but in the 2005 model year the smaller V-8 was dropped. In the same year, Ford added a new version of stability control with anti-roll programming.</p>, <p>The current, third-gen Expedition went on sale in 2007 wearing a much more straight-edged suit of sheet metal than its predecessors. At launch, it was powered by a 310-hp, 5.4-liter V-8, and in its first makeover it received a 6-speed automatic transmission. With 365 pound-feet of torque and a heavy-duty towing package offered, this Expedition could initially tow up to 9,200 pounds. It also came in an "EL" edition for the first time, measuring almost 15 inches longer than the standard SUV, with 24 cubic feet of additional cargo room.</p>, <p>The most extensive updates of the third-generation Expedition's platform came in the 2015 model year. Ford gave the model an updated look to match the 2014 F-150's, while the corporate twin-turbocharged EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 were fitted as the Expedition's only engine offering. The Expedition was brought fully up to the expectations of the latest group of SUV shoppers with a new continuous-damping suspension system for more comfort and quiet, and there were cosmetic improvements all around. This version is still technically part of the third generation, although it received a heavily revised interior, the new sheet metal, and the new engine.</p>, <p>Between 2007 and the big changes for 2015, Ford added a rearview camera, flex-fuel capability, a capless fuel-filler system, and the SYNC entertainment system, which connects drivers to phone and audio functions via Bluetooth and also controls connected media devices.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_ranger
[<p>The Ford Ranger is a mid-sized pickup truck new for 2019. Previously, it was a compact pickup produced by Ford until 2011. </p>, <p>Although the truck is new, the name isn't. The name "Ranger" had been affixed to Ford pickups beginning in the 1960s, up until the early 1980s when it split off and was used for compact pickups.</p>, <p>Now fully a mid-sizer, the Ranger competes against others including the Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, and Nissan Frontier.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114766_2019-ford-ranger">2019 Ford Ranger preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Ford Ranger</strong></p>, <p>Returning to North America after nearly a decade away, the 2019 Ford Ranger is larger than its predecessor but still significantly smaller than the Ford F-150.</p>, <p>The new Ranger's roots are global and it shows in its looks. Its body is upright and utilitarian—like a pickup should be—but its windshield has a steeper rake and its nose skips the "power bar" affixed to larger Ford F-Series pickups. The Ranger's interior wouldn't be out of place in any Ford vehicle with a familiar layout of buttons for climate controls and a large touchscreen for infotainment.</p>, <p>The Ranger is offered in extended and four-door cab configurations with a 5-foot bed on SuperCab models and a 6-foot bed on SuperCrew models. A 2.3-liter turbo-4 and 10-speed automatic provides power in the new Ranger. Rear-wheel drive is standard on all trucks, and four-wheel drive is optional. Off-road versions offer an electronic locking rear differential.</p>, <p>The truck will be available in XL, XLT, and Lariat trim levels. An FX4 off-road package is available to beef up the Ranger's trail resume.</p>, <p>Ford hasn't yet detailed options or pricing for the new truck, but has said the truck will offer forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, which is relatively rare among its competitors.</p>, <p>The Ranger will go on sale in late 2018.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Ranger history</strong></p>, <p>The Ranger dates back a long way in the Ford archives. The Ranger was split off in 1983 and applied to a new compact truck with a 6-foot-and-smaller pickup bed. That first-generation Ranger lived off its inexpensive, reliable reputation through a model changeover in 1989, until a new Ranger was introduced in 1993.</p>, <p>The third generation Ranger, sold from 1993-1997, offered a relatively weak 4-cylinder engine option, supplanted by either a 3.0-liter V-6 or a 4.0-liter V-6 later in its life. A 5-speed manual came on base versions—sometimes called "bug trucks," since exterminators loved the stripped Ranger painted in white—and a 4-speed automatic was an option. A 5-speed automatic was added later in this generation, as were dual front airbags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. This Ranger also offered a stylish Splash edition, with a sculpted set of fenders on its bed, and four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>A Mazda B-Series spinoff was sold from 1993 to 2009, and was essentially the same truck as the Ranger, with mainly cosmetic and packaging differences. It was canceled for the 2010 model year.</p>, <p>Ford put much energy into the early years of the fourth-generation Ranger. Introduced in 1998, the Ranger added some wheelbase length, saw its 4-cylinder and larger 6-cylinder engines upgraded to overhead-cam designs, and added flex-fuel capability to the middle-brow, overhead-valve 3.0-liter V-6. This Ranger was typically well-received and earned a reputation for reliability over its lifespan. It also improved on its reputation for a hard ride, thanks to a new independent front suspension. Though it remained, for all passenger purposes, a two-door, the Ranger was spun into popular off-road and city-commuter versions that extended its lifespan much longer than anyone—even Ford—anticipated.</p>, <p>Ford ended production of the Ranger with the 2011 model year. A replacement for other world markets was sold after 2011 and the Ranger didn't return to the U.S. until 2019.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_escape
[<p>The Ford Escape is a popular compact crossover with a wide variety of tech, powertrains, and options—but no hybrid.</p>, <p>The current Escape hit the streets for the 2013 model year, after a 12-year run by the first-generation model. The Escape now comes in Titanium top trim, alone with base S, SE, and SEL versions.</p>, <p>In the Escape, Ford has a rival for juggernauts such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. The Nissan Rogue, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, and Chevy Equinox are rivals too. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_escape_2018" title="2015 Ford Escape - review">2018 Ford Escape review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Ford's best-selling SUV received a mid-cycle update for the 2017 model year, adding new technologies, two new engines, a start-stop function, and a new look inside and out.</p>, <p>New front- and rear-end styling was part of the revamp, but the more important changes came under the hood. The base 2.5-liter inline-4 carried over, but mid-range Escapes were migrated to a 1.5-liter turbo-4 (in place of a 1.6-liter unit) or a new 2.0-liter turbo-4. Power output is about 179 horsepower for the smaller turbocharged inline-4, and 245 hp for the 2.0-liter version.</p>, <p>Fuel economy improves slightly (both come with stop/start), and so does handling, with new springs and shocks.</p>, <p>New safety equipment includes forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, parking assistance, and lane-departure and lane-keeping assistance. The Escape's front crash protection was rated as "Poor" until 2016, when it improved to "Acceptable" by the IIHS.</p>, <p>For 2018, Ford made minor changes to feature packages, while it split off a new SEL trim level.</p>, <p>When it was first introduced in 2001, it picked up on the compact-crossover trend that was just emerging and almost instantly became one of Ford's best-selling vehicles. The Toyota RAV4 had started the niche, and was followed soon by the Honda CR-V. The Escape joined them as one of the most popular vehicles in the segment, with sales even increasing as the extended first generation aged.</p>, <p>That first Escape made good use of space in a small package thanks to its tall and squared-off profile, accommodating passengers and cargo nicely. It also offered the smallest amount of off-road capability thanks to its ground clearance and available all-wheel drive. The car-like ride and handling were a product of it sharing some underpinnings with the Mazda 626, and it continued as a comfortable small-crossover option through 11 years on sale, with updates including revised sheet metal for 2004 and larger upgrades for 2007.</p>, <p>The first Escape was a good choice for those who needed compactness and maneuverability yet wanted impressive safety and a flexible, spacious interior. Its original base engine was a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, making 130 hp. It was underpowered, coarse and unrefined. In 2005, this engine was replaced with a 2.3-liter making 153 hp—enough to power the Escape confidently enough, provided you don't carry a heavy load or need to pass quickly on the highway. The 200-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 that was available gave the Escape a very different character. It's worth noting that real-world fuel economy in 4-cylinder versions of the Escape often didn't prove to be much better than that of V-6 Escapes.</p>, <p>Through 2007, interior materials on all but the top Limited model were quite inferior to those of other vehicles in the Escape's class. The substantial refresh given to the model for 2008 fixed that, bringing upgraded materials throughout. At that time, the Escape also received new powertrains, including a 240-hp version of the 3.0-liter V-6 and a new 171-hp, 2.5-liter base inline-4. By 2010, its entertainment offerings were upgraded to include SYNC, Ford's voice-driven controller for phone, audio, and navigation systems.</p>, <p>Throughout its first generation, the Escape earned mostly good scores for safety. The most noteworthy exception is for 2001-2007 models without the optional side airbags, and frontal performance for 2001-2004 models. In the IIHS's new roof-strength test, which came in late in the first generation, the Escape got a mediocre "Marginal" score that kept it from getting the Top Safety Pick. Federal testers did not re-score the Escape after it changed its testing criteria for the 2011 model year.</p>, <p>Ford sold an Escape Hybrid from 2004 through 2012. Like other early Ford hybrids, the Escape used a system very similar to Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive, combining an Atkinson-cycle inline-4 with electric motors in a unique transmission and a large battery pack. All-wheel drive was available, with about half of hybrid customers opting for it. The hybridized Escape was rated at 34 mpg city, 31 highway.</p>, <p>The Escape also spawned the Mercury Mariner and the Mazda Tribute, both of which also offered hybrid variants at one time. Both were discontinued in the 2011 model year.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Escape</strong><strong>, 2013-2016</strong><em><br/></em></p>, <p>For the 2013 model year, a new Escape was introduced. The launch of the 2013 Escape wasn't an easy one, with a number of high-profile recalls that happened in the new model's first few months on the market. For the larger recall, more than <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080803_2013-ford-escape-fusion-recalled-for-fire-risk">70,000 2013 Escapes sold in the U.S. with the 1.6-liter inline-4</a> were recalled for overheating that could result in a fire risk. T<a>wo of the first few recalls</a> were linked to its optional 1.6-liter EcoBoost turbo-4.</p>, <p>A trio of 4-cylinder engines were offered in this Escape, with a carryover 2.5-liter 4-cylinder being the most inexpensive choice. It was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, as were both other engine choices. A pair of new turbocharged 4-cylinders took over the Escape's performance duties: a 178-hp 1.6-liter turbo-4 was the mainstream engine choice, while a 240-hp, 2.0-liter turbo-4 was the quickest Escape offered in the 2013 model year. All versions improved on fuel economy, with some versions earning ratings of up to 33 mpg highway.</p>, <p>The Hybrid model did not return. In its place, Ford offered a more Prius-like gas-electric hatchback, the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_c-max_2013">C-Max Hybrid</a>.</p>, <p>That Escape remained in the same compact size class, but with more ample interior and cargo space, as well as new conveniences and features. A new flip-fold mechanism for the rear bench seat helped tuck in the headrests for easier cargo loading, as did a motion-sensing automatic tailgate. The Escape's electric power steering could steer the car into a spot with brakes controlled by the driver. Blind-spot monitors could alert drivers of traffic approaching from the side and rear.</p>, <p>Safety improved over the first-generation crossover, but more advanced testing challenged those initial good ratings. The new body structure helped the Escape earn the IIHS' Top Safety Pick status for 2013, but that rating was withdrawn for 2014 when the two-year-old car earned an embarrassing "Poor" rating on the small-overlap front crash test. The NHTSA gave it four stars out of five overall and on most tests, with a five-star rating for side-impact protection.</p>, <p>MyFord Touch was the Escape's first voice-controlled infotainment system. It ran audio, phone and optional navigation systems. For 2016, a new version of Sync, named Sync 3, took its place, with quicker and cleaner interfaces and better voice recognition.</p>, <p>Starting in 2015, Lincoln offered its own more luxurious version of the Escape, called the MKC.</p>]

[<p>The Ford Edge is a five-passenger crossover SUV that's bigger than the Escape but smaller than the Explorer. The Edge is steered toward convenience and comfort.</p>, <p>It was new for the 2015 model year, and the Edge now shares some of its running gear with Ford's popular Fusion sedan.</p>, <p>With the Edge, Ford has a rival for vehicles such as the Nissan Murano, the GMC Terrain and Chevy Equinox, even the Lexus RX.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_edge_2018">2018 Ford Edge review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Ford Edge<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The latest Ford Edge arrived for the 2015 model year, riding atop the same mechanicals as the latest Ford Fusion. Its styling cues are shared in part with the Fusion, and there are some BMW and Hyundai influences in the shoulder lines and six-sided grille. Inside, the Edge wears better interior finishes, and the dash shape has a close kinship with those in several Korean SUVs, especially in the vent shapes and brightwork bracketing the dash and framing the central touchscreen.</p>, <p>Base Edge crossovers get a new 2.0-liter tubo-4, good for 245 horsepower and 275 pound-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive is an option. The new base Edge is capable of towing up to 3,500 pounds, a substantial improvement from the previous version.</p>, <p>Of the two V-6 engines available, the more intriguing one is the twin-turbocharged, direct-injected 2.7-liter V-6 that comes standard in the Edge Sport. It's a new design also used in the Ford F-150 pickup. In the Edge, it produces 315 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque; it comes standard with active noise cancellation.</p>, <p>For those who don't want turbocharging, Ford offers its 3.5-liter V-6, making 280 hp and 250 lb-ft. A 6-speed automatic is standard on all Edge models, as are paddle shifters and a selectable sport driving mode.</p>, <p>The latest Edge uses a fully independent suspension. The Edge Sport has unique suspension tuning, with monotube dampers in the rear, as well as standard 20-inch wheels with 21s as an option. There's also a new electric power steering system for the pricier Sport and Titanium versions; it reduces the necessary wheel input at low speeds using special in-hub gearing.</p>, <p>Since the Edge now rides on the Fusion's platform, interior space is up. There's still no third-row seat, but there's more cargo space—up to 39.2 cubic feet behind the rear seat (an increase of 7 cubic feet), 73.4 behind the front seat (a 4.5-cubic-foot improvement) and Ford claims there is more leg room in both rows.</p>, <p>Safety features now include a rearview camera on most models, as well as a new passenger knee airbag mounted in the glovebox frame. Other features include standard Bluetooth and an LCD audio display. Options include parking assist that can handle both perpendicular and parallel parking, rear-seat inflatable seat belts, a automatic liftgate, and heated and cooled seats.</p>, <p>The latest Ford Edge went on sale early in 2015. A new infotainment system, dubbed Sync 3, replaced MyFord Touch in 2016 models. For 2017, the Edge gained a new cold-weather package. An appearance package with dark exterior trim and gray wheels came for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Edge history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>With the Edge, Ford finally came up with a satisfying answer to the car-based wagons that had been introduced by import brands—and it also found a way to make up for collapsing sales of the Ford Explorer, in the wake of the massive tire recall of 2000.</p>, <p>The first Edge was loosely based on a former version of the Mazda 6 sedan. Along with the Ford Fusion, which was introduced in the 2006 model year, the Ford Edge established a new design direction for Ford—totally contemporary, not dependent on past themes.</p>, <p>The first Edge had a somewhat limited appeal. The only engine was a 3.5-liter V-6 that made 265 hp, but it provided impressive acceleration through its 6-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive was standard, with all-wheel drive an option. Ford made no attempt to position the Edge as a rugged vehicle or one meant for off-roading; instead, it let the Edge establish itself with urban buyers more concerned with good ride and handling.</p>, <p>The first Edge only offered two rows of seating. That choice was a good one, as it allowed space for five adults and a large cargo space with quite a low load floor. The Edge has stuck to this two-row layout throughout its existence.</p>, <p>A thoroughly refreshed Ford Edge arrived for the 2011 model year. Along with a more powerful 285-hp V-6, it incorporated a neatly redesigned instrument panel, upgraded interior materials, and refined sheet metal and appearance details throughout. The Edge's basic shape and interior configuration remained the same.</p>, <p>A new engine option was added for the 2012 model year in the form of Ford's 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbo-4. With the 6-speed automatic and only in front-drive form, this Edge became the most economical optional, with a 30-mpg highway fuel economy rating. </p>, <p>The Edge was one of the first vehicles to get the new MyFord touchscreen interface system, which uses Bluetooth and steering-wheel controls to direct audio, phone and navigation systems, with an LCD touchscreen as the display.</p>, <p>For the 2013 and 2014 model years, the Edge changed only slightly. All-wheel drive was added as an option on SE models, and the model's 6-speed automatic gained a sport mode.</p>]

[<p>The Ford F-250 Super Duty is the automaker's heavy-duty truck sold in 3/4-ton (F-250) or 1-ton (F-350) configurations. The F-Series goes even higher than that, but those trucks are intended as commercial vehicles and likely only spotted at worksites and on long hauls.</p>, <p>With the Super Duty, Ford takes on rivals like the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra 2500-series trucks, the Ram 2500, and even the Nissan Titan XD, which passes some light-duty trucks in towing and hauling, but falls short of the heavy-duty class on those fronts.</p>, <p>Ford unveiled the newest Super Duty pickups in 2015 for the 2017 model year, and announced they would for the first time extensively use lighter-weight aluminum body panels. The truckmaker similarly changed the F-150 for 2015, which drew criticism from rivals and some pickup buyers.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111908_2018-ford-super-duty">2018 Ford F-250 review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Ford Super Duty F-250</strong></p>, <p>For 2017, the automaker extensively overhauled the Super Duty range. The heavy-duty pickups use significantly more aluminum than in prior years—similar to the F-150's changeover—and shed 350 pounds in body panels. The overall weight savings over prior years are a wash, according to Ford; the truckmaker uses that weight savings to beef up other parts of the truck.</p>, <p>According to Ford, the truck's fully boxed frame is 24 percent stiffer over the previous generation, and helps the truck tow up to 18,000 pounds when hitched to a conventional trailer.</p>, <p>Two powertrains are available in the F-250. The base truck is equipped with a familiar 6.2-liter V-8 rated at 385 horsepower and 430 pound-feet of torque. An optional, new 6.7-liter turbodiesel V-8 is available in the F-250 that boasts 440 hp and 925 lb-ft of torque. The latter should be popular for anyone with a grudge against a tree stump as it's required to achieve the heady towing and hauling figures.</p>, <p>Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission and are available in either rear- or four-wheel drive configurations.</p>, <p>Similar to all other full-size pickups in the U.S., the new F-250 Super Duty is available in myriad configurations of box length, powertrain, cab specification, and trim. The F-250 is available in single-rear wheel configuration only; the F-350 can be single- or dual-rear wheel; F-450 and up is dual-rear wheel only.</p>, <p>In addition to significant chassis improvements, the 2017 Super Duty lineup received comprehensive tech upgrades as well. The 2017 Super Duty lineup offers upgrades such as adaptive cruise control and forward-collision warning, which will work together with with trailer brakes; variable electric steering assistance; blind-spot monitors; up to seven exterior cameras, including a  trailer-mounted rearview camera; remote tailgate release; and inflatable rear outboard seat belts.</p>, <p>The updated Super Duty went on sale in late 2016 and was unchanged for the 2018 model year, save for minor horsepower and towing rating updates. The Super Duty's turbodiesel now makes 450 hp.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Super Duty history</strong></p>, <p>For Ford, the "Super Duty" name goes back to the 1960s, but the direct ancestors of the current heavy duty pickup line only go back as far as 1999. That was the first year Ford split the F-250 and F-350 from the F-150 line. The first Super Duty pickups borrowed heavily from the 1997 Ford Powerforce Concept truck that first used a plunging window line near the sideview mirrors for better visibility and towing. The window line would eventually be a signature styling element for the heavy duty trucks.</p>, <p>The first Super Duty trucks were powered by massive engines including a 7.3-liter turbodiesel V-8 or a 6.8-liter gasoline V-10. Those engines were paired to a variety of transmissions including 4- and 5-speed automatics, or 5- and 6-speed manuals. Those initial Super Duty trucks skewed heavily toward work trucks; most of the trims didn't come close to today's lavishly equipped heavy duty offerings.</p>, <p>The supersized pickup also spawned a supersized SUV: the Ford Excursion.</p>, <p>The second generation of Super Duty trucks was launched in 2008 with downsized engines and more opulent trims. The Triton V-10 could still be found under the hood, but the 7.3-liter turbodiesel was replaced with a 6.4-liter V-8. A 5.4-liter gas V-8 was standard. All engines were mated to either a 5-speed automatic, or 5- or 6-speed manuals.</p>, <p>For the first time, Ford offered the Super Duty in King Ranch and Harley Davidson trims, catering to buyers looking for the same luxury found in the F-150 in their Super Duty trucks. The success of heavy-duty trucks from all of the domestic automakers was hard to ignore and Ford significantly overhauled the Super Duty Series again in 2011 to keep up with General Motors and Chrysler.</p>, <p>The heavily upgraded 2011 Super Duty sported a massive grille increased power figures to match. A 6.2-liter V-8 came standard, which could be upgraded to the V-10. An upgraded 6.7-liter turbodiesel was available beginning in 2011, and jumpstarted the heavy-duty pickup arms race. Initially the unit was rated at 735 lb-ft of torque before being upgraded to 800 lb-ft and then again to 860 lb-ft. In America, Ford stopped offering Super Duty trucks with manual transmissions for this generation.</p>, <p>Ford announced in 2015 that an all-new Super Duty truck would arrive in late 2016 for the 2017 model year.</p>]

[<p>The Ford EcoSport is a compact crossover that skips the SUV all together. It's smaller engine and smaller size make it an ideal urban runabout.</p>, <p>It may be new to America for the 2018 model year, but the Ford EcoSport is actually a global crossover sold here on Ford's home turf.</p>, <p>With the EcoSport, Ford will re-use a nameplate that has been around since the early 2000s, when it was applied to a Brazilian-built, pint-size crossover. The version headed to the United States is based on a model assembled in about half a dozen plants and sold in virtually every market worldwide. </p>, <p>The version destined for the U.S. will be sourced from a Ford production facility in India. Our version in the States will be a new generation of EcoSports, which has been on sale around the world since 2013.</p>, <p><strong style="font-style: italic;">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_ecosport_2018">2018 Ford EcoSport review</a></strong></p>, <p>Designed to square off against rivals like the Mazda CX-3 and the Chevrolet Trax, the EcoSport is a small five-seat crossover with limited cargo space and a tight second row of seats. But its pint-size dimensions make it decidedly city-oriented here. Instead of a liftgate like its rivals, the EcoSport features a swing-out tailgate. In some markets, that tailgate has a spare tire festooned to it, but the American EcoSport does without a spare. That's not necessarily unusual; most rivals do without a fifth wheel and tire as well. </p>, <p>Global EcoSports come in at around 167 inches from head to toe, making them quite a bit smaller than the brand's Escape. For comparison, the Escape is about a foot longer, with most of that space dedicated to the rear seat and the cargo area. </p>, <p>The EcoSport is based on the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_fiesta_2017">Ford Fiesta's</a> platform, which gives it decent handling. Ford offers a choice between 1.0-liter turbo-3 and 2.0-liter inline-4. Only the 4-cylinder model is offered with all-wheel drive. Both engines are mated exclusively to 6-speed automatic transmissions.</p>, <p>The 2018 EcoSport is offered in four trim levels—S, SE, SES, and Titanium. The SES model includes a specially tuned sport suspension and copper-tinted interior and exterior accents, but it is offered only with the 2.0-liter engine and all-wheel drive. </p>, <p>On the tech front, the EcoSport packs a lot for a small vehicle. An 8.0-inch touchscreen shows off Ford's updated Sync 3 system and both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A 10-speaker B&amp;O Play audio system is included on the Titanium, too. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_focus
[<p>The Ford Focus is a family of compact cars, most recently redesigned in the 2012 model year. It's a challenger for the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, and Chevrolet Cruze, among many others.</p>, <p>Ford updated the Focus in 2015 and offers it in sedan and hatchback body styles that range from spartan to very well equipped in top Titanium trim.</p>, <p>With the Focus, Ford also offers a hot hatchback to cap the lineup. The Ford Focus RS arrived for 2017, the first time it has been available in the U.S. This harder-core version of the Focus ST adds all-wheel drive and an even more powerful turbo-4. The new RS also has more aggressive bodywork, a reworked suspension, and grippier tires.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_focus_2018" title="2015 Ford Focus - review">2018 Ford Focus review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Ford Focus</strong></p>, <p>The current third-generation Focus was launched as a four-door sedan and a five-door hatchback for the 2012 model year. The two-door and wagon models offered in previous generations and in Europe are not available here, while a sporty Focus ST "hot hatch" model joined the lineup for 2013.</p>, <p>The redesigned Focus is built in Michigan and shares about 80 percent of its design with the version sold in Europe. This version has excellent ride and handling as well as a more sophisticated driving feel overall. A new-generation direct-injection engine returns good gas mileage—up to 40 mpg in special SFE trim. The current Focus is great evidence that small cars don't have to seem like appliances, but can offer style, rewarding drivers, and upmarket features—if you're willing to pay for them.</p>, <p>On the efficiency front, Ford originally steered the Focus toward hybrid technology, the compact hybrid C-Max (built on Focus underpinnings) and the C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid model, offering 21 miles of battery range backed up by a gasoline engine. But for 2015, a new model joined the Focus lineup: one with a tiny turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine paired to a 6-speed manual. It's the kind of car that would have been unthinkable for a U.S. maker only a few years ago, but more efficient smaller engines and ever-rising corporate fuel economy rules have brought this most efficient of Focuses to the table.</p>, <p>At the other end of the scale, the Focus ST launched in 2013 features a 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 and much sportier suspension tuning, along with performance improvements throughout. We've driven the 2013 Ford Focus ST and found it to be a very satisfying enthusiasts' car, while remaining one that you can drive daily on your commute, as well as for long highway trips. It was good enough, in fact, that it was nominated for the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080834_2013-ford-focus-st-best-car-to-buy-2013-nominee">Best Car To Buy award by <em>Motor Authority</em></a>.</p>, <p>Ford offers a Focus Electric hatchback in a handful of states. The company doesn't do much to promote it, which leads us to believe it is simply a so-called "<a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1068832_electric-cars-some-are-real-most-are-only-compliance-cars--we-name-names" title="Electric Cars: Some Are Real, Most Are Only 'Compliance Cars'--We Name Names">compliance car</a>," designed to meet California regulations that require companies to sell a certain number of zero-emission vehicles to be allowed to sell other vehicles in the state. Ford recently slashed the price of the Focus Electric by $6,000, which means the company may not be selling as many as it needs to.</p>, <p>While the current Focus is base-priced just under $17,000 with delivery, it's easy to spend upward of $10,000 more if you ladle on the luxury items that Ford offers—separately and as part of the top-end Platinum trim level. Ford dropped the SEL trim from the Focus lineup after a year, going from SE to Platinum. But the current Focus has all sorts of class-first options—including the MyFord Touch interface, active parking assistance, and HD Radio.</p>, <p>For 2013 and 2014, the Focus rated an overall five-star NHTSA safety score, while early models were slightly lower. It's one of the few compact sedans to have earned both that and IIHS Top Safety Pick status. It earned an "Acceptable" rating in the tough new IIHS small-overlap front crash test—just one notch down from the top "Good" that it earned on all other tests.</p>, <p>The Focus received a visual refresh for the 2015 model year, including a revised front end and upgraded interior. Engine offerings were expanded as well: A version using the 3-cylinder, 1.0-liter engine joined the lineup, after first becoming available in the smaller smaller Fiesta. The ST and Focus Electric benefited from the styling updates as well, although both left their powertrains unchanged for 2015.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the all-wheel-drive <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1106602_2016-ford-focus-rs-first-drive-review-the-hottest-of-the-hatches">rally-ready Focus RS</a> joined the lineup. The most expensive Focus yet, it's also the fastest. With 350 hp on tap, the Focus RS can hit 60 mph in less than 4.6 seconds.</p>, <p>The Focus was carried over through the 2018 model year. A new version should go on sale by 2019; it will be Ford's first American-market vehicle sourced partially from China.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Focus history</strong></p>, <p>The original Ford Focus replaced the old Escort back in 2000 and has been the company's compact car line ever since. When it was first introduced that year, the Focus replaced not only the Ford Escort but also the slightly larger Ford Contour sedan, which was then discontinued. At that time, the Focus was a more upscale-feeling small car than most, offering a better interior experience than competitors, plus critically lauded handling, so the top rivals at the time were the Volkswagen Golf/Jetta and Mazda Protégé.</p>, <p>Over its life, the Focus has had a variety of body styles, including two- and four-door sedans, three- and five-door hatchbacks, and a wagon. As compacts have gotten larger over the years, the Focus lost its place as the entry-level model in Ford's lineup when the Fiesta subcompact arrived for 2011.</p>, <p>In its initial several years, the Focus was offered with 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engines that made 110 hp or 130 hp, with the 130-hp (DOHC) version being the pick of the two. Most models could be equipped with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, though for many years wagon models were oddly offered only with an automatic. Some models were offered with a 2.3-liter engine. In addition to all the body styles, the Focus was available in many different trim levels and could be loaded with luxury items like leather upholstery and a moonroof.</p>, <p>A 2005 model year refresh simplified the lineup in many ways and brought crisper front-end styling; the engine lineup changed to 136-hp (2.0-liter) and 151-hp (2.3-liter) versions of Ford's more modern Duratec engine. Focus models from this era and later are generally considered more reliable than the earlier ones—and for wagon and hatch aficionados, 2005 to 2007 is the sweet spot.</p>, <p>For 2008, the Focus lineup was refreshed more thoroughly, with an extensively redone interior, more refinement, and expanded safety features. The wagon was dropped along with all hatchback models, replaced by a rather homely looking two-door coupe sold alongside the sedan. Also of note, Ford chose the youth-oriented Focus in which to introduce its new Sync hands-free interface, which later spread to the rest of the lineup.</p>, <p>That Focus ST packed a high-output 4-cylinder that made 170 hp, a strengthened Getrag 6-speed manual transmission, uprated brakes, a tony exhaust, and a stiffened suspension. It was lots of fun to drive and is still admired by hot-hatch lovers.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_explorer
[<p>The Ford Explorer is a mid-size crossover and one of the most prolific cars on the road in North America. It was introduced in the 1990s as a truck-based, sport-utility vehicle, but in recent years has been transformed into a more car-like crossover SUV with very good performance, and less of an emphasis on off-road driving.</p>, <p>With the current Explorer, Ford has a competitor for vehicles like the Honda Pilot, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Pathfinder, and the Toyota Highlander.</p>, <p>At its core, the latest Explorer is a front-wheel-drive wagon with a little bit of crossover-style all-weather driving ability. It can seat up to seven people and can be configured with a turbo-4 or V-6 engines. It's offered in base, XLT, Sport, Limited, and Platinum trim levels.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_explorer_2018" title="2017 Ford Explorer - review">2018 Ford Explorer review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Explorer</strong></p>, <p>Introduced for the 2011 model year, the current Explorer trades in some rock-climbing ability for more all-weather comfort and family practicality. Ditching the body-on-frame design, the car-based Explorer arrived with seven-seat capability, electronic assistance for its all-wheel-drive system, and a 3.5-liter V-6 engine teamed with a 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>A turbocharged 4-cylinder engine became an option for the 2012 model year, and delivers up to 28 mpg on the highway—some 25 percent better than any Explorer before it. For 2013, a turbocharged V-6 was added as a V-8 replacement.</p>, <p>The latest Explorer is among our top-rated vehicles for families for its interior and fuel economy as well as for its carlike handling and good safety record. It gets the highest rating of "Good" from the IIHS on all tests except the tougher small-overlap front crash, where it's rated "Marginal"—just one step above the lowest "Poor" rating. The NHTSA gives the current Explorer a top, five-star overall rating for safety.</p>, <p>The current Explorer also includes all the latest connectivity systems, including a navigation system with Sirius Travel Link and Sync, which uses Bluetooth to enable voice control of some vehicle systems. There was also MyFord Touch, a system that used steering-wheel or voice controls to direct audio, navigation, and phone with a large LCD touchscreen to display the interface. The system was derided and replaced in 2017 with Sync 3, a system that doesn't escape faults. We've tested it in other vehicles and found it to be slick, albeit a little laggy and confused in certain situations, most noticeably in selecting day/night display modes during dawn and dusk.</p>, <p>Ford brought back the Explorer Sport badge in 2013. Instead of a two-door variant like its predecessor with the same name, this version uses the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 from the latest Taurus SHO, making 350 hp. It is paired with standard all-wheel drive and includes more standard features as well as suspension and steering improvements. Ford sees the turbocharged V-6 as a replacement for the Explorer's previous V-8 models, making it the closest thing to a performance-oriented Explorer we're likely to see. Its 0-60 mph times are 2 seconds quicker than the standard V-6 Explorer, while <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1074621_2013-ford-explorer-sport-twin-turbo-v-6-utility">towing up to 5,000 pounds</a>.</p>, <p>The EPA has rated the Explorer as high as 27 mpg on the highway in 4-cylinder front-wheel-drive guise, with all-wheel drive models earning 18 mpg city, 25 highway ratings.</p>, <p>A revised version of this Explorer went on sale for the 2016 model year. The interior and exterior were given a subtle once-over, with the exterior design now resembling a Land Rover's more than ever. The look is much more sophisticated, with finer details and a more cohesive front-end treatment. A Platinum model has been added at the top of the range, and there's a new 2.3-liter turbo-4 available as well, bringing the available engines to three.</p>, <p>For 2017, Ford added a sport appearance package to lower trims that replicates the Sport trim's good looks for a lower price. Sync 3 also replaced the finicky MyFord Touch system with limited effect. </p>, <p>The 2018 Explorer has some mild cosmetic touch-ups, and LED headlights now come standard on Platinum models. A high-speed data subscription now brings 4G LTE connectivity into the Explorer, and up to 10 devices can use its access.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Explorer history</strong></p>, <p>In its past, the Explorer was more directly related to Ford's small pickup trucks and was offered in many more versions—everything from a manual-shifted three-door to a V-8-powered quasi-pickup. Introduced for the 1991 model year, the Explorer was distantly related to the Bronco II that it replaced. Compared to that stubby, basic two-door, the Explorer was packaged and marketed much more successfully. It practically inaugurated the SUV era in America along with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and quickly became one of the best selling, most recognizable and popular vehicles in the U.S., with annual sales approaching a half-million.</p>, <p>Those earliest Explorers were three-door and five-door wagons, and quite crude devices that drove like short-wheelbase compact pickups. In fact, there were still a few shared parts with the Ford Ranger truck. A shortened three-door Explorer Sport was offered through 2003, while a four-door Explorer Sport Trac with a small pickup bed was offered through the 2010 model year.</p>, <p>The first-generation Explorer came under fire in 2000 and 2001, when a number of rollover accidents—linked to underinflated or improperly specified Firestone tires—led to the model's recall and replacement of the tires. From that recall, and the hearings around it, grew the federal requirement for tire-pressure monitoring and also arguably sped the deployment of electronic stability control. It also severely hurt the Explorer's brand image, causing sales to plummet.</p>, <p>That happened despite the much-improved Explorer that emerged after a full redesign in the 2002 model year. Standard equipment included an independent rear suspension, and a third-row seat became an option for the first time. In 2006, more safety features were added, and the exterior styling was smoothed over. Through this era, the Explorer's interior functionality also got better, with usable seating space for up to seven, and third-row seating that became easier to use. Still, Explorer sales never had quite recovered after the tire-separation issue, and buyers started to migrate to more carlike crossover vehicles like the Toyota Highlander.</p>, <p>That Explorer was a better-handling, more refined vehicle than its predecessor—and still is a good recommendation for its towing capacity for those that don't need a full-size SUV. The 4.6-liter V-8 was popular for hauling; the 4.0-liter V-6 wasn't responsive or smooth or particularly powerful—or even more efficient, the V-6 versions were rated nearly identically to the V-8 versions.</p>]

[<p>The Ford Fusion mid-size sedan is a bestseller for the automaker, but won't be around for much longer. The automaker said this Fusion would be the last Fusion (at least for a while) as sedan shoppers turn toward crossovers instead.</p>, <p>Rivals include perennials such as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, but the Fusion also competes with the Chevrolet Malibu, Mazda 6, Nissan Altima, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, and Subaru Legacy. </p>, <p>With the Fusion, Ford offers more powertrain choices than many of those competitors, including a plug-in hybrid sedan. (The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_fusion-hybrid">Fusion Hybrid</a>, and its plug-in hybrid Energi variant, are covered separately.)</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_fusion_2018" title="2017 Ford Fusion - review">2018 Ford Fusion review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Ford Fusion</strong></p>, <p>The Fusion was entirely redesigned for 2013 in stunning fashion. The Fusion was named <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080816_2013-ford-fusion-the-car-connections-best-car-to-buy-2013"><em>The Car Connection</em>'s Best Car To Buy</a> 2013, for its sleek, elegant good looks; refined performance; and fuel-efficient EcoBoost turbo powertrains. The Fusion has a premium-car feel and an impressive feature set. </p>, <p>The latest Fusion wears an entirely new design language that owes much to the themes seen on the Ford Focus. It's a sophisticated look, with some cues that echo details on everything from newer Hyundais to the latest Aston Martins and Audis. The cockpit design is formatted around a central touchscreen, updated to Sync 3 in later years.</p>, <p>Engines on the 2013 Fusion included a base 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with 175 horsepower; a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with direct injection, 178 hp, and an estimated highway gas mileage rating of 37 mpg; and a 2.0-liter turbo-4 shared with vehicles from the Taurus sedan, Edge crossover, and the hot Focus ST hatchback. Most were fitted with a 6-speed automatic, although a 6-speed manual was initially available in 1.6-liter versions. That engine was discontinued after 2015.</p>, <p>While most Fusions make do with front-wheel drive, the top Titanium trim offers the option of all-wheel drive when paired with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine. The 2.0-liter almost needs the extra traction to put its potent power down. All Fusions use an independent suspension design that provides confident, and even sporty, handling. It's fun to hustle and also handles long cruises with comfort. The Fusion also has good interior packaging for a family sedan, with a good balance of front- and rear-seat room.</p>, <p>When this generation was introduced, it offered a strong list of standard and available features. Those include Bluetooth with audio streaming standard, available leather upholstery, a rearview camera, and even park assist, which uses sensors and the electric power steering to put the car in tight spots with the driver only operating the brake and throttle.</p>, <p>In the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_fusion_2014">2014 Fusion</a>, Ford introduced a new 1.5-liter 4-cylinder EcoBoost engine that returned almost the same performance as the 1.6-liter turbo-4 but with better fuel economy. It came paired only to the 6-speed automatic and features an engine stop-start system to conserve fuel. The 2014 Fusion also made the inflatable rear seatbelt system that was originally offered in the Explorer available on the Fusion, and Ford added cooled front seats and a heated steering wheel to the sedan's options list as well.</p>, <p>For the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_fusion_2015">2015 model year</a>, Ford quietly dropped the manual transmission and its requisite 1.6-liter turbo-4 from the Fusion lineup. The Fusion's other features remained: enduring styling, very good handling, and excellent crash-test scores from both the IIHS and the NHTSA.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Fusion received a very mild mid-cycle update, with a grille and headlights so subtly redesigned that you might miss them altogether. There's a new top-level Platinum trim, and a new powertrain option as well: the Fusion Sport offers this generation's first V-6, a 325-hp 2.7-liter turbocharged V-6, along with all-wheel drive. There's also the latest Sync 3 infotainment system, a redesigned center console with a rotary drive selector, and added active-safety systems including adaptive cruise control that now works all the way down to a stop and back up to highway speeds again.</p>, <p>The Fusion carried over into the 2018 model year unchanged.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Fusion history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The Fusion name first appeared in 2006, effectively replacing the defunct Contour that had ended production after the 2000 model year. The first-generation Fusion received an styling and equipment update for 2010, when it added a hybrid version for the first time. The second-generation Fusion debuted for 2013, along with not only another hybrid but the brand's first plug-in hybrid, sold as the Fusion Energi.</p>, <p>Both generations of Fusion were related to the Lincoln MKZ, which was also revamped for the 2013 model year with a more distinctive design. The first-generation Fusion also spawned the Mercury Milan, which was discontinued along with its namesake division in 2011.</p>, <p>In 2006, the first Fusion set a new look for Ford with a very prominent three-bar chrome grille and upright headlights leading to a more conventional look otherwise. Though the look was bold for the time, it aged well and still looked fresh several years later at the end of that model's run. That early Fusion also earned excellent reliability ratings (including the all-important approval of <em>Consumer Reports</em>); it also gained kudos for quality from many other sources, and has held its resale value far better than the previous Taurus did.</p>, <p>Another reason the first Fusion resonated is that it simply was fun to drive. It helped that it was built on some of the same underpinnings as the previous-generation (pre-2009) Mazda 6, another vehicle lauded for its sport-sedan handling. Not counting pricier European luxury makes, the first-generation Fusion was quite possibly the best-handling mid-size four-door sedan available in the U.S. during its run on the market.</p>, <p>The base 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine offered from 2006 through 2009 was only adequate with the automatic transmission, but felt considerably peppier with the standard manual gearbox—a combination that was hard to find in some areas. The V-6 didn't stand out for its performance numbers—it only made 240 hp—but it felt strong in the Fusion and the 6-speed automatic transmission worked especially well with it.</p>, <p>For 2010, the 2.3-liter engine was replaced with a 2.5-liter that wasn't much more powerful but was considerably less noisy when pressed to perform. And the Fusion finally got Ford's larger, 3.5-liter V-6, making up to 263 hp. From 2007 on, all-wheel drive was been offered on the Fusion, but it was only available with the V-6 at first, and had slightly lower power ratings than front-wheel-drive models. All Fusions received a heavy facelift for the 2010 model year, as well.</p>, <p>The first-generation Fusion had a comfortable ride and a roomy interior, but for its first several years, up through 2009, it could feel a little drab inside. A redesigned instrument panel and new seats, along with some improved materials, brightened up the feel of the Fusion for 2010. Ford also stepped up the safety features for 2010; options included blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The only common complaint with the 2006-2009 Fusions was that they didn't return the fuel economy of most mid-size rivals—most of which were slightly larger and had slightly larger engines. Despite the improvements for 2010, fuel-economy figures didn't become much better.</p>, <p>Ford remedied that for 2010, with the introduction of the Ford Fusion Hybrid, a model that paired a version of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with an electric motor system. The Fusion Hybrid was able to run on electric power at up to 47 mph and achieved an outstanding city rating of 41 mpg, according to the EPA. Changes were minimal from then on, until the Fusion was replaced for 2013.</p>]

[<p>The Ford Fiesta is a subcompact sedan or hatchback that has struggled to find an audience in the U.S. Along with most other Ford sedans, it has a limited shelf life after Ford announced a new generation would not be available in the States.</p>, <p>The Fiesta is available with a pair of inline-4 engines: a base 1.6-liter inline-4 or a high-performance 1.6-liter turbo-4. The Fiesta offered a highly efficient turbo-3 that was scrapped in 2017.</p>, <p>With the Fiesta, Ford competes with the likes of the Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio, Honda Fit, Mazda 2, Hyundai Accent, and in some versions even the Mini Cooper or Fiat 500.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_fiesta_2018">2018 Ford Fiesta review</a></strong></em></p>, <p style="text-align: left;">The Fiesta badge was first used in the U.S. on a subcompact three-door hatchback sold from 1978 to 1980. Ford followed that car with the Mazda-designed Festiva 3-door (1986-1993) and then replaced it with the related Aspire three-door (1994-1997), which was built by Kia.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">Today's Fiesta, which debuted for the 2011 model year, is Ford's first new subcompact entry since the Aspire. It was adapted for U.S. sales from a model  sold in Europe. Ford was right to change the name of its subcompact again, as it offers better performance and more standard equipment—not to mention a greater number of safety features—than any of its American predecessors ever did.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">The revived Fiesta is wholly different from the typical economy car. Today's Fiesta is fully modern, with the features, handling, powertrains, and looks to make it a real competitor. The interior's interesting (if not universally loved) styling also helps set it apart from its price-minded roots.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">The Fiesta's narrow body and tight backseat keep it from being as useful as some other vehicles in this class, especially compared to the cavernous interior of the Versa sedan or the flexible Fit. In reviews of the Fiesta, though, we noted that it steers and handles far better than most of the numb, soft appliance-like vehicles in the class.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">The two Fiestas on opposite ends of the spectrum were both available only with a manual transmission. On the efficient end, the 1.0-liter, 3-cylinder model made 123 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. It achieved a 42-mpg EPA highway rating and was more fun than the standard engine. On the serious performance end, there's the Fiesta ST, which packs a 1.6-liter turbo-4 making 197 hp and 214 lb-ft of torque. It also has a near-perfect, stiffer suspension setup, grippy tires, and an all-around fun demeanor.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">A 120-hp, 1.6-liter inline-4 powers most Fiesta models, however. A 5-speed manual gearbox is standard, but the automatic option is an unusual and technically advanced 6-speed “PowerShift” dual-clutch gearbox. We have experienced a few drivability issues with the PowerShift transmission, which isn't as smooth as we'd hoped. Engine noise in the earlier cars was also an issue, but the later models are a bit better.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">A mild refresh for the 2014 model year gave the Fiesta revised front-end styling that takes the look from cute to a little more serious. It also added the 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost model and expanded the list of available powertrains. The 2014 model year also brought the outstanding Fiesta ST model, with its peppy turbo 1.6-liter and dialed-in chassis. Ford introduced a softer look inside, complemented by a stripped-down version of MyFord Touch, based on the SYNC Bluetooth-driven infotainment controller. Unfortunately not all versions dropped the confusing, slanted-button array of the base audio setup.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">Sync 3 replaced the controversial MyFord Touch for 2016. It comes with a 6.5-inch touchscreen and promises to be more intuitive and less buggy than MyFord Touch. Other 2016 changes consisted of a new SE Black Package and a few new color choices.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">The model lineup continues as it has since 2013, with S, SE, and Titanium trims, with the addition of the sporty ST. Features are a strength of the Fiesta. Even the base model includes air conditioning and an aux-in port; while at the SE level you get upgraded trim and lighting, as well as cruise control and power windows. The Titanium model gets leather heated seats, automatic climate control, heated side mirrors, the new Sync 3 infotainment system, Sony premium audio, and other extras that make it feel far better equipped than you might expect in a low-cost small car.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">Options include a power moonroof and Ford Racing wheels. Among other novel features, the Fiesta driver can choose from several different colors of LED “mood lighting” to illuminate the cupholders, footwells, and other interior bits.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;">The Fiesta is now one of the older entries in its segment. The Chevrolet Sonic, Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, and Toyota Yaris have all are debuted or been redesigned since the Fiesta was new. Pricing for the Fiesta starts around $15,000, but a fully decked-out standard model can approach $24,000, and an ST can add another $2,000.</p>]

[<p>The Ford GT is a two-seat supercar inspired by legendary racers with an astronomical price tag.</p>, <p>Now in its second generation, the GT is much more modern than the first generation car of 2005-2007. It uses a mid-engine design with a carbon fiber tub and carbon fiber body panels.</p>, <p>Revived for the 2017 model year, the Ford GT is powered by the brand's EcoBoost twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6, which makes 647 horsepower and 550 pound-feet of torque. It sends its thrust to the rear wheels through a 7-speed dual-clutch rear transaxle.</p>, <p>Its limited availability is reflected in its price: it starts at $450,000.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read</strong></em> <strong>Motor Authority's</strong> <em><strong>first drive of the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1110413_2017-ford-gt-first-drive-review-ready-for-supercar-liftoff">2017 Ford GT</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The GT's suspension is inspired by race cars, and that's appropriate because it's built by race car builder Multimatic and it also competes in endurance racing. The suspension has a short-arm, long-arm design, and the springs and dampers are mounted inboard and longitudinally.</p>, <p>Those dampers are adjustable. In fact, Ford offers five different driving modes for the GT: Normal, Sport, Track, Wet, and V-Max. The V-Max mode is meant for reaching the car's top speed of 217 mph.</p>, <p>Aerodynamics play a big role in the GT's exterior design. Air flows through portions of the body to increase stability, and the car has active aerodynamics, including active grille shutters up front and a rear spoiler that raises and tilts. The car's adjustable ride height also affects how it cuts through the air.</p>, <p>Inside, the GT has two carbon fiber-framed Sparco seats, a Formula One-style steering wheel with lots of controls, and a digital display that changes depending on the drive mode. Active noise cancellation is standard, and so is Ford's Sync 3 infotainment system with navigation.</p>, <p>Safety equipment is limited to a rearview camera and the usual government-mandated safety items.</p>, <p>Ford is limiting the GT to 250 cars per year for a run up to four years. To commemorate Ford's win at Le Mans in 1966, Ford is offering a <a>'66 Heritage Edition</a> in Shadow Black with Silver Stripes and Frozen White #2 hood and door graphics. Also available is the even more track-oriented Competition Series model that does away with niceties like a radio and air conditioning to save weight, has a lightweight Perspex acrylic engine cover, comes with carbon fiber wheels and a titanium exhaust system, and gets additional carbon fiber exterior bits.</p>, <p><strong>Ford GT History</strong></p>, <p>Though it only was built for a short time, the first-generation Ford GT has already assumed its place in the company's history. In part, that's because it was built specifically to be history.</p>, <p>With the GT, Ford had its long-wanted, road-going version of the GT40 racer that challenged Ferrari for Le Mans supremacy in the 1960s. It took decades, but the idea of building a streetgoing GT finally took hold at Ford as it prepared for its centennial, in June 2003. In January 2002, the company showed a concept GT at the Detroit auto show, after barely keeping the project under wraps—under the code name "Petunia."</p>, <p>The GT finally arrived late in 2003 as a production model for the 2005 model year. And though it would only be available for two model years it became an instant collectible. Inspired by the GT40, the GT was no direct copy: it wasn't 40 inches tall, for starters—it stood 44.3 inches high.</p>, <p>But in all other aspects, it was as stunning a recreation as it could be, given its modern powertrain and interior. The GT's mid-mounted V-8 was Ford's off-the-rack 5.4-liter of the day—only supercharged and massaged for a total output of 550 horsepower, and channeled to its rear wheels via a manual transmission. With 0-60 mph times of about 3.8 seconds and a top speed of about 190 mph, the GT's performance envelope was delivered with a unique signature.</p>, <p>In design, the GT bore a striking resemblance to the original, with some subtle cues to commemorate the company's anniversary, like high-intensity headlights styled to incorporate “100.” Working from the original, and improving its aerodynamics and its body construction with superheated aluminum sheets gave the GT a stiff body structure on which to mount a double-wishbone suspension front and rear.</p>, <p>Rounded out with a Torsen-style limited slip differential, four-piston Brembo brakes, and Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires (235-series 18-inchers in front, 315/40ZR-19s in back), we thrilled in the performance it crackled with: "the new GT on paper bristles with the energy of a downed power line," we wrote.</p>, <p>The GT always was intended to be a limited-run vehicle, and production ended with a handful of 2007 models being built. Initially priced just below $140,000, the GT was by then available at a discount, but values have appreciated. With a GT40 winning its class at the 2013 Pebble Beach Concours, there's every reason to believe one of these will cross the center stage at The Lodge in the future.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_flex
[<p>The Ford Flex is a full-size crossover SUV that's as much about its retro-chic looks as it is about versatility.</p>, <p>For some that may be a turn off, but the Flex has its fans thanks to its usable space and up to eight seating positions.</p>, <p>Introduced for the 2009 model year, the Flex has seen few significant changes since 2013, when it received a new front end and a restyled dash. The 2017 model is identical to the 2016 version, save for a couple new exterior colors.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_flex_2018">2018 Ford Flex review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>While the Flex overlaps with the more popular and rugged-looking Explorer seven-seat crossover, it's as much of a style statement as a predictable family vehicle. That said, its cavernous interior and class-leading infotainment features are ideally suited to family duties. The Flex has all along been a better seller in California than in the rest of the country, perhaps because that audience appreciates its post-modern station wagon looks, or because buyers there want most of the utility of a minivan without the stodgy look.</p>, <p>When optioned with the white roof, this full-size crossover looks like a combination of a Range Rover and a Mini Cooper—you’d be hard-pressed to say about any other model on the market. Is it a witty counter-take on today's mainstream, or the ready descendant to the Country Squires and Fairlane wagons of the past? We'll let you decide; but there's no doubt it's a very fashionable piece, and different.</p>, <p>The Flex was previewed by the Ford Fairlane concept of 2005, and the production version first appeared at the 2007 New York Auto Show. The slab-sided design includes horizontal strakes in the door panels that were inspired by vintage vacuum cleaners, according to designer Richard Gresens. Lots of chrome trim and the distinctive white roof give it a flair all its own, while the cabin is one of Ford's better efforts in recent history. Wood and metallic trim are comfortably integrated with leather or tweedy cloth seats, along with blue-lit gauges and cupholders and footwells with LED accent lighting.</p>, <p>Ford offers a choice of two V-6 engines in the Flex. The base powertrain is a 287-horsepower, 3.5-liter with standard front-wheel drive and available all-wheel drive. The optional engine, added in 2010, is one from Ford's EcoBoost line, a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter making 365 hp; it's paired exclusively with all-wheel drive. Fuel economy is pretty good with all Flex models; the EcoBoost model is the most thirsty at 16 mpg city, 22 highway, 18 combined.</p>, <p>The Flex's running gear originated with former corporate cousin Volvo. The "D4" platform shared by the Flex and the Lincoln MKT (as well as the latest Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS) stems from the full-size chassis underpinning the former Ford Freestyle and Ford Five Hundred, which were in turn derived from the Volvo S80 and XC90. The chassis features fully independent suspension at all four corners with very well-damped ride motions and surprisingly responsive steering.</p>, <p>The Flex can seat up to seven people, giving it acceptable minivan-alternative status. While the front seats are wide and nicely cushioned, their active headrests can push the head further forward than is comfortable—this is common among the company's products. Ford added a telescoping steering column for 2010, correcting the Flex's only real packaging-related problem. The crossover wagon's second row is one of the best-designed we've seen, with chairs situated up high and a choice of a bench or buckets that fold easily. The third row isn't too tough for adults to access, nor is it inhospitable for them. The last row can also be optioned with power folding to make reconfiguration a bit easier.</p>, <p>All Flex models include three rows of seating and a good complement of standard equipment. Options include Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system, navigation, a refrigerator between second-row seats, second-row footrests, a 12-speaker Sony audio system with Sirius Travel Link, and a glorious four-panel Vista Roof that opens up the Flex’s cabin to the sky. A dual-headrest DVD entertainment system is also available. Prices start at about $30,000, but with options and the EcoBoost engine, it's easy to push the pricetag well over $50,000.</p>, <p>In 2013, there were some significant changes to the Flex. In that year, the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1074168_2013-ford-flex-first-drive">Flex received more substantial updates to its powertrain, interior, and MyFord Touch infotainment system.</a> A new instrument panel, steering wheel, seat trim and padding, and new finish panels were fitted, as was a slightly redesigned front end that rounds out the Flex's look—and looks like a USB port to some.</p>, <p>Other upgrades include a new thumb-shift manual control for the automatic transmission, along with optional rain-sensing wipers and power-folding mirrors; passive entry and start; a new range of wheel options, including 20-inchers; and dual chrome exhaust tips. Power and gas-mileage ratings changed slightly.</p>, <p>The 2015 model year brought with it only minor feature changes and some additions to the Flex's color palette, but for the 2016 model year Ford has replaced the unloved MyFord Touch interface and replaced it with SYNC3, which is driven by entirely new programming, has a completely new interface and underlying technology, and in our brief experience, is much more reliable and simple to navigate.</p>, <p>Ford carried over the 2016 model into 2017 and 2018 without any significant changes.</p>, <p>The Flex is built in Oakville, Ontario, next to the mechanically similar Lincoln MKT crossover.</p>]

[<p>The Ford Transit Connect is a 4-cylinder, three-row commercial van on sale in America since 2010.</p>, <p>Available as a empty van or as a minivan-alternative passenger wagon, the Transit Connect was updated for the 2019 model year. Ford will offer the small van with a gas or diesel engine, in short- or long-wheelbase configuration.</p>, <p>With the Transit Connect, Ford has a compact van to compete with the Nissan NV200, Ram ProMaster City, and Mercedes-Benz Metris. All of the vans are aimed at small-business owners with short commutes, but nearly all can be configured as a bare-bones minivan alternative. If the Transit Connect can't haul it, Ford sells a larger Transit that's available in multiple configurations.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_transit-connect_2018" title="2018 Ford Transit Connect - review">2018 Ford Transit Connect review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Transit Connect</strong></p>, <p>The new 2019 Ford Transit Connect was unveiled in February 2018 and featured a revised powertrain lineup aimed at fuel efficiency. A 2.0-liter inline-4 or a 1.5-liter turbodiesel will send power through an 8-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The turbodiesel should return at least 30 mpg on the highway, and the gas engine is equipped with start/stop to cut consumption in stop-and-go traffic.</p>, <p>Like its predecessors, the new Transit Connect is available in myriad configurations and specifications to suit small-business owners.</p>, <p>The 2019 Ford Transit Connect goes on sale in fall 2018.</p>, <p><strong>Transit Connect history</strong></p>, <p>The 2010-2013 Transit Connect was based on a vehicle more than 10 years old by the time it was retired. That version of the Transit Connect was made in Turkey and had been sold across Europe since 2003. For a time, it had some competition in the Honda Element and the Chevrolet HHR panel wagon—both of which were canceled for the 2012 model year.</p>, <p>The previous Transit Connect was sold in the U.S. with a single powertrain. It was powered by a 136-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-4 teamed with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Acceleration was leisurely with the combination, but fuel economy was an estimated 21 mpg city, 27 highway. The front-drive van wasn't a sloppy handler, though—its steering was reasonably quick and the ride quality occupied a good middle ground of firmness.</p>, <p>Those pre-2014 Transit Connect models lacked all but the basic accoutrements, and had fusty, hard-plastic interiors that felt more 1994 than modern. Still, with their vertical expanses and the side-hinged doors at the back, those Transit Connects were useful, flexible options for small businesses and private use.</p>, <p>Ford briefly offered an all-electric Transit Connect with a driving range of 70 to 100 miles and a recharging time of 6 to 8 hours, but bankruptcy of the conversion company in 2012 sealed this model's place as a small blip in electric-vehicle history.</p>, <p>The second-generation Transit Connect arrived for 2014 riding on a new platform and including far better creature comforts than the model it replaced. Ford focused more on the civilian uses of this delivery van turned people hauler, going after a segment of the market that has mostly been abandoned by cars like the old Honda Element. It's better suited for family hauling than before and also manages to be better dynamically, with increased refinement and improved fuel economy<strong>.</strong></p>, <p>This passenger version offers three rows of seating, with a sliding third row and folding second and third rows—plus a choice of a liftgate or dual hinged cargo doors in the rear. Like the delivery-van version, it sits on a new front-wheel-drive platform and is powered by new engines—either a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder or a 1.6-liter turbo-4—driving the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Those versions borrow much of the front end and the front-row cabin appointments from the Ford Escape, so they're very pleasant to be in, with soft-touch materials and a sophisticated, stylish dash layout. Transit Connect driving dynamics are astonishingly good. While the turbocharged engine provides better performance when you need to dart through a gap in traffic, it's a tossup as to which engine is better; 2.5-liter models offer 2,000 pounds of towing capacity when properly equipped and return very good gas mileage when lightly loaded.</p>, <p>Because of an old import tax, all Transit Connects brought here for U.S. sale arrive as five-door wagons, even the two-seat commercial versions. This a workaround of the so-called Chicken Tax, which is imposed on commercial vehicles imported into the U.S. Ford brings them in with temporary seats and side glass, ripping them out at port on the East Coast, and recycling what it can, thus avoiding the hefty 25-percent tax. This is the same reason pickups sold in America are all built here, thereby avoiding the extra tariff. Ford also offers a larger Transit van line in the U.S. now, in both commercial and passenger-carrying grades, although those models are built in the U.S. and avoid the tariffs.</p>]

They provide better gas mileage ratings for budget-conscious shoppers who want to save at the pump.</p>, <p>The hybrids are more expensive, too. Base hybrid models start at about $2,000 more than their gas counterparts, but come standard with many of the features that are optional on gas-powered Fusions.</p>, <p>The two hybrid models of the sleek, fastback Fusion are both fitted with a smaller 2.0-liter gasoline engine and a slightly revised version of Ford's two-motor hybrid system, which together produce 188 horsepower. A new lithium-ion battery pack—smaller and lighter than the previous nickel-metal-hydride pack used from 2010 to 2012—takes up less room in the trunk. This powertrain is shared with the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ford_c-max_2013">Ford C-Max Hybrid</a> compact hybrid hatchback, the company's first dedicated hybrid (there's no gasoline-only version) and its first direct competitor for the Toyota Prius.</p>, <p><span>While the 2013 and 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid models were originally rated at 47 mpg combined (47 mpg city, 47 highway) in June 2014 Ford lowered the ratings to 42 mpg combined (44 mpg city, 41 highway) after discovering errors in test measurements and calculations for aerodynamic drag. Ford agreed with the federal government to lower the ratings and send a check for the increased gasoline costs to all owners of 2013 and 2014 Fusion Hybrids, along with those of five other Ford and Lincoln models whose ratings were reduced at the same time.</span></p>, <p>The changes followed reports by numerous outlets, led by <em>Consumer Reports</em>, that failed to achieve anything like the 47-mpg combined number. While it lauded the new Fusion Hybrid, the consumer magazine and most other reviews rarely got above 41 mpg for the Fusion Hybrid, some seeing as low as 36 mpg. The discrepancy is especially jarring because the first generation of Fusion Hybrids were widely acknowledged to deliver on their combined 39-mpg rating. The lower ratings still beat those for the Toyota Camry Hybrid (41 or 40 mpg, depending on model), and the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid (38 or 37 mpg, again depending on model).</p>, <p>Otherwise, the new Ford Fusion lineup received high marks from our reviewers for its "handsome, even stunning looks," generous interior space, and its taut roadholding. Dislikes included only average rear-seat head room and the profusion of shiny plastic trim in the cabin.</p>, <p>The Fusion Energi shares the engine and hybrid system of the hybrid Fusion, but it has a larger lithium-ion battery pack in the trunk, along with a charging port on the fender. Its major difference is that you can plug it into the wall to recharge it, which will give you up to 20 miles of all-electric range, versus the Hybrid's one mile or so, after which the Fusion Energi reverts to being a conventional hybrid.</p>, <p><span>Only minor changes have been made through the 2016 model year.</span> A refresh to the Fusion Hybrids and the entire Fusion lineup came for the 2017 model year. Changes focused on the exterior styling, interior layout, and technology offerings; and the number of standard and optional active-safety items increased.</p>, <p><strong>Fusion Hybrid history</strong></p>, <p>That first-generation Ford Fusion Hybrid launched in 2010, and was a well-engineered, quiet, responsive hybrid sedan that looked "normal" and yet delivered remarkably high gas-mileage numbers. It also earned excellent safety ratings such as the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080348_2013-ford-fusion-earns-iihs-top-safety-pick-award">IIHS's Top Safety Pick</a>. That first Fusion Hybrid four-door sedan was Ford's second hybrid model, following the now-departed Escape Hybrid. The first-generation Fusion Hybrid hit the market in spring 2009 as a 2010 model—based on the updated 2010 version of the Fusion that had originally launched way back in 2005.</p>, <p>The 2010-2012 Ford Fusion Hybrid used a 2.5-liter engine paired to Ford's two-motor hybrid system, with a total overall peak power of 191 hp and a combined EPA gas-mileage rating of 41 mpg city, 46 highway—better than the Camry Hybrid's at the time, which was 34 mpg combined. The Fusion Hybrid as well as that of the Nissan Altima Hybrid, also 34 mpg (that model was discontinued). It was sold as a well equipped model, containing many of the luxury features fitted to the high-end Fusion SEL model. On the road, it was quiet, responsive, and delivered 40 mpg or better in real-world usage—leading to rave reviews for this first full hybrid U.S. sedan.</p>]

In the years since then, the Ford Taurus has offered with several advanced-tech features like adaptive cruise control and Ford's MyKey programmable access system. The Taurus SHO has also returned, with a 365-horsepower twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6, a 6-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Taurus was refreshed for 2013, and it hasn't changed much since. With restyled front and rear appearances, as well as more soft-touch surfaces and a quieter (although not very spacious) interior—as well as the introduction of the MyFord Touch interface to upper trims—the current Ford Taurus keeps its look contemporary next to the more dramatic restyle of the Ford Fusion. Ride and handling in the new Taurus have been improved, while there's even more on-board tech—including contoured seats with parking assistance, rain-sensing wipers, and other active-safety features.</p>, <p>In 2013 the Taurus received a new base turbo-4 for front-wheel-drive models. In the Taurus, the turbo-4 made 237 horsepower and delivered 31 mpg or more on the highway. The familiar 3.5-liter V-6? It now makes 290 hp, with mileage boosted by 1 mpg.</p>, <p>The Taurus received minimal changes through the 2016 and 2017 model year. For 2018, the turbo-4 engine was dropped but the Taurus lineup soldiered on unchanged otherwise.</p>, <p>A new Taurus may be in the works for 2019 or ditched altogether as shoppers continue to turn away from full-size sedans. A redesigned Taurus for China has already been revealed, fueling speculation that it may be Ford's first car built in China for U.S. buyers.</p>, <p><strong>Ford Taurus history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The first Taurus was positively groundbreaking—it truly was a different kind of American car when it bowed as a 1986 model. The look was derided by some as a "jellybean," but in context against the stuffy General Motors and Chrysler offerings, the Taurus looked fresh, and radical, and completely different than anything else available on the market.</p>, <p>A ground-breaking design and the packaging-friendly front-wheel-drive layout both helped give the Taurus an advantage over the other American offerings at the time. In short, it was a logical and attractive choice for American families. The engine offerings weren't quite as exciting or advanced at first, but that changed with the arrival of the first high-performance SHO version.</p>, <p>Ford didn’t mess with a good thing for several years (and it thankfully discontinued the tepid base inline-4), and Taurus sales boomed. A thorough 1992 update made the Taurus appear a little lower and more aerodynamic in front, and the Taurus was slightly roomier and longer.</p>, <p>In its redesign of the Taurus for 1996, Ford simply struck out. Perhaps in response to some critics who had called the 1992 redesign conservative, the automaker gave the Taurus a more radical redesign that emphasized ovals, gentle curves, and elliptical shapes inside and out, but it brought serious deficiencies like meager trunk space and tight head room in back.</p>, <p>Ford then backtracked a bit in 2000, bringing up the roofline and trunkline and making the front and rear styling of the Taurus a lot more conservative. It also backtracked on powertrains.</p>, <p>In 1989, Ford introduced its high-performance Taurus model, the SHO. The first Taurus SHO was endowed with a 3.0-liter V-6 specially built by Yamaha just for this project and offering a serious 220 hp in the relatively light car. A SHO was again offered from '96 to '99 in the new body style, featuring a 3.4-liter V-8 making 235 hp, but that version is less loved by enthusiasts. Still, it remains the only factory-available V-8 Taurus to this day.</p>, <p>Looking at 1986 all the way through 2006, most Taurus models are equipped with Ford's Vulcan V-6 engine, which delivered adequate but never remarkable performance. The 200-hp Duratec 3.0-liter was offered from the late '90s through 2005 and made the Taurus more enjoyable.</p>, <p>Ford wound down Taurus production in 2006, after introducing both the slightly smaller <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ford_fusion">Ford Fusion</a> and the larger Ford Five Hundred. Then in 2007, under the leadership of Alan Mulally, Ford renamed the roomy but conservative Five Hundred the Taurus (also renaming the related Freestyle crossover wagon the Taurus X).</p>]

[<p>The Genesis G80 may be a new name for the nascent luxury automaker, but it's not a new car. The G80, a rebadged <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/hyundai_genesis">Hyundai Genesis</a>, was one of two luxury cars launched by the new brand in 2016. The other was a full-size G90 that served as a replacement for the Hyundai Equus.</p>, <p>The G80 made waves in its first generation as a luxury car from the Korean automaker that featured many of the same conveniences and luxuries as pricey European competitors, but at a fraction of the cost.</p>, <p>With the G80, Genesis competes against luxury stalwarts such as the Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and BMW 5-Series, and others including the Cadillac CTS, Chrysler 300, and Lexus GS.</p>, <p>For 2018, Genesis added a Sport trim to the G80.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/genesis_g80_2018">2018 Genesis G80 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Genesis G80</strong></p>, <p>The G80 is a rechristened Hyundai Genesis and therefore keeps the same mid-size dimensions. The G80 rides on the same 118.5-inch wheelbase as the old Hyundai Genesis, with the same 123 cubic feet of interior volume for up to five people. Its interior dimensions may be a little more compact than some competitors, but the G80's upright styling and easy entry/exit make best use of available space.</p>, <p>The mid-sizer's styling takes cues from other luxury brands: its grille and front view has hints of Audi, its side profile strikes a distinct BMW tone. Although its inspiration is apparent, the G80 is beginning to come into its own style with a more distinct character line down the body than both luxury brands.</p>, <p>Inside, the car takes a more subtle approach to style with strong horizontal lines across the dash and a sensible layout for its controls. An 8.0-inch touchscreen for its infotainment is standard, a 9.2-inch unit is equipped in higher trims.</p>, <p>Under the hood, the G80 uses the same two engines available in the prior Genesis. A stout 3.8-liter V-6 that makes 311 horsepower and 293 pound-feet of torque is standard, a 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 420 hp and 383 lb-ft is optional. Both are teamed to an 8-speed automatic, but only the V-6 can be equipped with all-wheel drive. Top models with the V-8 include an adaptive air suspension, and all versions have well-tuned electric power steering. Hyundai even enlisted help from Lotus for chassis tuning of the new sedan for 2015.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1107318_2018-genesis-g80-sport-debuts-with-365-hp-twin-turbo-v-6">new 2018 Genesis G80 Sport</a> adopts a twin-turbo version of the V-6 engine. With output of 365 hp, it also gets adjustable shocks and uprated brakes with ventilated discs. Rear-wheel drive remains standard but buyers can opt for all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The G80 is one of few cars on the road to ace every federal and IIHS crash test. For 2017, Genesis added standard advanced safety options such as forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert, active lane control, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>Value has always been the G80's biggest selling point, as most other luxury mid-sizers start where the G80 peaks. Even with a $2,350 price hike for 2017, the G80 tops out around $55,000 for a V-8 model.</p>, <p>We've found that the budget-first approach for the G80 only shows in two areas: the finer details like interior hinges and storage lining, and fuel economy. The G80 doesn't offer any alternative or hybrid powertrains and hovers around 22 mpg combined, according to the EPA. <em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>]

[<p>The Genesis G70 is a luxury compact sedan that trades equally on value and prestige. It’s a four-door message: Genesis can run with the big boys. It goes on sale in the U.S. in summer 2018.</p>, <p>With the G70, Genesis takes on imposing luxury bigwigs like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, BMW 3-Series, and Audi A4 at the game they invented: sport luxury compact. The G70 is sized within inches of all three.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115917_2019-genesis-g70">2019 Genesis G70 preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The G70 has dashes of the sedans that preceded it in the Genesis stable—the G80 and G90—but strikes out on a more aggressive tip than those stuffed shirts. The G70’s long hood is borrowed from the related Kia Stinger, but its turned-down nose and flared intakes are the first hallmarks for the new sedan to the new brand. We expect the others to follow.</p>, <p>The G70’s body sides keep the car in constant motion even when it’s parked; gills behind the front wheel look like a leg cocked, ready to run in a new direction.</p>, <p>Under the hood, a 2.0-liter turbo-4 or 3.3-liter turbocharged V-6 provide motivation with 252 or 365 horsepower respectively. An 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters is the most likely companion for either engine, but a 6-speed manual is available for rear-drive, turbo-4 models if shoppers prefer to go the hard way.</p>, <p>Rear-wheel drive is standard on both powertrains, all-wheel drive is available. Some sportier variants can shift power through a limited-slip rear differential for better cornering and composure, but all versions get launch control for quick getaways.</p>, <p>Although the G70 borrows the powerplants and drivelines from the Kia Stinger, the Genesis sedan chops about three inches from the wheelbase and nearly six inches from the overall length compared to the Stinger. Like the rest of the Genesis lineup, the G70 is awash in leather (real or synthetic) and soft surfaces.</p>, <p>Like the G80 and G90, the G70 aims for top safety scores from federal and independent testers and includes standard active safety features such as automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors, and active lane control.</p>, <p>The G70 offers compelling features for less money than the competition but doesn’t skimp on the top-shelf stuff either. Bigger 19-inch wheels, uprated Brembo brakes, a premium audio system from Lexicon, and summer tires are all available for the G70.</p>, <p>The G70 is rated by the EPA in the low- to mid-20s for combined fuel economy. The most efficient version, a rear-drive 2.0-liter turbo-4 with an automatic transmission, has been scored at 22 mpg city, 30 highway, 25 combined by the EPA.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/genesis_g90
[<p>The Genesis G90 is the first new vehicle from Hyundai's new luxury brand. While it rides on a dedicated platform and doesn't share components with the Hyundai Equus, it essentially replaced that car.</p>, <p>With the G90, Genesis competes in the big leagues against the likes of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7-Series, Jaguar XJ, and Lexus LS, while undercutting most of them by about $10,000. If the story sounds familiar, it's largely the same path that Lexus, Acura, and Infiniti took with their flagship luxury cars a couple of decades ago.</p>, <p>The 2018 G90 lineup sees few changes this year. The 3.3T Premium now includes standard LED headlights and the 5.0 Ultimate gains a rear-seat entertainment system. Both trim levels now include a CD/DVD player tucked into the glovebox.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/genesis_g90_2018">2018 Genesis G90 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Compared to the Equus, the G90's wheelbase is 4.5 inches longer and the car is 1.8 inches longer overall. It's also an inch wider, and the extra size means it weighs about 200 pounds more comparably equipped, though a new V-6 engine saves 120 pounds.</p>, <p>That V-6 is the base engine. It's a twin-turbocharged version of the brand's V-6, here displacing 3.3 liters and making 365 horsepower and 376 pound-feet of torque; the latter is available from 1,300 to 4,500 rpm. Also offered is a 420-hp 5.0-liter V-8, which makes only 7 more pound-feet of torque than the V-6, but is less fuel efficient. The lone transmission is an 8-speed automatic, and both engines are offered with rear- or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With rear- or all-wheel drive, the V-6 is rated at 17 mpg city, 24 highway, 20 combined. The V-8's ratings are 16/24/19 mpg with rear drive and 15/23/18 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Like the Equus, five-link suspensions are found front and rear, and the shocks are electronically controlled to offer Comfort, Comfort+, and Sport modes. The steering is a rack-mounted electric assist system with variable ratios. The wheels are 19-inches and they house brakes as big as 14.8 inches in diameter up front with the V-8 engine.</p>, <p>More than just the suspension is programmable. An Intelligent Drive Mode selector offers Eco, Smart, Sport, and Individual modes to control the steering and the engine/transmission. Within the Individual settings, the powertrain has only Eco and Smart modes, while the steering offers Comfort and Sport settings.</p>, <p>Up front, the G90 features the brand's new "crest" grille, a large chrome shield that is wide at the top and tapers downward. The view from the side shows the car''s classic rear-wheel-drive stance, with a long hood, a set back cabin, a short deck, and short overhangs.</p>, <p>Inside, the G90 features a horizontal layout that accentuates its width and luxury. A large 12.3-inch screen dominates the center of the dash, and below it are ergonomically designed metal buttons to help control it as well as the climate functions. The top quality materials—leather, wood, Alcantara, and metal—come together to create an environment that you'd love in your living room.</p>, <p>Also standard on all models is an extensive list of safety features that includes forward collision warnings with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, a forward-view cornering camera, a surround-view camera system, front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warnings and lane keep assist, blind spot monitors with rear cross traffic alerts and lane change assist, driver attention alert, adaptive cruise control, adaptive headlights with automatic high beams, and nine airbags (including a driver knee bag). There are no safety options; all Genesis buyers are well protected.</p>, <p>Federal testers haven't yet rated the car, but the IIHS gave the Genesis G90 a Top Safety Pick+ award for its "Good" ratings on every test and advanced safety features.</p>]

[<p>The GMC Terrain is the brand's smallest crossover, slotted below the Acadia SUV and well below the big Yukon 'ute.</p>, <p>The mid-size Terrain crossover SUV seats five and features a useful sliding second-row seat that gives it a more flexible cargo and passenger arrangement than many other vehicles in its class. For 2018, it's new inside, outside, and underneath. </p>, <p>With the Terrain, GMC has a compact crossover to compete with rivals such as the Ford Escape, Subaru Forester, Hyundai Santa Fe—even the mechanically related Chevy Equinox.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/gmc_terrain_2018">2018 GMC Terrain review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new GMC Terrain</strong></p>, <p>The 2018 Terrain shares little with its predecessor, but it continues to be closely related to the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_equinox_2018">Chevrolet Equinox</a>. Its styling is decidedly different, however, with a much more polarizing look up front and quirky, tiny side windows that look into the cargo bay. As a result, over the shoulder visibility is particularly bad—perhaps the worst we've encountered outside of a cargo van. But the Terrain's interior is a marked improvement, if not a little ergonomically curious.</p>, <p>Under the hood, the Terrain features the same trio of turbocharged 4-cylinder engines found in the Equinox; no V-6 is on offer any longer. A 1.5-liter turbo-4 will power base, front-drive models and is paired to a 9-speed automatic transmission. It's rated at 170 horsepower and 203 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>A 2.0-liter turbo-4 comes on Terrain models with all-wheel drive or higher-spec trim levels. The bigger turbo-4 makes 252 hp and 260 lb-ft. and is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds. Like Chevrolet, GMC will pair the 2.0-liter turbo-4 to a 9-speed automatic (Chevrolet won’t offer the 9-speed with the smaller gas engine, however) and direct injection to extract every mile from its 15.6-gallon gas tank.</p>, <p>A 1.6-liter turbodiesel shared with the Equinox and Cruze makes its way to the Terrain for the first time. The frugal oil burner is mated to a <span><span>6-speed</span></span> automatic and will be available only in top trims. Unlike Chevrolet, GMC hasn’t made any claims about mileage from the <span><span>diesel</span></span> engine (Chevy says it’ll achieve 40 mpg in the Equinox) even though the Terrain’s weight should be roughly identical.</p>, <p><strong>GMC Terrain history</strong></p>, <p>New for the 2010 model year, the Terrain featured the same hewn-from-stone styling that is seen on other GMC products, with big, squared-off fender flares and an upright front end.</p>, <p>Terrains were offered with a choice of either a 4- or 6-cylinder engine, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive an option with either. Both engines feature direct injection to aid performance while reducing fuel use, and they're backed in all models by a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The Terrain's base engine was a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, the first four-pot to be used in a GMC model since the 1980s. It's rated at 182 hp and delivers claimed best-in-class (at the time) fuel economy of 21 mpg city, 32 highway. An ECO mode helps save fuel by instructing the transmission's torque converter to lock up at a lower speed—1,125 rpm—which reduces losses due to friction.</p>, <p>Through the 2012 model year, the upgrade engine in the Terrain was a 3.0-liter V-6 engine with 264 hp on tap. This particular engine was a downsized version of the 3.6-liter V-6 found in several other GM products and in the Terrain it returned fuel economy of 17 mpg city, 24 highway. For 2013, GMC replaced the smaller-displacement V-6 with the full 3.6-liter version, good for 301 hp—but with identical fuel economy ratings (with a 16 mpg city, 23 highway rating on all-wheel-drive models).</p>, <p>Standard and available features include a rearview camera, a power tailgate, Bluetooth connectivity, USB and MP3 playback, and a touchscreen audio system with satellite radio and IntelliLink, a system that links smartphones to the audio system, enabling mobile apps like Pandora.</p>, <p>The 2013 model year brought <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1076960_2013-gmc-terrain-denali-first-drive-and-video-road-test">a new Denali edition</a> that added a soft-touch dash cap, a mesh grille, and a choice of either the 4- or 6-cylinder engine, and either 18- or 19-inch wheels with those engines, respectively. The Denali also gets a leather interior, wood trim on the steering wheel, and a power passenger seat. Denali Terrains also have some exclusive safety features such as blind-spot monitors with cross-traffic alerts—while all Terrains get new dual-action shocks that soften its ride considerably. </p>, <p>The 2015 GMC Terrain added GM's newest connectivity kit—in-car 4G LTE data that enables the Terrain to create its own private wireless network—and two new colors.</p>, <p>The Terrain received its first real overall update for the 2016 model year, although it mostly deals with styling and equipment and this time leaves the mechanicals untouched. For the 2016 model year, the Terrain gets a mild facelift with restyled front and rear fascias and lighting elements, a reshaped hood, an upgraded interior, and additional equipment for some trim levels. The blind-spot and cross-traffic monitors that were previously only available on the Denali model now become optional within the other upper Terrain trims.</p>, <p>The 2017 model was largely unchanged from the 2016 version, except for a Nightfall package that included blacked-out treatments for body and wheels.</p>]

[<p>The GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV offered in two body styles. There's a long-wheelbase Yukon XL, and the standard Yukon. In either form, the Yukon is GMC's largest vehicle, and its most capable utility vehicle when it comes to towing and hauling—it should be, it's based on the GMC Sierra pickup.</p>, <p>With the Yukon, GMC has a full-size SUV to compete against the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Nissan Armada, and Infiniti QX80. Like most of those other rivals, the GMC Yukon shares its running gear with others in General Motors' portfolio, namely the Cadillac Escalade and Chevy Suburban.</p>, <p>Like GM's other full-size sport-utes, the GMC Yukon entered a new generation for the 2015 model year, its first major rework since 2007.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Yukon sees a new 10-speed automatic for the Denali and a few minor optional and standard equipment shuffles.</p>, <p><em><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/gmc_yukon_2018">2018 GMC Yukon review</a></em></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new GMC Yukon</strong></p>, <p>For its biggest change in eight years, the 2015 Yukon adopted a more squared-off body, updated powertrains, and new fold-flat rear seats. Available in two body styles as before, the current Yukon rides on two wheelbases: the standard version's wheelbase is 116 inches, while the Yukon XL's is 130 inches. The styling is still traditional, but despite the very angular look, GMC says it's much more aerodynamically favorable than the outgoing 'utes. Compared to the previous-generation Yukon, materials and design have been updated throughout the cabin, making for a  more luxurious experience, particularly in Denali-trim examples.</p>, <p>To reduce weight and improve crash safety, the new Yukon's frame uses a larger percentage of high-strength steel. The suspension still depends on leaf springs and a live axle at the rear—with a standard locking differential—but the track is wider in back now, which improves stability and handling. Like the Sierra, the Yukon moves to electric power steering. Top-spec Denali models receive standard magnetorheological adaptive shocks, which improve both ride and handling. Towing maxes out at 8,500 pounds with proper equipment.</p>, <p>Powertrains are shared with the full-size Sierra pickup as well as the other GM SUVs. The standard engine is the same 5.3-liter V-8 found in the Sierra; in the Yukon, it's rated at 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque. The upgrade engine is GM's new 6.2-liter V-8, with 420 hp and 450 lb-ft of torque—it's similar to the engine used in the Corvette Stingray. Both powerplants were teamed with a 6-speed automatic at launch, with a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive. An 8-speed automatic for the bigger V-8 came online part-way through the 2015 model year and it's likely to move to all engine combinations in future model years.</p>, <p>For 2017, the big update was the new availability of low-speed automatic emergency braking, an important safety feature. The 2018 Yukon Denali gained a new 10-speed automatic transmission, but the 6-speed stuck around for the regular Yukon.</p>, <p><strong>GMC Yukon</strong> <strong>history</strong><em><strong><em><br/></em></strong></em></p>, <p>GM introduced the first Yukon for the 1992 model year. That original model was a two-door SUV version of the company's GMT400 family of trucks and utilities. The first four-door Yukon arrived in 1995, using the same basic V-8 engine and automatic transmission. Yukons of this generation were initially offered with either rear- or four-wheel drive. Changes over the early model's lifespan included the addition of OnStar, an all-wheel-drive option, and the fancier Denali trim level.</p>, <p>For the second-generation Yukon, GM moved its big trucks and SUVs to the GMT800 architecture, introducing new engines and transmissions along with them. A 275-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 was the base engine, while a 5.3-liter V-8 good for 295 hp was also available. Underneath, most versions of this Yukon pulled their weight with either rear- or four-wheel drive; the Denali kept the on-demand all-wheel-drive system as an exclusive. This second-generation Yukon was sold through the 2006 model year, over time gaining stability control, satellite radio, and rear-seat entertainment systems.</p>, <p>In 2007 GM began replacing all its full-size trucks and SUVs with new "GMT900" vehicles, and introduced new versions of the Yukon including a new four-door model—the Yukon XL, which replaced the former long-body GMC Suburban. The Denali returned, and the name was applied to the XL editions along with accompanying luxury trim. Engines included 4.8-liter V-8, the 5.3-liter V-8, and a 6.2-liter V-8 for Denali editions with up to 403 hp. A well-regarded Hybrid model was added in the 2009 model year, but was a slow seller. A 6-speed automatic became the standard transmission on all versions save for the 4.8-liter V-8 versions, which held fast with the 4-speed automatic (with that engine and transmission discontinued after 2009), and the Hybrid, which applied a specially engineered two-mode automatic for better fuel economy.</p>, <p>In this generation, the Yukon family of SUVs had its own distinctive styling inside and out, with a vast and well-trimmed interior, and options for a third passenger seat in the front row. Fuel economy on the Hybrid versions was exceptional—as high as 20 mpg city, 23 highway—and the Denali editions were suitable Range Rover replacements for some.</p>, <p>This Yukon rolled on into 2014 essentially unchanged, although GM introduced some improvements in the later years of this generation, including trailer sway control (2012) and engine braking (2013). The Hybrid edition was dropped after the 2013 model year.</p>]

[<p>The GMC Acadia mid-size crossover enters its second generation as a smaller vehicle than it had been since its launch for the 2007 model year. It shrinks 7.2 inches in length, 6.4 inches in wheelbase, and 3.5 inches in width, and the third-row seat is no longer standard on all models. Maximum seating capacity falls from eight to seven.</p>, <p>The smaller size teams with greater use of high-strength steel and a newly available 4-cylinder engine to cut weight by up to 700 pounds.</p>, <p>With the Acadia, GMC has a popular, family-sized crossover that is better distinguished from the Buick Enclave and Chevy Traverse with which it used to share common running gear. While it is closer in size to the GMC Terrain, it is still roughly seven inches longer than that vehicle and is distinguished by the available third-row seat.</p>, <p>The new size changes the competitive set from strictly three-row crossovers to two-row and smaller three-row crossovers. Competitors include the Ford Edge, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Honda Pilot, all of which are meant to haul families.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read</em> <em dir="ltr" id="tinymce">our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/gmc_acadia_2018">2018 GMC Acadia review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Acadia</strong></p>, <p>The 2017 GMC Acadia's styling is familiar, yet new. It looks a bit like a scaled down version of the last model, though with some softer lines, upscale elements, and unique styling flourishes. The blocky look of other GMCs is downplayed here, with a sleeker windshield angle, rounder corners, and side window shapes that kick up at the rear. Metal trim around those windows, as well as the grille, adds an upscale look. Like most new vehicles these days, the Acadia also sports LED signature lighting.</p>, <p>Like the outgoing model, the new Acadia comes with front- or all-wheel drive. Both versions get a new drive mode selector with various modes for different driving conditions. A new All Terrain model has off-road potential.</p>, <p>The new base engine is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that produces 194 horsepower and 190 pound-feet of torque. Buyers can also opt for an upgraded 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 310 hp and 271 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and the 4-cylinder engine has start/stop technology. With front-wheel drive, GMC says the 2.5-liter engine will deliver 22 mpg city, 28 highway, while the 3.6-liter will get 25 mpg on the highway. GMC quotes a 4,000-pound towing capacity for the V-6.</p>, <p>Inside, five-, six-, or seven-passenger seating configurations are offered. The All Terrain can seat only five. The available split-folding second-row seat has an upgraded version of its Smart Slide feature that allows passengers to move the seat from outside the vehicle. With the second- and third-row seats folded down, the Acadia has 79 cubic feet of cargo space, which is almost 40 cubic feet shy of the outgoing model.</p>, <p>Available safety features include forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, front pedestrian braking, automatic high-beam headlights, and a surround-view camera system, GM's Safety Alert Seat, lane departure warning with active lane control, lane change alert with blind spot monitors, and front and rear parking assist. GMC says its new splayed front frame rails will contribute to improved crashworthiness, especially in small overlap front crashes.</p>, <p><strong>GMC Acadia history</strong></p>, <p>GMC introduced the Acadia for the 2007 model year. It was based on the Lambda platform that it shared with several other GM crossovers. The Acadia is notable as being the first front-drive model from GMC, as well as the brand's first unibody vehicle.</p>, <p>Throughout its run, the first-generation Acadia's powertrain consisted of a 288-hp, direct-injected 3.6-liter V-6 matched to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Most of its rivals couldn't match the Acadia's 5,200-pound towing capacity, though the same couldn't be said for fuel economy. In its most efficient front-drive form, the Acadia was rated at 17 mpg city, 24 highway.</p>, <p>The Acadia could be ordered with all-wheel drive, but since there was no four-wheel-drive low range, it really didn't provide a lot of off-road capability. Like most crossovers, it was intended to help drivers get through sloppy weather on the road, not off.</p>, <p>Inside, the 2007-2016 Acadia had a practical layout that placed it somewhere between a minivan and a GMC Yukon. It could fit either seven or eight passengers in three rows of seats. The third row was actually useful, and even when it was in use the Acadia offered 20 cubic feet of storage space behind. With all of the seats folded, the space expanded to 116 cubic feet. </p>, <p>The 2012 Acadia received two new colors and an accessory power outlet on the console, plus new blind-spot mirrors. The Denali version also added hill-hold technology and brake override of the accelerator pedal.</p>, <p>For the 2013 model year, the Acadia at last got a more extensive refresh, including a completely new three-slot grille and front-end design, new LED running lamps, new taillights, and a new rear spoiler, plus an upgraded interior with more soft-touch surfaces plus French stitching and ambient lighting. Denali models became even more luxurious, with a new power steering-column adjustment and power front passenger seat. Powertrains carried over, though GM tuned the transmission controls for smoothness.</p>, <p>Also for 2013, GMC updated the Acadia's infotainment offerings. New infotainment systems included HD Radio, satellite radio, and touchscreen center displays. GMC also fitted a new suite of active-safety options plus a standard front-center airbag system.</p>, <p>The Acadia was carried over into the 2015 model year only lightly updated and t<span>he only revision of note for 2016 was the addition of 4G LTE connectivity that turned the crossover into a mobile wi-fi hotspot.<br/></span></p>]

[<p>The GMC Sierra 1500 is a full-size pickup truck, the mechanical near-twin to the Chevy Silverado 1500.</p>, <p>With the Sierra 1500, GMC has an entrant on the half-ton pickup truck contest, but there are others. Competitors for GMC's Sierra 1500 include the Silverado, but also the Ford F-150, Ram 1500, Nissan Titan, and Toyota Tundra.</p>, <p>Three-quarter ton Sierra 2500 HD and one-ton Sierra 3500 HD are available for <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/gmc_sierra-2500hd">heavy-duty shoppers and covered separately</a>.</p>, <p>GMC unveiled the latest version of the Sierra 1500, its mainstay pickup, for the 2014 model year. The latest Sierra stands out with not only its own design elements, but with some unique features including an advanced all-wheel-drive system and the luxurious Denali trim level.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Sierra is mostly unchanged. A rearview camera is now standard and the eAssist mild-hybrid powertrain is now available nationwide.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/gmc_sierra-1500_2018">2018 GMC Sierra review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new GMC Sierra 1500</strong></p>, <p>For 2014, both the Sierra and its sibling Chevy Silverado received new powertrains, nicer cabins, weightier styling, and a raft of new infotainment and safety features.</p>, <p>Styling is refined and muscular on the new Sierra, but doesn't stray too far from previous designs, with a tall, blunt front end. The Sierra's cabin has a lovely, well-organized dash with big controls and high-quality materials, especially for a truck.</p>, <p>GM offers three engines, all with direct injection, variable valve timing, and cylinder deactivation. The base 4.3-liter V-6 performs admirably for most tasks, especially in fuel economy; the 5.3-liter V-8 makes 355 horsepower, and can handle almost any towing job up to 11,100 pounds. A 6.2-liter V-8 producing 420 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque is also available for dedicated fifth-wheeler. For 2015, GMC paired the bigger V-8 with a new 8-speed automatic, then added that transmission to higher-line versions of the 5.3-liter V-8 for 2016. The other transmission is a 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>All Sierra 1500 pickups use electric power steering, and get four-wheel disc brakes with long-life brake rotors. The ride is pretty smooth, and the available Magnetic Ride Control suspension—added for 2015—makes it even smoother. The steering is even better, with quick reflexes and just-right weight. Sierra Crew Cab models come with a choice of 5-foot-8 or 6-foot-6 beds, while regular-cab Sierra beds come in 6-foot-6 or 8-foot lengths. Extended-cab versions get only the mid-size bed; unlike in previous generations, the extended-cab model uses forward-hinged doors for better access to the second row. The rear doors can also be operated independently of the front openings, unlike with the old overlapped, rear-hinged design.</p>, <p>Safety upgrades were included in the Sierra's 2014 redesign, including forward-collision alerts and hill-start assist. For 2016, GMC made IntelliBeam headlights and Lane Keep Assist available. Crash-test scores have been very good, with the NHTSA awarding five stars overall.</p>, <p>Base Sierra equipment includes air conditioning, keyless entry, and an AM/FM radio with a 4.2-inch color display (the latter for all but the base regular cab). GMC’s IntelliLink connectivity system is optional on the Sierra; it combines full voice-command functionality with Bluetooth phone, Bluetooth audio streaming, a Pandora app, and available navigation with an 8.0-inch touchscreen. A version of IntelliLink with a new 7.0-inch touchscreen comes standard in the new Elevation Edition, a low-end model with some features most truck buyers would want. Special models are decked out with other features—off-road suspension and gear in the Sierra All-Terrain, while the Sierra Denali and the new Sierra Denali Ultimate get extra luxury touches, a standard V-8 engine, and the Magnetic Ride Control suspension.</p>, <p>Changes for the 2015 model year were few, but included the addition of an optional 4G LTE system. It can turn the Sierra into a wi-fi hotspot for mobile devices and also speeds up the connection for OnStar services like driving directions that get sent to the vehicle from a live operator as well as diagnostics.</p>, <p>For 2016, GMC has updated the front end of its Sierra. Each model gets a bolder version of its unique grille, and all models add some form of LED lighting. Base, SLE and SLT models come with projector beam headlights with LED signature lighting, while high-performance LED headlights are standard on the Denali and available on the SLT. The SLT, All-Terrain, and Denali also have LED fog lights and taillights. The Denali Ultimate adds special 22-inch chrome or black-insert wheels. A locking tailgate is also newly available, and so are power steps for the Denali models. These steps automatically move in and out and can move forward and back by kicking a button at the rearmost end of each step.</p>, <p>A mild-hybrid version that allows for some low-speed electric-only driving is also on offer.</p>, <p>Other 2016 changes included the addition of wireless charging for models with the front bucket seats, a faster processor for the infotainment system, and the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. For 2017, the Sierra's big news was the availability of a low-speed automatic emergency braking system—a rarity among pickups.</p>, <p><strong>GMC Sierra history</strong></p>, <p>The Sierra nameplate was first used in 1999, when General Motors switched the old C/K pickup trucks to a new architecture and a new body style. With slightly rounded sheet metal, the Sierra presented truck buyers with an alternative to the wildly successful Ford F-150, which had adopted aerodynamic styling in 1997. The Sierra's interior didn't change as much, though, and while it was spacious, it seemed lower-grade than the comparable Ford cabin.</p>, <p>With extended- and crew-cab versions, short- and long-bed editions, and a choice of V-6 and V-8 powertrains that mated with manual and automatic transmissions, the rear- or four-wheel-drive Sierra offered something for nearly every truck shopper. The luxury Denali edition arrived in 2002, and four-wheel steering (GMC called it Quadrasteer) became a short-lived option. In 2003, the Sierra got a mild restyling; and in 2005 a mild hybrid edition arrived, with the ability to recapture some energy and charge batteries that aided the drivetrain and powered onboard accessories.</p>, <p>For the 2007 model year, GM began rolling out its GMT900 generation of trucks and SUVs—fully redesigned models with new body styles, new powertrains, and new technology. The Sierra 1500 emerged from this renovation with a conservative but tasteful exterior, and a very attractive, very high-quality interior to match its improved drivetrains. Engines ranged from a 4.3-liter V-6 with 195 hp to a 6.2-liter V-8 with 403 hp—the latter essentially derived from the Corvette's V-8. Four- and 6-speed automatics helped increase fuel economy on most versions.</p>, <p>The real gas-mileage boost came with the introduction of the 2009 Sierra Hybrid, which teamed a V-8 with batteries and motors and a two-mode transmission for fuel economy of 21/22 mpg. It was discontinued after the 2013 model year.</p>, <p>From 2010 to 2013, the GMC Sierra saw only minor changes, with new engine braking for 2013 (in 6-speed-automatic models) one of the most significant improvements.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/gmc_canyon
[<p>The GMC Canyon is very closely related to the Chevrolet Colorado. Today, the two trucks take on the Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma. Past competition has included the Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota, and Suzuki Equator, all of which have left the market in recent years.</p>, <p>The Canyon is a mid-size pickup truck sitting below the Sierra 1500 in the brand's lineup. The Canyon was new for the 2015 model year after a two-year hiatus.</p>, <p>Positioned as an alternative to full-size pickups, which some might find too large or cumbersome, the Canyon offers 4-cylinder or V-6 power, extended- or crew-cab styles, and a wide range of trims and build combinations.</p>, <p>While the Colorado has taken a somewhat macho approach, the Canyon offers a small margin of luxury, evidenced by its more sophisticated and full-time four-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 are limited to wider availability of leather upholstery.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/gmc_canyon_2018">2018 GMC Canyon review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Overall, the GMC Canyon is more manageable and more fuel-efficient than a full-sizer, without all of the feature and cabin sacrifices that choosing a compact or mid-size truck used to involve. It is a descendant of the GMC S-15 and Sonoma pickups.</p>, <p>Both rear- and four-wheel drive variants are available, in either extended- or crew-cab styles, with a choice of a 6-foot-2 bed, or, for crew-cab models, a shorter 5-foot-2 bed. Three trim lines are offered: base, SLE, and SLT. An All-Terrain package is offered on SLE models, adding 17-inch painted aluminum wheels, all-terrain tires, and a body-color grille surround, as well as off-road-tuned suspension. If you want your small GM truck without a bed, however, you'll have to look to the Chevy Colorado's chassis-cab option.</p>, <p>Interior features and driver convenience items are definitely improved versus the last versions of the Canyon. There's now top-notch audio and smartphone connectivity, available navigation, and in top models, a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system. OnStar 4G LTE data connectivity might help those who work out of their trucks, and optional safety extras include forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning—both of which GMC claims as segment firsts. Extended Cab and Crew Cab versions both accommodate back-seat passengers, although the Extended Cab's rear quarters are better suited for gear storage than carrying people.</p>, <p>With newly engineered, body-on-frame underpinnings, payloads are impressive; V-6 models can tow up to 7,000 pounds, while 4-cylinder models can pull 3,500 pounds. The base engine in the Canyon lineup is a 2.5-liter inline-4, available with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic; the inline-4 returns fuel-economy ratings of up to 20 mpg city, 27 highway, 22 combined. Buyers can step up to a 3.6-liter V-6 engine, making 305 hp and 289 lb-ft of torque mated initially to a 6-speed automatic until 2017, when a new V-6 with cylinder displacement and an 8-speed automatic arrived. Most models offer a choice between rear- or four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, a 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel inline-4 became available in the Colorado, offering improved towing and hauling, all with fuel economy numbers better than those of the base 4-cylinder gas engine. The turbodiesel makes 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>GMC has offered several special-edition versions of the new Canyon, the first of which was the Nightfall Edition. The Nightfall package was available on SLE trims and covers the truck in Onyx Black paint, adding a special blacked-out grille, black side steps, 18-inch wheels with dark-painted pockets, a chrome exhaust tip, and some other normally optional features.</p>, <p>The 2017 models added a new V-6 and 8-speed automatic gearbox, which actually earn slightly lower fuel economy thanks in part to some changes by the EPA to its fuel economy testing procedures.</p>, <p><strong>GMC Canyon history<br/></strong></p>, <p>As the replacement for the GMC Sonoma, the GMC Canyon launched in 2004 and sold well during its first few years on the market, outpacing many rivals, including the Ranger and Frontier. The Tacoma proved more serious competition, outselling the Canyon and its Chevy Colorado twin, and making for an interesting fight in the segment. Priced from the mid-teens, the Canyon offered a lot of capability for a low price, but scored poorly in crash tests.</p>, <p>With its multitude of configurations, there was a Canyon to suit almost any truck buyer's need or want. The truck had solid mechanicals and an especially rugged four-wheel-drive system, but many found the interior to be cheaply finished with low-rent materials and a lacking design. Because of that, it was best used as a work truck, not by those who were looking for luxury or image.</p>, <p>Regular cab, extended cab, and crew cab models were all available for the Canyon, and it could be had in a range of trims, including Work Truck, SLE, and SLT, differentiated primarily on the basis of equipment and features. Crew cab models got a shortened 5-foot-1 bed in place of the standard 6-foot bed. Powertrains included a 2.9-liter 4-cylinder rated at 185 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 3.7-liter 5-cylinder good for 242 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3-liter V-8 rated for 300 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>The four-cylinder could be had with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, while the 5-cylinder and V-8 were limited to the 4-speed automatic. The V-8 was only available on crew and extended cab models. Despite the smallish engines and mid-size positioning, the Canyon had fair towing and payload capacities, good for at least 1,200 pounds payload depending on the cab selected. Towing capacities are determined by the engine selected, with the automatic 4-cylinder rated for up to 3,400 pounds gross trailer weight, while the manual maxed out at 2,400 pounds. The five-cylinder could tow up to 5,500 pounds, while the V-8 was rated at 6,000 pounds across the board.</p>, <p>A sportier version of the truck could be configured with the addition of the ZQ8 sport suspension, available on two-wheel-drive extended and crew cab models with either the V-8 or 4-cylinder engines.</p>, <p>For its final year, 2012, the former GMC Canyon added standard Bluetooth connectivity, among other minor changes and trim adjustments.</p>, <p>The previous generation of the GMC Canyon was assembled in Louisiana, while production of the new-generation Canyon has moved to a plant in Missouri.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/gmc_sierra-2500hd
[<p>The GMC Sierra 2500HD is a full-size, heavy-duty pickup that's mechanically related to the Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD. Like the Silverado, the Sierra is available in three-quarter ton (2500HD) and one-ton (3500HD) configurations.</p>, <p>Where the Chevy Silverado heavy-duty range may skew toward work and fleet buyers, the GMC Sierra range is more often the luxurious pick between the two. The GMC Sierra Denali HD is a frequent sight on roadways and interstates, and offers a heady mix of capability and luxury features that many buyers are willing to swallow a large price tag for.</p>, <p>The latest Sierra heavy-duty range made its debut in 2014, alongside light-duty Sierra 1500 models. Those models were updated slightly in 2017 with a new optional turbodiesel engine and some styling changes.</p>, <p>With the Sierra HD, GMC has rivals for the Ford Super Duty range and the Ram heavy-duty lineup.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1112759_2018-gmc-sierra-2500hd">review of the 2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new GMC Sierra HD</strong></p>, <p>The newest GMC Sierra HD arrived in the U.S. in 2015, following an all new Sierra 1500 for 2014. While powertrains, frames, and suspension heavy-lifting had slowly made its way into the Sierra 2500HD before then, the truck was transformed when it adopted the interior from the light-duty range.</p>, <p>The GMC Sierra HD is offered with a choice between two V-8s that are powered by gas or diesel fuel. The former is a 6.0-liter V-8 that makes 360 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. Like other gas engines in its class, the 6.0-liter V-8 is the champ for payload capacity—more than 3,500 pounds in some configurations.</p>, <p>The optional 6.6-liter turbodiesel V-8 was updated in 2017 to make up to 910 lb-ft of torque and 445 hp. That kind of power makes it ideal for towing big trailers long distances, and when equipped with that engine in some configurations, the GMC Sierra 2500HD can drag more than 18,000 pounds.</p>, <p>Both engines are paired to a 6-speed automatic, with rear-wheel drive as standard or optional four-wheel drive. GMC offered the heavy trucks in regular, extended, or crew cab configurations, with an 8-foot or 6-foot-6 bed in back.</p>, <p>Those underpinnings are shared with the Chevrolet Silverado HD, although the two truckmakers begin to diverge in interior luxury and refinements.</p>, <p>The GMC Sierra 2500 Denali HD is a best-seller for the truckmaker thanks to its high level of features and quality interiors. Leather upholstery is standard, and GMC fits an 8.0-inch touchscreen inside for infotainment and navigation. The Sierra Denali HD has an especially hushed interior, and in four-door configurations, offers plenty of room for four adults on long hauls.</p>, <p>Like other luxury trucks (and cars) the Sierra Denali HD's price tag starts well north of $70,000, but its popularity and growing list of interior refinements may be an indicator of how far truckbuyers have come—and how far they're willing to go in the future.</p>, <p><strong>GMC Sierra HD history</strong></p>, <p>The GMC Sierra HD history is understandably linked to the Chevrolet Silverado HD range from which it's based.</p>, <p>GMC's heavy duty range goes back to the 1960s, when the truckmaker offered three-quarter and one-ton versions of their pickups, badged 1500 and 2500 with "K" denoting newly available four-wheel drive. Most of those heavy-duty trucks were powered by inline-6 engines, although a V-8 was made available toward the end of that generation.</p>, <p>The late-1960s and early-1970s marked a new generation for the big pickups, which were still reserved for commercial- or work-focused users. The "Sierra" name denoted a trim level on heavy-duty trucks, which applied to top trims for GMC. The truckmaker also shifted its naming convention to 2500 and 3500 for three-quarter and one-ton trucks, which endures today.</p>, <p>Those trucks were followed by a long-running series of pickups called the "square body" generation, powered predominately by V-8 gasoline engines, although a V-8 diesel engine was newly available. GMC updated its designs, inside and out, until the pickups were eventually retired in the late-1980s.</p>, <p>GMC Sierra's popularity soared in the 1990s with its GMT400-based pickups that, among other things, added an independent front suspension for smoother rides. Although double cabs were available before the fourth-generation pickup, the Sierra's four-door version took off with consumers looking for a comfortable ride for a crew.</p>, <p>The K-named trucks were retired after that generation when GMC made the switch to the Sierra name for the entire range in 1998.</p>, <p>GMC found paydirt in 2002 when it changed the name of its top-trimmed Sierra C3 to "Sierra Denali." The next generation of GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups traded on that success with increasing number of comfort features including the discontinuation of manual-equipped heavy-duty pickups.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/honda_accord-sdn
[<p>The Honda Accord mid-size sedan is an icon. It's been in the U.S. for decades and sold hundreds of thousands of examples. It's the go-to, hand-me-down car for millions of people.</p>, <p>With the Accord, Honda has evolved its family four-door in size and shape over the years, but its long-running qualities of space, efficiency, and safety have endured. It was our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1113752_honda-accord-the-car-connections-best-car-to-buy-2018">Best Car to Buy 2018.</a></p>, <p>A new Accord arrives for 2018, eschewing last year's naturally aspirated engines in favor of a pair of turbo-4s. The slow-selling Accord Coupe bites the dust, but enthusiasts can take note that both engines are available with manual transmissions. An Accord Hybrid is also on offer, but it's <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/honda_accord-hybrid">covered elsewhere</a>.</p>, <p>Key rival models include the Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Mazda 6, Kia Optima, Hyundai Sonata, Ford Fusion, and Nissan Altima.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_accord-sdn_2018">2018 Honda Accord review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Honda Accord</strong></p>, <p>Marking the Accord's 10th anniversary, the all-new 2018 shares little with its predecessors. It's more dramatic looking with a fastback-like shape. It looks larger, but it's not. The Accord is a little shorter than before. But a longer wheelbase provides a couple of inches more leg room in the rear and helps the trunk's volume increase by nearly a cubic foot over the outgoing model.</p>, <p>A 1.5-liter turbo-4 mates either to a CVT or, in Sport trim levels, a 6-speed manual. It's rated at at 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. Optional on most trim levels is a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that replaces the outgoing V-6. At 252 hp and 273 lb-ft, it offers more torque but less horsepower. The bigger engine is related to that used in the Honda Civic Type R and, like that hot hatch, it's available with a 6-speed manual on the Accord Sport. Most models will undoubtedly be fitted with a 10-speed automatic, however.</p>, <p>As before, all Accords are front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Honda has made its Honda Sensing suite of safety features—automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind spot monitors—standard on every version of the Accord for 2018.</p>, <p><strong>Honda Accord history</strong></p>, <p>The Accord family has, over the past four decades, included coupes, sedans, hatchbacks and wagons—many of which were markedly more compact.</p>, <p>The Accord has been a longtime U.S. best-seller. Most U.S. versions have been assembled in Ohio since the early 1980s.</p>, <p>In general, Accords have always been a little sportier-feeling to drive than the Camry or most other mid-size sedans, even if their engines haven't been any more powerful. Accord interiors have also typically been a highlight for their simplicity and nice, tactile controls. Even through the late 1990s and the past decade, Accords with a 4-cylinder engine were satisfying and refined—unlike some of the base fours in rival models.</p>, <p>Even though the Accord has been redesigned at regular intervals, its overall shape has clearly evolved. Third-generation (1986 through 1989) Accord models had hidden, flip-up headlights and a very advanced, sophisticated appearance for their time, and they're likely to be the oldest used Accords typically available. From the 1990 model year on, the Accord broke free from its equivalent model in Japan and became significantly larger in the U.S. to address American expectations. Since then the Accord has been redesigned several more times, with the 4-cylinder growing slightly, to 2.4 liters, and a V-6 joining the lineup beginning in 1995—which eventually grew to 3.0 liters.</p>, <p>Through the mid-1990s a wagon version of the Accord was offered, but it was eventually discontinued due to slow sales.</p>, <p>Honda offered the first Accord Hybrid model from 2005 through 2007. It was a somewhat unconventional approach, which used a 3.0-liter V-6 paired with the company's mild-hybrid system instead of a more modest 4-cylinder. As a result, it offered sprightly performance—60 mph arrived in just 6.7 seconds. Real-world fuel mileage wasn't great, however, and it was only slightly better than the non-hybrid, V-6 Accord model. That hybrid didn't win many fans, which explains its short lifetime and the new approach Honda has taken with the latest gas-electric Accords.</p>, <p>The Accord grew slightly for 2008, becoming more detailed inside and out at that time and really setting a bold look. This generation of Accord offered 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engines, making 177 or 190 hp, or a 3.5-liter V-6 making 271 hp, plus a long feature list and excellent safety ratings. An Accord Coupe received the same engines and features as the sedan, but with its own distinctive roofline and styling cues—especially in back.</p>, <p>For 2010, Honda introduced the Accord Crosstour, a five-door, tall-hatchback version of the Accord with a slightly higher seating level than the sedan. It was initially only offered with a V-6, but later received a 4-cylinder option. Widely considered a flop, the Crosstour was a slow seller, with more heft (up to 650 pounds more than the sedan), poor gas mileage, and unimpressive safety ratings. It was discontinued after the 2015 model year.</p>, <p>There were few other changes with this previous generation, but for 2012 Honda upgraded the navigation system, with a big 8.0-inch screen plus Zagat ratings, improved voice recognition, and a rearview camera system, and made at the same time a USB port standard across the lineup.</p>, <p>The Accord was completely redesigned for model year 2013, in four-door sedan and two-door coupe models. While the appearance of the current model is evolutionary, Honda introduced it with new powertrains that made substantial gains in efficiency. </p>, <p>Those Accord 4-cylinder engine featured direct injection and made 185 horsepower (or 189 hp in Sport models). It was paired with a 6-speed manual or an automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some drivers may confuse this CVT, with its superbly linear feel, with a regular automatic transmission. The Accord offered a V-6 engine for many years that could be coupled to a a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual in coupes. Both engines used regular unleaded gasoline. EPA ratings with the 4-cylinder and CVT are 27 mpg city, 37 highway; with the V-6 you'll get up to 21/34 mpg.</p>, <p>Back-seat room and trunk space were improved too and the Accord was more refined with active noise cancellation on all models. That generation gave up the old double-wishbone front-suspension layout in favor of struts.</p>, <p>A Honda Accord Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid were available in 2014 and 2015, but briefly shelved for 2016. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/honda_accord-hybrid">Honda Accord Hybrid and the Accord Plug-In Hybrid</a> sported a 137-hp, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that ran on the ultra-efficient Atkinson cycle, combined with lithium-ion batteries and two electric motors. With its larger battery pack, the Honda Accord Plug-In Hybrid could go 13 miles on electric power alone, according to the EPA, with a 124-kw electric motor system working together with the 4-cylinder engine. The Accord Hybrid was rated at 50 mpg city, 45 highway, 47 combined.</p>, <p>For 2017, a new Accord Sport Special Edition sedan added even more choices to the lineup. The Sport Special Edition was outfitted with leather seats and featured red stitching for a modest $1,000 over the standard Accord Sport.

[<p>The Honda CR-V is a compact crossover SUV that seats up to five people and is one of Honda's best-selling vehicles.</p>, <p>With the latest CR-V, Honda redesigned what already was one of the best vehicles of its kind. The CR-V has grown marginally outside, but the interior provides more space, and the naturally aspirated and turbo-4 turn in better fuel economy, too. Safety upgrades bring automatic emergency braking to nearly every model, too. After a redesign for the 2017 model year, the CR-V rolls into 2018 with no changes.</p>, <p>The CR-V's underpinnings are adapted from today's Honda Civic. With good fuel economy and reliability, the CR-V is a formidable rival for vehicles such as the Ford Escape, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, and Chevy Equinox.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_cr-v_2018" title="2018 Honda CR-V">2018 Honda CR-V review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><span>For 2017, the CR-V was new but its recipe didn't change a bit. It is a compact crossover with surprisingly good room for five. Base LX models essentially carry over the previous generation's 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, but all other trim grades (which Honda says should represent about 75 percent of the model's sales) utilize a turbocharged 1.5-liter 4-cylinder plucked from the Civic range. In the CR-V, it's rated at 190 horsepower and 179 pound-feet of torque, meaning it is slightly peppier than the engines that power base versions of most rival motors. </span></p>, <p><span>Both engines are mated exclusively to continuously variable transmissions (CVT) and they offer a choice between front- and all-wheel drive. The turbo motor shaves about a second and a half from the non-turbo's 0-60 mph sprint, but it feels brighter on the road. </span></p>, <p><span>Although the engine bay represents one of the CR-V's biggest changes, its expanded interior capacity shouldn't be forgotten. Honda only stretched the new model a little overall, but it feels much roomier inside. Of particular note is its cargo area, which now stretches 5 feet long with the second row folded. Likewise, the model's dashboard is more conveniently arrayed than before. We're especially happy that all models once again boast a volume knob instead of a silly and difficult-to-use slider knob. </span></p>, <p><span>The latest CR-V looks somewhat different from the model it replaced, especially in the rear hatch. Its interior style prefers softer, rounded shapes that blend into the background during commutes.<br/></span></p>, <p><span>On the safety front, all but the base CR-V LX include the brand's Honda Sensing collision avoidance tech—adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane departure warning. </span></p>, <p><strong>Honda CR-V history</strong></p>, <p>During its prior generations, the CR-V evolved from a softer—but still very basic—alternative to truckier vehicles like the Suzuki Sidekick and Jeep Wrangler into more of a family-oriented people-mover. It has seen great success with that transition, helping to kick-start the small crossover segment that continues to grow.</p>, <p>The first CR-V (1997–2001) was like other early crossovers; a more plain-looking vehicle that bore a strong resemblance to the old Honda Wagovan. It was equipped with a 4-cylinder engine then, like it has now. The CR-V quickly earned a following for its great visibility and durability, if not necessarily for its visual appeal.</p>, <p>The second-generation CR-V, sold from 2002, was a significant improvement in nearly every way—much more refined, responsive, and comfortable. These models all have a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, making about 160 hp, with most of them hooked up to a 4- or 5-speed automatic transmission (a 5-speed manual was also offered).</p>, <p>Safety has generally been a selling point for the CR-V. In a mid-cycle refresh for 2005, Honda increased the CR-V's safety content, making side airbags and anti-lock brakes standard across the line, which improved that model's IIHS side-impact results from a mediocre "Marginal" to the top "Good" result. The CR-V's scores in federal government crash tests generally have been good.</p>, <p>For 2007, Honda completely redesigned the CR-V again, with that generation quite a bit more passenger-focused than the previous generation. That redesign gave it an interior feel that was more like that of a tall wagon or—gasp—a minivan. One odd attribute of the first- and second-generation CR-V models is the externally mounted spare wheel and tire; for the 2007 redesign, Honda finally relocated the spare from its perch on the hatch. In the same generation, the interior design became more advanced and well-appointed.</p>, <p>The changes made to create the fourth-generation CR-V for the 2012 model year were more evolutionary than with previous generations, at least on the outside. Inside it feels a bit different, with upgraded materials and trims, along with an instrument panel that's in line with the latest Odyssey van's, and an even better rear-seat mechanism that allows you to fold the seats neatly forward with one hand—without the need for power systems.</p>, <p>The engine was carried over initially, but the 5-speed automatic offered in 2012–2014 models received taller ratios, helping the model achieve better gas-mileage ratings, according to the EPA. Overall, the driving experience is nothing to get excited about, and while the CR-V rides well and is reasonably responsive, the new electric power steering system here fails to give the crisp, confident-handling feel the model had in the last generation.</p>, <p>Honda has updated the CR-V's connectivity in the most-current generation. Bluetooth hands-free connectivity and Bluetooth streaming audio are at least standard across the entire model line, Pandora streaming is integrated with the system (if you have the right smartphone), and a new multi-information display can show personal pictures as well as the feed from a new rearview camera system.</p>, <p>The CR-V received an extensive upgrade for 2015. Styling was tweaked, and there was a new 4-cylinder engine mated to a CVT borrowed from the Accord that replaced the 5-speed automatic. The result was improved fuel economy and slightly better acceleration. The front end featured a much more modern, upscale look, while the rest of the exterior received some other small touches. Honda also gave the interior a once-over, improving materials and modifying the layout slightly. </p>]

[<p>The Honda Clarity is a mid-size sedan available in with a choice among three powertrains: all-electric, hydrogen fuel cell (only available in very limited areas of California), and a more popular plug-in hybrid with a battery and engine.</p>, <p>The Fuel Cell version is the follow-up to the first-generation Honda FCX Clarity leased to a few California drivers from 2008 through 2014. Only about 60 first-generation Clarity cars were leased—they couldn't be bought outright—and each was rumored to have cost Honda well into the six figures. The Clarity Electric is the successor to the 1,100 Honda Fit EV electric hatchbacks leased from 2012 through 2014, many of them still on the road.</p>, <p>It's a mid-size sedan, rather than a compact hatchback like the Chevrolet Volt or Toyota Prius Prime.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_fcx-clarity_2018" title="2018 Honda Clarity - review">2018 Honda Clarity review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Both the fuel-cell and battery-electric versions of the Clarity are very limited in volume, and will be offered only in California. Their volume will likely be just a few hundred a year for each, no more than a rounding error for Honda's popular Civic, Accord, and CR-V models, each selling more than 300,000 a year. The Clarity Plug-In Hybrid will be sold in all 50 states and could reach 20,000 a year or higher, Honda says.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Clarity Plug-In Hybrid will join the crowd, and likely will be the best seller among the three. It has an EPA-rated electric range of 47 miles, far higher than the Prius Prime's 25 miles and close to the smaller Chevy Volt's 53 miles.</p>, <p>The Clarity's design is futuristic and has more ornamentation, vents, trim and accent lines than the two iterations of the concept car that previewed it. The chrome bar that underlines the grille opening and sweeps over the thin, swept-back LED headlights is a recognizable Honda design element. The flat top of the rear wheel arch, angled slightly forward, may be the most dissonant stylistic element. Overall, it has a slightly bulbous, heavy-hipped look.</p>, <p><strong>Striking look, premium interior</strong></p>, <p>Every Clarity Fuel Cell has a glossy black roof with a chrome arc along the pillars and roof edge that delineates it from the lower-body color. It's a striking look, and most eyes would agree that the longer, sleeker Clarity is better-looking than the homely Toyota Mirai, the other dedicated fuel-cell vehicle on the market. The electric and plug-in hybrid Clarity have body-color roof panels. The Clarity's interior is relatively conventional, with a luxurious feel and materials, and very few of the Mirai's unusual controls or hard plastics.</p>, <p dir="ltr">The Clarity Plug-In Hybrid is powered by a specially tuned 1.5-liter inline-4 engine paired with the latest generation of Honda’s two-motor hybrid system, which supplants a conventional transmission. The drive motor, rated at a substantial 146 kilowatts (181 horsepower), produces 232 pound-feet of torque and can power the car itself in many cases, especially in low-speed use. Its 17.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack sits under the front and rear seats and the rear-seat floorboards. We found its performance to be sufficiently strong in electric mode for all but a few types of mixed-use driving.</p>, <p>In the low-volume Clarity Fuel Cell version, the motor that powers the front wheels produces 130 kw (174 hp) and 221 lb-ft of torque. Honda estimates acceleration from 0 to 60 mph at roughly nine seconds, which we confirmed in some informal on-road testing during a test drive. Like hybrids and electric cars, it uses regenerative braking to recharge a small battery pack, but that's used only to boost acceleration temporarily—it doesn't power the car for any meaningful distance. The new Clarity's 5.5 kilograms of hydrogen-storage capacity—at 10,000 psi—give it an EPA range rating of 366 miles, though like an electric car, aggressive driving style can cut the estimated range substantially. (Our Clarity Fuel Cell never showed more than 250 miles.) The Mirai, by comparison, is rated at 312 miles. Honda is particularly proud that its fuel-cell stack and all associated electronics fit under the hood in the same volume as a V-6 engine and transmission combination.</p>, <p>Finally, the Clarity Electric features a 25.5-kwh lithium-ion battery that has a projected range of 89 miles. With virtually every smaller electric car now rated at 107 to 125 miles, and a Chevy Bolt EV at 238 miles, the battery-electric Clarity is thus at a major disadvantage. Buyers will have to place a high value on the comfort and size of a mid-size sedan over a compact hatchback to make up for its range disadvantage, though the price is expected to be in line with those vehicles at roughly $35,000.</p>, <p><strong>Fuel Cell, Electric for California only</strong></p>, <p>Honda leases the Clarity Fuel Cell only to households in carefully chosen areas of Northern and Southern California that lie within range of small, but growing number of hydrogen fueling stations. But as zero-emission vehicle options, both Clarity versions are likely to be swamped in volume by total sales of more than a dozen battery-electric vehicles now on the market, including the Tesla Model S and Model X, and a host of shorter-range electric cars as well. The three-year lease on the Fuel Cell costs $369 a month, and comes with 20,000 miles a year and $15,000 of free hydrogen fuel—a major plus when a 60-mile refill with hydrogen cost us $16. Honda hasn't yet released pricing or lease details on the Clarity Electric.</p>, <p>For buyers uninterested in electric cars, or incapable of plugging in—and who are also lucky enough to live near a hydrogen fueling site—the Honda Clarity Fuel Cell offers a way to drive with zero tailpipe emissions aside from water. Its primary rival is the Toyota Mirai sedan, although Hyundai also leases a Tucson Fuel Cell model in even smaller numbers. The Clarity Electric will compete with close to a dozen battery-electric cars available in California, with longer ranges but in smaller packages. A similarly sized Tesla Model S, on the other hand, has almost three times the electric Clarity's range—but for twice the price.</p>, <p>But it's the Clarity Plug-In Hybrid, new for 2018, that's the important model. It provides the first viable, affordable competitor to the seven-year reign of the compact hatchback Chevrolet Volt as the most appealing plug-in hybrid on the market.</p>]

[<p>The Honda Pilot is a mid-size crossover that can seat up to eight people and hold plenty of gear.</p>, <p>With the Pilot, Honda has a family SUV that shares some of its skeleton with the Honda Ridgeline pickup truck, Odyssey minivan, and more distantly, the Acura MDX luxury SUV.</p>, <p>When it was introduced in 2003, the Pilot was originally marketed as a more car-like alternative to the mid-size utility vehicles that were based on trucks.</p>, <p>Completely revamped for the 2016 model year, the latest Pilot dropped its box-like styling for a softer crossover shape. It is a mid-size SUV that drives with the comfort and predictability of a family-friendly wagon—with or without optional all-wheel drive. The 2016 Honda Pilot was named <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/bestcartobuy"><em>The Car Connection's</em> Best Car To Buy 2016</a>.</p>, <p>Its competitors—think Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Toyota Highlander, and others—are almost all based on car platforms.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_pilot_2018">2018 Honda Pilot review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Pilot</strong></p>, <p>With the latest generation of the Pilot, Honda redesigned the vehicle entirely. It's still built from bits and pieces that also show up in the Acura MDX and the Honda Odyssey, but the fresh styling has more in common with the best-selling CR-V crossover SUV.</p>, <p>In this generation, the Pilot's powertrain got a boost. The new 3.5-liter V-6 is backed up a 6-speed automatic on base models and a 9-speed automatic on upper trims. The available all-wheel-drive system also has been redesigned, and the new model offers engine stop-start feature and standard cylinder deactivation.</p>, <p>The Pilot can now seat up to eight passengers, with a split second-row seat that can expand for better comfort, or move to create more space for passengers to access the third-row seat—a third-row which can seat adults, which is a rarity in the class.</p>, <p>The new Pilot borrows just about every active-safety feature from the Honda/Acura stable, including a new road-departure mitigation system. It's also much more focused on creature comforts and less intent on looking like a truck, which should work well in today's evolved crossover market.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Pilot's sole substantial change is the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The SUV carried over unchanged into the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><strong>Honda Pilot history</strong></p>, <p>That first Pilot offered good acceleration from a torquey 3.5-liter V-6 (making 240 to 255 horsepower), along with a smooth ride, respectable handling, and top-of-the-line safety ratings—including a roster of safety features (standard side and side-curtain bags and stability control) that was ahead of its time. A front-wheel-drive model was introduced in 2006 when the Pilot received a mild refresh.</p>, <p>The second-generation Pilot, introduced for 2009, didn't quite appeal in the same way aesthetically as did the first-generation model. Its exterior seemed an attempt to look more macho and rugged—against the grain as more utility models were becoming smoother and sleeker.</p>, <p>That boxy exterior paid off inside, however. The Pilot may have been the best family option for buyers who need the abilities of a minivan, but didn't want to be seen in one. The overtly boxy exterior of the Pilot yielded an interior that was chunky and utilitarian in design—which is to say not very attractive—but offered most of the appointments of a minivan.</p>, <p>The second-generation Pilot fit up to eight passengers in its three rows. It offered a variety of trays, cubbies, and bins for small items throughout the cabin. Its instrument-panel design appeared a bit cluttered, and the materials were harder than most other vehicles in this class, giving it a somewhat cheap feel.</p>, <p>Original Pilots had very cramped third-row seating, something Honda noticed and was able to fix for the current model. Tall passengers are much more comfortable back there, and this is now one of the more accommodating third rows as far as full-size adults go. The seats can fold flat when not in use to expand cargo room.</p>, <p>For the 2012 model year, Honda improved the efficiency of the drivetrain slightly and made some cosmetic changes to the front end and interior. A rearview camera system—still much-needed for some Pilot drivers—was made standard for 2013.</p>, <p>Unlike most Honda products, handling isn't at the top of the Pilot's to-do list. The suspension is soft and the tires have tall sidewalls, leading to a safe and comfortable ride. The current generation Pilot has been fitted with a more-potent 3.5-liter V-6—up from 250 to 280 hp for this year. The Pilot has also added more cogs to its automatic transmission—a 6-speed automatic in lower trims, or a 9-speed in higher ranges.</p>, <p>The Pilot remains one of the safest vehicles in any class, with top crash-test results from both the federal government and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in frontal and side tests. The  high seating position and boxy proportions afford a better outward view compared to many other curvier modern crossover designs. Honda has recently announced a series of recalls, affecting the Pilot going many years back, for <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081879_honda-recalls-748000-pilot-suvs-odyssey-minivans-for-airbag-defect">airbag</a>, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081111_honda-recalls-807000-minivans-suvs-in-u-s-for-rollaway-problem">parking brake</a>, and <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1073328_2012-honda-pilot-acura-mdx-recalled-for-possible-fuel-leak">fuel system</a> issues.</p>]

[<p>The Honda Civic compact sedan, hatchback, and coupe is one of the best-selling, most widely recognized car lines in the world. Across nearly a dozen generations, the Civic has come in many shapes, sizes, and models.</p>, <p>With the Civic, Honda has built an enviable reputation for durability and longevity. The Civic has another ace up its sleeve, too: efficiency. Over time, the Civic family has included natural-gas-powered and hybrid gas-electric models. Even the standard gas-powered models earn high fuel economy without much effort on the part of the driver, making them excellent choices for commuters.</p>, <p>A size larger than the Fit hatchback, the Honda Civic slots in beneath the Honda Accord in the company's lineup. With the Civic, Honda has a rivals for cars such as the Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sentra, Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze, and Hyundai Elantra, among others.</p>, <p>After a flurry of new hatchbacks and performance models added in 2017, the Honda Civic was largely identical for 2018.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_civic-sdn_2018">2018 Honda Civic review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Honda Civic</strong></p>, <p>The 2016 model year ushered in a new Civic, with a slew of new body styles and features, including the first turbocharged engine sold by Honda in America.</p>, <p>The Honda Civic has been on sale in the U.S. for five decades, and it's now in its 10th generation. Over the years, the Civic has represented efficient transportation for small families or commuters, mostly at affordable prices.</p>, <p>The Civic sedan was the first of the new generation to arrive, eventually joined by a hatchback and a coupe. It's the best-looking car Honda has drawn in a decade, with a beautifully edgy fastback shape that hides the gains in size very well. The cabin's a bit more tame, but well organized, with a broad horizontal theme that wouldn't look out of place in a BMW.</p>, <p>Honda offers two new engines in the new Civic. The base four-cylinder is a 2.0-liter engine, with 158 horsepower, coupled to either a 6-speed manual or an automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT). With either transmission, this Civic delivers even-handed, if unremarkable, power, but excellent fuel economy of up to 35 miles per gallon on the combined cycle, according to the EPA. For more lively performance, the turbo 1.5-liter inline-4 is an obvious upgrade to take: it gets the same fuel economy ratings as the CVT-equipped base inline-4, but acceleration is quick enough to merit a sportier, Si badge. What really sets the new Civic apart from its past is excellent ride and handling, thanks to a trick steering setup and hydraulic suspension mounts; it's so composed and compliant, it feels like a much more capable and expensive car.</p>, <p>The new Civic is much bigger than before, up to 3 inches longer and nearly 2 inches wider. Interior space and comfort have improved by a big margin, with a low driving position, excellent bucket seats, and very good rear-seat space that serve as its hallmarks. The feds haven't yet crash-tested the Civic, but the IIHS gave the car glowing marks: top, "Good" ratings for every crash test and a "Superior" front crash prevention result (when equipped with applicable options). Prices range from about $20,000 to just above $27,000.</p>, <p>The 2016 Honda Civic sedan was named the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1101818_2016-north-american-car-and-truck-of-the-year-awards-go-to-honda-civic-and-volvo-xc90">North American Car of the Year</a>.</p>, <p>A <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1100910_2016-honda-civic-coupe-video-preview">new Civic Coupe</a> arrived as a 2016 model and a new hatchback was introduced in the fall. The hatchback model is available only with the turbo-4 and is the first shot before Honda brings over its ultra-hot Type R hatchback in 2017. It was <em>Motor Authority's</em> <a href="https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1113609_motor-authority-best-car-to-buy-2018-how-we-arrived-at-the-winner">Best Car to Buy 2018</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Honda Civic history</strong></p>, <p>The Civic first came to the U.S. in the early 1970s. While in non-Rust Belt states there are no doubt many running examples of Honda Civic models dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, the 1990s-era Civics are currently the most common older Civic models still widely in circulation. These Civics mostly have 1.5- and 1.6-liter engines of various outputs; Honda's VTEC system was phased into the Civic's engine line in 1992 and allowed the model to be both faster and more fuel-efficient than many other small cars of that era. The Civic was also one of the few inexpensive small cars to have an independent rear suspension, giving it ride and handling traits that easily beat the norm.</p>, <p>The Civic that was sold from 2001 through 2005 was only sold as a rather drab sedan in the U.S.—except for the sporty Si model—but what it lacked for style it made up in all-around performance, with good fuel economy as well, and a roomy interior. Some enthusiasts weren't thrilled with the change to a strut front suspension. This generation marked the debut of a Civic Hybrid model, borrowing the Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system that had made its debut in the earlier Insight coupe.</p>, <p>With radically different, aerodynamically optimized exterior styling and a completely reimagined twin-level instrument-panel design, the Civic that was offered from 2006 to 2011 came in sleek coupe or sedan variants, with a 140-horsepower, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine on most (DX, LX, EX, and EX-L models). The Civic Hybrid model returned, with a CVT transmission and 110-hp mild-hybrid system good for an EPA 40 mpg city, 45 highway, and a natural-gas-fueled GX model was also on offer. This time around, the Civic Si model had an excellent 197-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-4 and 6-speed manual—other versions had a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic. Again, the Civic was praised for its fuel economy and peppy driving feel with nearly any of its variants, but backseat head room was limited because of the sloping roofline.</p>, <p>While many think of the Civic as solely a basic, no-frills vehicle, in that 2006-2011 generation the top-of-the-line Civic EX models grew even more luxurious, with leather upholstery, heated seats, and even a navigation system.</p>, <p>The Civic was redesigned for the 2012 model year, but in a rare error of judgment, Honda's designers erred too far on the side of austerity, using grim, cheap, hard plastics for the interior and stinting on things such as sound insulation. While the 2012 Civic sold fine, reviewers savaged the car as not up to Honda's usual standards. Just 16 months later, the 2013 models arrived with new front and rear styling, and a redesigned and more upscale interior. We <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1082230_2013-honda-civic-ex-driven">drove the improved 2013 Civic</a> and indeed found it to be better in many respects.</p>, <p>More than a typical mid-cycle refresh, the 2013 Honda Civic received a somewhat different look modeled after the new Accord, plus an expanded feature set, including standard Bluetooth, text-message functionality, Pandora integration, and a rearview camera—all standard—while optional navigation systems were upgraded with subscription-free, FM-based traffic info. Most importantly, the cabin was given new materials, as well as extra noise insulation. Civic Hybrids also received new standard active safety, with forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems.</p>, <p>There were some significant updates for 2014. The Civic coupe's front end was completely redesigned to be more aggressive and in line with the latest Accord two-door. The automatic transmission was replaced with a CVT, which improved fuel economy, while redesigned exhaust systems on most models bumped up horsepower and torque figures. There were also feature and technology updates, chief among them a new 7.0-inch touchscreen radio.</p>, <p>This Civic lineup was as wide-ranging as it had ever been, offering a variant for almost any compact-car shopper. Base models used a simple 4-cylinder gas engine, while the hot Si coupe and sedan offered sportier handling and more power with equally tuned looks. Enviro-conscious shoppers could opt for the Civic Hybrid sedan, which hit 45 mpg combined using its single-motor IMA hybrid system. There also was a Natural Gas model, which was fueled by compressed fuel stored in an in-trunk tank.</p>]

[<p>The Honda HR-V compact crossover SUV trades on its low price, efficiency, and flexible interior.</p>, <p>With the HR-V, Honda starts its crossover walk, below the mid-size CR-V and the big three-row Pilot—all new since the 2016 model year.</p>, <p>As it was new in the 2016 model year, not much has changed with the HR-V in the two years it has been on sale aside from a handful of new colors.</p>, <p>The HR-V is based on the mechanicals of the handy Honda Fit hatchback, and Honda builds it along with the Fit in Mexico. The HR-V competes with several other new crossover SUVs, including the Mazda CX-3, Chevy Trax, Fiat 500X, and Jeep Renegade.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_hr-v_2018">2018 Honda HR-V review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Honda HR-V</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>All-wheel drive is optional in the HR-V, which is standard equipment for even the smallest crossovers these days—even though most won't need it. The HR-V name has been used by Honda before, but this is the first time it's been used in the U.S.</p>, <p>Although based on Honda's space-age-looking Fit hatchback, the HR-V doesn't share that car's styling ethos. Instead, the HR-V is a more rounded interpretation of the current CR-V, with some very obvious Mazda-inspired design elements thrown in. Honda calls the lines coupe-like, which can be seen somewhat in the profile, and the designers have hidden the rear door handles to suggest further two-door styling. The high beltline, strong wheel arches, and wide stance give it a squat appearance. The interior is neatly organized and skips the dual-monitor clutter seen on larger Honda models; upper trim levels will get a central touchscreen for infotainment.</p>, <p>The HR-V has great fuel economy and good performance for the segment. The HR-V's 1.8-liter 4-cylinder is larger than the Fit's and develops 141 horsepower and 127 pound-feet of torque, with both peaks occurring fairly high on the powerband. With a choice of a continuously variable transmission or a 6-speed manual (the latter only on front-drive models) the HR-V mirrors the Fit's transmission offerings. Where it expands on the Fit formula is in offering all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The HR-V measures 169.1 inches long overall and rides on a 102.8-inch wheelbase, making it longer than the Fit in both respects. With more than 100 cubic feet of interior space on the base LX trim (96.1 cu ft on EX and EX-L), the HR-V should be one of the roomiest vehicles in its niche—Honda points out that it's roomier than some mid-size offerings. Just like the Fit, the HR-V also features the Honda "Magic Seat," which allows the second-row seat to fold and flip, opening up more configuration possibilities and lots of storage space. Behind the front seats, Honda says the HR-V has 58.8 cubic feet of storage space with the rear seats folded, and there's 24.3 cubic feet available behind the second-row seat. The front passenger seat can also fold, opening up space for 8-foot objects—Honda suggests a kayak.</p>, <p>The HR-V comes standard with a rearview camera and tire-pressure monitors, along with the usual traction systems and airbags. The NHTSA gives the HR-V a five-star overall result, although it received a four-star rating in frontal impact, for both positions and crash-test dummy sizes. The IIHS has given the HR-V some "Good" scores, but it's rated as just "Acceptable" in side-impact and small-overlap crash tests.</p>, <p>Standard features on the HR-V include power windows, locks, and mirrors; the aforementioned rearview camera; a tilt/telescope steering column; steering-wheel audio controls; and Bluetooth with audio streaming. Options will include a touchscreen interface; Honda's LaneWatch camera; keyless ignition; paddle shifters; satellite radio; navigation; leather; a sunroof; and heated front seats.</p>, <p>Fuel economy won't be quite as good as in the Fit, of course, as that model weighs less and uses a smaller engine. The most efficient HR-V returns ratings of 28 mpg city, 34 highway.</p>]

[<p>The Honda Accord Hybrid is the gas-electric version of the Japanese automaker's best-selling sedan.</p>, <p>With the Accord Hybrid, Honda hit the pause button for the 2016 model year, after selling American-made copies in the 2014 and 2015 model years. A two-year production run in Japan was ended when Honda announced the new Accord Hybrid would be sourced from Ohio.</p>, <p>The third generation of the Accord Hybrid will go on sale in early 2018 and is based on the newest Accord. It's directly solely at the mid-size sedan buyer looking for more efficiency, and our colleagues at <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1112970_2018-honda-accord-hybrid-first-drive-review-lighter-shade-of-green"><em>Green Car Reports</em> drove a very early prototype</a>.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_accord-hybrid_2017">2017 Honda Accord Hybrid review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Our editors were so impressed with the Accord Hybrid it was named <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1088280_green-car-reports-best-car-to-buy-2014-honda-accord-hybrid"><em>Green Car Reports'</em> Best Car To Buy 2014</a>. The latest Accord Hybrid returned for 2017 with all the updates applied to conventional Accords for 2016, plus an improved hybrid powertrain that delivers slightly higher EPA fuel-efficiency ratings. It competes with hybrid versions of the Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, and Ford Fusion.</p>, <p>With the exception of the grille, headlights, taillights, and a few add-on aerodynamic trim items, hybrid Accords look just like high-end versions of the conventional Accord four-door sedan. We like the lines, which are crisp for such a large sedan but neither overly curvaceous nor too aggressive. Inside, the hybrids use the same high-quality interior materials as the regular Accord; because the hybrids come in at the high end of the Accord range, they have most of the bells and whistles that are extra-cost options on gasoline-only Accord models. Honda has added extra energy-use graphics and power displays to the instrument panel and center display screen for the hybrid models as well, allowing drivers to monitor their green-leaning progress.</p>, <p>It's the powertrain that sets the new Accord hybrids apart, of course. Honda has created a new two-motor full hybrid system for these models (and more to come in the future) that's entirely different from the Integrated Motor Assist system offered on various smaller Hondas since 1999. The company concluded that a more powerful hybrid system was needed for larger vehicles, and Honda has put many years and much development work into the new system.</p>, <p>All Accord hybrids use a direct-injected 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder gas engine. It powers the front wheels through a transmission that features a pair of electric motors. Just one of those electric motors powers the wheels, now able to supply 135 kw (181 hp), which is more than the motors of other gas-electric vehicles. The combined output from the engine and motor together is 212 hp.</p>, <p>Despite the weight penalty compared to the non-hybrid Accord models, the gas-electric Accord handles decently, with a solid overall feeling and comfortable steering.</p>, <p>At speeds up to 30 or 40 mph and under moderate loads, the hybrid Accord can run solely on electric power. At the highest cruising speeds, only the engine powers the car. In between, the new hybrid system can power the car with blended torque provided by both the engine and the motor. It also has an additional "series hybrid" capability, in which the engine turns one of the motors that acts as a generator to recharge the battery while the battery simultaneously powers the other motor to run the car—but the engine is not mechanically driving the wheels. The system switches seamlessly among these modes to maximize fuel efficiency and respond to driver demands.</p>, <p>Overall, Honda's new hybrid system is clever, compact, and flexible, and it delivers a smooth driving experience with enough power that drivers can forget they're behind the wheel of a hybrid and simply drive as they always would.</p>, <p>The Honda Accord Hybrid range offers three trim levels: base Hybrid, Hybrid EX-L, and Hybrid Touring.</p>, <p><strong>Early Accord Hybrid history</strong></p>, <p>The earlier Honda Accord Hybrid, sold from 2004 through 2007, used the company's mild-hybrid system. Its aim was not better fuel economy but to deliver improved acceleration and performance. Ten years ago, with far fewer hybrids on the market, that was a confusing message. It used a 3.0-liter V-6 paired with an electric motor to provide lots of output and fuel economy that was only marginally better than that of a four-cylinder model.</p>, <p>The first-generation Accord Hybrid performed about as well as the standard Accord V-6, but was less smooth under some driving conditions--and didn't deliver the stellar gas mileage most buyers associated with hybrids. It didn't do well and was withdrawn after initially good sales plummeted. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/honda_odyssey
[<p>The Honda Odyssey is a minivan that's become synonymous with families like Taco Tuesday.</p>, <p>For the 2018 Odyssey, Honda has thoroughly reworked its minivan inside and out for a fresh appearance and improved performance and safety. The 2019 version was unchanged.</p>, <p>Although there are fewer minivans on the road today, Honda and other automakers have surprisingly good and competent options. The Odyssey competes against the Chrysler Pacifica, Toyota Sienna, Kia Sedona, and Dodge Grand Caravan.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_odyssey_2019">2019 Honda Odyssey review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Honda Odyssey</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>Comfort, convenience, and safety are paramount to minivan buyers, and the Odyssey’s redesign brings with it a second row of seats that can be configured in different ways, an innovative live feed of the cabin visible on the center screen, and some important safety tech standard on almost every model.</p>, <p>The Odyssey’s looks have been updated with a front end decked out in chrome that further blurs the line between crossover and minivan. From the side, its chrome belt line kink returns, a feature that helps it stand out from rivals. Inside, its layout is cleaner with upgraded materials, but the big news lies in its second row.</p>, <p>Three individual seats are included in the second row. The center seat can be removed entirely and the outboard seats can be pushed together, spread apart, or moved fore and aft. Unlike the Chrysler Pacifica, however, the Honda’s seats must be removed and stored elsewhere for maximum cargo-hauling capacity.</p>, <p>But one thing Chrysler doesn’t have is a camera embedded in its headliner that relays a live feed of the second and third row to the driver’s instrument cluster. The days of turning around to silence fighting passengers may be finally over. It’s available only on higher line models, and it pairs with a microphone and speaker system that lets the driver speaker system that lets the driver yell at the kids through the speakers or through the entertainment system's wireless headphones. Also offered are a built-in vacuum, an entertainment system with an airline-inspired map showing when the van will arrive its destination, and, of course, countless USB ports, cupholders, and climate control vents.</p>, <p>All Odysseys utilize a new 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 280 horsepower, a 32-hp increase over last year's model. Lower trim levels will mate that V-6 to a 9-speed automatic, while higher-spec versions gain a 10-speed automatic. Those transmissions, as well as an active grille shutters and cylinder deactivation, help make the Odyssey the most efficient minivan this side of the plug-in hybrid version of the Pacifica.</p>, <p>EX and higher trim levels, which should represent the vast majority of Odysseys Honda will sell, come standard with the brand’s Honda Sensing suite of technology. The highlights here are automatic highbeam headlights, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, active lane control that can gently nudge a drifting Odyssey back between into the road.</p>, <p><strong>Honda Odyssey history</strong></p>, <p>Today's Odyssey bears little resemblance to the one that first emerged in Japan in 1994 and launched a year later in the U.S. As Honda's first minivan, it had a cool reception in the States. It was smaller than domestic minivans, and didn't have sliding side doors like those on the American offerings at the time. Still, Honda’s reputation for reliability and strong resale values helped the Odyssey become a household nameplate within its first couple of years on sale.</p>, <p>That first Odyssey rode on a version of the Honda Accord family sedan platform and was built in Japan and exported. The smallish first-generation Odyssey offered only a 4-cylinder engine, although the little package was able to carry either six or seven passengers; the middle row could be optioned with either a traditional bench or a pair of captain's chairs. </p>, <p>The Odyssey’s other major calling card was its competitive pricing, although an inflow of cheaper models has seen this advantage eroded significantly. Nowadays, the highly featured Odyssey is one of the more expensive minivans for sale in the U.S. with a starting price in the high $20,000s.</p>, <p>The Odyssey was fully Americanized in its second generation, and production moved to North America as well. The van grew for 1999, and its 4-cylinder engine was replaced with the corporate 3.5-liter V-6. The second-generation Odyssey offered dual sliding doors, solid handling, and plenty of power.</p>, <p>Honda was on to a winning formula, so for the third generation of the minivan, which was launched as a 2005 model, changes were kept to a minimum. That Odyssey featured a 244-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 with optional cylinder-deactivation technology. The most efficient model returned EPA-rated fuel economy of 17 mpg city, 25 highway.</p>, <p>Honda added a little more design panache to the fourth generation of the Odyssey—which was introduced as a 2011 model—along with improved seating, new connectivity and entertainment features. The most noteworthy detail of the new design was a "lightning-bolt" beltline—a small drop of the window line just behind the sliding door—that added a little more window space in back. The design flourish—which continues to this generation—can be polarizing, but it at least serves a functional purpose, as any good minivan feature should.</p>, <p>The engine was carried over from the previous generation, but a new 6-speed automatic was phased in—initially, it was only offered on the upper trim levels. The new transmission boosted gas mileage to 19/28 mpg. Variable cylinder management and active noise cancellation made these vans among the most efficient and refined picks in the real world, too. The Odyssey earned nods from the IIHS as a Top Safety Pick status and a top five-star overall rating from the federal government.</p>, <p>The lack of some features on all but the highest-priced models was a problem with past Odyssey models. That was somewhat alleviated with the refresh given to the Odyssey <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_odyssey_2013">for the 2013 model year</a>, which made a rearview camera and Bluetooth connectivity standard equipment.</p>, <p>The 2014 model year brought a minivan innovation to the Odyssey's top Touring Elite trim level. The HondaVac, developed with ShopVac, is a built-in vacuum that is powered by the car's battery and can reach from its spot in the cargo area all the way to the front row. The HondaVac spread to the middle-of-the-road SE trim in addition to the Touring Elite trim. Honda also made the 6-speed automatic standard across all Odyssey models in 2014, putting all models at the same (higher) fuel-economy ratings. Few noticeable changes were made to the Odyssey for 2015 or 2016.</p>, <p>In its top trim, the Odyssey could be had with a stunning wide-screen entertainment system, HID headlights, blind-spot monitors, and a great 650-watt sound system—as well as, lest you forget, that integrated vacuum system.</p>, <p>For 2017, Honda added an acoustic windshield to more models and made available its in-car vacuum and rear-seat entertainment system on lower trims.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/honda_ridgeline
[<p>The Honda Ridgeline mid-size truck returned for the 2017 model year after a two-year hiatus. The pickup has a dirty secret: it's related to the Honda Pilot crossover and Honda Odyssey minivan.</p>, <p>With the Ridgeline, Honda has the only unibody pickup truck you can buy. It's also the only truck to offer front-wheel drive, though all-wheel drive is available.</p>, <p>The Ridgeline's roots come with a compromise. The Ridgeline boasts a spacious cabin, made better with good creature comforts, but ultimately runs out of room in the bed—it's smaller than the competition.</p>, <p>For 2019, the Ridgeline was largely unchanged.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read</strong> <strong>our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116708_2019-honda-ridgeline">2019 Honda Ridgeline review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Ridgeline's interior is not only more spacious, but better appointed than the cabins of its mid-size competitors, which include the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Nissan Frontier, and Toyota Tacoma.</p>, <p>One year after its return, the Ridgeline is unchanged for 2018 aside for some new colors for the Sport trim.</p>, <p><strong>The new Ridgeline</strong></p>, <p>Now in its second generation, the Ridgeline takes on a more traditional pickup look, with a bed that appears to be separate thanks to body cutlines that are cosmetic. The sail panels that made the Pilot look like a combination of a pickup and an SUV are gone. The design also includes a crew cab body style, a grille that plays off the current corporate face, and somewhat softer lines than the competition.</p>, <p>The bed is shorter but wider than those of most mid-size pickups. At 5-feet wide and with 50 inches between the wheel arches, it can allow 4-by-8 sheets of plywood or drywall to lay flat with the tailgate opened. At 5-feet-4-inches long, it is a bit longer than before but about 10 inches shorter than the longest beds offered by the competition.</p>, <p>The new bed has some features that the competitors can't match. It retains the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate from the previous model. The tailgate is hinged both at the bottom like a traditional tailgate and along its left side so it can open like a door. Located under the bed at the rear, the trunk has a flat bottom and adds a drain plug. Honda also provides eight 350-pound tie-down cleats.</p>, <p>The bed is also available with the industry's first in-bed audio system with six "exciters" in place of speakers. Offered as an accessory for the bed is a 400-watt AC power inverter to charge tools or plug-in your favorite tailgating entertainment.</p>, <p>Honda says the Ridgeline can carry up to 1,584 pounds in its bed and tow as much as 5,000 pounds on top of carrying two passengers and 100 pounds of gear. By comparison, the Chevrolet Colorado can haul up to 1,570 pounds of payload and tow up to 7,000 pounds.</p>, <p>The new Ridgeline is powered by a direct-injected 3.5-liter V-6 with 280 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque. Honda also offers an Intelligent Terrain Management system with Normal, Sand, Snow, and Mud modes.</p>, <p>Inside, leather upholstery is offered, and so are tri-zone automatic climate control, keyless ignition, a color meter display in the instrument cluster, an 8.0-inch Display Audio system with Apple Car Play and Android Auto, and a 540-watt audio system. We agree with Honda's claim that the Ridgeline has the quietest cabin in its class.</p>, <p>Like the last-generation Ridgeline, the new truck delivers Honda's typical smooth powertrain performance, and class-leading ride and handling. Inside, it features a multitude of stowage options, including space under the rear seat. The rear seat bottoms fold up in a 60/40 split to open up even more storage space.</p>, <p>The Ridgeline has achieved top crash test ratings, including a Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS, and it offers plenty of safety features, though only on the two top models. The Honda Sensing suite consists of forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, road-departure mitigation, blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts, lane-departure warnings, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, adaptive high beams, and front and rear parking sensors. A multi-angle rearview camera is standard on most trims, and the Honda LaneWatch system with a side-view camera activated by the right turn signal comes on a lesser trim.</p>, <p><strong>Ridgeline history</strong></p>, <p>Honda introduced the Ridgeline as a 2006 model. While it was named the 2006 North American Truck of the Year, the odd-looking truck was never a smash hit for the brand. Instead, like the Ford Ranchero, Chevrolet El Camino, and Subaru Baja near-trucks before it, the Ridgeline built a small, but fervent, fan base.</p>, <p>The first generation's strange design could have been explained by sail panels at the front of the bed to give it strength. Over the years, styling updates for that model were mostly limited to a new grille for the 2010 model year that borrowed from the trucky looking refresh of the Honda Pilot crossover.</p>, <p>The unusual pickup bed limited the Ridgeline's utility, though Honda explained that its pickup wasn't intended to be a full-size truck, but one useful to owners of its other motorized products. At just over 5-feet long, the composite bed wasn't big, but it could hold a 4-by-8 sheet of plywood with the tailgate down. An optional bed extender included more tie-downs and could handle mounting accessories for ATVs, snowboards, surfboards, bikes, and the like. Still, heavy-duty towing components were included, and the Ridgeline could tow up to 5,000 pounds, or haul a 1,550-pound payload. The under-bed cargo bin could only be accessed when the bed was empty, of course—but the Ridgeline's tailgate both flipped down and swung to the side on a hinge, making it more flexible in that respect than any other pickup.</p>, <p>Unusually for pickup trucks, the first-generation Ridgeline only ever offered one single engine and transmission. The 250-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine, paired to a 5-speed automatic transmission, gave the Ridgeline brisk acceleration and good passing response, even when loaded. The Variable Torque Management four-wheel-drive system made the Ridgeline better suited for slippery snow-covered roads than most four-wheel-drive trucks. Both ride quality and steering feel were better than most full-size and mid-size trucks, too.</p>, <p>What the Ridgeline lacked in utility it more than made up for in safety. Honda's truck was named a Top Safety Pick by the IIHS, with top "Good" ratings across the board. It also offered a slew of airbags (front side, rollover-sensing side curtains for both rows) as well as stability control and anti-lock brakes on all models. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/honda_fit
[<p>The Honda Fit twins hatchback utility with smart small-car handling and fuel economy to become one of our highest-rated subcompacts.</p>, <p>With the Fit, Honda has a rival for cars like the Hyundai Accent, Chevy Sonic, and Nissan Versa. Technically a compact car by interior volume, the Fit bests all of them for passenger and cargo room.</p>, <p>The Fit has been thoroughly revamped for a new third-generation model that arrived for the 2015 model year. It's also added a companion model: the Honda HR-V crossover SUV, which is built alongside the Fit in Mexico.</p>, <p>For 2018, Honda added standard forward-collision warnings and automatic braking to all but the Fit LX. Retuned steering and dampers, fitted acoustic glass and more sound deadening, and a Sport model with a black interior and Harley-orange stripes were added to the Fit as well. The 2019 Fit was the same as the year before it.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1116738_2019-honda-fit" title="2017 Honda Fit - review">2019 Honda Fit review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Honda Fit</strong></p>, <p>The current Honda Fit is powered by a direct-injected 1.5-liter inline-4 that produces 130 horsepower and 114 pound-feet of torque. A 6-speed manual is the standard transmission, but most Fits will arrive at dealerships with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that maximizes fuel efficiency, and return EPA ratings of up to 36 mpg combined.</p>, <p>One of the most obvious changes for the new model has been its styling. While the first two generations wore cute and cheerful sheet metal, this third version has morphed into a sort of robotic-looking angular design. Thankfully, the current version retains the same basic profile with a very laid-back windshield and upright rear end.</p>, <p>The latest Fit has a more grown-up ride than before and traded some of its sharpness and steering response for a comfort-oriented calibration. It's less of a joy to drive, quite frankly. The so-called Honda "Magic Seat" and its many configurations returns for this generation, and provides as much utility as before. We're actually somewhat surprised that no other automaker has copied this masterpiece of space engineering.</p>, <p>The Fit has earned the top IIHS rating of "Good" in all tests except the tough small-overlap front crash, where it hasn't been rated. The NHTSA gave the Fit five stars in its overall rating.</p>, <p>The Fit was joined by the Honda HR-V for the 2016 model year. That subcompact crossover is based on the Fit and offers a similar interior layout with the Magic Seat, but it uses a larger engine and offers all-wheel drive as an option. The styling of the HR-V is also in line with other Honda crossover models instead of the Fit's angular edge.</p>, <p>It's the Magic Seat that has given all Fit hatchbacks their versatile and generous cargo space. The design allows the back seat to fold into several different positions, including both forward and backward. Owners can create a low, flat cargo floor or provide space for exceptionally tall cargo, like a potted plant or a mountain bike. The clever seat arrangement premiered on the original 2007-2008 Fit and has been carried over to all subsequent models.</p>, <p><strong>Honda Fit history</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation Honda Fit had been sold overseas as early as 2001, and was noticed for its excellent reliability, low running costs, and good resale value, before it landed on our shores for 2007. Both the first and second generations of Honda Fits were just more fun to drive than their competitors—though the Ford Fiesta and Chevy Sonic closed that gap.</p>, <p>The first-generation Honda Fit was only sold in the U.S. for two model years, 2007 and 2008. The second generation ran from 2009 through 2013.</p>, <p>In its first generation, the Fit came with a 109-hp, 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine fitted with Honda's VTEC valve system. It was offered with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic sending power to the front wheels. Performance was sprightly if not downright quick, and its steering and suspension had a definite sporty tune to them, which made the task of piloting the small inexpensive car a joy rather than a chore.</p>, <p>The 2009-2013 Fit again offered a single engine: this time, a 117-hp, 1.5-liter 4-cylinder, which could be ordered with a 5-speed automatic transmission, but came standard with a 5-speed manual gearbox. On Sport models, the automatic came with paddle shifters for manual control of gear selection, along with an optional touchscreen navigation system and better audio connectivity.</p>, <p>The lineup for each model year of the second-generation car included Fit and Fit Sport models, with the Sport in recent years adding alloy wheels, foglights, and a rear stabilizer bar, plus cruise control, keyless entry, and steering-wheel controls.</p>, <p>Safety has been a strong point for the Fit throughout. Standard safety features for the second-generation car included side and side-curtain bags as well as active head restraints. The Fit was one of few small cars to get top scores from the IIHS for frontal and side impacts.</p>, <p>During the second generation, the Fit saw only minor upgrades to equipment and features. Changes for 2012 included expanded steering-wheel controls and upgraded fabrics. There were no significant changes for the 2013 model year.</p>, <p>The 2013 Honda Fit EV all-electric model was offered only in very small numbers and only to customers in California and Oregon. Honda expected to lease only 1,100 of them for a three-year term, in order to <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1068832_electric-cars-some-are-real-most-are-only-compliance-cars--we-name-names" title="Electric Cars: Some Are Real, Most Are Only 'Compliance Cars'--We Name Names">comply with California zero-emission vehicle requirements</a> for the carmakers with the highest in-state sales. With its light, eager driving feel, powerful electric motor, and EPA-rated range of 82 miles, it might have been a bigger success than the limited sales allowed for. Honda hasn't announced whether an EV model will return for the Fit's third generation.</p>, <p>Honda did not offer a Fit for the 2014 model year, instead beginning production early for a new 2015 model.</p>]

[<p>The Hyundai Azera is a full-size four-door sedan that was on sale from 2005 to 2017. It bridged the gap between mainstream four-door family sedans and their more luxurious spin-offs, with a focus on comfort and amenities, rather than everyday practicality. After slowing sedan sales, Hyundai shelved the sedan in the U.S. after 2017.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/hyundai_azera_2017" title="2015 Hyundai Azera review">2017 Hyundai Azera review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>The Azera was related to the Hyundai Sonata in the way Toyota's Avalon is paired with its Camry: it was essentially a longer, more plush and stylish alternative that offers some—if not quite all—the premium features of the Genesis G80 and G90 luxury sedans.</p>, <p>The Azera was a competitor for the Toyota Avalon and Chevrolet Impala, both bringing at least as much style and refinement to the party as the Azera.</p>, <p><strong>The last Hyundai Azera</strong></p>, <p>Hyundai brought its newest Azera to our shores in 2012. That model wore the brand's latest styling, updating the Azera to look current with its Elantra and Sonata relatives. A redone interior brought equally fresh design inside, with improved materials and modern technology. This marked quite an about-face for the previously conservative-looking Azera.</p>, <p>Even better, the Azera's dynamics have been brushed up, taking it from cushy to a bit lively in its responses. The Azera's 3.3-liter V-6 makes 293 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, and its 6-speed automatic has a wide range of gear ratios to allow quick takeoffs, strong passing ability, and relaxed cruising.</p>, <p>Compared to the smaller Sonata, the Azera makes a case for its higher price tag by being both more roomy for passengers and cargo and by offering more features. All Azeras include a standard rearview camera, as well as navigation, keyless ignition, heated front and rear seats, a 450-watt sound system, and power adjustments for the front seats. The options list includes upgrades sound by Infinity, a panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, and ambient lighting.</p>, <p>The 2012-2013 Azera was one of a set of vehicles found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers. Hyundai initially submitted figures to the EPA of 20 mpg city, 29 highway for the 2012 model year, and 20 mpg city, 30 highway for the 2013 model year. On a confirmation check of several vehicles, the EPA found the actual tested fuel economy to be lower for both models. Owners can register with Hyundai to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels; more details are found at <a href="http://www.hyundaimpginfo.com">HyundaiMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>The Azera carried over into the 2014 model year with no significant changes. Updates came for 2015, with Hyundai giving the model a very mild facelift that includes a new grille, reworked headlights, a new front fascia, and modified taillights. The center stack was also redesigned, and a lot of package content was moved around, with the result being more standard equipment in most models. </p>, <p>Adaptive cruise control and stop/start were new to the Limited model for the 2016 model year, as was an electronic parking brake. The Azera was carried over unchanged for the 2017 model year.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Azera history</strong></p>, <p>The Azera was first introduced in the U.S. in the 2006 model year as the follow-up to Hyundai's first attempts at premium sedans, the XG300 and XG350. Aimed squarely at the Toyota Avalon and mid-size sedans from Buick, the Azera offered mild styling and a 263-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, while other world markets also received the Azera with smaller 4- and 6-cylinder engines as well as diesel powerplants. In the U.S. the sole transmission was a 5-speed automatic with Shiftronic controls. Relatively well equipped, but plain inside, the plush-riding Azera sported a base price tag of about $25,000 in its first model year.</p>, <p>While its relaxed handling and subdued styling remained largely unchanged, the first-generation Azera was upgraded over time. New steering-wheel controls arrived in 2007; a new navigation system with voice control showed up in the 2008 model year, along with a new base engine, a 234-hp, 3.3-liter V-6. In 2009, Hyundai adapted the grille on the Azera, added blue backlighting for its gauges, and updated the audio and entertainment controls to include Bluetooth connectivity and iPod controls.</p>, <p>For the 2011 model year the Azera received a light refresh that included a new grille, headlights, LED taillights, and fog lamps, plus "high-gloss" window trim, a new trunk lid design and new alloy wheels. Powertrain changes were more substantial: the V-6 engines in the 2011 Hyundai Azera lineup became more powerful and consumed less gas. The 3.3-liter produced 260 hp and 233 lb-ft of torque (almost as many horsepower as the larger engine the year before) and improved fuel economy in both the EPA city and highway cycles, to 20 mpg city, 28 highway. The larger 3.8-liter V-6 was bumped up to 283 hp and 263 lb-ft, with fuel-economy ratings up 2 mpg in the city test and a mile per gallon on the highway, to 19 mpg city, 27 highway.</p>]

Hyundai caps the Kona with a contrasting roof, and fits it with a tall mesh grille and LED headlights, concave door panels, stubby rear roof pillar and slim tailights, for an on-trend body. The interior is organized around a central infotainment display, flanked by a softly sculpted dash.</p>, <p dir="ltr">With the Kona, Hyundai offers a range of small-displacement 4-cylinder engines. American-spec Konas will likely adopt a base 2.0-liter inline-4 with 147 hp and 132 lb-ft of torque. This 4-cylinder couples to a 6-speed automatic. The company estimates 0-60 mph for this version at under 10 seconds, and top speed at 121 mph.</p>, <p dir="ltr">A 1.6-liter turbo-4 puts out 175 hp and 196 lb-ft of torque.

[<p>The Hyundai Tucson is a crossover SUV that performs (and looks) more like a tall hatchback. With the Tucson, Hyundai has a rival for vehicles such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, and Subaru Forester. </p>, <p>A fully redesigned version of the Tucson arrived for the 2016 model year. Hyundai updated the design and powertrains for the Tucson for the 2019 model year.</p>, <p>With the Tucson, Hyundai sells a useful hatch-wagon with available all-wheel drive; off-road ability isn't nearly as much its forte as simply being a versatile, maneuverable vehicle with a high seating point.</p>, <p><strong>The current Hyundai Tucson<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>Today's Hyundai Tucson slots between its new Kona and Sante Fe/Santa Fe XL SUVs. Hyundai retouched the shape for 2019 with a new grille, headlights and taillights. The Tucson’s interior adopted the shapes of the Kona, with a lower dash and a big touchscreen.</p>, <p>For its first three model years, Hyundai powered the Tucson with either a 164-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine or a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 with 175 hp. For 2019 Hyundai replaced the turbo-4 with a non-turbo, 2.4-liter inline-4 with 181 hp. Both engines issue power to the front or all four wheels via a 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/hyundai_tucson_2019">2019 Hyundai Tucson preview</a></em></strong></p>, <p>In the latest Tucson, interior space grew, and so did the list of available active-safety features.</p>, <p>Forward-collision warnings became standard in 2019, along with active lane control. The Tucson added options for a surround-view camera system and adaptive cruise control to go with its standard rearview camera.</p>, <p>Very little changed on 2017 models aside from some nicer interior materials on Sport models. Hyundai shuffled some equipment and trim level names for 2018, and made a larger touchscreen standard on more models. For 2019 the base screen grew to 7.0 inches, and came with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>A hydrogen-powered Tucson was available in very small quantities. It's based on the previous-generation Tucson.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Tucson history</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation Tucson hit the U.S. market in 2005, offering an affordable compact crossover for daily driving with a range of trim levels. The Tucson has carried that basic motif through to the new generation, though over time the engine options have changed.</p>, <p>That 2005 Tucson was available with a 2.0-liter inline-4 rated at 140 hp, or a 173-hp, 2.7-liter V-6, with both mated to either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The Tucson's three trim levels—GL, GLS, and Limited—divided the powertrains up as fit the model. The GL was available only with the 4-cylinder engine, and a choice of the manual or automatic transmission. The GLS and Limited, on the other hand, were available with only the V-6 and only the automatic transmission. All models were available with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Safety ratings for the first Hyundai Tucson were a strong point, earning five stars in all categories in NHTSA testing from 2005 through the 2009 model year.</p>, <p>The second-generation Hyundai Tucson was introduced for the 2010 model year, with a much bolder new design and updated engines. It offered a choice between two 4-cylinder engines, either a 2.0-liter inline-4 with 165 hp, or a 2.4-liter inline-4 that makes 176 hp. A choice of 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic on the base engine became automatic-only with the bigger powerplant, but all-wheel drive was offered on either. </p>, <p>These Tucson models were more spacious than the ones they replaced, but they didn't have quite as much interior room as competitors like the Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester. Four adults fit comfortably, and the rear seat offered decent head room and leg room even for taller adults.</p>, <p>Safety ratings were fairly solid for this Tucson, with four stars overall from the NHTSA and mostly top "Good" scores from the IIHS; the only major demerit was a "Poor" score on the IIHS's newest test, the small frontal overlap crash test, which kept it out of contention for the agency's Top Safety Pick status.</p>, <p>This Tucson changed relatively little after its 2010 launch. Starting with the 2013 model year, all versions came with standard air conditioning; power windows, locks, and mirrors; remote keyless entry; cloth seats; and an AM/FM/XM/CD player with a USB port. Changes for 2015 were limited, with a new option package on the GLS adding items like a touchscreen radio and power driver's seat, while Limited models got LED taillights as standard equipment.</p>, <p>This Tucson was among those Hyundai vehicles included in a restatement of fuel-economy figures. From the 2011 to the 2013 model years, the EPA found that many Hyundai vehicles had overstated gas-mileage ratings that did not hold up to confirmation testing performed by the agency.

--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/hyundai_elantra
[<p>The Hyundai Elantra is the South Korean automaker's family of compact cars.</p>, <p>It's available as a sedan or hatchback, and has garnered several awards over its history, including the 2012 North American Car of the Year crown.</p>, <p>The Hyundai Elantra was new for the 2017 model year and added a hatchback version for 2018. With the Elantra, Hyundai has a rival for vehicles such as the Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, and Mazda 3 as well as the Chevrolet Cruze, Nissan Sentra, and Volkswagen Golf, and the Elantra's cousin, the Kia Forte.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our</em></strong> <em><strong><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111765_2018-hyundai-elantra">2018 Hyundai Elantra review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Hyundai Elantra</strong></p>, <p>The new Elantra that arrives for the 2017 model year is a more sedately styled sedan that has improved its quietness and refinement, much as Hyundai did with the bigger Sonata that was new in 2015.</p>, <p>The Elantra's styling bravado has been pared down, and supplemented with more safety features, a more comfortable cabin, and higher fuel economy.</p>, <p>Inside and out, the Elantra's lines have been dialed down and smoothed out. The space for people and cargo has been boosted, too: with about an inch more in overall length and in width, the new Elantra is firmly in the mid-size category, though Hyundai sells it as a compact car.</p>, <p>Two new powertrains help Hyundai nudge the Elantra's efficiency to new highs. A new 2.0-liter inline-4 makes 147 horsepower; its gas mileage ratings are 29 mpg city, 38 highway, 33 combined when coupled with a 6-speed automatic. A new Elantra Eco uses a turbocharged 1.4-liter 4-cylinder with 128 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque, coupled to a 7-speed, dual-clutch transmission for an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined.</p>, <p>A <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1107083_2017-hyundai-elantra-sport-first-drive-close-encounter-of-a-turbocharged-kind">new Hyundai Elantra Sport</a> adds a turbo-4, a new dual-clutch transmission, and stiffer suspension tuning.</p>, <p>The powertrains deliver adequate power, but much smoother performance in Limited models. Those Limited sedans have more insulation between the engine and cabin, thicker glass, and more sound-deadening material surrounding the cockpit. With them, the Elantra is now about as quiet as the Sonata.</p>, <p>Handling has improved with a stiffer body and a redesigned torsion-beam rear axle. Safety rating agencies are mixed with the Elantra. The IIHS calls the sedan a Top Safety Pick+, but federal testers give the car a worrying four-star overall score with a special note for intrusion.</p>, <p>New features on the options list include forward-collision warnings with automatic braking; adaptive cruise control; and blind-spot monitors with cross-traffic alerts. Other new features will include a motion-activated trunk release; Android Auto; and a new navigation system.</p>, <p>The new Elantra went on sale early in 2016, as a four-door sedan. While the coupe is gone, a new Elantra GT hatchback arrived for 2018. It's more closely related to the Hyundai i30, which is sold worldwide and assembled in South Korea, while the Elantra sedan is produced in North America and mostly sold there.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Elantra history</strong></p>, <p>From 1992 to 2000, the first two generations of Elantras were, like most Hyundais of the era, inexpensive economy cars. After 2000, the Elantra made great strides toward mainstream levels of equipment and quality, including standard front and side airbags, air conditioning, and power locks and windows.</p>, <p>Redesigned again in 2007, the last-generation Elantra and the Elantra Touring wagon offered even more room, more powerful and efficient engines, and standard safety features like electronic stability control, brake assist, side-curtain airbags, active head restraints, and all-disc anti-lock brakes. The modern-day Elantra GT five-door hatchback replaced the Touring wagon in the current Elantra lineup.</p>, <p>With that 2007-2010 model, Hyundai managed to earn a new level of respect for reliability and resale value—even against stalwarts like the Civic and Corolla. This Elantra was offered in just three trims, with the Limited model available from 2001 to 2006 cut from the lineup. The GLS and SE trims were complemented by the Blue, a special fuel-efficiency-focused version of the sedan available only with a 5-speed manual transmission. The Elantra Touring was only available in GLS and SE trims.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Elantra, 2012-2016</strong></p>, <p>With its 2011 redesign, the Elantra made a bold design gamble. Its radical new style was built on the automaker's "fluidic sculpture" theme seen on the larger Sonata; it featured dramatic curves and deep cutlines, and inside, an hourglass-shaped center stack. Power came from a 148-hp, 1.8-liter inline-4, and with weight reduced, the model initially had a 40-mpg highway rating across the entire lineup. While these models weren't especially enjoyable to drive, they were well-equipped small cars, with refinement a step above past efforts, including much reduced wind and road noise.</p>, <p>This Elantra's crash-test ratings were initially a mixed bag. The IIHS gave it the Top Safety Pick award and eventually, the car achieved a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA after some running updates. This Elantra also offered some features that weren't necessarily commonplace in this size class, including a touchscreen navigation system with real-time weather and traffic; heated rear seats; and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>One black mark on the 2011-2013 Elantra lineup: Hyundai was found to have overstated its fuel-economy numbers for several vehicle lines, due to what it deemed procedural errors during its testing. Hyundai initially claimed up to 40 mpg highway for some models, but after a consumer campaign alleged lower real-world economy, the EPA ran a confirmation check of the Elantra lineup and of several other Hyundai and Kia vehicles. The tests resulted in restated fuel-economy numbers for all involved model years. Owners were asked register with Hyundai to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels. For more details, head to <a href="http://www.hyundaimpginfo.com">HyundaiMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>The 2013 model year marked the introduction of a new Hyundai Elantra Coupe, essentially a two-door version of the Elantra sedan, as well as a Hyundai Elantra GT hatchback. The GT had more in common with the compact Hyundai hatchbacks sold in Europe. It was related more in name than in hardware to the Elantra sedan and coupe, as it had its own bodywork that's about nine inches shorter overall, with sharp fastback styling featuring some overt Mazda 3 cues. The interior was quite different, too: the dash was shallower, without the hourglass shape that defines the center stack of controls in the coupe and sedan. The GT had its own rear suspension design, and a three-mode electric steering rack that offered added heft, though feedback was still limited.</p>, <p>The 2014 model year brought a new Elantra Sport four-door model that used a 174-hp version of Hyundai's 2.0-liter inline-4. That engine was also added to the Elantra GT range as an option. This was also the second and final year of availability for the Elantra Coupe, which did not return for 2015 due to low sales volumes.</p>, <p>Hyundai updated the Elantra GT for 2016. Changes included a new front end with a slatted grille, a revised navigation system with Siri Eyes Free functionality, ventilated front seats, and the latest Hyundai Blue Link services, which brought remote-start and other capabilities via smartphone app.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/hyundai_sonata
[<p>The Hyundai Sonata was thoroughly redesigned for 2015, with the styling being the most obvious change, toned down from the last generation. The interior is equally conservative, with an almost Germanic, geometric look taking over. Hyundai also focused on powertrain efficiency.</p>, <p>The Sonata has continually grown larger and more refined with each successive generation. The newest version of the Sonata was launched for the 2015 model year bringing improved design and updated features as well as powertrain changes. In 2018, Hyundai sharpened the edges on that style, and added an optional, turbocharged engine and a new transmission.</p>, <p>With the Sonata, Hyundai has a rival for vehicles such as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, and Ford Fusion.</p>, <p>This year, the Sonata has new looks outside and a few tweaks inside. It's more cohesive and more interesting, capitalizing on the fastback-like shape that has set the Sonata apart from some less intriguing competitors. Inside, updated infotainment systems are joined by a handful of new features, but the biggest difference is that the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 now mates to an 8-speed automatic. </p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/hyundai_sonata_2018">2018 Hyundai Sonata review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Hyundai Sonata</strong></p>, <p>The Sonata offers a wide range of powertrains that span the base 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-4 to the twin-scroll turbocharged, 245-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-4. Both were initially teamed to a 6-speed automatic transmission with Shiftronic manual controls, but the turbo now has an 8-speed automatic. The Sonata's body's much stiffer now, and that makes it feel more settled at any speed, and allows better ride compliance. </p>, <p>Electrified options have included a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine mated to batteries, which evolved to a 2.0-liter inline-4 later. Hyundai introduced a new 2016 Sonata Plug-In Hybrid that offered a much larger 9.8-kwh battery pack, a somewhat stronger motor system, and 27 miles of electric-only operation—as well as a "Battery Charge" mode that makes it unique among mass-market PHEVs in being able to restore its battery charge while driving (at a cost of lower gas mileage during that time). Recharge times otherwise were less than three hours on Level 2 (240V) or up to nine hours on 110V (household AC).</p>, <p>The 2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, which went on sale in July 2015, earns up to 40 mpg city, 44 highway in SE trim, or slightly lower mileage in other trims.</p>, <p>An Eco model debuted for 2015. It pairs a smaller turbocharged 4-cylinder, displacing 1.6 liters, with a dual-clutch automatic transmission. Output is 177 hp and the setup is good for 28 mpg city, 38 highway, 32 combined.</p>, <p>The current Sonata has earned five-star scores from federal testers, as well as "Good" ratings from the IIHS in all categories including the tough small-overlap test, earning it the agency's Top Safety Pick+ status. There are plenty of safety features, too, including blind-spot monitors, adaptive cruise control, a driver knee airbag, and forward collision warning.</p>, <p>The Sonata also features the latest infotainment technology. Google's Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone interfaces are standard on all models. Models equipped with navigation get an 8.0-inch center touchscreen, integration with smartphone apps like Pandora and SoundHound, and HD radio functionality. Apple's Siri Eyes Free integration is also included.</p>, <p>Changes for 2016 include the use of several aluminum suspension components, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, a new 7.0-inch touchscreen audio system with the Android Auto smartphone interface, and some equipment shuffling. The Limited trim also gets the Sport trim's more aggressive front bumper.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the addition of dynamic headlights was one of few changes.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Sonata History</strong></p>, <p>The first Sonata introduced in the U.S. was actually the model's second generation, which arrived in 1989 and came with only 4-cylinder engines. A V-6 option became available for a short time on the second-generation car, before production ended at a Hyundai factory in Quebec, Canada. The third- and fourth-generation Sonata hailed from South Korean factories, and were offered with either 4- or 6-cylinder engines. The front ends of these models, sold through 2004, had sometimes garish styling that obscured the car's functional simplicity and value, and increasing reputation for reliability.</p>, <p>During these years, the Sonata architecture spawned two related vehicles, the Hyundai Santa Fe crossover utility vehicle and the Kia Optima sedan.</p>, <p>The Sonata broke into the mainstream as production moved to Alabama, beginning in 2005. With a newly styled body clean of any excessive detail, a much larger passenger cabin, and more powerful 4-cylinder and V-6 engines on board, the Sonata began to attract more attention in its very competitive class of vehicles. By the end of its run in 2010, this generation of Sonata had knocked the Toyota Camry off <em>Consumer Reports</em> magazine's top-recommendations list, based on its quality, reliability, and value.</p>, <p>In the same time frame, the Sonata architecture added another family member, the large Hyundai Azera, which is aimed more squarely at the Toyota Avalon and Buick LaCrosse.</p>, <p>The Sonata was completely redesigned for 2011, and won <em>The Car Connection's</em> inaugural Best Car To Buy award. Dramatic new styling inside and out carried a "Fluidic Sculpture" theme, with the curvaceous, nicely trimmed interior especially of note compared to sometimes-plain rivals. The suspension was been tuned for more of an enthusiast feel, and a 274-hp Sonata Turbo model joined the lineup.</p>, <p>This Sonata earned the IIHS Top Safety Pick accolade in this generation and achieved a five-star overall rating from the federal government.</p>, <p>EPA highway ratings rated up to 35 mpg for the base model, while a Sonata Hybrid, with a lithium-polymer pack and even higher ratings, was also introduced and achieved up to 40 mpg. However, the 2011-2012 Sonata Hybrid was one of a set of vehicles found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers. Hyundai initially submitted figures of 35/40/37 mpg to the EPA, which allows automakers to self-certify fuel economy. On a confirmation check of several vehicles, the EPA found the Sonata Hybrid's actual tested fuel economy to be 34/39/36 mpg. </p>, <p>The Sonata got no significant changes for the 2012 model year, but for 2013 a few more standard features were added, with heated seats offered through more of the lineup and a panoramic sunroof available on the Sonata Limited. The Sonata also <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1076042_2013-hyundai-sonata-loses-manual-gearbox-gains-features">lost its base manual transmission for 2013</a>, likely due to lack of interest.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/hyundai_accent
[<p>The Hyundai Accent is the smallest four-door sedan in the South Korean car company's lineup. It's also the least expensive Hyundai.</p>, <p>With the newly revamped 2018 Accent, Hyundai has one of the bigger sedans in its class, although it's not very exciting to drive.</p>, <p>The Accent is a competitor for vehicles such as the Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta, Kia Rio, and Chevrolet Sonic.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/hyundai_accent_2018">2018 Hyundai Accent review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Hyundai Accent</strong></p>, <p dir="ltr">The recently redesigned Accent adopts a new shape that mimics that of the bigger Sonata and Elantra sedans. It shares their six-sided grille, has a similar roofline, and a contoured dash that bears a strong family likeness. No hatchback model has emerged yet in this new generation—though the similar Kia Rio emerged new in 2018 with both sedan and hatchback body styles.</p>, <p>A 130-horsepower inline-4 powers the new 2,500-pound Accent. It's paired with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual. The front-strut and rear torsion-beam suspension are matched with electric power steering, front disc brakes (all discs on more expensive models) and 15- or 17-inch wheels and tires.</p>, <p>The Accent can carry four adults, with front head and leg room put in priority position. The rear seats fold down to expand the Accent's already large, 13.7-cubic-foot trunk.</p>, <p>Hyundai gives every Accent a rearview camera, but automatic emergency braking only comes on the Limited trim level, which also comes with heated seats, 17-inch wheels, a sunroof, and a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Accent skips navigation, leather, power seats, and other nice things, but all models carry a base price of less than $20,000.</p>, <p><strong>The 2012-2017 Hyundai Accent</strong></p>, <p>The last Accent arrived for 2012, offered in four-door sedan and five-door hatchback body styles. It was larger than its predecessor, nearly a compact in size, and offered a more sophisticated experience to go along with improved efficiency. An updated 1.6-liter inline-4 engine made 138 hp and was available with the choice of a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>It was a better performer, and was very well-executed, with adult-sized room in front or in back, with a smooth powertrain that accelerated at or above the usual econocar pace—all with a level of fit and finish a notch above the rival Fiesta and many other subcompacts. Not only that, it proved to be better equipped, with available Bluetooth, power features, and standard curtain airbags and stability control.</p>, <p>The Accent's fuel economy, however, was not as good as was initially marketed. In November 2012, the 2012-2013 Hyundai was found to have misstated gas-mileage figures for the Accent and several other models due to what it termed "testing errors," for which it compensated owners of the affected models. While the 2012 Accent was initially rated and promoted at 30 mpg city, 40 highway, the EPA deemed its actual fuel efficiency to be 28 mpg city, 37 highway. Owners were asked to register with Hyundai to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels at a website, <a href="http://www.hyundaimpginfo.com">HyundaiMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>Over its lifespan, this Accent tumbled as crash tests became more difficult. The NHTSA gave it four stars out of five overall, but noted some excessive intrusion in the side-impact test. The IIHS gave it a poor score in the new small front-overlap test and an acceptable score for side impact protection, with good scores in the rest of the testing.</p>, <p>In the second model year of this new body style, Hyundai gave the Accent more standard features in base GLS sedan form such as air conditioning, cruise control, and power windows, but raised the base price by $2,000 accordingly. The Accent was mostly unchanged for 2014.</p>, <p>The 2015 model year brought a light restyling, with <span>a new grille design up front. Accent GL and GLS models also got revised headlights, and the GLS adopted its own taillight look. Some features were moved around and repackaged, and the lineup was pared to three models: SE sedan, SE hatchback, and Sport hatchback. No major changes were made for the 2016 and 2017 model years.<br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Accent history</strong></p>, <p>Originally available in GL, GLS, and GT trims, with a choice of 1.5-liter and 1.6-liter engines, the Hyundai Accent has been simplified over the years. The first-generation car was a low-priced, often low-quality mode of basic transportation.</p>, <p>The second-generation Accent was offered from 2005, and trim choices eventually were reduced to a trio: the GLS model, with a choice of continuously variable (CVT) or manual transmissions, was offered in the sedan body style, while the hatchback was offered in GS and SE trims, with the SE replacing the previous GT trim as the sportier take on the Accent. This generation was powered by a lone powertrain: a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder good for 110 hp. The car offered good interior space and storage capacity, as well as standard air conditioning and a 60/40-split rear seat for cargo flexibility. It didn't fare too well in safety tests; U.S. versions got some extra reinforcements, but still did not excel in side-impact collision testing.</p>]

[<p>The Hyundai Santa Fe is a five- or seven-passenger crossover SUV. The name Santa Fe has evolved several times over the life of the crossover—it has been used for a five-passenger SUV, seven-passenger SUV—now it's both. The Santa Fe carries five, the Santa Fe XL carries seven.</p>, <p><strong>The new Hyundai Santa Fe</strong></p>, <p>With a bigger, butch look, the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe broke from its crossover roots into SUV-ness. The Santa Fe is now split (again) into two names: Santa Fe and Santa Fe XL. The outside offers a larger grille, topped with a strip of chrome along the front and thin LED running lights.</p>, <p>Inside, the Santa Fe is straightforward and modern, with a 7.0-inch touchscreen perched on the dash above the climate controls. The glass and windows are bigger in the Santa Fe, which helps brighten an otherwise dark interior.</p>, <p>The five-seater Santa Fe is equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 and 8-speed as standard, and a 2.0-liter turbo-4 is optional. On three-row SUVs, a 2.2-liter turbodiesel is available, a first for Hyundai in SUVs in the States.</p>, <p>The Santa Fe is offered with typical options such as bigger wheels, bigger infotainment, softer seating surfaces, and active safety features. Hyundai won't make automatic braking standard on all models, however.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Santa Fe history</strong></p>, <p>Until 2018, Hyundai's two Santa Fe crossovers shared a platform, but had different wheelbase measurements and featured different powertrains and were essentially two separate vehicles.</p>, <p>In either version, the Santa Fe adopted some of the cues of the Sonata and Elantra, but it was toned down significantly, with a new maturity to the look both inside and out. It was especially true for the three-row model, which competed against vehicles with more traditional, boxier designs.</p>, <p>The shorter Sport came only with 4-cylinder engines, while <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1082080_three-row-2013-hyundai-santa-fe-priced-below-explorer-pathfinder">the three-row Santa Fe</a> recieved a 3.3-liter V-6 good for 293 horsepower. The Santa Fe Sport's base 2.4-liter made 190 hp; an available turbo 2.0-liter inline-4 made 264 hp. All engines were mated to a 6-speed automatic with a manual shift mode and front-wheel drive, with an option for all-wheel drive. Gas mileage on the Sport rises was as high as 29 mpg highway, thanks to the newer, more efficient engines and other additions like electric power steering.</p>, <p>Like several other models in its class, the Santa Fe added flexibility to its interior package with an available sliding second-row seat. The seat also folded  for toting longer objects while preserving four seating positions.</p>, <p>With a base price in the mid-$20,000 range, the Santa Fe Sport included standard Bluetooth, but a rearview camera wasn't made standard on all models until 2017. An audio system with satellite radio and a USB port is also standard. Options include a well-executed navigation system, a panoramic sunroof, and Infinity audio. Equipment is similar on the longer Santa Fe, with prices rising into the high $20,000 range, base.</p>, <p>The 2013 Santa Fe Sport was one of a set of vehicles found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers. Hyundai's initial estimates of as much as 33 mpg highway for the new 'ute have been lowered, after tests run by the EPA. Owners can register with Hyundai to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels; more details are found at <a href="http://www.hyundaimpginfo.com">HyundaiMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>The Santa Fe and Sport received only minor updates through the 2018 model year.</p>, <p>For 2017, the model received a significant face lift, and minor structural changes that helped make it a Top Safety Pick+ by the IIHS.</p>, <p>On its debut in 2001, the Santa Fe was powered by either a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine available with a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission, or a 2.7-liter V-6 paired only with the automatic. Front-wheel drive was standard, though all-wheel drive was available as an option. A 3.5-liter V-6 engine option was added to the lineup in 2003, and that first Santa Fe had only minor styling changes through the 2006 model year. Three trim levels were available.</p>, <p>The Santa Fe's second generation launched in 2007 with a revised lineup of engines: a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, a 2.7-liter V-6, and a 3.3-liter V-6. The 2.7-liter was the only model available with a manual transmission; all others were paired with a 4- or 5-speed automatic. For 2010, powertrain choices were again reshuffled, with a 175-hp, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder made standard and a 276-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and a new 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic added. That same year, however, a small third-row seat was dropped and the last three years of this Santa Fe were offered with only two rows.</p>, <p>From 2007 to 2012, Hyundai offered the Santa Fe in three trim levels, each with its own specific engine options. The base GLS came standard with the 4-cylinder engine and a 6-speed manual transmission, while an automatic was available. SE models came only with a 3.5-liter V-6 and automatic transmission. The Limited was available with either engine but came only with an automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive was standard on all models, with all-wheel drive available with any automatic-transmission combination.</p>, <p>This second Santa Fe was sold much like other recent Hyundai vehicles—in relatively few build combinations, and with a strong list of standard features.</p>]

[<p>The Hyundai Veloster is a compact hatchback that's a relative of the Accent small car, but it's more than just a hatchback derivative.</p>, <p>The Veloster's fitted with four doors, but they're not in the usual locations. On the passenger side the Veloster has two doors, but on the driver side, only one. In the back, it's a hatchback. The unusual layout is supposed to help with cargo-loading and wedging passengers into the backseat. It takes some getting used to, and can also seem weird for the sake of weird, since there are few real advantages to the asymmetrical layout. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/hyundai_veloster_2019">2019 Hyundai Veloster review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>A new 2019 Hyundai Veloster was introduced at the 2018 Detroit auto show.</p>, <p><strong>The new Hyundai Veloster</strong></p>, <p>The 2019 Hyundai Veloster broke cover at the the 2018 Detroit auto show with a surprise: a very hot, Veloster N version.</p>, <p>Both the new Veloster N and 2019 Veloster don't stray far from the formula: asymmetric doors, seating for up to four, inline-4 and turbo-4 engines, and manual or automatic transmissions.</p>, <p>The base Veloster is powered by a 147-horsepower 2.0-liter inline-4, while Veloster Turbo and R-Spec models get a 1.6-liter turbo-4 that makes 201 hp. Six-speed manuals are standard for both, while the base Veloster gets an optional 6-speed automatic and turbo models get an optional 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Veloster N gets a 275-hp turbo-4 that with a 6-speed manual. </p>, <p>The new Veloster goes on sale later in 2018.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Veloster history</strong></p>, <p>Based on the Elantra sedan, but fitted with the 1.6-liter direct-injection inline-4 from the smaller Accent, the first-generation Veloster was the first Hyundai to offer the company's dual-clutch transmission. Its handling was very good (thanks in part to a different rear suspension geometry and stiffer tune), with impressive grip and poise, though its steering could've use better weighting and more road feel, and the engine was sorely lacking in low-range torque. Provided you keep the revs up, the Veloster showed its other, perkier personality.</p>, <p>Hyundai added a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1077096_2013-hyundai-veloster-turbo-first-drive-and-video-road-test">turbocharged engine to the Veloster lineup</a> shortly after the first model was introduced. It included a sport-tuned suspension, revised steering and brakes, and 18-inch wheels and tires. The Turbo netted 201 hp and originally offered a choice of a 6-speed automatic or manual.</p>, <p>While the Veloster's cabin is spacious and airy from the front seat, the back seats were cramped with limited head room. Rear seats were folded down, where they formed a flat cargo surface; the hatch is very wide, although there's quite a tall liftover at the back.</p>, <p>The Veloster came with a standard 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, built-in Gracenote display technology, and a USB port to connect and access iPod media via voice controls.</p>, <p>The 2012-2013 Veloster is one of a set of vehicles found to have <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080230_epa-red-flags-hyundai-elantra-kia-sorento-11-others-for-gas-mileage-ratings">overstated fuel-economy numbers</a>. The EPA has tested both model years and lowered its gas-mileage ratings, to a maximum of 37 mpg highway for the Veloster, and 35 mpg for the Turbo. Owners can register with Hyundai to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels; more details are found at <a href="http://www.hyundaimpginfo.com">HyundaiMPGInfo.com</a>. For our own real-world take on the car, including its gas mileage returns, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080327_2012-hyundai-veloster-six-month-road-test-gas-mileage-wrap-up">read our 6-month road test</a>.</p>, <p>Hyundai added a Turbo R-Spec Veloster model for 2014 for shoppers interested in taking their hatchback to a racetrack. Compared to the regular Turbo model, the R-Spec offered a stiffer suspension, a unique steering calibration, and a short-shifter from B&amp;M. It also did without a few features, like the proximity key, the fancy instrument cluster, turn signals in the side mirrors, and heated leather seats.</p>, <p>The Veloster changed only slightly for 2015. Eighteen-inch alloy wheels were added to the Style Package, and the Technology Package gained automatic climate control.</p>, <p>Hyundai updated the Veloster for 2016. All models got a revised front-end look, with a much larger grille and a new hood. The 7.0-inch infotainment system was improved, with the addition of the latest Hyundai Blue Link features and Siri Eyes Free functionality. The Veloster Turbo received a new 7-speed dual-clutch automatic as an option, replacing the former 6-speed automatic. A Rally model went above the R-Spec with stiffer suspension tuning, a B&amp;M Racing sport shifter for its 6-speed manual, lightweight 18-inch RAYS wheels, and unique matte blue paint.</p>, <p>After a host of updates last year, for 2017 the changes were limited to the addition of HD Radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to its infotainment system.</p>]

[<p>And while the longer three-row Santa Fe adopted a V-6-only powertrain, the Santa Fe Sport was downsized to four cylinders. A base 2.4-liter inline-4 with 190 horsepower was joined by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 with 264 hp. Both were offered with a 6-speed automatic and front-wheel drive, with available manual-shift mode and an option for all-wheel drive. Electric power steering and an independent suspension gave the Santa Fe Sport commendable road manners, and good fuel economy in the 30-mpg highway figure.</p>, <p>The 2013 Santa Fe Sport was one of a set of vehicles found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers shortly after it went on sale. Hyundai's initial estimates of as much as 33 mpg highway for the new 'ute were lowered, after EPA tests. Owners were asked to register with Hyundai to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels; more details were made available at a specific website, <a href="http://www.hyundaimpginfo.com">HyundaiMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>Inside, the Santa Fe Sport adopted some of the best features available on other vehicles in the class. The second-row seat was made available with a sliding function, to flex the space allotted to back-seat passengers and cargo, to a maximum of 35.4 cubic feet for cargo. The back bench also split and folded, and Hyundai packaged some storage space in beneath the Santa Fe Sport's cargo floor.</p>, <p>The Santa Fe Sport came with standard power features, air conditioning, cruise control, a USB port and Bluetooth; a rearview camera was an option. A simple to learn navigation system was an option, along with Infinity premium audio and a panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>Few changes were made to the Santa Fe Sport through the 2016 model year, other than updated infotainment systems and standard features. For 2017, Hyundai significantly updated the Santa Fe Sport, including new front grille and rear dual exhaust ports, a drive select mode and a standard 5.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/hyundai_ioniq
[<p>The Hyundai Ioniq breaks new ground among green cars by offering three different powertrains in a dedicated compact hatchback body that's intended to look relatively normal. The Ioniq was launched as a hybrid and a battery-electric model for 2017. The third and final version, a plug-in hybrid, was made available for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p>The hybrid Ioniq competes with the Toyota Prius, and Hyundai has managed to beat that car's EPA ratings for fuel economy. Other competitors include the Ford C-Max tall hatchback and hybrid versions of several mid-size sedans, including the Hyundai Sonata, as well as the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Kia Optima, and Toyota Camry.</p>, <p>The electric Ioniq, on the other hand, faces off against the Chevy Bolt EV, Nissan Leaf, BMW i3, and Volkswagen e-Golf, while the plug-in hybrid model—the last to arrive—goes against the Chevrolet Volt, the plug-in Toyota Prius Prime, and plug-in hybrid versions of the C-Max, Fusion, Sonata, and Optima.</p>, <p>With the Ioniq, Hyundai has a fuel-efficient hatchback—regardless of powertrain—that's moderately priced.</p>, <p>The 2019 Hyundai Ioniq is largely identical to the 2018 version, with the exception of more widely available automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1117154_2019-hyundai-ioniq" title="2017 Hyundai Ioniq - review">2019 Hyundai Ioniq review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>A few of the Ioniq's underpinnings are derived from the Elantra compact sedan, but the greener model is a dedicated design, meaning there's no version with only a gasoline powertrain.  Hyundai has deliberately given the Ioniq a conventional design, within the shape of a high-tailed five-door hatchback with an aerodynamically slippery shape. Hyundai's trapezoidal grille is flanked by headlights that sweep back into the fenders. The windshield is steeply raked, and a horizontal crease along the flat body sides has none of the curves and dips of other alternatively-powered vehicles. The Ioniq is no Toyota Prius or Nissan Leaf: it may pass unnoticed in traffic, and that's by design.</p>, <p>The two hybrid versions of the Ioniq are powered by a direct-injected 1.6-liter inline-4 putting out an estimated 104 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque. In the conventional hybrid, a single 32-kilowatt (43-hp) electric motor sits between the engine and a 6-speed dual-clutch automated transmission. Maximum output of the powertrain is 139 hp, and it drives the front wheels. The hybrid's 1.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack recaptures otherwise wasted energy, returning it to power the electric motor, which can supplement the engine torque or power the Ioniq by itself under light loads at low speeds. The plug-in hybrid version for 2018 has a more powerful motor, at 45 kw (60 hp), with an estimated range of 27 miles or more from its 8.9-kwh battery pack.</p>, <p>The battery-electric Ioniq has several differences from the other two. Its grille is replaced by a blanking panel that gives it visual distinction. Inside, conventional shift and parking-brake levers on the tunnel are replaced with a set of buttons and a controller for the interactive vehicle-information display. The 28-kwh battery pack is sited under the rear seat, between the rear wheels, and under the load bay. The Ioniq Electric is rated for more than 120 miles of range, and it's driven by an 88-kw (120-hp) electric motor. The regenerative braking system on all versions is Hyundai's third-generation system, said to offer better a blending of friction and regenerative brake force as the car slows.</p>, <p>In terms of safety, the Ioniq has seven airbags, and includes as standard or optional equipment a long list of the latest active-safety systems, including blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.</p>, <p>The Ioniq Hybrid's better-than-Prius looks and fuel economy, and the Ioniq Electric's 124-mile electric range, would have put the car toward the top of those segments two years ago. But the 2016 Toyota Prius turned out to have considerably improved driving behavior and roadholding—if even more bizarre looks than previous Priuses. And the 2017 Chevy Bolt EV simply reset the bar for affordable electric hatchbacks; it has almost twice the range of the electric Ioniq for about $7,000 more. Hyundai executives in South Korea have said a higher-capacity battery is on the way.</p>]

[<p>The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is a gas-electric version of the popular family four-door, mid-size sedan. It competes with hybrid versions of the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Kia Optima, and Toyota Camry sedans.</p>, <p>When it arrived in 2011, the Hybrid version of Hyundai's swoopy, sixth-generation Sonata was the brand's first U.S.-sold hybrid. It was updated for the 2016 model year with the newest generation of the Sonata, launched in gasoline-only form the previous year. In 2018, the Sonata Hybrid adopted styling from the newest Sonata sedan.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1109915_2018-hyundai-sonata">2018 Hyundai Sonata review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>A Hyundai Sonata Plug-In Hybrid was introduced, with extended all-electric operation that takes on the Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid and possibly both the Chevy Volt and the Toyota Prius Prime as well.</p>, <p><strong>The new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid</strong></p>, <p>In the new version of the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid that was introduced for 2016, Hyundai adopted its latest body style and made slight improvements to motor power and battery capacity as well as major improvements to its control software for clutching the gasoline engine in and out. The gasoline engine changed, too, from a 2.4-liter inline-4 in earlier models to a 2.0-liter inline-4 with direct injection and a long list of efficiency improvements. Fuel economy ratings were up—as high as 40 mpg city, 44 highway. For their hybrid models Hyundai moved the battery under the cargo floor to facilitate flat rear seatback folding.</p>, <p>Hyundai introduced a new 2016 Sonata Plug-In Hybrid that offered a much larger 9.8-kwh battery pack, a somewhat stronger motor system, and 27 miles of electric-only operation—as well as a "Battery Charge" mode that makes it unique among mass-market PHEVs in being able to restore its battery charge while driving (at a cost of lower gas mileage during that time). Recharge times otherwise were less than three hours on Level 2 (240V) or up to nine hours on 110V (household AC).</p>, <p>Updates for the 2017 model year include a larger 7.0-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and a few new colors.</p>, <p>In 2018, a refreshed Sonata Hybrid was introduced that carried over the same powertrains, but with a new face and tail.</p>, <p><strong>Hyundai Sonata Hybrid history</strong></p>, <p>When first introduced, the Sonata Hybrid showcased an all-new lithium polymer battery pack co-developed with LG Chem. While the earlier Hybrid models provided reasonably good EPA fuel economy ratings (36 mpg city, 40 highway), their drivability wasn’t as smooth or responsive as their mechanical arrangement promised.</p>, <p>Instead of the complex planetary-gear power-split configurations that are employed by some other mid-size hybrids like the Fusion Hybrid and Camry Hybrid, the Sonata Hybrid has a so-called Transmission Mounted Electric Device hybrid architecture that uses a motor that spins with the transmission input shaft to provide boost during moderate or quick acceleration, regenerative braking when needed, and light acceleration and electric-only operation under some situations.</p>, <p>Other than that, Sonata Hybrid models of this generation very closely followed their gasoline-engine counterparts. As with all models in this generation, the exterior was bold and flamboyant, although the interior was more plain. Seats weren’t quite as good as some in this class, but this Sonata was a very roomy, comfortable-riding sedan overall. There was plenty of trunk space, too, although the placement of the battery in these early models prevented flat-folding seats.</p>]

It's powered by a new, innovative engine; rides atop a new, front-wheel-drive platform; and boasts semi self-driving technology borrowed from parent-company Nissan.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115568_2019-infiniti-qx50" title="2016 Infiniti QX50 - review">2019 Infiniti QX50 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Infiniti QX50</strong></p>, <p>The newest 2019 Infiniti QX50 showcases some of the automaker's most important technology.</p>, <p>The crossover now rides atop a new skeleton that prioritizes fuel economy with a front-wheel drive setup; the last generation was rear-wheel-drive biased. The new model is sized roughly the same as the outgoing model, but features a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that can constantly change its operation to be more efficient or more powerful, depending on conditions. It makes 268 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque mated to a continuously variable transmission. Infiniti reports that the combination should manage up to 27 mpg combined.</p>, <p>With the QX50, Infiniti also has an entry in the self-driving race. Equipped with Nissan's ProPilot technology, the Infiniti QX50 can manage single lane highway travel for long-distance driving. The technology bundles adaptive cruise control and active lane control for stop-and-go traffic and long drives, but requires driver attention.</p>, <p>The QX50 went on sale in 2018.</p>, <p><strong>Infiniti QX50 history</strong></p>, <p>At one time, the QX50 was the Infiniti EX35—but as a result of an engine change for 2013, the EX went from its old EX35 badge to the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/infiniti_ex37_2013">EX37</a> name. A newer, 325-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 replaced the previous car's 297-hp, 3.5-liter V-6.</p>, <p>Handling and body control aren't quite as great as those of the Q50 sedan (formerly the G37) on which the QX50 is based, but they're impressive for a crossover, and steering weight and feedback are far better than what you'll find in other such vehicles. Fuel economy remains low—even for those who expect it in exchange for the very snappy powertrain performance; EPA ratings are just 17 mpg city, 24 highway with rear- or all-wheel drive, which is considerably thirstier than most of the alternatives.</p>, <p>The QX50 was at first a compact vehicle, but its sleek roofline and performance-oriented layout made for a tight rear seat. For the 2016 model year, the QX50 adopted its Chinese-market body—basically the same with a few inches added in wheelbase—and that's made the back seat as comfortable as anything else in the class, and cargo area is up slightly, too.</p>, <p>The current QX50 continues to be powered by the 3.7-liter V-6, paired with a smooth, quick-shifting 7-speed automatic that comes with steering-wheel shift paddles and can blip the throttle to rev-match downshifts. Both rear- and all-wheel-drive models have a bit more ground clearance, a lightly restyled interior, and lower base prices. </p>, <p>Trim levels include Premium, Premium Plus, Deluxe Touring, and Technology. Standard equipment includes leather seating, push-button start, a power-folding second row, a moonroof, a universal garage-door opener, power steering-column adjustment, and heated front seats. The technology package includes advanced features like blind-spot monitors, a surround-view camera system, adaptive cruise control, and forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the QX50 offered 19-inch alloy wheels as an option.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/infiniti_q50
[<p>The Infiniti Q50 is the Japanese automaker's four-door, five-seat luxury sport sedan. Essentially, it's a revamped version of the former G35/G37 sedan. The Q50 wears different lines and updated mechanicals, but it's quite similar to the G cars in its fundamental layout and engineering. </p>, <p>The Q50 was introduced for the 2014 model year, and was the first of Infiniti's cars to adopt a <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081189_2014-infiniti-q50-no-more-g37-or-m-or-ex-or-fx">new naming convention</a>.</p>, <p>With the Q50, Infiniti has a rival for such vehicles as the Audi A4, BMW 3-Series, Mercedes-Benz C Class, and Cadillac ATS.</p>, <p>For 2018, Infiniti touched up the front and rear bumpers and brought the Q50's interior a little closer to its competitors.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111733_2018-infiniti-q50-review">2018 Infiniti Q50 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Infiniti Q50<br/></strong></p>, <p>Of all of Infiniti's nameplates, the G lineup, and specifically the G37, probably had the most brand recognition, so the move to the Q50 badge was initially confusing. The G37 was known for its steering and handling, an all-around gratifying driving experience for enthusiasts while still offering the luxury expected in this price class. Its faults were a tight interior and a tendency to be a bit louder than competitors.</p>, <p>The Q50 has an obvious design link to its G37 predecessor, but brings the design up to date with a very modern, sleek profile and an interior with a much higher level of detailing. Its looks suggest a sportier car, even if the old car's focus has been muddled in the changeover.</p>, <p><a>In its first two model years, the Q50</a> could be had with two quite different V-6 powertrains and a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive with each. Standard-issue models made use of a 328-horsepower version of the company's tried-and-true 3.7-liter V-6 paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. There also was a Hybrid model, featuring a 3.5-liter V-6 with an electric motor system, two clutches, and a lithium-ion battery pack—essentially the same as the setup that debuted in the M35h hybrid—altogether making a total output of 354 hp.</p>, <p>Just two years after its redesign, the Q50 received three new turbocharged engines last year, as well as an adjustable Dynamic Digital Suspension, and a retuned version of the controversial "steer-by-wire" Direct Adaptive Steering system that debuted in 2014.</p>, <p>Starting with the 2016 model year, the base engine became a 208-hp 2.0-liter turbo-4 found in the QX30 compact and the Mercedes CLA/GLA. The old V-6 was also ditched in favor of a pair of twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6s from a new engine family. In base form, the V-6 makes 300 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. In the Red Sport 400, it spins out 400 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque. The Hybrid edition carries over, though it has been re-rated to 360 horsepower.</p>, <p>For 2017, the model lineup includes 2.0t, 2.0t Premium, 2.0t Sport, 3.0t Premium, 3.0t Sport, Red Sport 400, and Hybrid models. Rear- and all-wheel drive are offered. A new Sport model comes with the base 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, there's a new Design package for V-6 models, and minor equipment upgrades have been made.</p>, <p>While the G37 was known for its great steering and handling, the Q50 takes a slight step back from those accolades. The adaptive suspension offers adjustable dampers and helps flatten the attitude through corners. We found, however, that the summer tires on the Red Sport 400 lack the grip we expect in a sport sedan. In fact, when pushed, no Q50 is up to the handling standards set by the 3-Series and ATS.</p>, <p>Infiniti introduced a first-of-its-kind steer-by-wire system as an option on the Q50 in 2014 and updated it for 2016 to provide better handling and more feel. Dubbed Direct Adaptive Steering, it lets drivers choose from several settings, with adjustments for weight and ratio. Initially, we thought it provided an unnatural, video-game disconnected feel. The system became better for 2016, offering quick responses at low speed and plenty of heft at high speeds. Still, it lacks some of the feel that a good hydraulic- or electric-assist system can provide.</p>, <p>Inside, the Q50 builds on a G sedan-sized package—meaning that rear leg room may still be on the tight side for adults. The front seats offer exceptional comfort, and the trunk is rather large at 18 cubic feet. Hybrid models lose some cargo space due to the lithium-ion battery, but they still have a 14.1 cubic-foot trunk. Trims build on the plush, modern look of the Q70 sedan, with "Kacchu" aluminum and maple wood detailing.</p>, <p>The Q50 offers plenty of active safety technologies, including a surround-view camera system, adaptive headlights, high beam assist, blind spot intervention, lane-departure warnings and prevention, lane-keep assist, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, and backup collision intervention with rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The Q50 comes standard with the Infiniti InTouch infotainment system, with dual touchscreens. More important info is up top and finer controls live on the lower touch display. This setup throws its hat into the ring with systems like BMW's iDrive, Ford Sync 3, and Cadillac's CUE. Infiniti's work is neither the best nor the worst implementation of a complex infotainment system. It can be difficult to remember where to expect or look for info or controls between the two screens, but the most important items are relatively easy to access.</p>, <p>The Q50 is also the first Infiniti model to offer Infiniti Connection, a security- and concierge-related telematics service that has a companion smartphone app and provides remote monitoring (of teen drivers, for example), SOS call and collision notification, as well as a personal assistant service.</p>]

[<p>The Infiniti QX60 is a large, luxury crossover SUV competing with the Acura MDX, the Volvo XC90, and, despite only having two rows of seats, the Lexus RX. Initially offered with two powertrains: a 3.5-liter V-6 or a 2.5-liter inline-4 and battery pack, it was pared down to one for 2018.</p>, <p>The QX60 was, for a single model year, known as the Infiniti JX before the automaker implemented a <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081189_2014-infiniti-q50-no-more-g37-or-m-or-ex-or-fx">new naming strategy</a>. It carried over essentially unchanged from the JX after its name change, but was heavily updated for 2016 and mildly revised for 2017. The biggest change for 2017 was more power from the V-6.</p>, <p>For 2018, Infiniti canceled the slow-selling QX60 Hybrid.</p>, <p>With the QX60, Infiniti has a popular crossover, although we say it lacks some of the polish found in the Acura MDX and Volvo XC90. The Infiniti is relatively aged compared to those crossovers and it's shows in some places, including available options.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/infiniti_qx60_2018">2018 Infiniti QX60 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The QX60 shares its platform with the Nissan Pathfinder, and you can see the less-expensive model's influence somewhat in the overall shape and size, as well as under the hood. Though it's also closely related to Nissan's minivan, the QX60 distances itself from that shape with an extended front end and an arcing roofline that drops lower in the rear. A new grille added in 2016 integrates with the lower air intake, but the look is still familiar and it combines with the crescent D-pillar to tie the QX60's design with the rest of the luxury brand's models. We find that the well-tailored sheet metal avoids the bulky look of some similar-sized crossovers. Inside, the material colors are rich, though much of the switchgear and some of the layout is shared with less-expensive Nissan models like the Pathfinder.</p>, <p>While the 2013 JX only offered one powertrain—a 3.5-liter V-6 and continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT)—the QX60 model line added the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083214_2014-infiniti-qx60-hybrid-bows-in-new-york">QX60 Hybrid</a>. The gas-electric powertrain used a 2.5-liter supercharged 4-cylinder engine that has a single 15-kilowatt electric motor, with a clutch on either end, between the engine and the CVT. The combined system was rated at about 250 hp. The electric motor assists the engine when accelerating, or captures energy to recharge the lithium-ion battery pack when coasting or decelerating. It doesn't, however, have the ability to run the vehicle solely on electric power, even at low speeds—unlike its closest hybrid-luxury-crossover competitor, the five-seat Lexus RX 450h. The QX Hybrid earned an EPA combined rating of 26 mpg with either front- or all-wheel drive. The non-hybrid QX60 returned 19 mpg city, 26 highway, 22 combined with all-wheel drive and 21/27/22 mpg with front drive.</p>, <p>The automaker shelved the QX60 Hybrid for 2018 due to slow sales.</p>, <p>We'd hardly call the QX60's third row adult-friendly for long distances, but the seven-passenger capability it affords will be appreciated by large families. There's also some packaging innovation. For instance, the second-row seat can move forward, even if a child safety seat is latched into place, to give third-row access. And if no safety seat is installed, kids can climb to the third row through a 19-inch gap afforded by the articulating second-row seat. It's worth noting that the battery in the QX60 Hybrid didn't take up any load-bay space, so cargo capacity is unaffected, which isn't always the case in hybrid versions of conventional vehicles.</p>, <p>All the safety features—and in particular, those with leading-edge active-safety technology—in the QX60 might help win over busy moms and dads. A rearview camera is standard, and there's an excellent surround-view camera system that also scans the area immediately behind the tailgate when the QX60 is put into reverse. Other available safety features include lane-departure warning and prevention, blind-spot warning and intervention, and forward collision warning. For 2016, the forward collision warning system added emergency braking and pedestrian detection and Infiniti's also adds Predictive Forward Collision Warning that can read two cars ahead.</p>, <p>The QX60 comes with some very welcome standard equipment, such as a moonroof with an electric sunshade. Infiniti also offers an entertainment package to keep rear-seat travelers happy, as well as a premium speaker system from Bose. Seat cooling is available for the front seats while the second row can be optioned with heat. The only big miss on the QX60 is its infotainment setup; it's shared with other Infiniti models and like them has a somewhat convoluted menu structure that can be difficult to navigate.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/infiniti_qx30
[<p>The Infiniti QX30 is a family of all-wheel-drive compact hatchbacks that went on sale in mid-2016 and comes via the partnership between Nissan/Renault and Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz.</p>, <p>The vehicles are built at Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, England, on underpinnings shared with the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class sedan and GLA-Class crossover, although Infiniti emphasizes that the design, sheet metal, and cabin materials are its own.</p>, <p>With the QX30, Infiniti has a new entry-level car that fits below the QX50 crossover. The QX30 goes up against a wide range of compact luxury models such as the BMW X1, Land Rover Discovery Sport, Lincoln MKC, Acura RDX, and Audi Q3 and Q5. With a sportier, lower-riding QX30 Sport, it also serves as a direct rival to the Audi A3 Sportback.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/infiniti_qx30_2018">2018 Infiniti QX30 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Elsewhere in the world, the vehicle that Americans know as the QX30 is split into two different models—the Q30 and QX30. Although in other markets lower-riding, front-wheel-drive versions of this vehicle are called Q30 and higher-riding all-wheel-drive versions are called QX30, in the U.S. they're all badged QX30. </p>, <p>The QX30 is designed to look as attractive in tight urban situations as in rural environs, and with the sort of versatility that will meet elegant luxury-vehicle needs or rugged activity-vehicle needs.</p>, <p>The QX30 is about 174 inches long and has the parking footprint of a compact car. In all-wheel-drive models, which may be particularly appealing to those in regions with wintery road conditions, its ride height has been raised 1.2 inches, and in its lower-body treatments it gets just a little more visual ruggedness. You might even call it the QX30 AWD model an “Outbacked” version of the front-wheel-drive QX30.</p>, <p>There's also a sporty version, called the QX30 Sport, which comes with a stance lowered 0.6 inch and more aggressive front and rear fascias, plus cross-drilled front brake rotors and 19-inch wheels on performance tires.</p>, <p>The styling of the QX30 is quite bold, fitting with Infiniti's latest idiom. The nose is angular in side profile, but flows rearward from overhead, with nicely sculpted hood and fender lines. The design language in the QX30 is a close relationship between sharp creases and sweeping, organic surfacing. The greenhouse is short, and perhaps the most noteworthy design element is the crescent C-pillar, standing out in chrome as signature that’s echoed throughout some of the latest Infiniti models. Inside, the look heads in a different direction, too, with a broad, asymmetrical sweep across the dashboard; black cloth upholstery is standard, while leatherette and nappa leather are available. Look close enough at the dash and doors and you’ll no doubt see some commonality with the Mercedes-Benz products.</p>, <p>The QX30 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that makes 208 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. Shifts are handled by a 7-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, and the all-wheel-drive system can send up to 50 percent of power to the rear wheels as needed. The QX30 is offered in other markets with a manual transmission and a diesel engine, but neither are likely in the U.S.</p>, <p>Inside, the QX30 is a relatively straightforward hatchback, with good front-seat space and a back seat that is OK for head room but a bit tight for adults in leg room and knee room. It is also almost impossible to fit three across back there. Seats in the QX30 are of note; they use a “spinal support” design that aims to closely match the curvature of the spine and more evenly distribute support throughout. Infotainment is handled by a 7.0-inch screen that accepts touch-and-swipe controls.</p>, <p>The QX30’s safety kit includes options such as surround-view cameras, automatic high beams, an automated parking system, blind-spot monitors, lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and forward collision warning with emergency braking.</p>, <p>In its second year on sale, the 2018 Infiniti QX30 was carried over without changes from its debut a year before.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/infiniti_qx70
[<p>The Infiniti QX70 conveys style and grace with its curvaceous exterior and warm cabin appointments.</p>, <p>Before Infiniti's wholesale name change, the QX70 was known as the FX. The QX70 carries forward with the same strengths: performance of a sport sedan and an all-around attitude that makes it a standout versus either family-oriented premium crossovers or more truck-like luxury SUVs.</p>, <p>Rival models have included the Acura MDX and now-defunct ZDX, BMW X5 and X6, Range Rover Sport, Porsche Cayenne, and Mercedes-Benz GLE.</p>, <p>For 2017, the only changes that have come to the aging but lively crossover are a new grille design and a pair of new paint colors. Infiniti ended production of the QX70 after the 2017 model year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/infiniti_qx70_2017">2017 Infiniti QX70 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The QX70 is a very sporty mid-size crossover with a striking design. We find it to be one of the more entertaining sport 'utes—both visually and from behind the wheel. The Infiniti QX70 name has very little history behind it, but the model actually goes back a while.</p>, <p>Infiniti's current naming convention, adopted in 2014, means model names no longer include a nod to engine displacement, so the former FX37 is now known simply as the QX70. Badges to denote engine displacement—3.7—live on the front fenders. For a full explanation, and a cheat sheet, check out our story on <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081189_2014-infiniti-q50-no-more-g37-or-m-or-ex-or-fx">Infiniti's naming strategy</a>, which further discusses these changes.</p>, <p>With a 325-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 under the shapely hood, the QX70 has strong acceleration. Infiniti used to offer a 390-hp 5.0-liter V-8, but it was dropped for the 2015 model year. That's OK because handling has always been at its best in the QX70 with the V-6 and rear-wheel drive; that's where it feels most like a sport sedan. The QX70 is one of the best-handling crossovers or utility vehicles of any kind, while the 7-speed automatic transmission fits the performance personality, with downshift rev-matching and steering-wheel paddle shifters.</p>, <p>The QX70's V-6 is a bit loud and feels somewhat coarse. Compared to other luxury SUVs, the QX70 lets more sound into the cabin. Road noise is notable, with the big tires making themselves known on grooved pavement and uneven surfaces, which can burst the luxury bubble for some.</p>, <p>The QX70 has a sleek interior featuring rich finishes and available quilted leather seating that gives it a very upscale feel. Front-seat comfort is top notch, and the view over the rippled hood is higher than a car's but lower than that of some SUVs, a nice compromise. Space in the QX70 is limited in the rear seats as a result of the sloping roofline, and the storage behind is likewise reduced. The high cargo floor doesn't help much, either. Similar to other slant-back SUVs, sporty style takes precedence over utility.</p>, <p>The QX70 comes in just one base model with rear- or all-wheel drive. QX70 models can top $60,000 when you add the contents of the Sport, Premium, Deluxe Touring, and Technology packages. Notable available features include a lane-departure warning and prevention system, adaptive bi-xenon headlights, and a navigation system with an especially good display and interface. Other standalone options on the QX70 include a rear entertainment system with dual headrest-mounted monitors, roof-rail crossbars, a cargo organizer, and a tow package.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/infiniti_q60
[<p>The Infiniti Q60 is a luxury two-door with four seats. Formerly available as a coupe or as a convertible, the newest Q60 only comes in hardtop form.</p>, <p>Competition comes mainly from Germany—including the BMW 4-Series coupe and convertible, hard- and soft-top versions of the Audi A5 and S5, and Mercedes-Benz's C-Class coupe—but also from the new Lexus RC coupe and Caddy's two-door ATS variant.</p>, <p>The Q60 is new for 2017 and mostly unchanged for 2018 aside from renamed trim levels.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/infiniti_q60_2018">2018 Infiniti Q60 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Infiniti Q60</strong></p>, <p>For 2017, Infiniti unveiled a new coupe based on the Q50. The new Q60 follows the same powertrain lineup as well with a trio of turbocharged options. A base 2.0-liter turbo-4 is standard, but an updated 3.0-liter V-6—distantly related to the Nissan GT-R engine—is available in two tunes: 300 and 400 horsepower. A 7-speed automatic is the only transmission available, and all-wheel drive is available on every powertrain.</p>, <p>The Q60 shows off a new styling language for Infiniti, dubbed "Powerful Elegance," which it shows off in its muscular and organic nose.</p>, <p>Base versions start at Pure, with Premium models next. From there, 3.0t Premium models are next, then Sport, and finally the coupe's top-of-the-line Red Sport trims replaces the brand's former performance pinnacle, which it called IPL. Frustratingly, telling these cars apart comes down to what color the "S" badge is on the cars—a silver S means there are 300 horses available under the hood, a red S means there's 400.</p>, <p>All models get the same interior layout, including Infiniti's dual touchscreen setup that it cribbed from the Q50. The coupe places more of a premium on front passengers than the sedan, however, with better room up front for driver and passenger.</p>, <p>Infiniti also used the Q60 coupe to unveil its latest "drive-by-wire" steering system that replaces mechanical linkages with an electronically controlled setup. The automaker called it Direct Adaptive Steering, and made it available as an option in Premium trimmed models.</p>, <p><strong>Q60 and G Coupe History</strong></p>, <p>Born of a sedan line that has itself grown from G35 Sedan to G37 Sedan to the all-new Q50, but built from the ground up to be a two-door, the Q60 draws its lineage back to the G35 Coupe, which was introduced in 2003. Powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 from which it took its name, the G35 Coupe quickly drew attention for its pleasing, if none-too-daring styling, well-executed cabin, and engaging performance.</p>, <p>
The G35 carried on until 2007, and in 2008, a new engine and a new body design brought us the G37 Coupe, followed a year later by the G37 Convertible. The new engine, a 3.7-liter V-6 bred from the 3.5-liter that preceded it, was rated at 330 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque, a gain of about 10 percent over the G35. A 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic were offered, powering the rear-wheels, or, in G37x trim, all four wheels. All-wheel-drive models were only offered with the automatic transmission.</p>, <p>
Though the new 3.7-liter engine wasn't quite as sonorous as its predecessor, its high power output and willingness to rev up to its 7,500-rpm limit quickly won fans. As the model line developed, particularly in Sport trim, the G37 became recognized as a legitimate luxury/performance coupe, capable of running with the established German leaders of the segment, though at the expense of ride quality in more ordinary driving.</p>, <p>
The previous G37 Coupe was available in four trim levels: base G37 Coupe; G37 Coupe Journey; G37 Coupe AWD; and G37 Coupe Sport 6MT. The Sport model was the only one to offer the 6-speed manual transmission. The other three models feature a 7-speed automatic with available steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, manual shift mode, and downshift rev-matching. The G37 Coupe AWD is the only all-wheel-drive model, but all four share the same 330-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 engine.</p>, <p>In 2011, Infiniti introduced the IPL G37 Coupe, offering an up-rated 348-hp version of the 3.7-liter V-6 engine, IPL-tuned suspension, unique wheels, and unique aerodynamic bodywork. This high-performance version of the G37 Coupe puts an even sharper edge on the car than the Sport model. In late 2011, Infiniti unveiled the Convertible version of the IPL G ahead of initial sales for 2013. Otherwise, the G Coupe (and Convertible) carried into 2013 with only a few very minor changes.</p>, <p>Both body styles were available with a manual transmission, while only the coupe offers all-wheel drive. In the transition from G37 to Q60, Infiniti dropped the former base G37 coupe, leaving the Q60 Coupe Journey, the Q60 Coupe AWD, and the Q60S Coupe 6MT. Convertibles were available in two trim levels: the Q60 Convertible and the Q60S Convertible 6MT. Infiniti also offers its high-performance IPL versions of both body styles.</p>, <p>The primary differences between versions of the Q60 were by their extended names: the Q60 Coupe AWD was the only variant to offer all-wheel drive, while the Q60S Coupe and Convertible 6MT were only models to offer a 6-speed manual transmission. As with the G37 cars before it, a paddle-shifted 7-speed automatic was standard on the rest of the Q60 range. The same 330-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 engine that powered the G37 provided the Q60's motivation.</p>, <p>Higher-performance versions were also available from the Infiniti Performance Line, or IPL, range. Both the coupe and convertible were offered in Q60S IPL and Q60S IPL 6MT versions. Again, the difference between the two were the transmissions; 6MT models had a 6-speed manual, while the standard car used the 7-speed automatic found in the rest of the Q60 range. All IPL versions of the Q60 shared an upgraded, 348-hp version of the 3.7-liter V-6 engine as well as suspension and styling tweaks. They rode more firmly than the other cars, trading some of the balanced comfort for handling, which made them feel more related to the Nissan 370Z.</p>, <p>Standard equipment lists were extensive, with the Journey and other higher trims bringing more equipment and more options. All models included a standard 7.0-inch color information display; HID bi-xenon headlights; power windows, mirrors, door locks, and seats; keyless ignition; automatic climate control; and much more. Optional upgrades varied by model, but included sport-tuned suspension; an 11-speaker Bose audio system (standard on the Sport model); a dual-occupant memory driver's seat; GPS navigation; voice-recognition control for infotainment and navigation; and sonar-assisted parking sensors.</p>]

[<p>The Infiniti QX80 is a full-size luxury sport-utility vehicle—and the biggest vehicle to wear the belt-buckle logo. A new addition to the Infiniti lineup in 2004, the QX80 formerly was known as the QX56, back when it was built in the U.S.</p>, <p>With the QX80, Infiniti has a competitor in the high-stakes fight for full-size SUV luxury dollars. The Cadillac Escalade, Mercedes-Benz GLS Class, Land Rover Range Rover, Lincoln Navigator, and Lexus LX570 compete for high-margin money.</p>, <p>The 2018 version was revised with a new face and some interior improvements.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/infiniti_qx80_2018" title="2018 Infiniti QX80 - review">2018 Infiniti QX80 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new QX80</strong></p>, <p>The first major model change for the vehicle that would become the Infiniti QX80 came in 2011. As a part of a wholesale movement to give Infiniti more distance from Nissan's U.S. offerings, the big SUV changed platforms and homes.</p>, <p>The 2011 Infiniti QX56 turned away from its past as a plusher version of the Nissan Armada SUV. Instead, the name was applied to a new version of the sixth-generation Nissan Patrol, which was not sold in the U.S. (That has changed for 2017, as the new Nissan Armada is basically a Patrol by another name.) The new vehicle can still hold up to eight passengers, and it continues to offer a big 5.6-liter V-8. This new engine, however, makes 400 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque, and comes paired with a 7-speed automatic.</p>, <p>For 2014, that QX56 became today's QX80. Infiniti announced in late 2012 that it would rename all of its offerings with numbers and letters that depicted their relative size and place within the lineup, instead of basing them on engine displacement. As the QX80 is the largest SUV, it gets the biggest number.</p>, <p>The 2015 model year brought <span>a new Limited model to the top of the QX80 range. The package, which continues to this day, includes a Truffle Brown cabin marked by a palette of brown, black, and silver leather appointments and wood and trim. Quilted leather seats, a suede-like headliner, silver accent piping, and leather-wrapped speaker grilles for the instrument panel are among the many dress-up items within. </span></p>, <p>For 2016, Infiniti added a limited run of 1,000 Signature Edition models that featured a split bench rear seat, a Saddle Tan high-contrast interior, bodyside moldings, and chrome mirror caps, plus a rear entertainment system and the host of safety features that were otherwise available in other packages.</p>, <p>Today's QX80 is basically the same vehicle as the QX56 that came before it. The big V-8 provides strong acceleration. With rear-wheel drive, the QX80 gets the same 14 mpg city, 20 highway ratings as its differently named predecessor. The QX80 also retains the optional linked hydraulic suspension, which helps reduce body roll on-road and also improves articulation should the luxury bus find itself off pavement, allowing the wheels to basically unlink and move more freely, much like with active anti-roll bars. Its tow rating of 8,500 pounds also carries over.</p>, <p>The QX80 is handsome overall, though some take issue with the very tall hood, blunt front-end styling, and bulbous, organic shapes. The cabin is extremely plush, with nicely contoured leather and wood trim that looks inviting and masculine at the same time. The first two rows of seats are very comfortable for adults of any size, while the third-row bench is sized for kids. The behemoth offers plenty of cargo space, one of its strengths.</p>, <p>Features lag behind the Cadillac Escalade, but the QX80 has a standard surround-view camera system with rear cross traffic alerts; the SUV will apply brakes if it senses an obstacle crossing behind it when in reverse. Other standard features include navigation, DVD audio, Bluetooth audio streaming, and keyless ignition.</p>, <p>The QX80 also comes with the Infiniti dealer experience, something that rivals like Lincoln and Cadillac still can't quite match, more than 25 years down the road.</p>, <p>Updates for 2017 included standard trailer sway control, pedestrian detection for the forward emergency braking system, and changes to the interior and exterior color palettes.</p>, <p><strong>QX80/QX56 history</strong></p>, <p>The Infiniti QX80's lineage stretches all the way back to the 2004 model year, when the then-QX56 was launched as a more luxurious spin-off of the big, bruising Nissan Armada full-size SUV. Built in Mississippi right next to the Armada, both vehicles rode on a version of the Titan pickup's body-on-frame platform. While there were almost no mechanical differences when compared to its cheaper kin, the QX56 was more plush. Both vehicles used the Titan's sole powertrain—a 5.6-liter V-8 that over time saw its output climb to 320 hp and 393 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>With a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive and a standard 5-speed automatic, the QX56 was a brawny machine that could tow up to 9,000 pounds. In other ways, however, it came up short. The interior wasn't as luxurious as those of competitors like the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator. To fix that flaw, Infiniti upgraded the cabin of the QX56 with better materials, while it also face-lifted the sport-ute and added new audio and navigation features.</p>]

[<p>The Infiniti Q70 is a four-door luxury sedan, the largest car offered by Nissan's upscale brand. </p>, <p>Until 2014, the Q70 was known as the Infiniti M. Now renamed, but essentially the same car, it competes with the Audi A6, Jaguar XF, Lexus GS, and the Acura RLX. </p>, <p>With the Q70, Infiniti has a full-size luxury sedan, although it prioritizes sportiness over luxury compared to others in its class.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/infiniti_q70_2018" title="2017 Infiniti Q70 - review">2018 Infiniti Q70 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>The Q70 represents the third generation of the mid-size Infiniti sedan, with earlier generations of the Infiniti M having launched in 2003 and 2006.</p>, <p>Today's Q70 debuted as the third-generation Infiniti M at the 2009 Los Angeles Auto Show, and went on sale in spring 2010. Along with other Infinitis, it was renamed in 2014; that new naming system is bound to generate confusion for a few years more. (For more details, see the rundown on <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081189_2014-infiniti-q50-no-more-g37-or-m-or-ex-or-fx">Infiniti's naming strategy</a>.)</p>, <p>The car was previewed by a stunning concept sedan, the Infiniti Essence, that revealed styling themes and a design language for the brand. The flowing lines helped to boost the car's profile among the crowded set of traditional luxury competitors, which was then expanding with the addition of the similarly expressive Jaguar XF.</p>, <p>The Infiniti Q70's styling has always looked handsome and is aging well. The big back seat, fine handling, communicative steering, and balanced ride also win the Q70 praise. As for the interior, fit and finish are dialed in, and the optional silver-hued wood trim is especially attractive.</p>, <p>When this generation launched, it offered two engines. What was then called the M37 (now the Q70 3.7) packs a 3.7-liter V-6 and is pretty quick on its feet, although it is noisier than its pricier counterpart. For a extra cash, the Q70 5.6 offers a 5.6-liter V-8 with a 0-to-60-mph time of about five seconds, which is very fleet for a standard series-production sedan not wearing a performance label. Although it's starting to get up there in age, we've always enjoyed this model's smooth V-8 engine.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive can be ordered on the V-6 (nee M37) and V-8 (nee M56) models of the Infiniti Q70. A Sport Package is available on both rear- and all-wheel-drive models and adds 20-inch wheels and performance tires, upgraded brakes, and a number of appearance enhancements.</p>, <p>The Q70 Hybrid (which was introduced for 2012 as the M35h) pairs a performance-oriented single-motor hybrid system to a 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The combination puts out 350 hp, but gets an EPA combined rating that now sits at 29 mpg city, 34 highway, 31 combined. Unlike many hybrids, this model manages to mix fuel efficiency with driving fun. Its steering and dynamics are almost as good as those of the rest of the range, and the boost in gas mileage—the V-8 with rear-wheel drive is rated at just 19 mpg combined—is a strong case for considering the hybrid Q70. In some situations, however, it is not the most seamless of hybrids, as the engine's starting and stopping can be felt very acutely. This is, in some part, due to the way the hybrid transmission is designed and is a trade-off to the more direct feel offered.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Q70 gained an extended-wheelbase version. This model, called Q70L, adds 5.9 inches of rear leg room and 7 inches to the overall length. The Q70L is available with either V-6 or V-8, but not the hybrid powertrain.</p>, <p>The 2016 model year brought very little change to the Q70 lineup—although there is a new Q70 Premium Select edition brought some sportier exterior cues and special 20-inch wheels, plus semi-aniline leather seats, aluminum trim finish, illuminated kick plates and floormats with contrast piping.</p>, <p>The 2017 and 2018 models were relatively unchanged.</p>]

[<p>The Jaguar I-Pace is the British luxury automaker’s first all-electric vehicle and the first to challenge Tesla for luxury EV money.</p>, <p>Announced in 2016 as a concept, the I-Pace went on sale in 2018. In the U.S., it costs more than $70,000 to start, before federal tax credits and any applicable state incentives are applied. The I-Pace is powered by a 90-kwh battery, with an expected range of roughly 240 miles.</p>, <p>With the I-Pace, Jaguar has a toe in quickly rising waters; luxury automaker such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi have announced plans for an onslaught of luxury electric vehicles in coming years. Much smaller than those automakers, Jaguar beat them all to the punch.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115704_2019-jaguar-i-pace">2019 Jaguar I-Pace review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The I-Pace takes some familiar cues from the rest of Jaguar’s lineup, and wraps them around a new, electric-vehicle architecture. The I-Pace isn’t an electrified version of the F-Pace or E-Pace crossovers—it’s wholly separate.</p>, <p>The electric crossover may read more as a tall wagon to some shoppers, certainly within Jaguar’s design purview. Where the I-Pace diverges is in its execution: the wave-like body lines crest and fall around the front and rear wheels; the cab-forward design differs from any conventionally powered Jaguar so far; and the door handles recess into the body and automatically extend to greet passengers.</p>, <p>Inside, the I-Pace features a version of the automaker’s 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system and touch controls for vehicle functions and climate controls. Despite its futuristic drivetrain, the I-Pace eschews minimalist design inside for something that may be more recognizable to most drivers.</p>, <p>A pushbutton transmission commands the electric driveline that consists of two electric motors, one for each axle, that produce 394 horsepower combined. The I-Pace will be all-wheel drive and, thanks to the battery placement under the floor, will feature an ideal 50:50 weight distribution. That latter figure may appeal to performance car buyers who’ve made the mental shift to electric performance—Jaguar looks to help more of those buyers along with an announced racing series composed entirely of I-Pace crossovers.</p>, <p>Recharging the battery in the I-Pace up to 80 percent may take as little as 40 minutes, according to Jaguar. Early adopters in the U.S. may have a hard time doing that: that charge time is based on some 100-kw fast chargers that are slowly rolling out across Europe. Stateside, 50-kw fast chargers are more common, and Jaguar said the I-Pace could recharge a depleted battery to 80 percent in 85 minutes. At home on a Level 2 charger, the Jaguar takes 10 hours to 80 percent and 13 hours to 100 percent from a fully discharged battery—something few EV owners will actually do.</p>, <p>Jaguar said that the I-Pace will be available in S, SE, HSE, and First Edition trim levels.</p>, <p>The 2019 Jaguar I-Pace goes on in late 2018. Orders began March 2018.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/jaguar_f-type
[<p>The Jaguar F-Type is proof that the British brand is back in the sports-car business. Though Jaguar has produced a series of open-top two-seaters and 2+2s, they were really more grand tourers than sports cars. </p>, <p>The F-Type arrived for the 2014 model year as the replacement for the XK coupe and convertible. It shares some of that car's aluminum construction techniques as well. This year, the F-Type lineup adds a new base model powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-4. That engine is available in both coupe and roadster guise, albeit only with an 8-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With the F-Type, Jaguar has a coupe or convertible that can compete against luxury cars such as the Mercedes-Benz SLC Class, Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman. In top specs, the F-Type is rivals for the Chevy Corvette, Porsche 911, Mercedes-AMG GT—even some supercars.</p>, <p>For 2019, Jaguar shuffled its trim levels with a new naming scheme.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jaguar_f-type_2019" title="2019 Jaguar F-Type - review">review of the 2019 Jaguar F-Type</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The F-Type ushers in some new design themes for Jaguar. It sports a high front end—in part to handle European crash regulations—and LED front lighting, with some strong influences of Maseratis and Corvettes of the past. The taillights are also LED units, and Jaguar says they're the thinnest shapes that could be manufactured. The cockpit has an asymmetric, driver-oriented theme, with the passenger fenced in by a large center-tunnel grab handle—a strong visual cue to the F-Type's dynamic intentions. There's a big LCD screen for infotainment and settings, while a set of rotary knobs controls some secondary functions. Not everything's been steered off into touchscreen interfaces, thankfully.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079437_2013-jaguar-f-type-preview-2012-paris-auto-show">Jaguar F-Type was offered with three engines at launch</a>. Two were supercharged V-6s, both 3.0-liter units, one with 340 horsepower and the other with 380 hp. In its slowest form, the F-Type will accelerate to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. But with the top-level supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 with 495 hp, it's capable of 4.2-second 0-60 mph times and a top speed of 186 mph. A 2.0-liter turbo-4 was added in 2018.</p>, <p>At launch, the F-Type was offered with rear-wheel drive only, and all models featured an 8-speed automatic transmission. At that time, Jaguar said it was considering adding a manual transmission to the car, something it made good on with the announcement of the 2016 model.</p>, <p>A bit larger than the intended competition of SLC, Boxster, and Z4, the Jaguar F-Type is about 176 inches long, riding on a wheelbase of 103.2 inches. Curb weight of about 3,500 pounds is kept low with aluminum construction down to the suspension level—it's all independent, and steering is electric. There's also an available adaptive suspension that allows the F-Type's responses to be switched from a comfort mode to a sport mode.</p>, <p>Luxury features haven't been left off the menu just to save a few ounces—not if the well-heeled buyer wants them. Power sport seats have manual fore/aft adjustments to save weight, but upgraded "Performance" seats are an option, as is full power adjustment. Audio systems come from Meridian, with either 10 or 12 speakers, and either 380 or 770 watts of power. The convertible top is power-operated, and it's lined in Thinsulate to reduce noise and heat transfer, folding in such a way that no tonneau cover is needed. It also lowers or rises into place in 12 seconds, at speeds of up to 30 mph. A <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080749_jaguar-shows-off-f-type-personalization-options-in-l-a">wide range of personalization options</a> are also available.</p>, <p>A coupe version of the F-Type was launched in 2014. It was also the only body style offered in the new V-8 R trim, which is good for 550 hp and 4.0-second 0-60 mph times, as well as a 186-mph top speed.</p>, <p>For 2016, all-wheel drive became available on the V-6 S and standard on the R. Rear-drive V-6 and V-6 S models became available with a 6-speed manual transmission. The convertible gained an R model, while the former V-8 S convertible model was discontinued.</p>, <p>For 2017, the F-Type's trunk was reconfigured for slightly more storage space. The headline for the new model year, though, undoubtedly was the addition of the most powerful F-Type yet, the SVR. With more horsepower and a top speed of more than 200 mph, the F-Type SVR offers standard all-wheel drive and a 0-60 mph time of under 3.5 seconds.</p>, <p>The 2018 model year brought a new base engine: a 2.0-liter turbo-4 paired to an 8-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/jaguar_e-pace
[<p>The Jaguar E-Pace takes over as the brand's smallest crossover SUV for the 2018 model year, giving the bigger F-Pace a relief after just a year on sale.</p>, <p>With the E-Pace, Jaguar will have a two-SUV lineup–at least until it adds its upcoming battery-powered I-Pace electric crossover SUV.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our review of the <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115248_2018-jaguar-e-pace">2018 Jaguar E-Pace</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The E-Pace renders some of the cues of Jag's bigger SUV on a shorter body, though the two are built on different architectures. The E-Pace has a similar tall front end, a mesh grille flanked by two large air intakes and one thin wide one, and angled LED running lights that underscore its headlights. A deep recess is sculpted into the lower half of its door panels, while the rear fenders arch from the midpoint of the rear doors. Fender vents and a cat-eyed rear side window match up with a steeply raked roofline and a slim band of angled LED taillights. The roof can be painted black, or fitted with panoramic glass.</p>, <p>The interior of the E-Pace cribs the cockpit-style layout from the F-Type sports car. The center stack of controls angles toward the driver, with a built-in grab handle that walls it off from the passenger. Round climate controls live below a wide touchscreen and above the automatic shift lever. The dash wears stitched material for a neat, finished appearance.</p>, <p>A 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 powers the new 4,175-pound E-Pace. In base specification, it's rated at 246 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque. The uprated version spins out 296 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both are part of Jaguar's in-house Ingenium engine family, and sport direct fuel injection, and twin-scroll and variable-geometry turbochargers. Jaguar promises the lower-output model will hit 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, while the uprated version will shave that number down to 5.9 seconds.</p>, <p>In the U.S., the engines come only with a 9-speed automatic. The ZF-sourced gearbox also is available in the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque and Discovery Sport. On R-Dynamic models, the E-Pace adds steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles. The usual shift modes apply: Eco mode slows down throttle and upshifts quickly, while Dynamic mode turns up the wick on shift speed and eagerness. A slush mode helps the E-Pace stick to the road when grip subsides due to snow, ice, and rain.</p>, <p>All-wheel-drive systems differ by output. The 246-hp E-Pace splits torque between the front and rear wheels in the usual way, and has a braking system that simulates torque vectoring. The 296-hp E-Pace has a more sophisticated system that can disconnect the rear axle for better fuel economy, or split power between the rear wheels through twin wet clutches, for more precise power distribution and better cornering behavior.</p>, <p>MacPherson struts in front couple with an integral-link rear suspension. Some components are cast in aluminum, and both setups are isolated on subframes for better chassis performance. An adaptive set of dampers can be adjusted to normal or Dynamic settings, while the infotainment houses a display that clocks lap times and cornering forces. The crossover's stability control has a low-speed mode that smooths out launches on mixed-traction surfaces.</p>, <p>Inside the E-Pace, Jaguar provides seats for five passengers in a body composed of steel, aluminum, magnesium and composites. It's much less aluminum intensive than the F-Pace, but has some panels glued and bonded in the same way as Jaguar's aluminum-intensive cars. Overall, it's 173.0 inches long and rides on a 105.6-inch wheelbase (think Honda Civic), and its split-fold rear seats can boost the cargo space from 24.2 cubic feet with the rear bench up, to 52.5 cubic feet with the rear bench folded down.</p>, <p>Base models come with synthetic leather, while leather is an option on some versions and standard on the plushest models. The center console holds four big water bottles, and the doors have molded-in pockets for additional storage.</p>, <p>Safety options include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, and lane-departure warnings.</p>, <p>The E-Pace comes with cruise control, power features, and Bluetooth with audio streaming. A 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system can be upgraded to a 12.3-inch screen. High-power audio, ambient lighting, a head-up display, and up to five USB ports can be specified, as can a power-operated, gesture-controlled tailgate and in-car data service, as well as navigation.</p>, <p>Priced from below $40,000, the E-Pace went on sale in 2018.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/jaguar_f-pace
[<p>The Jaguar F-Pace is the British automaker's long-awaited crossover SUV. A five-passenger utility vehicle with a body made largely out of aluminum, the F-Pace went on sale in the U.S. in 2016.</p>, <p>The F-Pace shares some of its design cues with the automaker's new XE and XF sedans—no surprise, since it's part of the same compact to mid-size family of vehicles. It's the opposite of sibling Land Rover's straight-edged shapes; the F-Pace has gently curving rear quarters, four mesh grilles on its front end, a signature LED lighting pattern embedded in its slim headlights, and semi-circular taillights also rendered in LEDs.</p>, <p>With the F-Pace, Jaguar finally has a crossover SUV that consumers craved. By itself, the model doubled the number of new cars Jaguar sells each year.</p>, <p>For 2018, Jaguar added a small turbo-4 as the base engine.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jaguar_f-pace_2018">2018 Jaguar F-Pace review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The cabin in the F-Pace is much closer to that in the sedans. It's a spare design with most of the space on top versions dedicated to digital displays. Base models have an 8.0-inch touchscreen front and center; pricey models get a 10-inch screen in the center of the dash, with a 12.3-inch panel swapped in for the gauges. Elsewhere, the F-Pace can wear a mix of cloth and leather upholstery, wood or aluminum trim, and metallic detailing on its controls—down to the hockey-puck-shaped controller that selects the automatic transmission's gears.</p>, <p>For performance, the F-Pace offered a choice at launch between a lower-output and a higher-output version of the same supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. With direct injection and Roots-type supercharging, the engine comes in 340-horsepower and 380-hp "S" editions. Both are teamed with an 8-speed automatic transmission; 380-hp models get paddle controls for the transmission.</p>, <p>Jaguar says the F-Pace S versions with 380 hp are capable of 0-60 mph times of 5.1 seconds, and a top speed of 155 mph.</p>, <p>Later in the 2016 calendar year, a new turbodiesel engine arrived for the F-Pace. The 2.0-liter turbodiesel inline-4 makes 180 hp and 317 lb-ft of torque. The gas powertrain has been rated by the EPA at 18 mpg city, 23 highway, 20 combined; the turbodiesel nets a heady 26/33/29 mpg rating.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is also standard on the F-Pace. It's a system shared with the XE and XF sedans, where it's an option. The system uses a central multi-plate clutch and a chain drive to shift power from the rear wheels to the front, at up to a 50/50 split. The actual power split is figured by the car's traction- and stability-control systems. There's a related system that enables three adaptive modes for the all-wheel-drive system's operation on slippery surfaces, and another function that's effectively a low-speed launch and cruise control.</p>, <p>The F-Pace has up to 8.4 inches of ground clearance, and approach and departure angles of 25.5 degrees and 25.7 degrees, front and rear. It can wade through water up to 20.7 inches high.</p>, <p>For ride and handling, the F-Pace uses variable-ratio electric power steering and a suspension made mostly from aluminum, with double control arms at the front and a multi-link rear, with integral links in a rear subframe. Adaptive dampers are an option, and can be configured in the F-Pace's driving-mode programming. The F-Pace has electronic torque vectoring across its rear wheels, which range from 18 to 22 inches.</p>, <p>A five-seat wagon, the F-Pace splits the difference in size between the XE and XF sedans. It rides on a 113.1-inch wheelbase, and is 186.3 inches long overall. The front seats can be upgraded to sport seats with leather, heating, and ventilation. The rear seats have a split-fold three-piece design, and power-fold flat to boost the F-Pace's cargo space from 33.5 cubic feet to 61.4 cubic feet. A power tailgate is standard, while gesture-controlled opening is available.</p>, <p>The F-Pace hasn't been subject to crash-testing. Standard features include its low-speed launch and cruise control, as well as a forward-collision warning system with automatic emergency braking. The options list includes adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go control; adaptive cruise control; a laser-projected head-up display; blind-spot monitors with cross-traffic alerts; and automatic parking assistance.</p>, <p>On the technology front, the F-Pace comes standard with Jaguar's new InControl Touch interface and an 8.0-inch touchscreen, as well as steering-wheel controls and voice-command capability. The more advanced InControl Touch Pro system gets a larger touchscreen display with gesture control, 60 GB of on-board memory, full-screen navigation, and pinch-and-zoom control. It's paired with an 825-watt, 17-speaker Meridian sound system. With available data services, the Touch Pro system can predict fuel levels needed to reach a destination, can find parking spaces, and can show a 360-degree view of the destination when the car approaches, for easier navigation. It has companion apps available for both Android and Apple operating systems, and the apps offer their own list of functions, from remote start to emergency services.</p>]

[<p>The Jaguar XE is a compact luxury sedan that's the British automaker's entry level model. It springs from Jaguar's new modular architecture and shares some of its underpinnings and styling themes with the new XF.</p>, <p>In size, details, and mission, the Jaguar XE is a rival for BMW's 3-Series, down to the familiar echoes that appear in the Jag's roofline. The Cadillac ATS is also a worthy rival, as is the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the Audi A4.</p>, <p>With the XE, Jaguar has a small luxury sedan for buyers uninterested in crossovers—if any are left.</p>, <p>For 2018, Jaguar subbed in its new turbo-4 under the hood in two tunes: 247 horsepower or 296 hp.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jaguar_xe_2018">2018 Jaguar XE review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The BMW influences are clearest in the Jaguar XE's side view, where it might do a better job even than the 3-Series in summing up the customary sport-sedan look. It's better here, through the kinked roofline, the F-Type-alike tail, and in the pronounced Jaguar nose, decorated on the supercharged S model with a mesh grille and big air intakes. The bling is kept in check, save for chromed fender vents and 20-inch wheels—all the better to play up its low, 0.26 coefficient of drag.</p>, <p>The cabin is trimmed in a choice of aluminum, wood, or piano-black trim, and dials up a suitably sporty looks that's not as glitzy as the cockpits of the big XJ and XF sedans. A rotary transmission control dominates the center console, and gauges styled like those on the F-Type are framed by a thick steering wheel.</p>, <p>In the XE, the body forms around what Jaguar describes as a long wheelbase and a low seating position. Interior space is good in the front, but slim in the back seat, along the lines of the Cadillac ATS.</p>, <p>The XE is built on a new modular aluminum architecture that will eventually see wide adoption within Jaguar Land Rover. The company currently builds its larger vehicles, the XJ and Range Rover, on their own dedicated aluminum chassis, but this modular will see use on the XE, the next XF, the F-Pace crossover, and likely some smaller forthcoming Land Rover models. The XE's aluminum body reduces weight which in turn pays dividends in fuel economy and performance.</p>, <p>The XE was initially offered with three different engines. In XE 25t form, it gets a 2.0-liter turbo-4, making 240 horsepower and 251 pound-feet of torque. There is an XE 35t model, with Jaguar Land Rover's well-known supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 fitted under the hood that makes 340 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque. An XE 20d has a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel, making 180 hp and 318 lb-ft and based off the same Ingenium architecture as the XE 25t's gasoline inline-4. The XE 20d and 35t will be the models available with all-wheel drive, while rear-wheel drive is standard across the board.</p>, <p>For 2018, a fourth engine was added to the XE. The 25t is powered by Jag's new corporate turbo-4 that makes 247 hp. The 30t bumps output from the same engine up to 296 hp, and the V-6 is called the S and made 380 hp. The 2.0-liter turbodiesel 20d carries over.</p>, <p>Jaguar says that the base model will do 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, while the V-6 models get to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds and diesels take 7.5 seconds. All XE models top out at 120 mph. The sole transmission is a ZF 8-speed automatic, although a manual option may be offered later.</p>, <p>Under the aluminum skin, the Jaguar XE rides on a double-wishbone front suspension partly composed of aluminum, while the rear suspension uses a multi-link setup. Electric power steering is a Jaguar first on the XE.</p>, <p>In addition to its stiff, aerospace-inspired body structure, the XE depends on new active and passive safety equipment to provide state of the art protection. Along with the usual airbags and stability control, the XE has a new traction-control system that uses sensors to determine power application below 19 mph for better launches. Other safety features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, parking assist, a laser-projected head-up display, and an autonomous braking system that uses stereo cameras for obstacle detection.</p>, <p>Jaguar has finally given its aging infotainment suite a complete overhaul, and the XE sports its new InControl system. It combines the usual items—USB connectivity, audio and voice streaming over Bluetooth, navigation using SD-card mapping data, and connectivity features like mobile hotspot capability. There is also an InControl remote app that lets drivers perform some functions from their smartphone, such as remote starting and locking or unlocking the vehicle, and the system is also able to stream audio directly from apps on a connected Android or Apple smartphone. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are not yet a part of the firmware, however.</p>]

[<p>The Jaguar XJ is the British carmaker's most luxurious and largest four-door sedan and sits at the top of the brand's luxury lineup. </p>, <p>Its long history as the Jaguar flagship sedan had some rocky periods, but since the early 2000s, the XJ has been one of the most structurally advanced vehicles on the road; made from aluminum, it's a relative lightweight in its class. Since its 2011 redesign, it's been one of the more striking vehicles in its class.</p>, <p>With the XJ, Jaguar has a full-size luxury sedan that competes with big names: Audi A8, BMW 7-Series, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Those sedans are loaded with tech that the XJ doesn't have, so the Jag is left to trade largely on its looks.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jaguar_xj_2018">2018 Jaguar XJ review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>For 2018, the XJR575 replaces the XJR. A change in engine calibration increases the supercharged 5.0-liter V-8's horsepower from 550 to 575 horsepower. The car also gets some aerodynamic upgrades and some styling cues on the inside.</p>, <p>The XJ also adds some new safety features for 2018, including forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warnings with active lane control, and a driver drowsiness monitor. Jaguar’s All-Surface Progress Control system, which uses the traction control to help the car pull away on low-friction surfaces, becomes available on the XJ as well. Inside, it gets a new 10-inch center touchscreen in place of an 8.0-inch screen and in-car wi-fi.</p>, <p><strong>The new Jaguar XJ</strong></p>, <p>With the fundamentals in place, Jaguar set out on a radical path for the fourth-generation XJ, which debuted for 2011. Ditching the formal look, the newest four-door looks utterly modern, from its rakish front end to the sexy kicked-up tail. The cabin wears lots of gloss piano-black trim, leather, wood and chrome—and though it sacrifices some space for the roofline, it's still a usefully roomy sedan.</p>, <p>Rakish front styling aside, the Jaguar XJ's distinctive fastback profile only hints at its performance-bred pedigree. Handling and steering are superb, deft, light to the touch. And with the original version's choice of a 385-horsepower V-8 or a 510-hp supercharged V-8, straight-line performance is thrilling.</p>, <p>For the 2013 model year the XJ received both optional <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078545_2013-jaguar-xj-preview-jaguars-flagship-gets-new-engine-awd-new-model">all-wheel drive and a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine</a> that it desperately needed to broaden its appeal to buyers in cold climates as well as those who don't necessarily feel the need for a V-8 in their large luxury sedan. The V-6 offers 340 hp and fuel economy of up to 27 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>Jaguar has added special editions of the current XJ, such as the Portfolio. For the 2013 model year, the limited-edition, <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075594_the-most-luxurious-jaguar-ever-is-the-new-xj-ultimate-edition">long-wheelbase XJL Ultimate</a>, priced from $155,875, also entered the U.S. Only 30 examples were imported, and Jaguar called the model a “high-performance bespoke limousine.”</p>, <p>A high-performance model, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083147_2014-jaguar-xjr-full-details-on-the-executive-super-sedan">Jaguar XJR</a>, was made available for the 2014 model year. It offered a 550-hp version of the supercharged V-8, as well as suspension, styling, and interior upgrades. The XJR replaced the XJ Supersport model in the lineup.</p>, <p>Jaguar made no significant changes to the XJ for the 2015 model year; a new infotainment system arrived in the 2016 model year, and the car stayed nearly identical for 2017.</p>, <p>With a new mid-size XF and compact XE sedan in U.S. showrooms, the XJ is now the oldest offering in Jaguar's lineup. A new XJ should be on the way soon.</p>, <p><strong>XJ history</strong></p>, <p>The XJ has been around for much of Jaguar's recent history, but it has changed significantly over the years. Over five generations, and in production since 1968, the XJ has ranged in style from avant garde to stodgy, and it went back to the avant garde, style-forward look when the latest generation was launched for 2011.</p>, <p>The first-generation XJ was a very long-lived model, having debuted in 1968 and run all the way through to 1986. The "Series III" of 1979 might be considered a second generation by itself, or perhaps a very heavily edited version of the first, with a new roofline and sheet metal, and changes to virtually every other component. Six- and 12-cylinder models and a distinct Daimler version were made, as well as a two-door coupe.</p>, <p>The original and classic XJ design was updated to poor effect, in 1973, then again more comprehensively in 1979. The underlying vehicle had a very long shelf life, despite poorly executed additions, but those weren't the XJ's biggest problems. Despite its lovely ride and compact size, the XJ's meager interior space and electrical problems made it temperamental at best—which makes used XJs an absolute handful and remarkably expensive to maintain in their original state. Some of the mechanical problems, if not the electrical ones, were solved in the day with popular kits that allowed the adaptation of a small-block Chevy V-8 engine to replace the sixes or V-12s originally fitted.</p>, <p>The second-generation XJ was developed under the chassis code XJ40. With it, Jaguar attempted to fix the model's flaws while keeping the things that made it unique—the muscular shape, purposeful stance, and youthful image. Most of that was achieved, although the square headlights didn't do the design any favors. This generation persisted through 1994, with long-wheelbase and V-12 models arriving later in that time period.</p>, <p>After the Ford Motor Company acquired Jaguar in 1989, a revised version of the XJ appeared in 1994; Ford's influence included a return to circular headlight units, part of the brand's storied past. Ford also made big alterations to the manufacturing processes that produced the XJ, improving quality when the refreshed second-gen car arrived and continuing to make strides in that area as time went on. Jaguar also added its first supercharged car, the XJ6R, in this time frame. In a final touch-up before its dramatic reinvention in 2004, in 1997 the XJ added its first V-8 engine and a 5-speed automatic to supercharged versions, while all cars received a new interior.</p>, <p>The third-generation Jaguar XJ emerged in the 2004 model year, completely reworked with new aluminum construction techniques—bonded and riveted like airplane fuselages—that transformed the car's structural quality. Strangely, Jaguar gave the 2004-2010 XJ an even more traditional look than its predecessor, and it virtually fell off the radar among luxury-car buyers faced with avant garde new models of the BMW 7-Series and the Audi A8.</p>, <p>Still, the XJ's performance was better than ever, with normally aspirated and supercharged V-8 engines mated with one of the first 6-speed automatics ever built. Reliability was improved and Jaguar leaped to the top of quality ratings from J.D. Power; rear seat room was improved enough for adults to find ample room in the back. The switch to aluminum gave the Jaguar lightness it desperately needed to distinguish itself.</p>]

[<p>The Jaguar XF is a mid-size luxury sedan and the latest vehicle from the brand to get an aluminum body, as it's reinvented for the 2016 model year. The XF kicked off a design renaissance at the British automaker just as it was being separated from its former parent company, Ford. </p>, <p>With the XF, Jaguar has a rival for sedans such as the BMW 5-Series, Audi A6, Cadillac CTS and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jaguar_xf_2018">2018 Jaguar XF review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new XF</strong></p>, <p>Jaguar has unveiled its first full redo of the XF, which went on sale in 2016. The car is lighter by 130 pounds on rear-drive models and more than 250 pounds for all-wheel-drive versions thanks to a switch to an aluminum-intensive platform like those of its Jag sedan siblings, according to the automaker. The package keeps the same basic overall dimensions, but the wheelbase has been stretched 2 inches to create more room in the back seat, one of the original XF's major sticking points.</p>, <p>From launch, engine options included a 3.0-liter V-6 in a choice of two strengths—340 horsepower or 380 hp—while a 2.0-liter turbodiesel followed about a half-year later.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, diesel and all-wheel-drive versions became available in the U.S. For the 2018 model year, Jaguar added a Sportbrake wagon and a turbocharged gasoline-powered 2.0-liter inline-4 in two power outputs. The 340-hp V-6 was dropped.</p>, <p>Handling is set up more softly than some rivals, but it's engaging and predictable at the same time. Styling is in line with that of the new <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jaguar_xe_2017">Jaguar XE</a> sedan; a slightly less curvaceous take on recent Jaguar themes, but still very handsome. The XF was perhaps one of the tougher designs to follow up with a second generation, but thankfully the new version carries the themes forward with some modernity.</p>, <p><strong>Jaguar XF history</strong></p>, <p>The XF was first shown at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as the Concept C-XF with its clean, modern lines and a reinvented cabin full of glitzy touches of sparkling chrome and aluminum. Most of the concept car's design made it to final production form, as Jaguar revealed the sedan at the 2007 Frankfurt motor show.</p>, <p>The first XF's performance ranges from blinding to lurid—vastly different from the old S-Type, its almost-predecessor. Steering is light, but direct and full of feedback, and the XF feels planted and well-controlled in most circumstances. The big criticism than can be leveled against the XF is its lack of rear-seat space. It's truly tiny in back, with cramped leg space and no head room to spare for adults, thanks to the cut-down roofline.</p>, <p>Though the car itself changed very little since its introduction, the XF's powertrains evolved throughout its run. In its first year, the XF offered a choice of normally aspirated or supercharged 4.2-liter V-8 engines, with 300 hp and 420 hp, respectively.</p>, <p>In the 2010 model year, Jaguar upgraded the XF's engine lineup to include a pair of 5.0-liter V-8 engines, again with available supercharging. The normally aspirated 300-hp, 4.2-liter V-8 carried over from the first-year sedan was joined by a 385-hp, 5.0-liter V-8, and in the XFR by a 510-hp supercharged 5.0-liter V-8. In 2011, the base 4.2-liter engine was discontinued, and the XF retained its top 510-hp engine, while also adding a 470-hp version of the forced-induction 5.0-liter for the Supercharged model. A 6-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters worked with all three.</p>, <p>The XF gained <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078542_2013-jaguar-xf-preview-new-engines-and-all-wheel-drive-enhance-product-line">some important updates for the 2013 model year</a>, including a new <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078885_jaguar-to-debut-new-awd-system-xfr-speed-pack-at-moscow-motor-show">all-wheel-drive model</a>. In the XF, the system has a rearward bias that can send power to the front wheels when slip is detected. In different driver-selectable modes, the torque split varies from 100 percent power to the rear or a 30/70-split front-to-rear in winter mode. It's offered only with a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that nets 340 hp, which was a powertrain that effectively replaced the former base 5.0-liter V-8 engine. The V-6 was also available with rear-wheel drive. A new 8-speed automatic replaced the older 6-speed unit in all XF versions.</p>, <p>The 2013 model year also brought a smaller engine for base models; this 2.0-liter turbo-4 makes 240 hp and is mated to the same 8-speed automatic as the rest. It hit 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, and was rated by the EPA at 29 mpg on the highway. The engine has enough power to move the mid-size Jag, but it's not quite as smooth or refined as the larger engines that are available.</p>, <p>Infotainment and navigation in the XF were also updated—including new features to make navigation screens more useful. Jaguar also turned to Meridian, a British company known for high-end home audio components, for new premium sound systems across its lineup.</p>, <p>For the 2014 model year, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080705_2014-jaguar-xfr-s-bows-at-2012-los-angeles-auto-show">550-hp Jaguar XFR-S</a> was made available, albeit in very limited numbers. It's a notch or two above the XFR's craziness, with an available rear wing that puts it pretty much over the top, even compared to other super-sport sedans.</p>, <p>For 2015, Jaguar did away with the base turbocharged 2.0-liter model and created the 2.0T Premium in its place, which includes the formerly optional Premium Pack (navigation, keyless entry, rearview camera, front parking sensors, a 380-Watt Meridian sound system, HD Radio, and satellite radio). Jaguar has also created two different models for the 3.0-liter supercharged V-6, both new for 2015. The Portfolio and Sport are geared toward luxury and performance-minded buyers, respectively. They carry the same base price but bundle different aesthetics and features. Both are available with Jaguar's all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>Jaguar also offers a wagon version of the XF in other markets, including a long-roof XFR-S, but that body style is not sold in the U.S. in any trim. It happens to be the more attractive XF shape to our eye, but it seems the American buying public doesn't always decide on looks, or practicality for that matter.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/jeep_wrangler
[<p>The Jeep Wrangler is an American icon and a longrunning convertible SUV that's defied age. It's a tribute to World War II-era military Jeeps and has a distinctive shape that is instantly recognizable.</p>, <p>Competitors for the Wrangler are few, recently the Nissan Xterra, Toyota FJ Cruiser, and Hummer H3 have challenged the Wrangler. Current rivals include the Toyota Tacoma, Chevy Colorado, and upcoming Ford Bronco. A Wrangler pickup is on the way soon to take on the former two. </p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_wrangler_2018" target="_blank" title="2017 Jeep Wrangler - review">2018 Jeep Wrangler review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>An all-new Wrangler arrived for the 2018 model year, although Jeep produced new Wranglers and old Wranglers together and sold both simultaneously. The new model, codenamed Wrangler JL, is worth seeking out. It's slightly larger, but more maneuverable, than the outgoing model, and it boasts two vastly improved powertrains with new transmissions.</p>, <p>The Wrangler is again available in two- and four-door variants, the latter of which is named the Wrangler Unlimited.</p>, <p>Jeep will make a Wrangler-based pickup off of the redesigned, likely called the Scrambler; it will be the first official Jeep pickup since the Comanche, which was retired in 1992.</p>, <p><strong>The new Jeep Wrangler <strong>(JL)</strong></strong></p>, <p>The new Wrangler shares little more than a silhouette with its predecessor. It's about an inch longer in two-door form and two inches longer in four-door Wrangler Unlimited guise. Its exterior is evolutionary, but not really a throwback since this basic shape has been around since 1941 without any breaks.</p>, <p>Standard on all Wranglers is a 3.6-liter V-6 with stop/start technology that can be paired to either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual. A 2.0-liter turbo-4 sourced from Italy is optional, and while it's not much more powerful, it does offer more low-end torque and its mild-hybrid 48-volt system allows the Wrangler to coast with its engine off. The turbo-4 is paired exclusively to the 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Four-wheel drive is standard. A new automatic system is available on the Wrangler Sahara. The off-road Wrangler Rubicon has a beefier transfer case that goes with its heavy-duty Dana 44 axles. All Wranglers retain coil springs and solid axles for off-road use, but they're markedly more comfortable on pavement than their predecessors. Even a base Wrangler Sport is a veritable mountain goat, but the Rubicon's 33-inch all-terrain tires, front and rear locking differentials, and disconnecting swaybars make it the king of the mountain. Moreover, the Rubicon's special fender flares can accommodate 35-inch tires without a lift kit.</p>, <p>The Wrangler also saw big upgrades inside, with a dash that's better organized and pushed away from the passenger compartment for more space and an airier feel overall. The Wrangler comes standard with a 5.0-inch display for audio, but 7.0- and 8.4-inch touchscreens with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are on the options list.</p>, <p>Two-doors are rough riders but mountain goats off-road. The Wrangler Unlimited's 20-inch longer wheelbase is an asset in certain off-pavement situations and it provides for far more cargo and passenger space inside. Its rear seat is still tough to access but is roomier and has a more comfortable, sculpted bench than before.</p>, <p>Wranglers are available with a host of roof configurations, including a soft top that's easy to put down and can be configured in several different modes, and hardtops painted black or body color with removable panels. A big fabric sunroof can also be paired with the hardtop for a semi-open air feel.</p>, <p><strong>Jeep Wrangler history</strong></p>, <p>The Wrangler emerged from its ancient roots into the modern era in the late 1980s. There have been three generations of Jeep Wranglers built since 1987, each one an evolution of the last. The model can be considered a successor to the CJ line of Jeeps, which also featured open tops, fold-down windshields, and solid off-road chops.</p>, <p>The first Wrangler, known as the YJ, is unique in that it's the only one to have used rectangular headlights. It was offered from 1987 to 1996 and came with a choice of 4- or 6-cylinder power and manual or automatic transmissions. Several appearance packages were offered over the production run, including the Islander and very popular Renegade models.</p>, <p>Beginning in 1997, the utility vehicle received an upgraded suspension design to improve on-road comfort and roadholding, plus new engines to boost power and fuel economy. The so-called "TJ" was built from 1997 to 2006 and carried on the original two-door soft-top design, with instantly recognizable classic Jeep lines.</p>, <p>Numerous upgrades arrived for the 1997-2006 Wrangler, including a return to the round headlights found on CJ models. It added a new 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine in 2003, the same year the automatic transmission was upgraded from three speeds to four. The 2003 model year also saw the addition of the most capable production model yet, the Rubicon, named for the famous trail where Jeep tests its creations. The Rubicon was beefed up with stronger front and rear differentials, a 4:1 low-ratio transfer case, and other off-road improvements. In mid 2004, Jeep added the Wrangler Unlimited body style that extended the wheelbase by 10 inches, offering more cargo room but still just two doors. A limited-production Sahara Edition debuted in 2005, offering a range of desert-themed appearance upgrades inside and out.</p>, <p>In 2007, Jeep began offering two- and four-door versions of the Wrangler. The four-door model carries the Wrangler Unlimited name. The old AMC in-line 6-cylinder engine (which dated all the way back to Rambler days) was replaced with a 205-horsepower, 3.8-liter Chrysler V-6 that year.</p>, <p>The Wrangler received a heavily revised interior in 2011, with an all-new instrument panel and upgraded materials throughout the cabin, plus better noise insulation. For 2012, Jeep added its new 285-horsepower Pentastar 3.6-liter V-6. Hooked to a stout 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual, the new engine is quicker and more responsive compared to the 3.8-liter pushrod V-6 it replaced.</p>, <p>Both body styles are offered with hard and soft tops. The doors on all models are still removable, half doors are available, and the windshield still folds over.</p>, <p>Given its extreme off-road abilities, the Wrangler has never been known for on-road manners, but with this generation the street-ability has greatly improved. The long-wheelbase Unlimited provides the best ride of any Wrangler yet, and a series of powertrain and suspension changes have further enhanced things for both models. The Wrangler is larger than before, with greater comfort for passengers and their stuff, and it now offers such niceties as power windows and locks with a remote, items only dreamed of before.</p>, <p>Overall, with its classic looks, superior off-road capability and unique packaging, the Jeep Wrangler manages to stay relevant despite continuing as a throwback vehicle. Ride quality, comfort, steering, and even occupant safety might not be up to the standards of today's daily commuters, but if you head to the trails on the weekends the Wrangler is king.</p>, <p>You might even be happy with a used Wrangler if you're a serious trail hound and expect some dents, scrapes, and gouges. Meanwhile, new Jeep Wranglers come priced from around $25,000 to more than $45,000, with the latter being a loaded, top-of-the-line Rubicon.</p>, <p>For 2013, the Wrangler received changes, limited to comfort and convenience additions like new LED map lighting, interior lighting, and available Alpine speakers. A new easy-lift top mechanism was also introduced for 2013. Jeep also offered a Moab special edition that borrowed much of the Rubicon's look, but without its front locker and super-low 4:1 "creeper" transfer case—which gave it a more affordable price, too.</p>, <p>Changes for 2015 included the usual new paint colors and trim packages, as well as a new standard 8-speaker audio system, a new 9-speaker system with a subwoofer, a standard Torx tool set, and a package that bundled steel wheels with 31-inch tires for Sport models. The tool set allows owners to remove the windshield or doors wherever they are. For 2016, the Wrangler gained a new Black Bear Edition with off-road rock rails, five-spoke black wheels, Silent Armor tires, and some other blacked-out details.</p>, <p>Changes for 2017 consist of available LED headlights and fog lights and a new Sport S model. A Cold Weather group is now offered for the Sport S and Rubicon models.</p>]

[<p>The Jeep Grand Cherokee mid-size SUV is a high-water mark for utility vehicles. It comfortably seats five, and is equally at home on the interstate or a rocky trail.</p>, <p>With the Grand Cherokee, Jeep has a mainstream SUV that can take on all challengers with ample interior technology and luxury. The Grand Cherokee can run the range from off-roader to track athlete in high-performance versions—even a drag-strip warrior in the Grand Cherokee Trackhawk edition.</p>, <p>The Grand Cherokee takes on the Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner as well as some Euro 'utes like the BMW X5 and the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class (a vehicle with which it shares its basic chassis).</p>, <p>The big news for 2018 is the addition of a model that truly shows Grand Cherokee's breadth: the pavement-oriented Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. With the supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 from the Dodge Hellcat models making an equivalent 707 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque, it can sprint from 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 180 mph.</p>, <p>Also for 2018, the 8.4-inch version of the Uconnect infotainment system gets Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, base models move from a 5.0- to a 7.0-inch Uconnect screen, active noise cancellation is added to the available Alpine audio system, and a new Sterling Edition package is offered to celebrate the Grand Cherokee's 25th anniversary.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_grand-cherokee_2018">2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Grand Cherokee</strong></p>, <p>Things changed when the 2011 Grand Cherokee was introduced in 2010. Thanks to the earlier DaimlerChrysler tie-up, the new Grand Cherokee shared a basic architecture with the Mercedes M- (now GLE) and GL-Class (now GLS) SUVs. It's more sophisticated as a result, with smoother on-road dynamics, an available air suspension, and great steering, while still retaining the off-road capability that made the Grand Cherokee what it was in the beginning. Although Daimler and Chrysler are no longer an item, this prime example of their shared expertise continues on anyway.</p>, <p>As before, the current Grand Cherokee is as extreme as you want it to be—with the top Quadra Drive II system sophisticated enough for either negotiating slippery rocks and mud or mindfully gripping with the correct wheel in your snow-drift-buried driveway. And even better, Jeep has also introduced a Range Rover-like Selec-Terrain system that simplifies getting through the tough stuff, with an Auto mode plus separate ones for sand/mud, snow, and rock.</p>, <p>With its modern and more refined 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, in addition to returning Hemi V-8s, the fourth-generation Grand Cherokee is also a bit more fuel efficient in its base form.</p>, <p>The SRT8 model returned for 2012 with a 465-hp, 6.4-liter Hemi. It has become much more comfortable and luxurious compared to the original, hard-edged SRT8, which has opened up its appeal but lost some of the rawness, for better and worse. It's now simply known as the Grand Cherokee SRT.</p>, <p>The Grand Cherokee has always been ahead of its time with respect to features. Back in its first generation, the Grand Cherokee offered features like steering-wheel audio controls, plush leather upholstery, heated seats, and keyless entry. The newest models can be had with extensive entertainment and information extras like Uconnect Web (to turn the vehicle into a wireless hotspot).</p>, <p>In 2013, a rugged Trailhawk version of the Grand Cherokee joined the lineup. The Grand Cherokee Trailhawk included off-road-specific hardware such as 18-inch off-road tires; an air suspension; off-road-tuned traction control; its own badging and black and red accents; and black suede and leather seats.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_grand-cherokee_2014">2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> made its debut at the 2013 <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/detroit-auto-show">Detroit Auto Show</a>, bringing a significant refresh to the lineup. A new 8-speed automatic transmission is now standard throughout the lineup. New for the model year was a 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V-6 that achieved an excellent 30 mpg on the highway. Towing capacities were boosted and now range up to 7,400 pounds for the diesel. SRT models (no longer SRT8) gained a new Launch Control feature, as well as a Track Mode that sends 70 percent of torque by default to the rear wheels for high-performance driving.</p>, <p>All models in the 2014 Grand Cherokee lineup received a new shorter grille, slimmer taillights, and new LED rear lamps that mimic the shape of the headlamps. New active-safety features included forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, and a new 19-speaker, 825-watt Harman/Kardon surround-sound audio system highlighted a set of revised infotainment features.</p>, <p>Changes for 2015 included an output bump to 475 hp for the Grand Cherokee SRT, an Argentine Tan leather option for the Summit, a new monochrome California Edition exterior package, and acoustic glass. Both the Summit and SRT got active noise cancellation that plays through the stereo.</p>, <p>For 2017, a new version of the Trailhawk model joined the lineup. It gets 18-inch off-road tires; red tow hooks; Quadra-Drive II; an electronic limited-slip differential; an air suspension with more suspension travel; Selec-Speed Control; skid plates; and a black leather interior. The base Grand Cherokees also added a standard rearview camera and parking sensors for 2017.</p>, <p><strong>Jeep Grand Cherokee history</strong></p>, <p>The Grand Cherokee is one of the vehicles that spawned the SUV gold rush in the 1990s. It and the Ford Explorer drew a generation of drivers out of sedans and into big, tall wagons, for better or worse. It's still one of the best sellers in that group today, and though a handful of other SUVs combine toughness with a luxurious ambiance, almost none of them do it at the Grand Cherokee's price point.</p>, <p>Through the years, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has been a very off-road-capable luxury sport-utility vehicle, offering rather chunky, rugged styling, along with enough family-friendly practicality inside.</p>, <p>The first-generation Grand Cherokee wasn't an exceptional on-road performer by any measure, but it moved just fine with the long-running and torquey 4.0-liter inline-6 (of AMC origins). The 5.2-liter or 5.9-liter V-8 engines were definitely the choice for those who towed, and the 5.9 Limited felt like an all-out muscle truck. During some of this time, the most luxurious versions of the Grand Cherokee were badged Grand Wagoneer, and included a specially trimmed, leather-lined cabin and a wood-paneled-look exterior.</p>, <p>The second-generation Grand Cherokee arrived with a rounded version of the original's styling that was still distinctive and recognizable. The interior trimmings were more luxurious, and mechanical updates included a new 4-speed automatic transmission and a hydraulically actuated four-wheel-drive system; rear-wheel drive and a more basic four-wheel-drive system remained on offer as well. The engine menu stayed put, although V-8 models saw increased output.</p>, <p>The Grand Cherokee was again substantially redesigned for 2005. This time, Jeep threw out the old inline-6, replacing it with an also-dated 3.7-liter V-6, but all-new 5.7-liter and 6.1-liter HEMI V-8 engines joined the range. While the V-8s brought brisk acceleration and plenty of muscle for towing, this generation was widely panned by critics as being a step back in what mattered to much of the Grand Cherokee's buyer base; most notably, it felt a bit tighter, seating-wise, than the previous generation.</p>, <p>For a short time, Jeep also offered a 3.0-liter turbodiesel version of the third-gen Grand Cherokee; it performed well and was quite fuel-efficient, but emissions regulations and slow sales forced an early demise.</p>, <p>Beginning with the 2006 Grand Cherokee SRT8, Jeep showed that it could appeal to go-fast, on-road enthusiasts, too. The performance model packed a 420-hp, 6.1-liter HEMI, a sport-tuned suspension, and a host of upgrades, and this model could not only do modest off-roading, but also get to Autobahn speeds and reach 60 mph in well under five seconds. </p>, <p>In all of its existence through the '90s and '00s, the Grand Cherokee was lacking several things that were increasingly required by suburban families: More precise, carlike handling; a better on-road ride; and top-notch safety. Over the past decade, its rugged image and Rubicon capability were no longer enough; its sloppy steering and choppy-yet-boundy ride were, in fact, deal-breakers to many, and families moved over to other luxury-brand SUVs that didn't cost much more.</p>]

[<p>The Jeep Cherokee is a compact crossover SUV that draws on a long history of great off-road capability. </p>, <p>With the Cherokee, Jeep has a lineup mainstay and a legendary name. Some may remember the boxy versions from yesteryear; those Cherokee SUVs were hardcore, rugged trail blazers—and they were long-lived. The Cherokee name went on hiatus from 2001 to 2013 in the U.S. as it was replaced by the Liberty.</p>, <p>The new Cherokee introduced in 2014 doesn't have the same square-jawed look, but it's a crossover utility with true off-road chops, just like its forebears.</p>, <p>Today's Cherokee takes on some of the most popular entries in the compact SUV market—including the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.</p>, <p>An updated 2019 Jeep Cherokee was unveiled at the 2018 Detroit auto show. It presents a cleaner face with new headlights and boasts an available 2.0-liter turbo-4 under the hood.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_cherokee_2019">2019 Jeep Cherokee review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Jeep Cherokee</strong></p>, <p>The 2014 Cherokee revival featured controversial styling, with narrow "eyebrow" headlamps and a version of Jeep’s slotted grille, split between an upright snout and a low, curved, aerodynamic hoodline. That look is updated for 2019. The face is now more conventional with headlights and daytime running lights brought together, giving the Cherokee the appearance of a baby Grand Cherokee.</p>, <p>The 2014 Jeep Cherokee not only brought back the Cherokee name but also gave the vehicle a roomier, more versatile interior layout. While the Liberty was rugged, it was never all that comfortable, refined, or space-efficient.</p>, <p>With a five-seat layout and an adult-sized second row that slides fore and aft, plus a special cargo-management system available in back, the latest Cherokee is a useful family vehicle. A 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is standard. It makes 180 horsepower, and hooked to a 9-speed automatic—enabling an EPA highway rating of up to 31 mpg highway. Those who want to tow (up to 4,500 pounds) or just want more power can select the 271-hp, 3.2-liter Pentastar V-6. For 2019, Jeep adds a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that makes 270 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. It launches the Cherokee from 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, making it the quickest engine in the lineup. Also for 2019, the tuning of the standard 9-speed automatic transmission is revised for drivability, and the suspension is tweaked for on-road comfort. </p>, <p>The Cherokee is offered in Latitude, Latitude Plus, Limited, Overland, and Trailhawk trim levels, the latter a purpose-built off-roader with better approach and departure angles, off-road tires, skid plate, and an off-road suspension. Buyers can also choose from three all-wheel-drive systems, including two with very low crawl ratios.</p>, <p>The latest Cherokee also takes a big step up from the Liberty in terms of cabin appointments, and especially features. Memory heated/ventilated seats are on offer, along with an 8.4-inch touchscreen and Uconnect Access via Mobile. For 2019, the screen in base models grows from 5.0 to 7.0 inches and all versions get faster processors.</p>, <p>While Jeep’s compact entry has jumped toward the head of the pack in safety with bind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, and cross-path detection, plus a parking assist feature, the crash-test scores have been below average.</p>, <p>Changes over the past few model years have been minor. For 2015, Jeep bolstered the Cherokee's safety kit at several levels. Latitude and Trailhawk models added a rearview camera plus automatic headlamps. Latitude, Limited, and Trailhawk models added a package that combined blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-path detection, rear parking sensors, and signal mirrors with courtesy lamps. The 2016 Cherokee included a few comfort improvements inside, a couple of new paint colors and, on models with the 8.4-inch touchscreen, user-interface improvements that brought a drag-and-drop menu bar, Siri Eyes Free voice recognition, and a Do Not Disturb mode. Changes for 2017 were minimal, amounting to new feature availability.</p>, <p><strong>Jeep Cherokee history</strong></p>, <p>The Cherokee nameplate hasn't always been affixed to small Jeep models. The original Cherokee from the 1970s was a version of the large body-on-frame "SJ" Jeep Wagoneer, but with more basic trim. It was offered first as a two-door and then later on as a four-door as well. Most of them were powered by AMC V-8 engines.</p>, <p>Utility vehicles were given a major evolutionary kick beginning in 1984 with the introduction of the game-changing "XJ" Cherokee, likely the most familiar model to people aside from the current version. A completely new unibody vehicle, with 4- and 6-cylinder engines (even a diesel for a time) and two- or four-wheel drive, this Cherokee arguably led the way for modern crossover vehicles, with its lighter weight, somewhat car-influenced body structure. Yet it featured solid axles (and a leaf-spring rear suspension) that aided off-road ability but could leave a lot to be desired in on-road ride. One of the final customers for that Cherokee was the U.S. Post Office, which used right-hand-drive models as delivery vehicles.</p>, <p>The XJ Cherokee was sold through 2001, having evolved sparingly since its introduction. Changes included upping the power of the inline-6 engine, mild styling updates that included a switch from fiberglass to steel rear hatches, and additional luxury options over the years. Its most notable upgrade came for the 1997 model year, when its boxy look was slightly softened outside and it gained a new dashboard with dual airbags. These later Cherokees have proven desirable used, with values typically outpacing the larger Grand Cherokee. Of particular desire to enthusiasts is the Up Country suspension package that included rock-deflecting skid plates, tow hooks, a limited slip rear differential, a slightly raised suspension height, and additional engine cooling. Most Cherokees were equipped with a 4-speed automatic, but a 5-speed manual was available (earlier models also utilized a 3-speed automatic). </p>, <p>In 2002, a replacement arrived in the form of the Jeep Liberty; the Cherokee name was gone here in the U.S., but lived on in some export markets with that model. The Liberty name survived for two generations—the first through 2007 and the second from 2008 to 2012. It was replaced by the current model—back to the Cherokee name—but based on a Fiat platform shared in part with the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200.</p>]

[<p>The Jeep Renegade is a compact utility vehicle that shares some hardware with the Fiat 500X. The Jeep is fitted with more rugged components, including off-road gear that can scramble the cute 'ute up a mountainside.</p>, <p>With the Renegade, Jeep joins an increasingly crowded market of small and carlike, yet tall and often boxy utility vehicles—such as the Subaru Crosstrek, Nissan Juke, Honda HR-V, and the Mazda CX-3. Unlike many of those, the Jeep can be fitted with a manual transmission, although those versions are increasingly rare.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Renegade added a standard rearview camera.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_renegade_2018" title="2017 Jeep Renegade - review">2018 Jeep Renegade review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Jeep Renegade</strong></p>, <p>The Renegade throws out both the very creased, angular look of products like the Patriot and Liberty and the somewhat softer look of the Compass, Grand Cherokee, and new Cherokee. Instead it strikes up a new look that is chunky and rugged-looking, yet sophisticated and just a little playful. With its blunt slotted grille and somewhat upright windshield, the Renegade nods to Jeep tradition; its curved rear flanks and its low beltline are anything but traditional.</p>, <p>Inside, the Renegade is less radical in its design statement. It's a subtle look, but one that's finished with plenty of soft-touch materials around the front seats, plus some body-color details.</p>, <p>With an overall length of 167 inches, the Renegade is slightly longer than a Wrangler, but over a half-foot shorter than the Patriot. It manages to offer interior volume similar to the Patriot by being a little wider and taller than that model, but still fits into smaller parking spaces just the same.</p>, <p>An upright seating position in front, combined with the rather low beltline, adds up to great visibility, and back-seat space is adequate for a couple of adults. Cargo space is 18.5 cubic feet with the rear seatback up, or nearly 51 cubic feet with it flipped forward. The Renegade offers a rollback cloth roof that can be opened or removed entirely.</p>, <p>While several engines are offered around the world, U.S.-bound Renegades are powered by a choice of two engines, each with its own no-choice transmission pairing. A 160-hp, turbocharged 1.4-liter inline-4 is matched to a 6-speed manual, while the 184-hp 2.4-liter gets a 9-speed automatic transmission. The Renegade features an independent rear suspension with frequency-selective shocks from Koni, which provide a good balance of handling and ride. There's even a feature to help the anti-lock brakes detect rough roads so they can react accordingly.</p>, <p>Off-road ability is the selling point on a lot of Jeep vehicles, and the Renegade holds true to the reputation in a way that might be unexpected. You can even order a Renegade with sufficient equipment to carry off-road ability Jeep deems worthy of its Trail Rated badge—the Trailhawk model comes with the so-called "Active Drive 2" system, which adds a low range, a 20:1 crawl ratio, skid plates, increased ground clearance, and hill descent control, among other things. Meanwhile, there's also an Active Drive 1 for those who simply want an all-weather all-wheel-drive system. Front-drive is the standard layout.</p>, <p>Renegades also offer the latest from Chrysler's infotainment options. The infotainment system can read incoming text messages aloud and even send dictated messages. The service is integrated with Sirius Travel Link, which provides weather, traffic, and other info. There's also integration with smartphone apps and services like Yelp.</p>, <p>The Renegade went on sale in early 2015, and few changes were made for the 2016 model year. For 2017, standard keyless ignition and available high-intensity discharge headlights arrived slightly after the start of the model year. The Latitude trim got a 7.0-inch touchscreen as part of the Uconnect package, the top-level Limited added keyless entry, and automatic high beams became a new option.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Renegade saw some minor trim shuffling and new HID headlights after hitting the market as a new model in 2016.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/jeep_patriot
[<p>The Jeep Patriot is a compact crossover SUV, and a counterpart to the Jeep Compass. The Compass and Patriot share powertrains and underpinnings, but the Patriot's blocky styling distinguishes it from the hatchback cues of the Compass.</p>, <p>Both are compact 'utes design for drivers who want some of the storied Jeep tradition, but don't need a vehicle as large or as capable as the Cherokee.</p>, <p>The Patriot's rivals include the Subaru Crosstrek and the Kia Soul—and the Compass, of course, though the Patriot is equipped to be the less expensive of the duo, at least in base form.</p>, <p>For 2017, don't look for many changes—the Patriot is set to be shelved after the 2017 model year. For now, it's available in Sport, Sport SE, 75th Anniversary (even though last year was the brand's 75th birthday), Latitude, and High Altitude trim levels.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_patriot_2017">2017 Jeep Patriot review</a><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The Jeep Patriot was launched alongside the brand's very similar Compass SUV, with both of these small utilities causing the public to wonder if Jeep had lost its way. Although Jeep had long used unibody technology to build capable SUVs, the Compass and Patriot were the first to combine that concept with a front-drive-based layout. Often referred to as "soft-roaders," car-based utilities such as these don't always get a lot of respect from the off-roading community, but Jeep countered that by offering a Trail Rated version of both with a true low range.</p>, <p>Both the Patriot and Compass came to market in 2007. Unlike its sibling, the Patriot has only seen one major refresh since, in the form of interior revisions for 2010. It continues to offer the same pair of 4-cylinder engines, with either front- or all-wheel drive, including a 4x4 system with a low range that earns it a Trail Rated badge. The base engine is a 158-hp 2.0-liter, with a 172-hp 2.4-liter inline-4 as an option on some models and standard on upper trims. A 5-speed manual is available, as is a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that is quite unloved; Jeep added a conventional 6-speed auto in 2014, which takes the place of the CVT in some configurations.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, both engines are noisy and somewhat coarse, and the CVT in older models exacerbates the problem, keeping engine revs high for peak power—its noisiest operating range. The manual makes the Patriot both sportier and nicer to occupy. Noise and vibration shielding added a couple of years ago modestly improved the sound problem as well.</p>, <p>The little Jeep crossover isn't terribly fuel-efficient, despite being based on the same car platform as the now-departed Dodge Caliber and its Compass sibling. Only one version of the Patriot manages 30 mpg on the highway, and EPA ratings fall as low as 20 mpg city for the least-efficient model.</p>, <p>The Patriot gets boxier, chunkier styling that both looks better and is more functional than either of its platform-mates. It's easier to enter and exit than many smaller hatchbacks, and the head and leg room are good for its size—though the seats aren't that supportive. There's plastic everywhere inside, especially in the bargain-basement 2007-2009 models, but if you have an off-road mission in mind, that's not necessarily a bad thing. This is one SUV that's pretty easy to clean up. The new interior fitted for 2010 looks a little richer without compromising the rough-and-tough appeal. Best of all, the cargo floor gets a rubber liner that keeps you from mucking it up.</p>, <p>The Patriot is more charming on the road, where its small size and maneuverability run counter to the prevalent SUV bloat. The compact size and visible corners make parking a breeze and city driving a relief, especially compared to the far clumsier Wrangler. Still, the Patriot can boast some off-road bona fides: a Trail Rated package includes a low-range transfer case, skid plates, heavy-duty cooling, and hill descent control. Buyers opting for this package will also get an extra inch of ground clearance, thanks to the trail suspension system. And even with that hardware, the Patriot steers fairly well.</p>, <p>The Jeep Patriot has fared well in crash tests, and the IIHS has awarded the Patriot with "Good" scores in frontal and side tests. Roof strength testing also yields a result of "Good." The Jeep Patriot comes with a very generous list of standard safety features for the price, including electronic stability control with electronic roll mitigation, front side airbags, and side curtain airbags.</p>, <p>A CD player is standard along with speakers that can fold out from the back hatch (i.e. facing away from the car) for tailgating entertainment. You'll drive the price up quickly, however, if you start to tick the boxes for power features, leather seats, and satellite radio.</p>, <p>For the 2014 model year the Patriot received a 6-speed automatic transmission to replace its awkward CVT in most configurations, as well as some other minor mechanical and cosmetic changes.</p>, <p>Chrysler had intended to discontinue the Patriot by the 2012 model year, but its life span was extended at least through 2017. The new Jeep Compass replaced the Patriot and outgoing Compass in Jeep's lineup.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/jeep_compass
[<p>The Jeep Compass is the smaller half of Jeep's compact crossover lineup. Wedged between the smaller Renegade and the larger Cherokee, the Compass was new for 2017. It replaced a model that reached its sell-by date the minute it hit the market.</p>, <p>While the Compass, Jeep goes after the heart of the market—crossovers like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, and Subaru Forester. The Compass excels in off-roading compared to many other crossovers, although that ability may appeal to a minority of shoppers in the segment.</p>, <p>There were few changes for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><em style="font-weight: bold;">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_compass_2018">2018 Jeep Compass review</a></em></p>, <p>The new Compass rides on a stretched version of the smaller Renegade's platform and is built in four plants globally (American Compasses are sourced from Mexico), which potentially could make it the most mass-produced Jeep ever, at least in terms of assembly locations. All Compasses share the same 180-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder gas engine and a choice of three transmissions are on offer—6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic, and 9-speed automatic. Front- and all-wheel drive variants are available as are four trim levels. </p>, <p>Like other Jeeps, a Trailhawk variant is aimed at off-roaders. Here, it has a suspension lift and its own bumpers that allow it to scale more sharp inclines than the decidedly street-oriented standard Compass models. </p>, <p><strong>Jeep Compass history</strong></p>, <p>The Compass was a new vehicle for the 2007 model year. It and the Patriot were derived from Dodge's Caliber hatchback; Compass styling was out of the Jeep norm, a bit chunky and awkward, and appearing more like a five-door hatchback than a utility. Though a front-drive-based model, it was offered all-wheel drive from the start and was able to hang with other small light off-roaders. The styling didn't win too many fans at first, especially among Jeep faithful, and noisy engines, an unloved continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a dark, cheap-feeling interior kept it from achieving success early on.</p>, <p>The concept on which the Compass is based dates all the way back to 2002. When the production version arrived five years later, the concept's V-6 had given way to a transversely mounted 4-cylinder engine—a choice of two of them that remain in the Compass to date. Neither the larger 2.4-liter, 172-horsepower engine nor the 158-hp, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder made the Compass particularly quick. Energetic drivers will get more acceleration with the 5-speed manual gearbox, while the CVT drains the life out of the engine while amplifying its noisy, rough feel. For 2014, a proper 6-speed automatic was substituted for the CVT in most models. There's an all-wheel-drive option, though it adds more weight and complexity than it may be worth for those who plan on staying on-road.</p>, <p>Though there is a traditional Jeep seven-slot grille up front, the Compass represented a big design departure from the rest of the Jeep lineup, and its original look didn't find many fans. Things improved somewhat in 2011, when the entire front end was restyled to give the Compass a mini-Grand Cherokee look—at least from the front. For the sake of cost savings, the Compass even uses the larger crossover's headlamp units. It also gained much-improved interior materials and smoother, simplified cabin trims in that update.</p>, <p>Along with the host of improvements the Compass received for 2011, it also received the Patriot's Freedom Drive II system, which gives this vehicle a level of off-road ability that's unusual in small crossovers. Jeep gives the system its Trail Rated seal of approval, which means it's ready for more difficult off-roading, helped along by skid plates and the like. It was originally going to be reserved for the Patriot, which was being positioned as the more off-road-friendly model of the pair.</p>, <p>The Compass offers good head room and lots of leg room for front passengers, with seating for five. The cushions can feel a bit flat, however. The cabin is airy, and the second row of seats can fold flat to create a long load floor for extra gear. The recent round of updates included the addition of more sound deadening, providing a quiet experience compared to many other crossovers of this size.</p>, <p>Handling, however, is a bright spot; the Compass is very maneuverable and steers most of the time with the accuracy and precision of a small car. The ride is nicely controlled, with only minor harshness on broken pavement. It drives much more like a Grand Cherokee than a Wrangler, which is not surprising given its car-based origins. </p>, <p>Standard safety features on the <span class="keylinks_silent">Jeep Compass</span> include side curtain airbags, traction control, a driver-controlled electronic stability program, brake assist, roll mitigation, and anti-lock brakes with rough-road detection. Jeep added active head restraints for 2010, covering both the driver and the front-seat passenger. Front-seat-mounted side airbags are optional, and later years of the Compass come with standard electronic stability control.</p>, <p>A feature aimed at tailgate partiers, the speakers located in the cargo area can drop down from the hatch to aim out, turning the Compass into a big mobile stereo. Early model years also offered a removable dome light that doubled as a flash light, but it was replaced with a conventional fixed unit for 2015. Options include a remote-start system, automatic climate control, Sirius satellite radio, Bluetooth connectivity, 19-inch wheels, all-terrain tires, a moonroof, and upgraded sound with a six-disc CD changer.</p>, <p>The Compass continued into 2012 and 2013 essentially unchanged, with changes for the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/jeep_compass_2014">2014 Jeep Compass</a> including a new front-end look and the new 6-speed automatic. Production ended in late 2016. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/kia_stinger
[<p>The Kia Stinger is a four-door, rear- or all-wheel-drive hatchback that offers a decidedly unique alternative to "default" European, American, and Japanese sports sedans. </p>, <p>The Stinger brings to the market a new nameplate for the 2018 model year, and while it's a little larger than establishment rivals like the BMW 3-Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the Stinger offers similar power and a rear- or all-wheel drive powertrain. It's that last bit that helps the Stinger stand apart from the front-drive Kia Optima since the two are sized about the same outside. </p>, <p>The Stinger is powered by a turbo-4, while Kia reserves its new twin-turbo 3.3-liter V-6 for the Stinger GT.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_stinger_2018">2018 Kia Stinger review<br/></a></strong></em></p>, <p>With its Euro-esque styling, the Stinger looks like it could have emerged from a German automaker. And it was engineered in Europe, too; Kia says that much of its final chassis development was completed at Germany's famed Nürburgring racing circuit. That's pretty standard for brands like BMW, Cadillac, and Jaguar, but it's new ground for Kia.</p>, <p>The Stinger's long hood and short rear overhang are classic rear-wheel-drive design elements—something that Kia has largely imitated but not had the goods to back up until now. Inside, it's also clearly inspired by Germany's best; certain elements of Mercedes-Benz's current design language show through, in particular. Even though it's from what was once a budget brand, the Stinger looks and feels positively upscale inside. Ample use of nappa leather and soft metallic surfaces elevate its interior materials and there is considerable attention to detail absent in more mainstream models in Kia's lineup—like the company's mid-size Optima, for instance.</p>, <p>While the Optima is sized about like the Stinger outside, the two cars are after very different buyers. The Stinger shoots for enthusiast drivers instead of the center of the market. </p>, <p>Pop the Stinger's long hood, and a 2.0-liter turbo-4 or 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 live underneath, both of which are mated exclusively to an 8-speed automatic transmission. A manual gearbox isn't on offer, although we wouldn't rule one out down the line. The 4-cylinder is rated at 255 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque, the latter of which comes on at just 1,400 rpm. The V-6, meanwhile, comes in at an impressive 365-hp and 376 pound-feet.</p>, <p>The Stinger comes standard with rear-wheel drive and a limited-slip differential is available, while the snow-friendly all-wheel-drive system comes with brake-based torque vectoring that clamps down on the inside rear wheel to send the power to the outside wheel and help the car rotate through turns. The Stinger’s suspension is a fairly conventional setup: MacPherson struts up front and a multi-link setup out back. The V-6 model also features four-piston front brakes supplied by Brembo. </p>, <p>In terms of safety, the Stinger is available with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, active lane control, and even a fatigue sensor that sounds alerts if it detects a tired driver.  </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/kia_niro
[<p>The Kia Niro is a hybrid crossover SUV launched for the 2017 model year, with a plug-in hybrid version added for 2018. The subcompact Niro is offered only with a hybrid powertrain; no gasoline-only version will be available.</p>, <p>With the Niro, Kia has a small crossover (or wagon, depending on who you ask) that competes against such vehicles as the Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Chevy Trax, and Mazda CX-3, although the Niro is slightly larger. The Kia Soul is even close, although it has more interior room, but lower fuel economy.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_niro_2018" title="2018 Kia Niro - review">2018 Kia Niro review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Niro shares its underpinnings with the Hyundai Ioniq hybrid hatchback. But while there are other hybrid five-door hatchbacks—the Toyota Prius and the plug-in Chevrolet Volt are two—the Niro is unique as the only dedicated-hybrid crossover sold in the U.S. Kia calls it a crossover even though all-wheel drive is not available on any version. The small roster of other hybrid crossovers adapted from conventional models includes the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, the luxury Lexus NX 300h, and the Nissan Rogue Hybrid, all larger and less fuel-efficient than the Niro.</p>, <p>The FE version of the Kia Niro Hybrid achieves an EPA rating of 50 mpg combined, an aggressive figure for a vehicle with more crossover looks and capabilities than the average hatchback. Other trim levels are rated at 49 mpg and 43 mpg combined. The Niro's lines actually split the difference between what could be considered a conventional wagon and a genuine utility vehicle. But its crossover credentials are damaged by the lack of available all-wheel drive, usually a requirement in cold-weather states for anything considered a crossover or SUV.</p>, <p>The Kia Niro Hybrid is powered by a 104-horsepower direct-injected 1.6-liter inline-4, running on the ultra-efficient Atkinson cycle, combined with the company's own 6-speed dual-clutch transmission. In between those two components, a 32-kilowatt (43-hp) electric motor contributes its own torque and can propel the car on its own under some driving conditions. Kia quotes combined power output at 139 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>The motor acts as a generator to recapture otherwise wasted energy from braking and engine overrun, using it to charge a 1.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery sited under the rear seat. Under power, the battery sends energy to the motor to power the Niro—whether by itself or in combination with the engine. Kia says a plug-in hybrid version of the Niro will come later.</p>, <p>The Niro Plug-In Hybrid uses the same engine and transmission with a more powerful 45-kw (60-hp) electric motor, and its much larger 8.9-kwh battery pack occupies the space under the load deck. Cargo capacity and rear leg room, however, are virtually the same either version, and only the eagle-eyed will notice a few trim differences and the charge-port door on the left-front fender that distinguish the plug-in from the regular hybrid.</p>, <p>EPA ratings for the Niro Plug-In Hybrid are 26 miles of electric range, 105 MPGe when running electrically, and 46 mpg combined once it reverts to a conventional hybrid after the battery is depleted. That’s slightly higher than the 43 mpg combined that the equivalent Hybrid model gets.</p>, <p>The Niro reached showrooms in January 2017 in four trim levels. The base FE model deletes several items from the next-higher LX trim level, to reduce its weight enough that it reaches that ideal 50-mpg combined EPA rating. The mid-level LX and EX are expected to be the volume versions, with the well-equipped Touring model at the top. For 2017, Niro prices ranged from about $24,000 including delivery to around $34,000 for a fully optioned Touring version.</p>, <p>The plug-in Niro starts under $30,000 and goes to about $35,000. It The qualifies for a $4,543 federal income-tax credit the year it’s purchased, as well as state purchase rebates of $2,000 in New York and $1,500 in California, among others.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Sportage is a five-seat crossover SUV that fits below the Sorento in the South Korean automaker's lineup.</p>, <p>Redesigned for 2017, the Kia Sportage has rivals in vehicles such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Mazda CX-5, and the related Hyundai Tucson.</p>, <p>With the Sportage, Kia has made a transition from off-roader to urban carver. Its smallest crossover SUV was, in its distant past, a true SUV. These days it's more a crossover with more car-like road manners. Changes for 2018 are minor but widespread: EX trims now include blind-spot monitors and every variant sees some optional equipment shuffling. Automatic emergency braking is now available at every step of the Sportage trim walk.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our</strong> <strong><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_sportage_2018">2018 Kia Sportage review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong><strong>The new Kia Sportage</strong></strong></p>, <p>The latest Sportage that arrived for the 2017 model year has a look that's thicker and more muscular. It brims with big air intakes and puffed-up fenders. Inside, the Sportage's new cabin is streamlined with a more horizontal layout and more soft-touch materials.</p>, <p>Two powertrains are offered on the new Sportage. Base models get a 181-horsepower 2.4-liter inline-4, with a 6-speed automatic and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. The Sportage SX has a 2.0-liter turbo-4 with 240 hp. A fully redesigned suspension and steering system improve its on-road performance. The Sportage is one of the heaviest models in its class, and while that helps allow a nice, settled ride, it does make the driving experience a little more deliberate than you might expect, given the specs.<em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The new Sportage is slightly larger than the previous model, with 1.2 inches more space between the front and rear wheels, and 1.6 inches more overall length. Kia promises slightly more head room and knee room, especially for the back seat. Cargo space is up to 30.7 cubic feet behind the second row.</p>, <p>Kia earns good safety scores for the Sportage, including a Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS. The Sportage offers forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking; blind-spot monitors; a lane-departure warning system; and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>All versions of the new Sportage come with touchscreen audio, Bluetooth, power features, and satellite radio. The Sportage EX adds a new infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while the Sportage SX gets navigation and an 8.0-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Sportage history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The very first generation of the Kia Sportage was a different car for a different time. It appeared in showrooms way back in 1993 as a primarily rear-wheel-drive vehicle, and while it faced an uphill battle from the beginning against competitors like the Toyota RAV4 and Subaru Forester, it had a strong start before sales waned. That truck-like Sportage was discontinued in 2002.</p>, <p>When the second-generation model arrived in 2004, it had transitioned into crossover territory. By this time, the compact crossover SUV segment had exploded with newcomers like the Ford Escape, Mazda Tribute, and Honda CR-V, so competition was considerable. The second-generation Kia Sportage was criticized for losing the off-road prowess of its predecessor, while at the same time not being as refined as its rivals—though a new V-6 engine was added to the lineup and overall fit and finish were improved considerably.</p>, <p>A facelifted version was introduced in 2008. The changes consisted of new-look bumpers, revised headlights, and an updated dashboard and instrument panel. The base Kia Sportage featured a 141-hp, 2.0-liter inline-4 and front-wheel drive as standard, while the range-topper came with a 175-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 and all-wheel drive. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or an outdated 4-speed automatic. Overall, these models remained a strong value, even with performance that lagged behind that of many rivals.</p>, <p>The most recent Sportage, the third-generation version, arrived in 2011. It brought with it crisp new styling, a longer wheelbase, more interior and cargo space, and an improved ride, as well as sportier engine options.</p>, <p>This Sportage offered room for five passengers—four could travel comfortably—advanced interior amenities, good fuel efficiency, and more than a dash of panache at a price that was competitive among compact crossovers. It found buyers among couples and small families, perhaps including a few who've moved up from the quirky Soul hatchback.</p>, <p>Mechanically, this Sportage had much in common with the Hyundai Tucson, though the styling was a key differentiating factor. A direct-injection, 2.4-liter inline-4 making 176 hp provided more gusto than previous V-6 engine options, and there also was a 260-hp turbocharged SX model. All-wheel drive remained an option across the line and included a switchable differential lock that helped when the going grew rough. Overall, we found these models to be quite roomy, with reasonably good performance in standard trims. The ride was comfortable, although its quality suffered if you stepped up to the 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Kia has always focused on features to bring in customers, and that certainly was evident with this Sportage. The list of standard and optional items included keyless start, Bluetooth, a USB port, and satellite radio. Higher trim levels offered leather upholstery, heated seats, a cooled driver's seat, and the more sophisticated UVO infotainment system.</p>, <p>The 2012-2013 Kia Sportage was among vehicles found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers. Kia initially submitted figures of 21 mpg city, 26 highway, 23 combined with the 2.0-liter engine and 4WD up to 22/32/25 mpg with the 2.4-liter and front-wheel drive. On a confirmation check of several vehicles, the EPA found the Soul's actual tested fuel economy to be lower, with those figures (along with all the rest in the lineup) corrected to 20/25/22 mpg and 21/30/25 mpg, respectively. See the model-year details for all the other numbers. Owners were able to register with Kia to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels through a website, <a href="https://kiampginfo.com/overview/affected-models">KiaMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>The Sportage received a very mild facelift for the 2014 model year, as well as an updated version of the 2.4-liter inline-4, which made more power and got better fuel economy—maxing out at 28 mpg highway for the front-drive version. Changes for 2015 were minor, consisting mostly of shuffled package options and additional standard equipment for the top SX trim level. For 2016, the Sportage EX received standard leather seats.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Sorento is a mid-size crossover SUV with seating for up to seven passengers in three rows of seats.</p>, <p>The Sorento is offered in many configurations, with a choice of 4- or 6-cylinder engines and optional all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With the Sorento, Kia has a crossover to fill a growing need for many families, but it hasn't always been that way. Like the mechanically related Hyundai Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport, the Sorrento started life as a traditional SUV but has evolved to a more modern, car-like crossover.</p>, <p>The Sorento faces off against a raft of competitors including the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Edge and Explorer, Nissan Murano, and the Dodge Journey. Of course, its half-sibling, the Hyundai Santa Fe, should be considered as well.</p>, <p>For the 2019 model year, the Sorento gained a mild restyling and a new 8-speed automatic paired to its V-6 engine. The turbo-4 was dropped.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_sorento_2018">2019 Kia Sorento review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Sorento</strong></p>, <p>Kia introduced a new Sorento at the 2014 Paris auto show. The third-generation model arrived in the U.S. as a 2016 model. Its styling is an evolution of the previous model, with all of Kia's latest brand cues mixed in.</p>, <p>The Sorento's engine lineup expanded to three choices: an improved version of the 2.4-liter inline-4, the same 3.3-liter V-6 from before, and a 2.0-liter turbo-4. The wheelbase was stretched 3.1 inches, and the chassis was reinforced and strengthened to improve handling and ride. The new Sorento also carries additional standard and optional features, such as a surround-view camera system, power-adjustable second-row seats, and several advanced-safety items.</p>, <p>The new Sorento was more refined than its predecessor, with a very nicely finished interior and improved materials. The styling is more cohesive, owing some to Kia's coming of age in the U.S. Like other new Kias, it offers three driving modes: Sport, Normal, and Eco. They tailor engine, transmission, and steering settings based on the selected mode.</p>, <p>In line with the competition—or perhaps slightly below it—prices for the current Sorento start at about $26,000, though a heavy hand on the options list will drive that above $30,000 quickly and the top models go for more than $40,000.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Sorento's turbo-4 bit the dust, but an 8-speed automatic replaced the 6-speed on V-6 models. Minor chassis and steering revisions improved its ride and handling, too.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Sorento history</strong><em><br/></em></p>, <p>In its first generation, which was sold from 2003 to 2010, the Sorento was a body-on-frame SUV instead of using a carlike unibody to create a crossover. This decision hurt the model some, as many families prioritize the interior space, ride, and handling of a crossover over towing and off-road capability offered by a traditional sport-utility and its truck-like frame.</p>, <p>One of two V-6 engines—a 242-horsepower 3.3-liter and a 262-hp 3.8-liter—was matched to a 5-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel-drive capabilities were offered on both, but the system for the smaller engine was part-time rather than full four-wheel drive. Towing capacities were 3,500 and 5,000 pounds, respectively, for the smaller and larger engines. Fuel economy, however, was just 16 mpg city, 22 highway with the smaller engine, and a dismal 15/20 mpg with the larger.</p>, <p>The 2011 Kia Sorento switched from old truck-style body-and-frame construction to a car-based platform. Many of its mechanicals were closely related to those in its corporate cousin, the Hyundai Santa Fe. Production also moved to Georgia. And like many of its competitors, it offered a choice among two 4-cylinders and a V-6, rather than two sizes of V-6. The 276-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 with 6-speed automatic was rated at up to 26 mpg highway. The 175-hp, 2.4-liter inline-4 was rated at up to 29 mpg highway and came with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic, while a direct-injection version, new for the 2012 model year, had 191 hp and EPA-rated highway mileage of up to 30 mpg. Front-wheel-drive was standard, with all-wheel drive available on all except the base manual-transmission version.</p>, <p>All Sorentos in this generation came well-equipped, with air conditioning, cruise control, satellite radio, and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel standard. A third-row seat became standard on V-6 models. The EX model added 18-inch wheels and a host of electronics, including keyless ignition, backup sensors, automatic headlights, leather seating, and a power driver’s seat. Options included navigation, a better audio system, a sunroof, a DVD entertainment system, and Kia's voice-command UVO system.</p>, <p>While its outward appearance didn't change much, the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_sorento_2014">2014 Kia Sorento</a> got a substantial mid-cycle refresh. Updates included a re-engineered body structure, a new 290-hp, 3.3-liter direct-injected V-6 engine (in addition to the 191-hp inline-4), improved versions of the available all-wheel-drive system, and a long list of new features. The front and rear end were restyled, and the Sorento's infotainment systems were upgraded. The systems offered 8.0-inch screens, Infinity premium audio, real-time traffic info, and next-gen UVO eServices features.</p>, <p>For 2014, a top Sorento SX model added nappa leather upholstery, heated rear seats, and a wood-trimmed heated steering wheel, as well as HID headlights and more on the outside. Other new features included second-row sunshades, ventilated seats, and a power inverter.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Optima is the South Korean automaker's mid-size, four-door family sedan.</p>, <p>With the Optima, Kia competes in one of the most challenging segments in the car industry. Its competition includes best sellers like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, not to mention the Ford Fusion, Nissan Altima, Mazda 6, and Chevy Malibu, as well as its mechanical cousin, the Hyundai Sonata.</p>, <p>The newest Optima was introduced for the 2016 model year as a bona fide contender among mid-size sedans. For the 2019 year, automatic emergency braking is standard and the Optima's styling has been modestly updated.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_optima_2019">2019 Kia Optima preview</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Optima</strong></p>, <p>A new Optima arrived for 2016. Styling for the new Optima is slightly less dramatic than before, while the car itself is slightly wider, with a touch of extra wheelbase length. The cabin is slightly restyled, and has much more in common with the related Hyundai Sonata than before.</p>, <p>The latest <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_optima_2016">Kia Optima</a> benefited from the dual-clutch automatic transmission offered in the Hyundai Sonata Eco model. Like the Sonata, the new Optima offers a 2.4-liter inline-4 as well as two turbo-4s, a 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter. Kia claims increased torsional rigidity and improved sound suppression.</p>, <p>On the infotainment end, the Optima offers both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility for its base 7.0-inch touchscreen or optional 8.0-inch touchscreen.</p>, <p>Today, the Optima shares an assembly plant in West Point, Georgia, with the Kia Sorento, though Optima Hybrid sedans are made in South Korea. A new S trim level joined the lineup for 2018. The following year, the Optima's styling was updated (squint and perhaps you'll see the differences), but the big and worthwhile change was its newly standard automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Optima history</strong></p>, <p>With the first-generation Optima, Kia reached beyond its usual crossover and hatchback offerings to take on the mainstream mid-size sedan market. From 2000 to 2005, Kia was still in its infancy in the U.S., and as a result, the Optima was substantially the same as the Hyundai Sonata, save for some cosmetic differences. It was offered with a 4-cylinder engine, and wore a small grille that differentiated it from the Sonata.</p>, <p>For the second generation, the 2005-2010 Kia Optima had styling that more distinctly separated it from its Hyundai cousin. In 2008 it received a revised look influenced by new design director Peter Schreyer, as well as updates to equipment including Bluetooth and satellite radio. It remained a compact to mid-size sedan, but in the second generation it added an optional V-6.</p>, <p>These models came with either a 175-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-4 or a 194-hp, 2.7-liter V-6. The 4-cylinder returned better fuel economy, while the V-6 didn't offer much more power, so we did recommended the base engine. While this Optima wasn't a style leader, it did have a spacious interior and an airy feel, with good outward visibility. Safety ratings were good; front side airbags came standard, along with side-curtain airbags covering both rows, and active headrests for front-seat occupants.</p>, <p>The 2011 Kia Optima was new. The sedan was longer, wider and lower than before—and much more attractive, with some of our editors liking the Optima's look better than that of the Sonata.</p>, <p>The Optima shared the Sonata's powertrains, including a 200-hp, 2.4-liter direct-injection inline-4, a 274-hp, 2.0-liter turbo-4, and a new hybrid model. Fuel economy ratings for the base engine were as high as 35 mpg highway, and up to 40 mpg for the Hybrid. Though thrifty, the gas-electric model's behavior left it a tier below the more refined performance of Toyota and Ford hybrids.</p>, <p>The Optima's standard and optional features lists were stronger than for those of most other mid-size sedans in this price range. Bluetooth and a USB port were included even on base models, the mid-level EX trim offered dual-zone climate control and a smart-key system, and top options included Infinity audio, leather upholstery, and heated rear seats. A navigation system was available, as was UVO, an enhanced system for smartphone connectivity.</p>, <p>No major changes were made to the Optima for 2013, although late in the model year the Hybrid model saw some driveability updates and mileage improvements, with its EPA numbers now coming in at 35 mpg city, 39 highway. In 2014, the four-door was given a small revamp that included some aesthetic tweaks up front, upgrades to the infotainment offerings, and cross-traffic alerts as well as blind-spot monitoring.</p>, <p>The 2011-2013 Optima Hybrid was one of a group of cars that have been found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers. Kia initially submitted figures of 35 mpg city, 40 highway, 37 combined to the EPA, which allows automakers to self-certify fuel economy. On a confirmation check of several vehicles, the EPA found the Optima Hybrid's actual tested fuel economy to be 34/39/36 mpg. Owners can register with Kia to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels; more details are found at <a href="https://kiampginfo.com/overview/affected-models">KiaMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Optima received the latest version of Kia's UVO infotainment system.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Soul is a compact hatchback that was introduced in the 2009 model year. A part of Kia's compact family of cars (one that includes the Forte sedan, coupe, and hatchback) the Soul has an unorthodox hatchback shape that's won it the affection of buyers who might otherwise be shopping for a small crossover SUV.</p>, <p>With the Soul, Kia found a mainstream hit in a boxy shape. It's a rival for the Jeep Renegade, VW Golf, and Nissan Juke—even the Kia Niro that offers better fuel economy, albeit in a smaller package.</p>, <p>The Soul is the South Korean brand's first and only model sold with an all-electric version in the U.S., albeit in very small quantities. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_soul-ev_2017">Kia Soul EV</a> has about 100 miles of battery-powered driving range.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_soul_2018">2018 Kia Soul review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Soul</strong></p>, <p>A redesigned version of the Soul emerged in 2014, with more power and a much better interior. Engine options include a pair of 4-cylinders, with manual and automatic transmissions on offer. The base engine is a 1.6-liter inline-4 with 130 horsepower and 118-pound-feet. Soul Plus and Soul Exclaim hatchbacks are fitted with a 2.0-liter, inline-4 that produces 164 hp and 151 lb-ft of torque, paired only with a 6-speed automatic, which is optional on the base model. In 2017, a turbocharged model was added to the lineup. The 1.6-liter turbo-4, borrowed from the Elantra Sport, makes 201 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque and is paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.</p>, <p>The styling has been modernized without losing the flavor of the original; it's slightly more aggressive looking while maintaining the friendly bulldog look. Crash-test ratings have improved on the new Soul as well.</p>, <p>The Soul offers good space for four passengers, although adding a fifth will make things a bit cozy. Second-row seats can be folded forward to increase cargo space to more than 61 cubic feet, and there is a small storage bin located below the cargo floor, with an organizer inside that separates the area into different spaces. The seats are comfortable and the interior is relatively flexible for a small hatchback.</p>, <p>A 10-year/100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty extends to the Soul, which also comes with power features, iPod connectivity and Bluetooth standard on most versions. A navigation system and Kia's system for voice controls for infotainment are available, although unfortunately you can't get both together as of yet. Other available features include cooled front seats, a heated steering wheel, and adjustable mood lighting.</p>, <p>Few changes were made to the Soul through the 2016 model year.</p>, <p>In the 2018 model year, Kia added automatic emergency braking to a package offered only on the Soul Plus.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Soul history</strong></p>, <p>First shown in production form at the 2008 Paris auto show, the Kia Soul was designed at the company's U.S. headquarters near Irvine, California.</p>, <p>The Soul went on sale in 2009 with a Web-driven marketing campaign that featured hamsters driving, and borrowed characters from Nickelodeon's lineup of cartoons. But the Soul is a more serious effort than that all seems. The hatchback was pitched directly against the likes of the Toyota Matrix, Nissan Cube, Scion xB, Chevrolet HHR and Chrysler PT Cruiser, as Kia tried to establish a larger foothold among younger drivers looking for a dash of style.</p>, <p>Two engines and two transmissions were available in the 2010 and 2011 model years. A 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 122 hp was teamed with a 5-speed manual in base models, and was rated at 26 mpg city, 31 highway. More common was a version powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 with 142 hp, which offered an optional 4-speed automatic; the EPA rated this combination at 24 mpg city, 30 highway.</p>, <p>Kia revamped the Soul's engine offerings for 2012 while also giving it a light once-over inside. A new 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 135 hp and 121 lb-ft of torque took over as the base engine, while the optional engine became a 2.0-liter inline-4 making 164 hp and 143 lb-ft. A 6-speed manual was standard, with a 6-speed auto as an option on some trims and standard on others. Fuel economy for either transmission was rated at 26 mpg city, 34 highway. The Soul continued to be a confidence-inspiring little runabout, if not wholly exciting on the road.</p>, <p>The 2012-2013 Kia Soul is one of a set of vehicles <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080337_hyundai-kia-owners-seek-775-million-over-fuel-economy-fibs">found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers</a>.

--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/kia_soul-ev
[<p>The Kia Soul EV is the first electric car sold in the U.S. by the Korean automaker.</p>, <p>The electric Soul adds a zero-emissions powertrain to its enormously popular Soul small wagon that should give it some credibility among tech-focused buyers.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115143_2018-kia-soul-ev">2018 Kia Soul EV review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Kia launched its second-generation gasoline Soul for the 2014 model year, and the battery-electric Soul EV arrived a year later for 2015. In its second model year, 2016, the Soul EV picks up a new, more basic trim level as well as the existing pair, and Kia tweaked a few features slightly. In 2018, Kia increased the overall battery capacity from 27 to 30 kwh.</p>, <p>With its 30-kwh lithium-ion battery pack powering an 109-horsepower motor that drives the front wheels, the Soul EV is roughly similar in specification to the Volkswagen e-Golf, the Ford Focus Electric. The Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt EV, and Tesla Model 3 all have significantly more range.</p>, <p>The electric Kia stands out from the rest of the pack in one area: it has somewhat more interior space, due to its tall-wagon shape. In practice, this means that around town the Soul EV delivers a real-world 100 miles of range in temperate weather. It's not the 150 to 200 miles that would largely eliminates range anxiety, but the three-digit figure is more reassuring to drivers than it might seem.</p>, <p>The Soul EV looks pretty much like a tricked-out version of the regular Soul. It has some unique colors, and rather than a grille, there's a blanking plate over the opening with a door for the charging port on neat articulated hinges that swing it out and to the side when opened.</p>, <p>Kia is to be complimented for including a CHAdeMO DC fast charge port in every Soul EV. (For 2016, a plug lock was added as well.) The electric Soul also has a standard 6.6-kw onboard charger for 240-volt Level 2 charging (versus the 3.3-kw chargers fitted to some competitors). Both heated front seats and a heated steering wheel make driver and passenger feel warmer in cold weather, minimizing the use of cabin heating to save energy and maximize cold-weather range.</p>, <p>The only drawback to the Kia Soul EV, is in fact, its limited availability and low volumes. Kia itself has said it underestimated how popular the little electric wagon would be, and it's trying to get more production from the factory in Korea to expand sales to territories beyond California, Oregon, and Georgia—which were the only three markets where the car was initially available.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Optima Hybrid is exactly what the name implies; it looks, performs, and functions just as well as the mainstream Optima sedan but has a very fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain.</p>, <p>The Optima Hybrid lineup, which was redesigned for 2017, rivals the Toyota Camry Hybrid and Ford Fusion Hybrid, as well as the Chevrolet Malibu. It’s closely related to the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, and like that model it also includes a plug-in hybrid model, called the Optima Plug-In Hybrid or Optima PHEV, which also goes up against the Ford Fusion Energi.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our review of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111708_2018-kia-optima-hybrid">2018 Kia Optima Hybrid</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Optima Hybrid</strong></p>, <p>Compared to the Kia Optima, the Optima Hybrid and Optima Plug-In Hybrid are almost indistinguishable because those models differ in mostly cosmetic ways, outside of powertrain and packaging. Active grille shutters, special front aerodynamic skirting, a beveled rear bumper, and a rear diffuser together help reduce drag. Hybrid models also get modern LED exterior lighting.</p>, <p>The Optima Hybrid is powered by a 154-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-4, with a 38-kw electric motor system that’s clutched into a 6-speed automatic transmission. In all, it makes 193 hp.</p>, <p>The Hybrid has a 1.62-kwh lithium-polymer battery pack that’s underneath the trunk floor, where the spare tire would otherwise be, with packaging concessions to back seat or cargo space. In the Optima PHEV, there’s a stronger 50-kw motor, plus a much larger 9.8-kwh pack is located under the back seat and in the forward area of the trunk, limiting space slightly compared to the standard Optima.</p>, <p>That larger battery allows the PHEV to go 27 miles in EV mode, though there’s no way to fully “lock in” a pure electric mode (the gasoline engine will still turn on if you press the accelerator too far).</p>, <p>Feature highlights on the latest 2017 Kia Optima Hybrid include a 10-speaker, 630-watt Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility—to control smartphone apps via the infotainment system. There’s also an available suite of active-safety and driver-assistance systems—including automatic emergency, which can bring the vehicle to a full stop to avoid a crash or reduce damage.</p>, <p>The 2017 Kia Optima Hybrid lineup has been rated at 42 mpg combined by the EPA—better on the highway than the Ford Fusion Hybrid, and better than the Toyota Camry Hybrid, as well as just ahead of the Sonata Hybrid.</p>, <p>No changes were made for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Optima Hybrid history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The first generation of the Optima Hybrid, which was sold from the 2011 through the 2016 model years, was a bit of a work in progress. It originally offered a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, as well as a motor system clutched into the 6-speed automatic transmission—just as in the redesigned 2017 model—and made 206 total hp and 235 lb-ft. That was revised to 199 hp for the 2013 model year, as this model got some significant improvements to drivability and the general smoothness of the hybrid system.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/kia_rio
[<p>The Kia Rio is the South Korean automaker's smallest and least expensive U.S. offering. It's sold as either a four-door sedan or as a five-door hatchback.</p>, <p>The newest Kia Rio was launched as a 2018 model, in hatchback or sedan form. The automaker has big plans for the car, including for the first time producing it in North America. The car's dimensions were largely the same from the outgoing model, but ride and handling were improved over the previous car.</p>, <p>With the Rio, Kia has a rival for other small cars including the Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, and Toyota Yaris—even the Hyundai Accent, with which it shares some of its running gear.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_rio_2018">2018 Kia Rio review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Rio</strong></p>, <p>The new Kia Rio arrived for the 2018 model year with a conservative restyling and a bigger emphasis on driveability. The Rio is still powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4, but the new motor made more power lower in the rev range for stoplight grands prix. The engine's ratings were lower than the year before, only 130 horsepower, but the same 32-mpg average regardless of transmission.</p>, <p>Available in either a hatchback or sedan, the 2018 Kia Rio was among the most affordable new cars available to shoppers, but it keenly missed some safety features other automakers were making standard. Only the top-trim Kia Rio EX came equipped with automatic emergency braking, and base versions skipped a rearview camera.</p>, <p>Despite lacking some common-sense features, the Rio was made better with more sound-deadening material and a smoother drive. The automaker shipped the cars with its newest infotainment system, dubbed UVO 3.</p>, <p>Although the small compact car segment is dwindling in the U.S., Kia says the fourth-generation Rio will be the best-selling car for the brand over its life. Kia said worldwide sales of the Rio would top 1 million cars.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Rio history<br/></strong></p>, <p>When it was added to the lineup back in 2001, the Rio became the third Kia model to be offered in the U.S. after the Sportage small crossover and the Sephia sedan (a car later succeeded by the Spectra, and most recently the Forte). That first Rio used a 96-hp, 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine (upgraded to 104 hp for 2003), along with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. At a price below $9,000, we found it well-built but coarse and unrefined, with substandard interior materials. In 2002, a Rio Cinco five-door hatchback (or, arguably, a wagon) joined the lineup, offering low-priced cargo volume and versatility.</p>, <p>In 2007, the second-generation Rio shared its running gear and underpinnings with the Hyundai Accent (Hyundai owns Kia, though the two brands operate fairly separately in the U.S. market). The revised Rio had had one of the better interiors in its class—even though it wasn't that exciting in design—as well as much better ride quality. It caught up with competitors on several levels and remained one of the better-equipped subcompacts in the class for several years. A smooth new 110-hp, 1.6-liter four gave it more gusto, while transmissions remained a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. Unfortunately, despite its standard side airbags (hardly ubiquitous at the time), its crash-test ratings were some of the lowest in the class. A Rio5 five-door hatchback model was introduced for 2008, although only in the somewhat more expensive LX trim.</p>, <p>The 2012 model year marked the beginning of the third generation for Kia's Rio. While it is priced considerably higher than the 2011 car it replaced, the latest Rio is not only sportier and more stylish inside and out, but also much more engaging to drive. Crisp details, lots of body sculpting, and a European-inspired interior bring the nicely proportioned Rio into full competition with rival models. The sedan is a particular standout, with a design that doesn't look bulky and awkward like many of its competitors' four-doors do.</p>, <p>Only one engine was offered. The smooth, 1.6-liter, direct-injected 4-cylinder engine made 138 horsepower and is paired with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The Rio's safety ratings improved, but were still middling—four stars overall from the NHTSA, and one "Marginal" and one "Acceptable" rating from the IIHS, among "Good" ratings in other categories.</p>, <p>One black mark on the otherwise cheerful Rio's record is that it was one of several vehicles for which Kia (and also Hyundai) were found to have overstated fuel-economy numbers. Kia self-certified that the Rio automatic achieved 30 mpg city, 40 highway, 33 combined. The manual was rated higher at 34 mpg combined. But after complaints from buyers, the EPA tested several vehicles and found that the actual numbers should have been 28/36/31 mpg for the 6-speed automatic, and 29/37/32 mpg for the 6-speed manual. Perhaps more embarrassing, the 2013 Kia Rio Eco model was busted down from 34 mpg to 32 mpg combined, with its magic 40-mpg highway number falling to 36 mpg as well.</p>, <p>Kia will reimburse owners of all the affected cars for the extra gasoline costs reflected by the more accurate lower ratings. (The company attributed it all to test-cycle errors on its part, and apologized profusely and repeatedly.) Owners can register with Kia to receive reimbursement for the gas consumed above and beyond expected levels; more details are found at <a href="https://kiampginfo.com/overview/affected-models">KiaMPGInfo.com</a>.</p>, <p>For 2013, the only change to the Rio lineup was the arrival of a long-delayed engine start-stop option, priced at $400. The impact was about a 1-mile-per-gallon increase for the Rio's city fuel-economy rating, though we're not convinced the option will find many takers.</p>, <p>For 2016, the Rio received a mild facelift. The changes consist of a restyled front end, revised lighting elements, and some new color options.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Sedona is the South Korean automaker's minivan. Sold as the Carnival in other markets around the world, the Sedona is built in South Korea.</p>, <p>With the Sedona, Kia has a competitor for minivan stalwarts such as the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey, Chrysler Pacifica, and Dodge Town &amp; Country. The Sedona is among the oldest in its class, but it's less expensive than many of its competitors.</p>, <p>For 2017, Kia added more available active safety features and Apple CarPlay to most models. The 2018 model year was unchanged.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_sedona_2018">2018 Kia Sedona review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Sedona</strong></p>, <p>After taking a brief hiatus and returning mostly unchanged in 2014, the Sedona was given a major rework for 2015. Changes included a noticeably new body, as well as an updated interior, modern tech features, and a new sliding-seat system.</p>, <p>While the body is new, the mechanicals aren't. A familiar corporate 3.3-liter V-6 sits up front and is paired with a 6-speed automatic. They're packed into a stronger body shell that stretches a little longer than the outgoing model, although it still doesn't match competitors like the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey in overall size.</p>, <p>There's seating for up to eight passengers inside the Sedona. The key new feature for the Sedona could be its "Slide-n-Stow" second-row seat. It can slide forward and flip upright to allow an especially low, level load floor without the need to remove the seats. An alternate arrangement allows for "first-class" lounge seating with retractable lower leg rests, similar to what is available in the Toyota Sienna. As for the third row, it's somewhat smaller but is split 60/40 and folds flat right into a well in the floor.</p>, <p>The latest version of Kia's UVO infotainment system is offered in the new Sedona, and can pair with a smartphone for data. It can stream audio from smartphone apps like Pandora to the car's head unit. As this is a minivan, a rear-seat entertainment system is available, and the Sedona offers the requisite electrified goodies like power sliding side doors and a hatch that auto opens when the key is nearby (presumably in your pocket) for a few seconds.</p>, <p>Fuel economy ranges from 19 to 21 mpg combined for all versions of the new Sedona; prices begin at about $26,000, and rise to more than $37,000 for well-trimmed models.</p>, <p>The 2016 Sedona added a few features, including a standard rearview camera. In 2017, the Sedona added available advanced safety features including blind-spot monitors, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. When equipped with those features, the IIHS deemed the Sedona a Top Safety Pick+ for safety-conscious families to consider. Kia also added Apple CarPlay to most models, improving on a solid set of standard features.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Sedon</strong><strong>a history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The first-generation Sedona went on sale here as a 2002 model and ran through the 2005 model year. Its 3.5-liter V-6 made 195 horsepower and was teamed to a 4-speed automatic. It lacked features found on competitive minivans, like power-sliding side doors, curtain airbags, a navigation system, and a fold-flat third-row seat. That first Sedona was also a heavy vehicle, so performance and fuel economy both suffered compared to the segment leaders.</p>, <p>The second-generation Sedona arrived as a 2006 model, much improved. The powertrain was updated to a 3.8-liters V-6 that made 244 hp, teamed with a 5-speed automatic with manual gear selection. Fuel economy improved to 17/24 mpg, a competitive figure. In 2007, Kia added a short-wheelbase version, making the Sedona the only two-body-style minivan left in America (since Chrysler had since dropped the short-wheelbase Dodge Caravan). That version was dropped after the 2008 model year.</p>, <p>Performance improved, but the features included in the Sedona still fell short of those in other minivans. The Sedona carried seven passengers, but there was no clever fold-away seat option like that in the Chrysler minivans or in the Nissan Quest. The third-row seat did fold flat into the rear cargo area, however. Interior trim was better than in prior versions, and the Sedona also added USB audio inputs, a navigation system, and a DVD entertainment system.</p>, <p>Anti-lock brakes, as well as stability and traction control, plus front, side, and side curtain airbags (that cover all three rows of seats) were all standard on this Sedona, and its performance in NHTSA and IIHS crash tests was acceptable, though it didn't score well in the latest roof-crush tests. Also standard was a backup warning system, although outward visibility was already quite good.</p>, <p>Spruced up in the 2011 model year with a new face and a revised powertrain, the Sedona soldiered on with its 3.5-liter V-6 with 271 hp, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Sedona was carried over with only minor changes in the 2012 model year, while it skipped 2013 and returned for a short 2014 model year with only minor changes.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Forte is a family of compact vehicles that includes a sedan, a hatchback, and previously, a coupe (playfully branded the Koup).</p>, <p>On sale since 2010, the Forte took the place of Kia's Spectra and Spectra 5 models. The Forte immediately gave Kia reputability among economy cars, thanks to the Forte's more attractive shape and competitive hardware.</p>, <p>For 2018, only minor changes to feature availability were made, though Apple CarPlay and Android Auto now can be accessed through the Forte's infotainment system.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_forte_2018">2018 Kia Forte review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Forte</strong></p>, <p>The Forte lineup today includes a compact four-door sedan and a five-door hatchback, with new and more flowing lines and even more amenities than its predecessor. Competitors include the high-selling Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic, along with the Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra (which is closely related to the Forte), Mazda 3, and Subaru Impreza—as well as the slightly pricier Volkswagen Jetta sedan and Golf hatchback.</p>, <p>The redesigned 2014 Kia Forte sedan made its way to showrooms in the spring of 2013, while the Koup two-door and five-door followed shortly after. That Forte is longer, lower, and wider than its predecessor, with 2 inches more in the wheelbase, expanding interior room. It came in two basic trim levels: the base LX and the high-end EX, each with its own engine. A  mid-level S model was added for 2017. The 148-hp, 1.8-liter inline-4 used in the Forte LX for 2014-2016 was replaced with a 147-hp 2.0-liter inline-4 for the 2017 model year. A 6-speed manual is standard on the LX, with a 6-speed automatic optional. The Forte EX upgrades to a 173-hp, 2.0-liter 4 that is paired with the 6-speed automatic only. All models use electric power steering.</p>, <p>Today's Fortes offer better fuel efficiency and much more handsome styling than their predecessors. The models, and Kia in general, have made big strides in infotainment, with the best system included with navigation. All Forte sedans have air conditioning, satellite radio, heated outside mirrors, and steering-wheel audio controls. The Forte EX adds standard keyless entry, a cooled glovebox, a rearview camera, and Kia's UVO connectivity and infotainment system.</p>, <p>Kia made few changes to the Forte for 2015, and gave it a slightly updated nose for 2017 along with the revised base engine. Fuel-economy ratings have varied over the years, with the latest models ranging from 28 to 32 mpg combined, hardly at the top of the efficiency heap among compact sedans. The 2016 model year brought a new base audio system, and 2017 an added option package of active-safety features.</p>, <p>For 2017, Kia slightly restyled the Forte, and fitted a new 4-cylinder engine to the lineup—one shared with the new Hyundai Elantra.</p>, <p><strong>Kia Forte history</strong></p>, <p>The first generation lasted a short 4 years, with a new and redesigned version launched in 2014. The 2010-2013 Forte 4-door sedan and two-door Forte Koup shared little sheet metal. Both were neatly and handsomely styled, elevating Kia from the bland-box lines it had been known for. The standard engine was a 156-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-4 used in the base LX and mid-range EX models, whereas the sportier, top-line SX model got a 173-hp, 2.4-liter inline-4. For the 2010 and 2011 model years, LX and EX Fortes came standard with a 5-speed manual gearbox; a behind-the-times 4-speed automatic was optional. The SX had a 6-speed manual standard, with a 5-speed auto available as an upgrade. In this generation, the Forte started with a base price below $14,000 and was well-received. Solid performance over the next several years helped put Kia back into the small-car conversation with the segment's big players.</p>, <p>All of those original Forte models featured Bluetooth pairing, Sirius Satellite Radio, and steering wheel controls with voice activation. The mid-range EX model added air conditioning and various power accessories; the SX model got a sportier suspension tune and flashy 17-inch alloy wheels. The few options included a power sunroof, leather seats, and a Convenience Package that bundled several upgrades into the base LX.</p>, <p>There was also a high-efficiency option for the EX trim level: The Fuel Economy Package paired the better 5-speed automatic to the 2.0-liter inline-4, adding electric power steering, a smart alternator system, tires with low rolling resistance, and some aerodynamic tweaks as well. It paid off in fuel economy of 27 mpg city, 36 highway, the highest of any Forte model. (The Forte was not among those Kia cars affected by a gas-mileage restatement in the 2011-2013 model years.)</p>, <p>The 2012 model year brought some notable improvements to the Forte. All models were equipped with either 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmissions, with fuel economy ratings of 26/36 mpg for most models. There was also a new Technology Package that brought navigation with SiriusXM Traffic, plus automatic climate control and push-button start.</p>, <p>The Forte Koup and Forte5 hatchback were offered with the same powertrain options as their sedan sibling, although they did without the base-level LX trim. Starting with the EX trim, the coupe and hatch came with standard A/C; power windows and locks; and a 6-speaker stereo with AM/FM/CD/MP3/Satellite capabilities as well as USB and aux-in ports.</p>, <p>With a new model around the corner, the 2013 Forte lineup brought relatively few changes.</p>]

[<p>The Kia Cadenza is a full-size sedan that sits atop the automaker's sedan lineup, kind of. It's bigger than the others, but the Stinger gets more attention.</p>, <p>Kia has pushed its Cadenza full-size four-door sedan slightly upmarket with a 2017 redesign that addresses some of the previous model's shortcomings with a new, more cohesive style and a vastly improved interior.</p>, <p>With the Cadenza, Kia may be looking to siphon near-luxury buyers away from brands such as Buick and Volvo.</p>, <p>It's unchanged for the 2018 model year, save for minor feature packaging.</p>, <p><strong><em dir="ltr" id="tinymce">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_cadenza_2018">2018 Kia Cadenza review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Kia Cadenza</strong></p>, <p>A full redesign for 2017 brought a more dynamic look inside and out, a stiffer structure, and an 8-speed automatic transmission that improved both performance and fuel economy. Its 3.3-liter V-6 was lightly updated, despite a modest power drop to 290 horsepower and 253 pound feet of torque. That's more than made up for by a slightly lower curb weight and the 8-speed automatic, however.</p>, <p>Though its styling is derivative of its predecessor, the K900 is altogether more cohesive-looking inside and out. Its detailing is particularly nice, with a concave grille and more subtle use of chrome than we've seen on a high-end Kia in a while. </p>, <p>Kia expanded availability of automatic emergency braking on the updated Cadenza, making it standard on the Technology and SXL trim levels (although it's not available on the Premium).</p>, <p><strong>Kia Cadenza history</strong></p>, <p>At launch, Cadenzas were powered by a 293-hp, 3.3-liter V-6; a 6-speed automatic transmission that sent the power to the big car's front wheels. The engine checked in with 255 lb-ft of torque, but the peak doesn't occur until high up in the rev range, making the engine feel weaker than its ratings would suggest. The transmission made the best of this, however, and also included a manual-shift gate for drivers. While it looks sporty, the Cadenza has always been tuned more for comfort. </p>, <p>The Cadenza saw several updates for 2015. Kia added an adaptable steering system, which offers three levels of steering weight from which the driver can select. All Cadenza trim levels gained an eight-way adjustable power front passenger seat, while the Technology Package added rear cross-traffic warning. Limited models added a standard surround-view camera system as well as a new analog clock.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the Cadenza gained a new base model, while navigation became standard across the lineup. Blind-spot monitors were added to the Luxury package.</p>]

[<p>The Kia K900 is the biggest, most expensive, most luxurious sedan the South Korean automaker has yet offered in the U.S.</p>, <p>Now in its second generation, the K900 gives Kia a rival for the Acura RLX, Lincoln Continental, Cadillac XTS, and Genesis G90.</p>, <p><strong>The new Kia K900</strong></p>, <p dir="ltr">In its second-generation K900, Kia tilted the big luxury sedan more into the sporty realm it now occupies with the smaller Stinger sport sedan.</p>, <p dir="ltr">The style now is less formal, but also less memorable. The K900 distances itself from the related Genesis G90 with an anodyne shape that looks more like its own Cadenza large four-door than the Stinger. Inside, it's more memorable, with a wide touchscreen floated on the dash amid a sea of fine leather and walnut or ash trim.</p>, <p><em dir="ltr"><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_k900_2019">2019 Kia K900 preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p dir="ltr">The Stinger loans its 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 to the 2019 K900. Rated at 365 horsepower and 376 pound-feet of torque, the sole engine teams with an 8-speed automatic. Kia outfits the K900 with standard rear-biased all-wheel drive and torque-vectoring, so it can split power between front and rear wheels, and then between the rear wheels.</p>, <p>The new K900 has a longer wheelbase and a stiffer body, which should give it a smoother ride, along with its new electronically controlled shocks. It also has more interior room, and power seats for four of the five passenger spots–up to 20-way adjustment for the driver, of course.</p>, <p>The K900's long safety features list includes blind-spot monitors, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and a surround-view camera system. Other features include an available head-up display and a 900-watt, 17-speaker audio with surround sound.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Kia hasn’t priced the 2019 K900, and the EPA hasn’t confirmed fuel economy. Sales begin late in 2018.</p>, <p><strong>Kia K900 history</strong></p>, <p>In its first generation, the 2015-2018 Kia K900 wore almost staid styling, with a chrome-heavy grille and a shape compiled, it seemed, from the luxury sedans sold by other brands. The interior sported Nappa leather trimmings inside, with a choice of wood for the fanciest versions.</p>, <p>At launch the K900 drew power from a 3.8-liter V-6 rated at 311 horsepower, teamed with an 8-speed automatic. At 420 hp, the K900's optional V-8 made it a direct rival for the then-Hyundai Equus (later renamed the Genesis G90). The V-8 came paired with an 8-speed automatic with a choice of Eco, Normal, and Sport shift modes.</p>, <p>Underpinning the K900 was an independent suspension setup with one subframe for the front coil-and-shock setup and another for the rear and its five-link design. Hydraulic power steering was standard; V-6 cars rode on 18-inch, 50-series tires while the V-8 models had 19-inchers.</p>, <p>The first-generation K900 shared its 119.9-inch wheelbase with the Equus. It had extravagant rear-seat leg room and good space up front as well, with places for up to five people. Head room wasn't as good as in the more upright Hyundai: the K900's roofline pinched in, and rear-seat passengers suffered the most.</p>, <p>Kia fitted base K900 models with a 12-way power driver seat, while 16-way seats are available on higher trim levels. Heating and cooling were standard for the front seats as well. In the rear, all K900s included heated outboard seats and remote controls for the climate control system. A VIP package had rear-seat ventilation, reclining seat backs, and power lumbar adjustment.</p>, <p>Standard safety equipment included parking sensors and both a front and a rearview camera; safety options included a head-up display, a lane-departure warning system, blind-spot monitoring, and adaptive cruise control.

The Lexicon audio system sent output to a set of 17 speakers with a total of 900 watts of power. A navigation system was also standard equipment, and it was controlled through the latest version of Kia's UVO infotainment system.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lamborghini_huaracan
[<p>The Lamborghini Huracán is the smaller of the Italian brand's supercars. A relative of the Audi R8, the two-door Huracán seats two passengers, at a base price of more than $250,000. </p>, <p>For that price, the super sports car rivals some of the top performance cars in the world, even stepping on the toes of the larger, more expensive Aventador in some measures.</p>, <p>The Huracán succeeds the Gallardo as the brand's less-expensive sports car. Like the Gallardo before it, the Huracán gets its power from a 5.2-liter V-10 engine mounted amidships, powering all four wheels. That's about where the similarities end. Every element of the Huracán has been redesigned, upgraded, and improved as compared to the Gallardo's already high standard.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lamborghini_huaracan_2017" title="2017 Lamborghini Huracan preview">2017 Lamborghini Huracan preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p>In base form, that 5.2-liter V-10 engine generates 601 horsepower, sending its power through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission to all four wheels. Acceleration is predictably brisk, with 62 mph arriving in just 3.2 seconds and 124 mph in 9.9 seconds. The car's top speed is 202 mph.</p>, <p>The acceleration is aided by a lower power-to-weight ratio, with the chassis of the latest little Lambo using plenty of aluminum and carbon fiber. Weight is down to a relatively svelte 3,140 pounds. Lamborghini is using new bonding methods to connect the aluminum to the carbon fiber, ensuring durability and rigidity.</p>, <p>The technological advancements continue inside the Huracán. Drivers are greeted by a 12.3-inch information display, which takes the place of conventional gauges and also displays infotainment and navigation information. The screen can also be customized to the driver's taste. A covered start button sits at the base of the center console, while a secondary screen for ancillary (digital) gauges sits up top, and a steering-wheel button lets the driver select between Strada, Sport, and Corsa driving modes. The interior has an almost industrial, purpose-built feel to it, with all of the important functions directed toward the driver, and several items on the steering wheel, which has no stalks sprouting from its column.</p>, <p>The trio of modes also determine the shift points and speed of the Huracán's transmission, exhaust volume, stability control settings, throttle mapping, chassis response, and four-wheel-drive system calibration. An optional Dynamic Steering system can further enhance performance-tuned dynamics, while magnetorheological dampers offer a range of ride and handling settings to go along with the three modes.</p>, <p>
Another high-tech element of the Huracán's performance is the Piattaforma Inerziale, which uses three gyroscopes and accelerometers (most cars use only a single gyroscope) to precisely measure the car's pitch, roll, and yaw rates, thereby enhancing the computer's ability to calculate traction and maximize speed while retaining the safety net of computer intervention. Because the Huracan uses three gyroscopes, no data has to be interpolated from other sensors, cutting the response time for the system even further.</p>, <p>
Attractive 20-inch wheels partially obscure meaty carbon-ceramic brakes and complement the Huracán's aggressive exterior design.</p>, <p>The Huracán is raced in the Blancpain one-mark SuperTrofeo series and will soon be added to FIA competition where it will race against other marques with the addition of a GT3-spec version of the car. Roadgoing special editions are inevitable, with some likely to take influences from the racing versions.</p>, <p>In 2016, the Huracan is joined by a Spyder roadster version and a rear-wheel drive version, the latter dropping a few hp to power the back end exclusively. Higher-power models are also probably on the horizon, and if Lamborghini's history is anything to go by, the lineup may include Superleggera (lightweight) models like those offered on the Gallardo before it.</p>, <p>For 2016, the Huracán added cylinder deactivation to improve fuel economy, as well as more expensive and extensive color and trim options.</p>, <p>Fuel economy isn't as bad as the V-10 might lead you to believe: the EPA rates the Huracan at 14 mpg city, 21 highway, 17 combined.</p>]

[<p>The Lamborghini Aventador is a two-seat supercar by the Italian automaker that's available as a coupe or convertible. It carries forward the banner of the exotic automaker with a V-12 engine planted in the middle of avant-garde bodywork.</p>, <p>With the Aventador, Lamborghini has a rival for some of the most expensive machines on the planet made by exclusive automakers such as McLaren, Ferrari, Bentley, and Rolls-Royce.</p>, <p>For those who might be curious, Lamborghini took the Aventador's name, like those of its other models, from a Spanish fighting bull.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lamborghini_aventador_2017">2017 Lamborghini Aventador review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>A 6.5-liter V-12 engine in standard Aventadors produces 700 horsepower and 510 pound-feet of torque. The engine is the fourth built in-house by Lamborghini and only the second all-new V-12 design since the 3.5-liter V-12 that was introduced in the 350GT—the brand's first production model.</p>, <p>Shifting duties are handled by what Lamborghini calls an Independent Shifting Rod automated manual transmission, which differs from the dual-clutch autos used in most cars in this class. The company claims that, based on this transmission and other developments it made for the Aventador, this car is two generations ahead of the competition. Paired with standard all-wheel drive, the whole package provides <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078771_2013-lamborghini-aventador-first-drive">undeniably incredible performance</a>—the Aventador is able to accelerate to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and run up to a top speed of 217 mph. Few supercars can match both of those performance figures, putting the top Lambo in even rarer company.</p>, <p>The body may be the most radical element of the Aventador, with a jet fighter-like design theme and extensive use of carbon fiber. In fact, the entire chassis is made of carbon fiber, making it one of the first carbon monocoque road cars. The suspension and subframes are some of the only structural elements to use any metal at all. The suspension itself is race-inspired, too, with inboard pushrods transferring wheel loads to dampers mounted horizontally inside the body. Despite the weight-saving materials, the big Aventador still weighs in at 3,472 pounds.</p>, <p>Scissor-style doors open onto the cockpit, which is snug, low-slung, and futuristic in its look. As you'd expect from Lamborghini, it's all wrapped and shrouded in exquisite materials, including a healthy dose of carbon fiber. The first Avendators were gobbled up almost immediately; Lamborghini had a 12-month wait after announcing the model.</p>, <p>Lamborghini added the Aventador roadster for 2013.</p>, <p>A notable addition for the 2015 model year was the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1056070_2015-lamborghini-aventador-lp-700-4-pirelli-edition-revealed">Aventador Pirelli Edition</a>, which recognized the supercar's tire supplier. The design package included a choice of four matte exterior colors, a matte black roof, red-outline black wheels, a red accent stripe along the roofline, and various interior finishes, including contrasting red stitching. The Pirelli car was offered in both coupe and roadster body styles and was sold in limited numbers.</p>, <p>Lamborghini also recently introduced a new top model for the Aventador, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1097057_lamborghini-aventador-lp-750-4-superveloce-revealed-in-geneva-video">LP 570-4 SuperVeloce</a>, or SV for short. It combines the most powerful version of the car's V-12—738 hp—with a net weight around 110 pounds less than the standard Aventador's. The SV includes the requisite big honking wing out back and other aerodynamic tweaks, and Lamborghini says it is capable of a 0-60 mph time of 2.8 seconds. The SV badge has been appended to many top Lambos in the past, including the Diablo and Murciélago most recently. (It means "super fast.") Lamborghini will build a total of 600 of these models for worldwide consumption, and in the U.S. they will command a price of about $500,000—a full 25 percent more than the non-SV car. A SuperVeloce Roadster version is available, if you're looking for a 738-hp hairdryer.</p>, <p>Among other special editions, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1073677_lamborghini-aventador-j-2012-geneva-motor-show">completely topless Aventador J one-off prototype</a> was made and shown at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show and will remain the only such model built.</p>, <p>A trio of unique limited-run cars was built using the Aventador's chassis and engine as a basis. Unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082683_lamborghini-veneno-fully-revealed-geneva-motor-show">Lamborghini Veneno</a> took an even more extreme angle on style and performance—and no, we didn't think that was possible either.</p>, <p>Further special editions and additional models will be rolled out over the course of the car's lifetime.

The other functions incorporate into a pair of 10-inch screens at the center of the dash. One controls navigation and audio, the other ancillary climate and comfort functions. The screens substitute fingertip gestures for switches, with swipe, pinch, and touch control over everything from playlists to air flow. Dubbed Touch Pro Duo, it has permanent touch-sensitive icons devoted to functions such as fan speed and defrosting.</p>, <p>For performance, the Velar ponies up a trio of powerplants. A turbo-4 in gas or diesel slots into base models. The diesel makes 180 horsepower, the gas version 247 hp. The latter's capable of 0-60 mph times of 6.4 seconds.</p>, <p>The performance option, for the moment, will be a supercharged V-6 with 380 hp. Land Rover pegs 0-60 mph performance at 5.3 seconds, and top speed at 155 mph. A high-power Jaguar F-Pace was announced in 2018, with a performance Velar surely to follow soon.</p>, <p>A steel-coil suspension and electric power steering can be upgraded to an air suspension. When so equipped, the Velar has 9.88 inches of ground clearance, and a fording depth of more than 25 inches. A drive-mode controller offers specific programming for the stability and traction control systems, spread across the usual gamut–mud, snow, rocks, and ice.</p>, <p>The Range Rover Velar can tow up to 5,512 lb. Wheel sizes range from 18 to 22 inches.</p>, <p>The Velar sits marginally shorter than the Range Rover Sport and its 115.1-inch wheelbase. The Velar's wheelbase is 113.1 inches, the same as that of the Jaguar F-Pace.</p>, <p>Land Rover delivers a useful interior with seats for five passengers, luggage space of 34.4 cubic feet behind the rear seat, and total interior space behind the front seats of up to 70.1 cubic feet. The second row may be cramped for tall passengers—grab the keys early.</p>, <p>Safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warnings, automatic emergency braking, and surround-view cameras.</p>]

[<p>The Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a five- or seven-seat SUV with a body constructed from aluminum. It's aimed at those who might think the bigger Range Rover is a bit too formal—hence its more stylish roofline.</p>, <p>With the Range Rover Sport, Land Rover has a perennial powerhouse that competes head to head with others such as the Mercedes-Benz GLE Class, Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q7, BMW X5 and others.</p>, <p>In 2018, Land Rover added dual 10-inch touchscreens for infotainment and vehicle functions dubbed Touch Pro Duo in addition to mild styling changes inside and out.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114840_2018-land-rover-range-rover-sport">2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Range Rover Sport</strong></p>, <p>The latest Range Rover Sport arrived for the 2014 model year and has seen updates every year since. It shares its architecture with the bigger Range Rover, which was itself new in 2013. Both models now use aluminum extensively in their construction. As such, the Sport also achieves major weight loss with the resulting performance upgrade.</p>, <p>For the first time, the Sport offers a V-6 engine as its base powertrain; the 90-degree V-6 is supercharged, and with help from a smooth ZF 8-speed automatic it can rip a 0-60 mph trip in less than seven seconds. The related supercharged V-8 spits out 510 hp in standard models and makes a glorious noise while running to 60 in under five seconds.</p>, <p>The new Sport's ride/handling blend tilts firmly to sport. Its air dampers and variable-ratio steering quicken up the utility's responses compared to the bigger Range Rover, and the V-8's Dynamic setting dials out much of the innate lean and scrub dictated by its height and weight. It's much closer now to the benchmarks set by the uber-utes from Germany. At the same time, it's an incredibly capable muckraker, with either the base Torsen four-wheel-drive setup, or the more advanced dual-range system, with its active rear locking differential. With more ground clearance than ever, the Sport can extract itself from almost anything the bigger Range Rover can, and its slight size advantage might let it squeeze through where the executive-class model can't.</p>, <p>The 2015 model year brought the craziest Range Rover Sport yet—the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1093777_2015-land-rover-range-rover-sport-svr-revealed-video">Range Rover Sport SVR</a>. It's the first SVR model in the Range Rover lineup, and the first volume-model effort from Jaguar Land Rover's new Special Vehicle Operations group. Power comes from a high-output version of the company's supercharged 5.0-liter V-8, here putting out 550 horsepower and 502 pound-feet of torque. The SVR is good for a 0-to-60-mph run of 4.5 seconds, going on to a top speed of 162 mph. Those are indeed serious numbers for an SUV, and indeed for vehicles half its size.</p>, <p>The arrival of this speed-freak Rover Sport suggests that there will be additional SVR Rovers in the future; the Evoque is a likely candidate, especially since Land Rover has already managed to extract some extra power from its turbo-4.</p>, <p>Aside from the addition of the SVR model, there were few changes for the 2015 Range Rover Sport. <span>Blind-spot monitors gained closing vehicle sensing and reverse traffic detection, and the puddle lamps were upgraded to project a silhouette of the vehicle, instead of an outline of the Range Rover Sport logo, when you approach. Land Rover's InControl suite of smartphone connectivity apps was made available.</span></p>, <p>For 2016, Land Rover offers a Range Rover Sport with a diesel engine in the U.S. for the first time. The model is called Td6 and uses a 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 engine that makes 254 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque. Highway mileage tops out at 29 mpg. A new HST Limited Edition model was in 2016, straddling the gap between the supercharged V-6 and supercharged V-8 models. It gets a 380-hp version of the V-6, unique chassis tuning, and some special design touches, borrowing some visual cues from the recently added SVR model.</p>, <p><strong>Range Rover Sport history</strong></p>, <p>The Range Rover Sport was conceived to appeal to buyers of less traditional 'utes—it shares the Range Rover tag, but its styling is considerably less constrained. The look is based on a concept, the Range Stormer, that came in two-door form to the 2004 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. In the process of becoming a "junior" Range Rover suitable for production, the concept grew a pair of rear door, but kept the performance intent that makes it a competitor for the likes of the BMW X5 and X6, as well as the sporty Porsche Cayenne.</p>, <p>The Range Rover Sport first came to America as a 2006 model, slotted just beneath the tried and true Range Rover in the brand lineup, distinct from the LR3 and LR2 "family" Rovers. Outfitted with either a naturally-aspirated 4.4-liter V-8 engine (which had its roots at BMW, which sold Land Rover to Ford) or a supercharged 4.2-liter V-8 that was shared with the Jaguar XF and XJ for a time. Both versions offered a 6-speed automatic transmission and a sophisticated off-road-worthy suspension with standard all-wheel drive. The "Terrain Response" system allowed drivers to select a four-wheel-drive mode based on conditions like snow, sand, or pavement, and tailored the Sport's traction and stability control to match. Elsewhere, the Sport brought touchscreen controls to the Land Rover tradition, with a big LCD screen incorporating navigation, climate and audio functions.</p>, <p>During the next three model years, the Range Rover Sport would change very little, as Ford sold the brand to Tata and as it was combined into a business unit with Jaguar. In 2010, however, Land Rover had completed work on an updated Range Rover Sport. The centerpiece to the model was a 5.0-liter V-8, offered in both normally aspirated and supercharged form. With the new powerplants, this Sport offered either 375 hp or a stunning 510 hp, enough to hurtle the truck from 0 to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds. The automatic transmission received updates to handle the power, and the suspension's electronic controls were reprogrammed for quicker responses. Fuel economy was poor, at 12/17 mpg for the fastest Sport, but handling was as sharp as many luxury sedans—the equal of BMW's fine-handling X6—and off-road capability was as strong as necessary in such an expensive, attractive vehicle.</p>]

[<p>The Land Rover Discovery Sport is a spin-off of the smaller Evoque. Both are luxury compact crossover SUVs, but the Discovery Sport puts an emphasis on family-friendly utility, with its third-row seats.</p>, <p>The seven-seat Discovery Sport was launched for the 2016 model year as the replacement for the LR2.</p>, <p>Rivals for the Disco Sport include crossovers like the Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC, and BMW X3, although none of those offer the Land Rover's third row of seats. A turbo-4, a 9-speed automatic, and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system power the crossover.</p>, <p>For 2018, Land Rover swapped out an aging 2.0-liter turbo-4 for the company's newer version with the same displacement and size. In most models, the updated engine makes 237 horsepower (down from 240 hp) or in top trims it can make 286 hp.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/land-rover_discovery-sport_2018">2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>From the outside, the Discovery Sport telegraphs two new developments at Land Rover. The first is the nameplate: "Discovery" is not only making a comeback at Land Rover, it's spawning its own sub-brand. It will develop offshoots much as "Range Rover" has with the Range Rover Sport and Evoque models.</p>, <p>The second piece of newness is styling. The Discovery Sport's lines are a more raffish, attenuated take on the blocky, angular LR2 standard. The new model is linked visually with other Land Rovers and Range Rovers, with its twin ribbons of grille, skid plates, and clamshell hood, while the arc of the roofline and the almost austere body-side sculpting are new. Inside, the look is more traditional, with available twin-needle stitching and big knobs for ancillary controls. The sole touch of futurism is the rotating, rising puck that controls the transmission, something that has been appearing from the consoles of many Jaguar and Land Rover products since it was first introduced on Jag's XF sedan.</p>, <p>At launch, the Discovery Sport offered just one powertrain. A 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder making 240 horsepower is paired with a 9-speed automatic with paddle shifters and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system. The same basic setup can be found in the smaller Range Rover Evoque, where it provides adequate power and torque, although it could use some refinement when it comes to power delivery and sound. As a newer design, the Disco Sport should hopefully do a better job of quieting the powertrain.</p>, <p>Land Rover quotes a 0-60 mph time of 7.8 seconds, and a top speed of 124 mph. EPA fuel-economy estimates come in at 20 mpg city, 26 highway, 22 combined which is a bit lower than the smaller Evoque manages (21/30/24 mpg).</p>, <p>Like all of Land Rover's latest offerings, the Discovery Sport offers the familiar Terrain Response system. Its four modes of operation—default, Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud and Ruts, and Sand—alter the vehicle's throttle and stability-control settings to adapt to the surfaces encountered, working in concert with the ABS, hill descent control, stability control, and traction control.</p>, <p>The Discovery Sport is meant to be at least as fluent on pavement as off, with electric power steering that varies its ratio for parking maneuvers and highway driving. Off-road, the new Sport can boast of, and make use of, its Haldex unit, 8.3 inches of ground clearance, a full complement of skid plates, and the ability to climb a 45-degree grade, with a 25-degree approach angle.</p>, <p>The Discovery Sport's suspension is a mix of front struts and multiple links in the rear, though both systems are isolated from the body structure by separate subframes. Land Rover has tried to pare down weight by cladding the steel body with an aluminum hood, front fenders, tailgate, and roof; still, the Discovery Sport checks in at about 4,000 pounds.</p>, <p>Compared with the outgoing LR2, the new Discovery Sport is about three inches longer in wheelbase and overall length, which factors into its new third-row-seat option. The Sport is 180.7 inches long, and rides on a 107.9-inch wheelbase. It's capable of seating up to seven passengers, but Land Rover acknowledges that those rearmost two seats are best suited for occasional use. To make the most of their space, the second-row seats slide on a 6.3-inch track, and the rearmost seat folds away, maximizing the space's flexibility.</p>, <p>Safety systems are thoroughly modern, with the Discovery Sport taking advantage that its parent company has to offer. Lane-departure warning, parking assist for both parallel and perpendicular spaces, auto headlights, and trailer-sway control are offered. Forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking can halt the vehicle at speeds slower than 32 mph.</p>, <p>All Sports come with a touchscreen interface, and with a 10-speaker audio system with terrestrial and satellite radio, Bluetooth audio streaming, and USB and auxiliary ports. The system can pair with two devices—one to talk, one to stream entertainment. The Sport will have up to four power points and as many as six USB ports. Other new technology includes Land Rover's new InControl connectivity kit, which adapts some Apple and Android mobile apps to the Discovery Sport's operating system. Those apps include favorites like iHeartRadio and Parkopedia.</p>, <p>Leather upholstery is standard, along with dual-zone climate control and power features. Major options include navigation, a contrast-color roof, a panoramic roof, oversized alloy wheels, underbody protection, side steps, a towing package, and a black-trim package. </p>, <p>For 2017, the Discovery Sport adds a new Dynamic Design Package that's all about giving it a look more in line with its sport moniker, plus Land Rover's more advanced 10.2-inch infotainment system is now available.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/land-rover_range-rover-evoque
[<p>The Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is easily the most stylish model in Land Rover's stable. Don't mind the long name: it's actually the smallest vehicle in the British automaker's lineup.</p>, <p>Stylish and sized for urban deployment, the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque shares some of its mechanicals with the Land Rover Discovery Sport.</p>, <p>As part of the Range Rover sub-brand, the Evoque gets more luxurious trim and features than the more pedestrian Land Rover offerings. It's a rival for vehicles such as the Volvo XC60, Audi Q3 and Q5, and even the BMW X4.</p>, <p>For 2018, Land Rover added a new turbo-4 in two tunes to the Evoque. All versions get a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that makes 236 horsepower, while HSE Dynamic and Autobiography variants can be equipped with 286-hp version of the same engine.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/land-rover_range-rover-evoque_2018">2018 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Evoque makes all the right moves for those uninterested in the rugged-chic SUV aesthetic. It's also drawing in admirers who want the Land Rover cachet but don’t want a big vehicle or large fuel bills.</p>, <p>The roofline itself could be mistaken for that of a sports coupe, and its backward slope and blacked-out pillars make it especially distinctive from afar, but it’s the squat, muscular stance, really, that make the Evoque what it is. Not since the AMC Eagle has there been a vehicle that looks so carlike, yet so brawny.</p>, <p>All Evoques were initially powered by a 240-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbo-4; a higher-power variant was added for 2015. The engine is a bit coarse in character but moves the crossover swiftly. The transmission was initially a 6-speed automatic transmission that worked well enough, offering quick shifts when requested, and has since been replaced by a 9-speed auto that is equally willing but improves fuel economy. With a version of Land Rover’s Terrain Response all-wheel-drive system, as well as an excellent magnetically controlled suspension on many models, the Evoque feels as much in its element on potholed city streets and curvy mountain roads as it does on a forest trail. Acceleration to 60 mph happens in around seven seconds, with a top speed of 135 mph, and in its initial year the Evoque earned EPA ratings of 19 mpg city, 28 highway.</p>, <p>Interior appointments for the Evoque are on the mark in every respect—warm and inviting, with a soft padded dash, earthy (Prestige models) or colorful (Dynamic models) tones and contrasting trims, and in general it feels more luxury coupe than off-roader.</p>, <p>At just 172 inches long, the Evoque is truly compact, which makes it a great partner in crowded cities. The packaging and electric power steering make parking and maneuvering in tight spots very easy. It still manages to be comfortable for four adults, although getting full-sized folks into the back seat of the two-door model is a little tough. The Evoque keeps everyone inside connected to the outside world, with a USB port, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, and a touchscreen as standard. Navigation is an option, as are high-powered sound systems.</p>, <p>For 2013, <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079561_2013-land-rover-range-rover-evoque-pure-new-entry-level-model">a new Pure model</a> ditched the panoramic glass roof and some of the interior leather (replaced by synthetic suede) to shave $2,000 off the entry price to the range. A new automated parking feature was also made available for 2013, and off-road navigation is now included in the standard navigation package.</p>, <p>For the 2014 model year, a new 9-speed automatic transmission was fitted to the Evoque, offering smoother shifts and closer ratios. The result is a slight, but noticeable improvement to gas mileage, from 2013's 20/28/23 mpg to 21/30/24 mpg.</p>, <p>Land Rover also updated the all-wheel-drive system for 2014. The new Active Driveline system is standard on all Evoque models and includes torque vectoring and active differentials. It also manages to reduce fuel use by decoupling the all-wheel-drive components when speeds rise above 22 mph, thus reducing drag on the driveline. If needed above that speed, the all-wheel drive can be called up within 300 milliseconds whenever necessary.</p>, <p>For <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1090404_2015-range-rover-evoque-gets-autobiography-trim-and-incontrol-app-system">the 2015 Range Rover Evoque</a>, the Autobiography trim was applied to the standard-output model to join the Dynamic trim. Both feature enhanced body styling, 20-inch forged alloy wheels, and premium leather interior details. The Dynamic also benefits from a chassis that’s been optimized for sharper handling, as well as larger brakes and a more responsive transmission.</p>, <p>The Evoque came in for a mild visual refresh for the 2016 model year. A revised front fascia brought larger intakes at the corner, a cleaned-up grille, and full-LED headlights, which make the Evoque look a bit more like the handsome Range Rover Sport. The interior received some updates as well, and Land Rover added its new smartphone-enabled InControl system in the 2016 model year; it allows control of select smartphone apps (iHeartRadio, Stitcher, Glympse, others) through the vehicle's touchscreen and buttons. InControl works with Android and Apple phones once they're connected to a USB port in the Evoque.</p>, <p>Land Rover has since added the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1073388_coming-to-geneva-range-rover-evoque-convertible-concept">Evoque Convertible Concept</a> it showed at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. This two-door, droptop crossover gives the Evoque a third body style and arrived in 2016 as a 2017 model. Other changes were minimal for the 2017 model year; Land Rover made All Terrain Progress Control and InControl Apps standard on all models.</p>]

[<p>The Land Rover Discovery is a storied name in the British automaker's lineup. After going on hiatus in the 2005 model year, the Discovery badge returned for 2017 on a new seven-seat sport-utility vehicle.</p>, <p>With the Discovery, Land Rover has a family-oriented SUV that can compete against the Mercedes-Benz GLE Class, BMW X5, Audi Q7, and even the Land Rover Range Rover Sport.</p>, <p>In style, the new vehicle shares much with the Discovery Sport. It has a slim mesh grille flanked by LED headlights, a long roof that bumps up slightly over the third-row seat for improved headroom, and an interior with a straightforward vertical stack, a wide touchscreen interface, a rotary shift controller, and lots of gloss-black trim.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/land-rover_discovery_2018">2018 Land Rover Discovery review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>For performance, the new Discovery offers a choice between gas and diesel engines. The gas-powered Disco has a 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 with 340 hp; while the 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 has 254 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque; both are shared with other Jaguar Land Rover vehicles. Both are teamed to an 8-speed automatic and standard four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Discovery weighs 1,000 pounds less than the LR4 it replaces; it shares an aluminum body with the Range Rover Sport, as well as an integral-link rear suspension.</p>, <p>As for off-roading, the Discovery has 11.1 inches of ground clearance, a fording depth of 35.4 inches, and Terrain Response and All-Terrain Progress Control, both of which help the vehicle navigate over a variety of surfaces, from slick rock to mud and snow. The new Discovery can tow up to 8,201 pounds.</p>, <p>In the seven-seat cabin, Land Rover offers heated and cooled seats in the first two rows. Up to 82.7 cubic feet of storage space is available behind the front two rows of seats.</p>, <p>On the infotainment front, the new Discovery offers the InControl Touch Pro interface, operated from a 10-inch touchscreen or by voice commands. Audio systems include a 17-speaker surround-sound setup.</p>, <p>The new Discovery went on sale in mid-2017, priced from about $50,000.</p>, <p><strong>Land Rover Discovery history</strong></p>, <p>The Land Rover Discovery was a five-door sport-utility vehicle that became the second mainstream offering in Land Rover's U.S. lineup (discounting the military-grade Defender). It joined the Range Rover in showrooms in the 1994 model year, and has occupied that niche for 20 years—if you count the successor LR3 and LR4 models.</p>, <p>Equipped with an automatic transmission, a 3.9-liter V-8, and four-wheel drive, the rugged-looking Discovery quickly gained a reputation for hardcore off-roading, which Land Rover encouraged through events that put the vehicle through extraordinary terrain and circumstances—events like the Camel Trophy and jungle expeditions in Belize. Outfitted with a locking differential and proper tires, the Discovery proved to be an agile off-roader—and at about $35,000 base, a much less expensive vehicle to bash around in versus its regal Range Rover sibling.</p>, <p>The Discovery had been sold in other markets prior to 1994, but because of U.S. safety regulations, it couldn't be offered until after a mid-cycle revamp that incorporated dual airbags.</p>, <p>The SUV was updated extensively for the 1999 model year, with the goal of reducing its complexity and increasing its reliability, which had been a sore point with the first generation. At the same time, Land Rover was transitioning from ownership by BMW to ownership by the Ford Motor Company. With the new model came a longer body (by 6.5 inches) on an unchanged wheelbase, and a long list of new technology features including traction control and hill-descent control. A new suspension design helped the top-heavy Discovery behave more stably, and a new 4.0-liter version of the old Rover V-8 (which had its origins at Buick, of all places) was rated at 188 horsepower and 251 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>Gradually, the Discovery was adapted for better on-road behavior, losing its locking center differential in 2001, and going through yet another reskin in the 2003 model year. That model year brought a new front-end look and an upgrade to the Range Rover's powertrain—a swap of the Buick-derived V-8 for a BMW-engineered 4.4-liter V-8 producing 300 hp. Land Rover also added free maintenance for the first four years or 50,000 miles of the vehicle's life, to convince fence-sitters. In its last years on the U.S. market, the Discovery had seen improved third-row seats, too, though its back chairs always were a seating position of last resort.</p>, <p>The Land Rover Discovery was replaced by the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/land-rover_lr3">Land Rover LR3</a> in 2005. The LR3 name lasted through the 2009 model year, when it was redesigned and rebadged the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/land-rover_lr4">Land Rover LR4</a>.</p>]

[<p>The Land Rover Range Rover is more than the gold standard of SUVs. Arguably, it's the original luxury SUV, the utility vehicle good enough for British royalty (at least until the Bentley Bentayga came along to make the Range Rover look like a bargain).</p>, <p>With the Range Rover, Land Rover offers a supercharged V-6 or V-8 engines, or a turbodiesel V-6. A longer wheelbase model was added that underscores the luxurious life that many Range Rovers now live.</p>, <p>The Range Rover is capable of chauffeuring heads of state in armored class, or driving for miles where no road exists. Or both. Despite an intense creep in prices and luxury features in the past decade, the Range Rover remains very capable.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Range Rover sees a host of changes inside. Most traditional buttons are gone in favor of a dual 10.0-inch touchscreen arrangement that consolidates without confusing.</p>, <p>Most owners would say the Land Rover Range Rover is without rival, but it has some fierce competition as a luxury good, sometimes mentioned in the same breath with the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and GLS-Class, the Cadillac Escalade, and the Bentayga.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/land-rover_range-rover_2018">2018 Land Rover Range Rover review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Land Rover Range Rover</strong></p>, <p>The Range Rover was most recently revamped for the 2013 model year. It's now built on an aluminum architecture, which sheds 700 pounds from the five-seat SUV. It also enables a 4.5-inch stretch in wheelbase for much better rear-seat room on the standard-length model, with overall length up just over an inch.</p>, <p>Styling is less of a departure, and simplicity and elegance are keywords. The grille was toned down to be more friendly, and the added length gives the Range Rover a suitably regal stance. Few details break out of its smoothly formed aluminum body panels as much as the vertical vents just ahead of the front doors; they can be painted to contrast with the body color, and to coordinate with a sill color, for a uniquely catchy or distracting body line. The interior's just as refined, or more so, with an emphasis on leather and wood and LCD touchscreens, and rotary shift knobs for both the transmission and the off-road mode selectors.</p>, <p>The lighter body helps bring sterling performance. The launch model's 375-horsepower V-8 was as quick as the old supercharged version, at 6.5 seconds to 60 mph; the supercharged SUV's 5.1-second trip to 60 mph competes with Jaguar's XJR. Fuel economy is pegged at a 9-percent improvement. Off-road performance remains unparalleled—there's full-time four-wheel drive, an air suspension, a maximum of 12.2 inches of ground clearance, and available automatic Terrain Response that selects traction modes based on conditions, from mud to snow to rocks to pavement. Towing capability remains at 7,700 pounds maximum.</p>, <p>The big Range Rover comes standard with two LCD screens up front; an 8.0-inch touchscreen handles infotainment on the center stack, while a 12.3-inch widescreen displays digital gauges. The infotainment setup also makes use of soft and hard keys to control phone, navigation, audio, climate, and vehicle settings. All big Rovers get leather upholstery as well, while items like a cooler box, a panoramic sunroof, a surround-view camera system, and a Meridian audio system with 1,700 watts of power are available options. There are at least 37 exterior paints to choose from, as well as 17 hues for the interior palette and three veneer choices.</p>, <p>For 2014, Land Rover <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/land-rover_range-rover_2014">replaced the Range Rover's standard V-8</a> engine with a new supercharged V-6. Combined with the all-aluminum construction pioneered in 2013—fully 700 pounds lighter than its predecessor—the new engine boosts efficiency even further to meet various challenging global fuel-economy and carbon emissions goals. The company also added a long-wheelbase variant, creating a limousine-like off-roader with a rear seat that more than subtly evokes the feeling of the stretched Jaguar XJ. The long-wheelbase Range Rover has even greater presence than the standard-length model and appears simply huge in person.</p>, <p>Changes for 2015 included expanded availability of the long-wheelbase model with HSE trim and the supercharged V-6 engine. Land Rover also made more features standard on the lower models and created a well-rounded Driver Assistance package that includes all of its advanced safety and convenience tech, including automated parallel and perpendicular parking with parking-exit assist.</p>, <p>In addition, Jaguar Land Rover's Special Vehicle Operations unit produced in 2015 a very exclusive model to top the Range range. The Holland &amp; Holland edition played off the luxury gunmaker's brand and offered what was effectively the most luxurious rolling gun cabinet extant. A bespoke interior, special green paint, and gun lockers in the cargo area assured the most comfortable of hunting outings. Only 40 of these were to be built beginning in 2015 over the next three years, each with a price tag of $285,000, making this the most expensive Range Rover model ever built.</p>, <p>For 2017, Land Rover offers a Range Rover with a diesel engine that was new last year. The <span>3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 engine makes 254 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque. Highway mileage is pegged at 29 mpg, with combined ratings of 25 mpg.<br/></span></p>, <p>Last year, the lineup added a new top trim, the SV Autobiography model. It included two-tone paint, a higher level of exterior detailing, and everything Range Rover can throw at an interior. The SV Autobiography also got an engine upgrade, using the 550 hp version of the corporate V-8 that was developed by SVO for the Range Rover Sport SVR. The SVAutobiography replaced the Autobiography Black.</p>, <p><strong>Land Rover Range Rover history</strong></p>, <p>Over the years, the Range Rover has managed to add layers of refinement and on-road performance while holding on to its rugged abilities. It's been in production since 1970, but the Range Rover has only been built in three distinct generations, all defined by some common traits.</p>, <p>Since 1970, the Range Rover has been built on a frame with aluminum body panels. It evolved over its early life from a utilitarian vehicle into a more luxurious sport-ute that went on sale in the U.S. in 1986, by the automaker's American arm, Range Rover North America. The "classic" Range Rover had other American ties; its original V-8 had been developed from an engine sold by Buick for decades.</p>, <p>By the time it arrived in the U.S., the Range Rover used a 3.5-liter version of the V-8. By the mid-1990s it had grown in displacement to 4.3 liters, and the SUV itself had gained a long-wheelbase edition.</p>, <p><strong>BMW and Ford eras</strong></p>, <p>In 1990, BMW acquired what had become the Land Rover brand. A new Range Rover was developed and introduced in the 1995 model year. The Buick-derived V-8 carried over in the second-generation SUV, while other markets also had diesel engine options. A BMW-derived 4.4-liter V-8 was introduced during this generation. Self-leveling air shocks and sophisticated off-road mechanicals were standard on American versions, as were an automatic transmission and anti-lock brakes. Of all the criticism lobbed at this Range Rover—reliability chief among them—the almost plain exterior shape visually conveyed how the times had changed at Land Rover.</p>, <p>In 1999, Land Rover changed hands again. BMW sold the brand to Ford, and delivered a nearly completed third generation of the Range Rover. The new vehicle emerged as a 2003 model, with a more expressive style, even more technology under its sheet metal, and the existing BMW-derived powertrain installed. The Range Rover now was a unibody vehicle, and an air suspension interlinked with electronic controls for braking gave it even more on-road prowess. Passenger space was improved, and build quality was Land Rover's best-ever: the new Range Rover's interior wore especially striking blends of vertical bands of wood trim and leather. Reaching even further upmarket, the Range Rover came to the U.S. fully equipped with standard navigation system, rearview camera, sunroof and leather upholstery.</p>, <p>During this generation, Ford worked with its other British acquisition, Jaguar, to build common V-8 engines for both brands. The new engines emerged in the 2006 model year: a 4.4-liter V-8 produced 305 hp, and a supercharged version of the engine put out 400 hp. The accompanying facelift brought some interior refinements to the Range Rover, including a new LCD screen that controlled the vehicle's navigation, audio, and climate controls.</p>, <p>In the 2010 model year, the Range Rover received its most substantial changes since 2003. Subtle changes to the headlights, grille, and bumper marked the exterior, but inside, the SUV received a finer interior with a much larger LCD screen. The powertrains were upsized for more performance: a new 5.0-liter V-8 shared with Jaguar earned 375 hp in base Range Rovers, while the supercharged version put out 510 hp, enough to accelerate to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds—while still able to tow more than 7700 pounds. The drivetrains carried over through the end of the generation in 2012, along with a newly tuned adaptive suspension and a revamped Terrain Response system with hill-start assist integrated with the Rover's stability control system. Equipment remained royally complete; heated front and rear seats, a power tilt-and-slide sunroof, LED interior lighting, and Bluetooth integration were available, as were a range of wood and leather interior options.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus RX has been the brand's best-selling vehicle since it was new in the 1999 model year. A five- or seven-seat crossover SUV, the RX was recently revamped in the 2016 model year, when it adopted radical new looks and an F Sport model. </p>, <p>The RX was one of the first luxury crossovers to go on sale; many of its chief rivals—the Audi Q5, Volvo XC60, and Lincoln MKC—followed it on the market.</p>, <p>With the RX, Lexus has a popular crossover for mid-size luxury buyers—in fact, it helped create the segment when it was new. Now it's flanked by similar offerings everywhere and the line grew with the addition of hte RX L long-wheelbase model with three rows of seats for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p>Its lineup now includes models powered by both V-6 and hybrid gasoline powertrains, and recently the RX was joined in the Lexus lineup by the compact NX crossover.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our</strong> <strong><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_rx_2018">2018 Lexus RX review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Lexus RX</strong></p>, <p>A fourth-generation 2016 Lexus RX was introduced at the 2015 New York auto show, and it gets a much edgier look inside and out. The styling is much more striking, with a floating-roof effect on the D-pillar and many aggressive cues taken from the smaller NX crossover. The layout in front has been configured for an airier, more open feel, with the shifter moved away from the instrument-panel area, a streamlined series of controls, and a new head-up display. Atop the center stack there’s now an available 12.3-inch infotainment screen with full-size map.</p>, <p>Two models are offered. The RX 350 draws power from a 300 horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, coupled to a new 8-speed automatic transmission for all models. The RX 450h hybrid gets an Atkinson-cycle version of the V-6 teamed with an electric motor-generator system. This version of Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive system makes 308 hp altogether. F Sport versions of both the gas and hybrid RX crossovers are offered, but only with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The RX rides on MacPherson struts in front and a double-wishbone setup in back, and adaptive dampers are available. The setup is tuned toward performance on the road, not at all off-road.</p>, <p>The new RX is about five inches longer than before, with an additional two inches of wheelbase to provide more rear-seat room. It remains a five-passenger model, with two rows of seating, and width and height are essentially unchanged. The driving position has been lowered slightly, while the rear seat is seat is 60/40-split and now power-folding.</p>, <p>Trims and materials in the RX family are especially inviting, and warmer-looking than what you see, for the most part, in German alternatives. But technology, and safety tech, are an important part of this model’s appeal. The available head-up display is now colorful and larger, while Mark Levinson surround sound, a rear HDMI entertainment system, and a whole suite of available active-safety features—called the Lexus Safety System+—can help keep accidents from happening, or lessen their severity.</p>, <p>Connectivity is stepped up, too. Through the Navigation Package you get an expanded app suite with which you can also take advantage of Bing search; Pandora, iHeart Radio, or Pandora streaming audio; or Yelp, among others. We still aren’t in love with Remote Touch controller, but Lexus has improved the RX’s voice controls. The Lexus Enform suite of telematics and apps-based services—some of them subscription-based—has been expanded for 2016, with offerings now including automatic collision notification or stolen vehicle location, as well as new remote functions such as remote start, locking and unlocking, and climate pre-conditioning (all through an app).</p>, <p>Although the F Sport package doesn't quite turn the Lexus RX into a genuine sports car, its sport-tuned suspension offers adjustable dampers that help tailor its ride quality between soft and firm. Additionally, the F Sport looks the part with unique styling inside and out.</p>, <p>The Lexus RX's fuel economy story is terrific—at least for the RX 450h. The thriftiest variant is the front-wheel drive hybrid, which uses its electric motor to use very little gas around town. On the EPA's test, it is rated at 31 mpg city, 30 highway, 30 combined, while the all-wheel drive hybrid comes in at 30/28/30 mpg. The RX 350 isn't quite so miserly at 20/28/23 mpg with front-wheel drive and 19/26/22 mpg with all-wheel drive. </p>, <p>In 2017, the RX gained a host of collision prevention tech as standard equipment and the F Sport performance package became available on the front-wheel drive RX 350. For 2018, it added a long-wheelbase body style to meet a growing demand for three-row crossovers.</p>, <p><strong>Lexus RX history</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation RX was the RX 300, introduced for 1999. It was offered in only one trim, with a limited number of options, and included the same 220-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 that was featured in the ES 300 sedan. Power was delivered with a 4-speed automatic transmission through either front- or all-wheel drive. For 2001, the RX 300 saw slightly different styling plus a new list of options, with electronic stability control made standard.</p>, <p>For 2004, the crossover was redesigned and renamed the RX 330, getting a larger, stronger 230-hp (or 223-hp), 3.3-liter V-6 plus a 5-speed automatic. The RX's overall size and formula remained the same, though its styling inside and out was smoother, with substantially improved interior materials. For 2007 and 2008, the RX was renamed the RX 350, as it gained the higher-output 3.5-liter V-6 that was introduced on a number of Toyota and Lexus products. One of the key attributes of this second-generation RX is that quite early on it offered a number of high-tech features that weren't found on many other luxury vehicles in its segment or price range at the time, including the an adaptive front-lighting system and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The third-generation RX made its debut in 2009. Although the RX was again completely redesigned, it carried over with the same base engine, now making 275 hp, and didn't look all that much different from the outside than the models before it—particularly the 2004-2008 models. The design of the instrument panel was significantly changed this time around, however, becoming more swoopy and curvaceous, with materials again given a big upgrade. Top features on the latest RX include heated and cooled seats, power heated mirrors, a head-up display, and an updated navigation system with XM NavTraffic and NavWeather.</p>, <p>Like most crossovers in its class, the third-generation RX wasn't really designed for serious off-roading or towing. It could handle itself in snow or mud, with a diff-lock mode standard on all-wheel-drive models, and most RX models of this era were able to tow 3,500 pounds, which isn't much by class standards, but more than most cars can handle. It also was not meant to be a minivan substitute, as the RX has been a strictly a two-row affair; the third-row seats available or standard in similar and smaller competitors were not offered here.</p>, <p>Safety and reliability have traditionally been strong reasons to choose the RX, as much as luxury and comfort. In this generation, the RX achieved top ratings from both crash-test agencies. Also, the RX has been a very reliable vehicle its entire run, and resale value is strong no matter what the year.</p>, <p>The Lexus RX 350 and RX 450h were given an updated front-end appearance in 2013, with a new grille to bring the front-end design more in line with the GS sport sedans' look. Other than a few other smaller changes, the RX continued unchanged, although the RX 450h was given a Sport mode and <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075203_2013-lexus-rx-crossover-priced-from-40185">its own F-Sport model</a> to offer better responsiveness.</p>, <p>In the 2014 RX lineup, Lexus added Siri Eyes Free functionality for the infotainment system, allowing you to integrate some iPhone models with the RX's voice-command system. For 2015, Lexus followed that with refreshed audio systems across the model line.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus LS is a large four-door luxury sedan and the flagship of the Lexus product line. It is the product that launched the brand in 1990, and sent a shockwave through the industry that this upstart Japanese brand could build a true luxury car. In nearly 30 years on sale, it's set the pace for quality and durability regardless of pricetag.</p>, <p>With the LS, Lexus relies on quiet luxury and a coddling interior to vault itself into consideration as a rival for the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7-Series.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Lexus LS is new—an overdue update to what was no longer really feeling like a flagship. That's all history, the latest LS can keep pace with the megabuck luxury class with organic shapes and high-tech amenities that can run with the Germans for now.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_ls_2018">2018 Lexus LS review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Lexus LS</strong></p>, <p>Lexus revealed the fifth-generation LS at the 2017 Detroit auto show. It's based on a lengthened version of the GA-L platform that it shares with the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1107650_2018-lexus-lc-500-first-drive-review" title="2018 Lexus LC 500 first drive review">stunning new LC sports coupe</a>. Lexus says the platform lowers the car's center of gravity and centralizes the mass. Additional high-strength steel, as well as aluminum, have been used to remove about 200 pounds from the platform. Braces in the engine compartment and stiff front and rear suspension towers add strength to the structure.</p>, <p>Two engines were available at launch including a new twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 415 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission (also shared with the LC) that Lexus claims can shift as quickly as a dual-clutch transmission. Lexus quotes a 0-60 mph run of 4.5 seconds. A 3.5-liter V-6 and electric motor combo that made 354 hp is mated to a multi-stage hybrid transmission and nets up to 28 mpg combined.</p>, <p>New multi-link suspensions are found front and rear. Optional suspension components include active sway bars, air suspension, and rear-axle steering.</p>, <p>The styling is a bolder than LSs of the past. Longer, lower, and wider than the outgoing model, the car has a more imposing stance, and the added length allows the greenhouse to extend to the rear in a teardrop shape with six windows instead of four. Only one length is offered and it's an inch longer than the long wheelbase version of the last generation on a wheelbase that is 1.3 inches longer. Exterior details include a chrome-outlined version of the Lexus spindle grille, headlights with wing-shaped LED signatures, and taillights with Lexus L signatures.</p>, <p>Inside, the LS features organic shapes influenced by Japanese wood working patterns. The materials are a sea of wood, metal, and leather, and they are accented by ambient lighting. The dashboard has a 12.3-inch screen for the Lexus Remote Touch control interface, which now supports handwritten inputs. Active noise cancellation is also standard.</p>, <p>Among the new tech features are a color head-up display that Lexus says is the largest on the market, a pedestrian detection system with active steering that can detect a pedestrian in the lane ahead and steer around them while staying in the lane, and an access mode for the available air suspension that lowers the car and opens up the seat bolsters.</p>, <p>The LS also comes with the Lexus Safety System+, which features forward collision warnings with emergency braking, lane departure alerts, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>Interior options include a 3-D Mark Levinson sound system with in-ceiling speakers; 28-way power adjustable front seats with heating, cooling, and massage functions; rear seats with heating, cooling, and a massage function, plus a right side rear seat ottoman with a reclining seat.</p>, <p><strong>Lexus LS history</strong></p>, <p>In its first generation, which spanned from 1990 to 1994, the Lexus LS 400 changed the way American shoppers perceive Japanese brands. Introduced at the 1989 Detroit auto show (alongside the Infiniti Q45), the first Lexus LS 400 was a warning shot fired across the bow of BMW, Benz, and Cadillac. It offered all the luxury-class bona fides of the competition—with fanatical attention to fit and finish, new dealerships with top-drawer customer service, and what some considered a lowball price meant to lure buyers away from other brands.</p>, <p>It worked: The LS drew several best-of awards, gained a reputation for extreme durability, and essentially launched the brand, though a smaller ES 250 sedan gave dealers something else to sell besides the $36,000 LS. While it wasn't lauded much for handling, the LS's sewing-machine-smooth V-8 engine helped give the car the quietest cabin of any luxury sedan, aided by a smooth 4-speed automatic. The combination provided a 0-to-60-mph time of about 8.5 seconds.</p>, <p>In its second generation, which ran from the 1995 to the 2000 model year, Lexus upped power in the V-8 to 260 hp. It didn't look very different from the first LS 400, but the new car reportedly shared only about 10 percent of its components with the original car. More powerful than before, the LS 400 also was lighter and quicker than before, with an estimated 0-60 mph time of 7.5 seconds and a top speed again limited to 155 mph. New features included an in-dash CD changer; the base price had risen to more than $50,000. In 2000, the LS received side airbags and stability control, before a new vehicle arrived in 2001.</p>, <p>For the third generation, which appeared in the 2001 model year and was offered through the 2006 model year, Lexus uprated the V-8 engine. The new V-8 displaced 4.3 liters and put out 290 hp and 320 pound-feet of torque. A new control-arm suspension all around with a sport package was offered. The new car had an estimated 0-60 mph time of 6.7 seconds, an improvement over the prior version. An air suspension was offered, as was a touchscreen LCD panel that operated the navigation system. A Mark Levinson sound system came as an option, as did ventilated front seats, massaging rear seats, and adaptive cruise control. Curtain airbags and parking sensors were standard. The price of this Lexus LS began in the mid-$50,000 range, but top versions cost as much as $70,000, neatly overlapping the prestige brands from Europe. In 2004, an updated version received a 6-speed automatic to go with the carryover V-8 engine and also added knee airbags and a choice of interior trim, including maple wood, along with new options such as Bluetooth connectivity and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>The fourth-generation LS arrived in the 2007 model year; base LS 460 sedans and LS 460 L long-wheelbase versions came with a new 4.6-liter V-8 with 380 horsepower, teamed to a new 8-speed automatic. Still rear-wheel drive, the LS grew longer and adopted the "L-finesse" styling theme that would appear on subsequent Lexus vehicles, carrying a graceful, feminine look. Long-wheelbase editions added nearly 5 inches to the overall length of the sedan, and a new multi-link suspension replaced the former design.</p>, <p>Performance increased again, with 0-60 mph times estimated at 5.7 seconds for either the short- or long-wheelbase sedan. New interior features included keyless ignition; hard-drive navigation; a heated steering wheel; and real-time traffic. An "executive" package for the rear seat added DVD screens in the headrests, fold-down tray tables, and massaging seats. Over its lifespan, the LS has added features such as an automatic parking-assist feature and a lane-departure warning system, both of which were advanced for their time.</p>, <p>Lexus added a hybrid to the LS lineup for 2008. Called the LS 600h L (and offered only in a long-wheelbase version) it paired a 5.0-liter V-8 with batteries and electric motors for total system output of 439 hp. Unlike most Lexus and Toyota hybrids, the gas-electric LS didn't get amazingly improved fuel economy as compared to its gas-only counterpart—it used a larger engine after all—and it was also very expensive, at a base price above $100,000. The idea instead was to provide greater performance without a fuel-economy penalty, with the quiet motoring of brief EV sprints as an added touch of luxury.</p>, <p>Lexus updated the LS family's styling slightly in 2010 with new bumpers and wheels. As always, the model bristled with gas or hybrid powertrain technology, exuded world-class fit and finish, and kept driving dynamics well-muted as it hit mid-life.</p>, <p>For 2013, a new <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078030_2013-lexus-ls-preview">performance-oriented LS 460 F Sport model</a> joined the lineup, and the rest of the LS models fit in with the family look, getting Lexus's latest "spindle" grille. The F Sport brought improved handling, Brembo brakes, and paddle shifters for the Sport Direct Shift transmission it shared with the former Lexus IS-F.</p>, <p>For 2017, Lexus dropped the slow-selling hybrid but kept most of the LS lineup and options packages the same.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lexus_nx
[<p>Though the Lexus NX compact luxury crossover utility vehicle uses some underpinnings from the mass-market Toyota RAV4, the NX looks nothing like its corporate sibling. The NX slots below the brand's best-selling RX mid-size crossover, but it's not necessarily intended for the families that buy the RX. Instead, it's more for couples and perhaps those with one young child who haven't quite made it to the suburbs yet.</p>, <p>When it debuted in 2015, the NX was the marque's first turbocharged model as well as its first utility vehicle in this smaller segment. The NX competes in an ever-growing crowded field of compact luxury crossovers that includes the BMW X3, Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, Acura RDX, Audi Q5 and the Mercedes-Benz GLC.</p>, <p>For 2018, the NX gets mildly updated front and rear styling and revisions to its lights, a number of equipment changes, and a new name for its base model. The previous NX 200t is now simply the NX 300, with the NX 300h hybrid continuing as before. In addition, the NX's previous 1-year free trial period on Enform Safety Connect and Service Connect services has been extended to 10 years.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_nx_2018" title="2018 Lexus NX - full review">2018 Lexus NX review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Lexus has gone for a very distinct look with its small crossover. As a result, the NX in no way resembles the RAV4 on which it's based, with a pronounced version of the Lexus-family spindle grille on a long-overhanging and sharp front end. The headlights are mounted high and are very short, while slits in the lower fascia house running lights. The rest of the sheet metal is equally sharply defined, giving the NX an almost angry look, especially when viewed from the front. Flared wheel wells and a fast roofline lead to an ordinary-by-comparison rear view that maintains more of the staid Lexus look we're used to. It has helped usher in a more dramatic look for Lexus models that has also transferred to the new RX.</p>, <p>The NX carries its sporty theme to the interior. It's a much sleeker look than in Lexus SUVs past, with a cozier, more cockpit-like feel. There's a rich mix of materials—perhaps a few too many—with soft surfaces, leather, and metal-look trim mingling with big round gauges; the instruments look to have been pulled from one of Lexus's sporty sedans, simply positioned higher on the dash.</p>, <p>The NX models are sized right in the middle of what the U.S. would consider the compact luxury crossover segment (it might be considered mid-size in Europe), at around 183 inches long, with a wheelbase of more than 106 inches. The sport seats have a rather low hip point compared to those of other crossovers, Lexus notes, which should give it a connected feeling during spirited driving while also helping to increase head room. The decent rear seating space and long, low cargo area reveals its practical RAV4 roots.</p>, <p>The Lexus NX is offered in two models: the standard NX 300, with a 235-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo-4 paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 194-hp NX 300h hybrid that the company expects to make up less than 10 percent of total sales in the U.S. Lexus said its F Sport package will be chosen by half of NX customers and it includes a more aggressive grille, unique interior trim, comfortable sport seats, and a tuned suspension. Both powertrains are offered in front- and all-wheel-drive versions, though the all-wheel-drive setup differs by model: The 300 gets a mechanical system that sends engine torque to all four wheels, while the hybrid, similar to Lexus's gas-electric RX, drives the front wheels with the hybrid powertrain and uses a separate, 50-kw (67-hp) electric motor on the rear axle for on-demand all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The NX debuted a new generation of the Lexus Remote Touch interface, this one featuring a touchpad, haptic feedback, and scratchpad-like capabilities that lets users trace letters—it's similar to the controllers seen on some Audi and Mercedes-Benz models. Active-safety features include all-speed adaptive  cruise control and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. A head-up display is also offered.</p>, <p>Lexus retired the front-drive hybrid version of the NX in 2017 and added two new paint colors for the NX F Sport version.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus IS four-door sedan sits at the entry point in the Lexus roster, but it has a huge mission: to tackle everything from the Audi A4, BMW 3-Series, and Cadillac ATS to the Mercedes C-Class.</p>, <p>Over time, the IS family has counted a sportback wagon, a two-door coupe, and a hardtop convertible, it has since been pared back to a sedan—with the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lexus_rc">Lexus RC filling the two-door roll</a>. In the past with the IS, Lexus has offered a higher-power IS F version to rival super sedans from German automakers, although no such version exists for this generation.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_is_2018">2018 Lexus IS review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Lexus IS</strong></p>, <p>When it was new in 2014, the Lexus IS sedan carried over the base powertrains from the 2013 model. Everything else was new, including updated features and equipment, better packaging in a stiffer yet lighter-weight structure, a double-wishbone front suspension, and a new 8-speed automatic transmissions.</p>, <p>In the first two model years, Lexus offered two V-6 engines for the IS, a 2.5-liter in the IS 250 and a 3.5-liter in the IS 350. Both used automatic transmissions and were available with optional all-wheel drive, with rear-drive standard.</p>, <p>For 2016, the powertrain lineup was reconfigured. The new entry-level IS 200t was powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-4 with 241 horsepower. It came only with rear-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters and three drive modes: Eco, Normal, and Sport—though cars with the F Sport package gain an extra Sport S+ mode.</p>, <p>For 2017, the exterior style was slightly refined with a bigger opening for the spindle grille and sharper headlights. Lexus also made a suite of advanced safety features standard, including forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, lane departure alerts with active lane control, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>A new all-wheel-drive IS 300 is now powered by a 260-hp version of Lexus's 3.5-liter V-6 mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The top IS 350 carried over with a 3.5-liter V-6 that now makes 311 hp; it's still available with rear-wheel drive and an 8-speed transmission, or all-wheel drive and a 6-speed transmission.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year, the IS 200t was renamed the IS 300. Other changes were minimal, save for a 5-hp bump on V-6 cars.</p>, <p>There's also an F Sport package available for any IS, which adds a sportier suspension tune, summer tires, some aesthetic differences, and a neat LFA-inspired gauge cluster.</p>, <p>All IS models share improved interiors and the bold new styling of the current generation. Like the larger GS, the IS's cabin is driver-focused, with sweeping lines and nice materials.</p>, <p>There's no official confirmation yet of a successor to the V-8-powered IS F sedan that was offered in the last generation. That said, Lexus launched an F variant of its RC coupe lineup, which is a two-door version of the IS.</p>, <p><strong>Lexus IS history</strong></p>, <p>The IS was first introduced for 2001, then a rebadged, lightly reconfigured version of the Toyota Altezza, a performance model sold in Japan. With a 3.0-liter inline-6, rear-wheel drive, and a choice of manual or automatic transmissions, the IS 300 was taken seriously by U.S. enthusiasts almost right away and seen as a rival to the BMW 3-Series.</p>, <p>Though the IS didn't quite have the handling and near-perfect balance of the BMW 3-Series, it offered strong performance, with its rating of 215 hp allowing 0-60 sprints in less than 7.5 seconds, and it had a number of appearance cues—like the chronograph-style gauge cluster—that were sportier than anything else in the Lexus lineup.</p>, <p>The first-generation IS 300 was also offered in a sport-wagon variant. Called the IS 300 SportCross, this wagon sold poorly when new but has since become sought-after on the used-car market.</p>, <p>While the original IS models drove well from an enthusiast standpoint, were reliable, and durable. They had quite basic interior appointments—as well as quite noisy interiors—that were more in line with vehicles in the Toyota line than those with the Lexus badge.</p>, <p>The IS was completely redesigned for 2006, adopting underpinnings that were based in part on the larger GS sport sedan. Eventually, the lineup was expanded to include IS 250 and IS 350 models, with the IS 250 available with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The 204-hp, 2.5-liter engine in the IS 250 produced just enough power to be enjoyable with the standard 6-speed manual, but was too taxed with all-wheel drive or the automatic transmission. The better pick of the two was the confident IS 350, which had a completely different character thanks to its 306 hp and more accessible low-rpm torque.</p>, <p>The two models both handled quite well, but the Lexus IS never quite gained the "underground" tuner following that the earlier 2001-2005 models enjoyed. The newer models were far more civil and enjoyable for day-to-day driving and passenger comfort. Backseat space was always been very tight in the IS, though.</p>, <p>Lexus tried to stoke enthusiast interest in the IS with both the introduction of a 417-hp, V-8-powered IS-F performance model, as well as a line of dealer-installed F Sport accessories that brought a much more aggressive appearance as well as suspension, braking, and exhaust upgrades.</p>, <p>In 2010, Lexus added the first IS-based convertible, the IS C. It was sold with either the 2.5-liter or 3.5-liter engine and only with rear-wheel drive. Unlike most of its competitors, the droptop IS used a retractable hardtop, providing better top-up stiffness, a quiet ride, and more of a refuge in bad weather. Because of its metal roof, the IS C competed most directly with BMW's 3-Series Convertible, but at a slightly lower price.</p>, <p>Through 2013, the IS sedan lineup carried over mostly unchanged, although for 2013 Lexus updated audio systems with HD Radio and iTunes tagging, and bundled Lexus Enform with AppSuite with the navigation system. The IS F was offered through 2014.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lexus_lc
[<p>The Lexus LC is an exclusive high-performance four-seat luxury coupe that’s slightly larger than the automaker's RC coupe but far more flamboyantly styled. It is something of a successor to the company's the SC coupe (and folding metal hardtop convertible) models, which were discontinued after the 2010 model year.</p>, <p>The rear-wheel-drive LC was a project championed by Toyota Motor Corporation president and CEO Akio Toyoda, who has made it one of his goals to push Lexus in a more decidedly performance-oriented direction.</p>, <p>The coupe is offered in LC 500 form, with a 467-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8, a new 10-speed automatic transmission, and a serious set of sport-oriented underpinnings, as well as LC 500h—a high performance hybrid. Under the hood of the LC 500h will be a 454-hp hybrid powertrain. </p>, <p>With the LC 500, Lexus has an entry that goes up against models like the BMW 6-Series, the Jaguar XF, the Cadillac ATS-V Coupe, and the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class, among others. There really isn't a player in the luxury performance hybrid coupe segment, aside from perhaps the exotic Acura NSX, but Lexus has proven immensely itself capable of going where nobody has before. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_lc_2018">2018 Lexus LC review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Lexus cites a 0-60 mph time of just 4.5 seconds for the LC 500.</p>, <p>The 10-speed automatic transmission is the first such transmission in any luxury model, Lexus says. The 10-speed automatic is smaller than some existing 8-speeds and has shift times that rivals those of a dual-clutch (automated manual) gearbox.</p>, <p>Design-wise, the LC makes an interesting counterpoint to the LFA’s sharp lines, contrasted by the 3-D mesh-design grille and low hood. Inside, the LC 500 is said to be both cockpit-focused and elegant, with lots of attention paid to the driving position and strong front-seat bolstering (with a very low hip point). Notably, the LC's body is said to be the stiffest ever put into production. </p>, <p>The LC is mid-size by American standards. It’s about 187 inches long, but has a 113-inch wheelbase and very short overhangs. It’s built on rear-wheel-drive luxury platform that Lexus says is the stiffest unibody vehicle the brand has ever built, with extensive use of high-strength steels that outdo the LFA’s carbon-fiber platform in torsional stiffness.</p>, <p>The Lexus LC 500 rides on a multi-link suspension, made mostly of aluminum, with huge staggered-width 21-inch Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Six-piston front disc brake calipers (four-piston in back) should provide great stopping power for scrubbing off triple-digit speeds. Engineers have spent far more than the usual vehicle development time to make sure steering is precise and communicative.</p>, <p>As it is, the LC exhibits plenty of weight-saving measures (although Lexus hasn’t revealed curb weight). It has a carbon-fiber roof, aluminum door skins, and a composite trunk floor. It carries no spare tire, and the battery is mounted in the trunk to help with weight distribution—adding up to a 52/48 front-to-rear weight distribution. Underneath, the LC will share its platform with the automaker's fifth-generation LS sedan. </p>, <p>Mark Levinson audio is offered in the LC for serious audiophiles, and it can be loaded with tech, including active lane control, and forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p><strong>LC genesis</strong></p>, <p>Lexus has played in the big coupe segment a number of times before. Its first SC 300 and SC 400 were luxurious, but restrained, two-doors largely designed by the automaker's Calty studio in Southern California. A choice of 3.0-liter inline-6 and 4.0-liter V-8 engines were on offer, with the former available with a 5-speed manual.</p>, <p>The two debuted shortly after the original, groundbreaking Lexus LS 400 sedan, and they were updated in 1996 before being dropped from the automaker's lineup before the 2001 model year. </p>, <p>A few months later, in early 2001, the second-generation SC arrived with a 4.3-liter V-8 and a major shift in its outlook on life. Designed from the outset to be a convertible with a folding metal hardtop, the SC 430 was more luxurious, but also softer and not nearly as sporty. </p>, <p>The second-generation SC 430 was updated for the 2006 model year and then discontinued in 2010.</p>, <p>At that point, Lexus was left without a flagship coupe—excluding, of course, its LFA supercar. One of the most advanced vehicles ever created, the LFA stands in marked contrast to the boulevardier SC 430. Just 500 examples of the V-10-powered, carbon fiber LFA were built, selling for nearly $400,000.</p>, <p>While the LFA helped steer Lexus in a sportier direction, it was the Lexus RC that reawakened performance for the masses (at least those with upwards of $40,000 to spend). The RC slots in between the company's compact IS and its mid-size GS sedans and is available to Americans with a choice of 2.0-liter turbo inline-4, 3.5-liter V-6, or 5.0-liter V-8 engines (the latter of which is slotted into the RC F). </p>, <p>But while the RC arrived on the scene first, the LC was previewed by the LF-LC (for Lexus Future Luxury Coupe) show car at 2012's Detroit auto show that shares much of its appearance with the production LC. </p>]

[<p>The Lexus GX is a mid-size sport-utility vehicle that can seat up to seven passengers in three rows of seats. The GX shares some of its running gear and underpinnings with the Toyota 4Runner, but gets more luxurious trim and some specific off-road hardware and technology that gives it even more extreme ability.</p>, <p>Truth be told, it's actually a dressed-up version of a global market Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (which, confusingly, is different than the Toyota Land Cruiser sold here in the United States). That means the GX has more than a little off-road ability, trumping nearly everything in its segment. </p>, <p>Rivals for the GX include vehicles such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Land Rover LR4 and Volkswagen Touareg.</p>, <p>For 2017, the GX added a new appearance package as an option, and it carried over into the 2018 model year unchanged.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_gx_2018">2018 Lexus GX review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Lexus GX</strong></p>, <p>The current generation of the GX was launched for the 2010 model year, with and upright and buff design like before. Though it shared underpinnings with the 4Runner, its design was wholly separate. At that time, the engine changed to the current 301-hp, 4.6-liter V-8 (hence the slight name change and numerical demotion), and the transmission became a 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Soon after the launch of the second-generation GX, <em>Consumer Reports </em>hit the truck with a rare "Do Not Buy" warning. In testing, the publication found that the vehicle's stability-control system didn't perform as expected during emergency maneuvers, producing heavy oversteer in certain situations. Toyota later discovered a flaw in the stability-control programming and issued a fix for the GX, which led the magazine to lift its embargo.</p>, <p>The Lexus GX 460 was lightly refreshed for 2012, with additional chrome accents and body cladding, plus a new wheel finish in high gloss. Other changes through the 2016 model year have been minimal—save for the refreshed front end, which in 2014 adopted the Lexus family's spindle grille.</p>, <p>The GX is one of the Lexus brand's two truly off-road-capable SUVs, and its rugged hardware is paired with luxury trappings to create something that's capable off-highway but keeps occupants comfortable wherever it goes.</p>, <p>Performance is only adequate, however, since the Lexus GX is one tall, heavy vehicle with the compromised aerodynamics to go with its shape. A variety of electronic systems supervise its off-pavement behavior, helping it do surprisingly well. Systems include standard adjustable roll bars; adaptive suspension and height adjustment for the rear shocks; various modes to control rock crawling and hill descents; and electronic simulation of a locking differential, using the anti-lock brakes.</p>, <p>The GX is a safety-conscious vehicle with a solid list of safety and accident-avoidance equipment, though its older body structure hasn't kept up with crash tests. Eight airbags come standard, located in the front, at the sides of the front seats, and in curtains along the sides, plus knee airbags for the driver and front passenger. Other standard items include a lane-departure warning system, active head restraints, and a rearview camera. Additional cameras for the front and sides are available as part of a package and prove helpful in off-road and mall-lot maneuvers alike.</p>, <p>Inside, the GX offers lots of standard and optional features, including available heated and cooled seats, three-zone climate control, a heated steering wheel, and power folding for the rearmost row of seats. In part because of its height, the GX uses a swing-out rear tailgate with an integrated flip-up glass portion. It is not power operated but does hold itself in place nicely when opened to any angle.</p>, <p><strong>Lexus GX history</strong></p>, <p>The first generation of Lexus's GX was launched for the 2003 model year, offering the legendary off-road capability and toughness of the Toyota 4Runner, as well as a host of luxury features that included leather upholstery, wood trim, and of course the comforting Lexus showroom experience. That 2003 Lexus GX 470 shared the same 4.7-liter V-8 engine that was fitted to the full-size LX sport utility at the time, driving all four wheels through a 5-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The early GX also featured adaptive suspension with adjustable roll bars, to let the driver choose between on-road comfort and off-road agility. Although it was marketed as a three-row, eight-passenger vehicle, the third-row seat was notably small and far from practical over long distances for two adults—let alone three. Options in the early GX line included a Mark Levinson sound system and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus ES is a mid-size, five-passenger sedan that slots between the GS and IS in the Japanese luxury brand's lineup.</p>, <p>Before the 2013 model year, the ES was based on the Toyota Camry. After a redesign in 2013, it emerged as a larger car, now related to the bigger Toyota Avalon. Like the Avalon, the ES is also available with a hybrid powertrain.</p>, <p>With the ES, Lexus has a rival for sedans like the Lincoln MKZ and Buick LaCrosse, and even the Chrysler 300.</p>, <p>For 2018, the ES lineup gets only minor trim changes and the extension of a 1-year trial period on Enform Safety Connect and Service Connect services to 10 years. The previous year, automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control was added as standard on all models, as well as a new app-based turn-by-turn navigation system and a desirable "back" button for its infotainment controller.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_es_2018" title="2018 Lexus ES - full review">2018 Lexus ES review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Lexus ES<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The latest Lexus ES made its debut <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075204_2013-lexus-es-350-and-es-300h-walkaround-video">at the 2012 New York Auto Show</a>. The standard model was once again called ES 350 but for the first time it was joined by a hybrid model, the ES 300h. Both were introduced as 2013 models and share running gear with the Toyota Camry, but this time the ES has a couple of extra inches of wheelbase, providing more backseat space. In this generation, the ES actually has more in common with the Toyota Avalon, which is based on a stretched version of the Toyota Camry's platform.</p>, <p>The ES adopts a very sleek design theme this time around, certainly its smoothest profile yet. The interior carries a horizontal design that's similar to what's found in the latest GS sedan. It takes a step down in the base model, however, with synthetic material replacing the formerly standard leather upholstery. The ES also features the latest safety and tech features that Lexus has to offer, including smartphone connectivity and a lane-departure warning system.</p>, <p>The ES 350 sports a 268-horsepower V-6 and a 6-speed automatic, while the 300h uses Toyota's 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle hybrid and a hybrid system to achieve an EPA city rating of 40 mpg city, 39 highway, 40 combined; both are offered only with front-wheel drive. Thanks to a quicker steering ratio and tuned suspension, the ES models feel slightly sportier from behind the wheel without sacrificing passenger comfort—it's still just as plush and quiet as ever. In a <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1076583_2013-lexus-300h-first-drive">first drive of the ES 300h</a>, we found it to be surprisingly as responsive as the 350, while far more fuel-efficient. This newfound sportiness doesn't quite match other new Lexus models for all-out driving enjoyment, and there's no available F Sport model of the ES nor is one expected, but it is certainly an improvement over previous generations.</p>, <p>The ES lineup changed very little into 2014. For 2015, it received upgraded infotainment systems, including a new around-view camera system, as well as an audio-buffer feature, enhanced apps integration, and a new touchpad controller for the infotainment system, replacing the odd mouse-like piece used previously.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the ES gets a more aggressive nose highlighted by LED headlights and a larger version of Lexus' signature spindle grille. In addition to the styling updates, the ES is offered with a new active safety package. The Lexus Safety System+ package adds a automatic emergency braking, active lane control, intelligent high beam headlights, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p><strong>Lexus ES history</strong></p>, <p>First introduced for 1992, the Lexus ES 300 helped establish the Lexus name and won customers to the brand for its comfort, style, and reliability. Although the first couple of generations of the ES dabbled on the sporty side in some variations, with the third-generation ES that was introduced for 2002 Lexus focused the model even more toward mainstream luxury sedans. It was again called the ES 300 for its first two years, packing a 210-hp, 3.0-liter V-6. This model had an even roomier interior than before and included all the extras you would expect to come standard on a luxury car today; a navigation system and excellent Mark Levinson sound-system upgrade were among the options.</p>, <p>For 2004, the ES was given a very slight refresh and new standard equipment, then was renamed the ES 330, gaining a 3.3-liter V-6 making up to 225 hp.</p>, <p>Another redesign in 2007 brought with it another engine-size increase and name change. The powertrain changed to a 272-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, with a 6-speed automatic transmission, creating the ES 350. This ES had an even plusher ride than before, with excellent soft-touch and wood trim. A number of new tech features—including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, park assist, and adaptive xenon HID headlights—were offered for the first time in this model.</p>, <p>While competent and luxurious, the ES was not for everyone. For instance, the styling was rather bland and not fit for those who wanted to be noticed. The car is also somewhat of an isolation chamber, for better or worse, keeping the occupants from the noise outside but also keeping all types of feedback from the driver. There was little arguing with its safety record, however.</p>, <p>There were certainly plenty more upsides. Resale value for the ES, no matter what the model year, has been top-notch; so has reliability.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus LX is the rugged, gargantuan anchor at the top of the Lexus SUV lineup. A cousin of the Toyota Land Cruiser, it layers glitzy trim and luxury features over a hardcore off-road machine with immense capability.</p>, <p>With the LX, Lexus has a full-size luxury SUV with a pedigree that few can match. It may be more capable than most need, but it's there for those that want it.</p>, <p>The Lexus LX has always been offered with a single V-8 powertrain over the years, with the full model name—LX 460, LX 470, or LX 570—changing to coincide with the engine displacement at each step. It competes with other big, luxurious, V-8-powered SUVs, such as the Land Rover Range Rover, Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX80, and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class.</p>, <p>Changes for the 2018 included making the cramped third row optional for the first time.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read <a>our</a> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_lx_2018">2018 Lexus LX review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Lexus LX</strong></p>, <p>The current generation of the LX was introduced for the 2008 model year as the LX 570. It features a 5.7-liter V-8 that makes 383 horsepower and 403 pound-feet of torque, with a 8-speed automatic transmission and a new electronically controlled four-wheel-drive system. The LX again shares its frame and construction with the Land Cruiser, but it introduced even more modern airs, including crawl control for low-speed boulder crawling and a new version of the height-adjustable suspension.</p>, <p>Because the LX 570 is designed for true off-road capability, it makes some compromises for passenger comfort and packaging, things other Lexus models rarely do. The cabin is tall but somewhat narrow and can feel tight with more than four adults onboard. Its third-row seats don't help much, as they're fold-down jump seats that live in the cargo area. While the big V-8 is torquey and the truck is relatively quick as a result, the LX still feels big and heavy—because it is. Cornering and simply navigating a parking lot can get iffy if you're not careful.</p>, <p>Lexus gave the LX 570 a year off for 2012, and brought it back for 2013 with a modified front end that features the brand's new spindle grille design. That new look helped differentiate it a little further from its Land Cruiser sibling. The big SUV also gained some additional standard features then, including heated and cooled seats, a rear-seat entertainment system, trim made of African Bubinga wood, and a 19-speaker Mark Levinson audio system with the Lexus Enform connectivity suite built in. There have been very few changes to the LX 570 since that update.</p>, <p>For 2016, the LX 570 added two more forward cogs—it's now fitted with an 8-speed transmission.</p>, <p><strong>Lexus LX history</strong></p>, <p>In the 1990s, Americans couldn't get enough of the rugged mystique of SUVs. At the same time, the Lexus brand was on the rise and broadening its lineup of vehicles so it seemed natural for the luxury brand to get a somewhat more luxury-laden and refined version of the Toyota Land Cruiser—one with a little more driveway cachet for well-off suburbanites.</p>, <p>That's exactly what was delivered when the LX made its debut for the 1996 model year. As one of the first rivals to the Range Rover, the LX charted new territory for Lexus and brought the brand its first truck entry. With a 212-hp, 4.5-liter inline-6, four-wheel drive, and solid front and rear axles with separate locking front and rear differentials, the Lexus LX 450 was a serious truck underneath and nearly identical in layout to the Land Cruiser. Extras on the LX 450, other than the badge, were limited to mostly cosmetic items like body cladding, wheels, and running boards (which made the LX less practical off-road, enthusiasts were quick to point out), while the LX received luxury-car must-haves like automatic climate control, premium leather seats, and a little more noise insulation. A third row of seats was included, but these were side-folding jump seats, essentially, just like in the Land Cruiser.</p>, <p>While the first-generation LX (LX 450) models are surely less refined, their powertrains have a rock-solid reputation for durability. But for 1998, a next-generation LX was introduced, called the LX 470 and coinciding with a redesign of the Land Cruiser. This time the LX gained a V-8 under the hood—a 230-hp, 4.7-liter V-8—along with some new electronically controlled aids like an Adaptive Variable Suspension with adjustable height, which greatly improved ride quality (as did the independent front suspension) while maintaining some off-road ability. This generation of LX got some running changes along its long run—first with a power boost to 235 hp and a 5-speed automatic, in 2003; then with a new version of the engine, making 275 hp, for 2006. Also in 2006, Lexus broadened standard equipment. Throughout this generation, the LX offered many of the same features found in the LS flagship, including Nakamichi premium sound, a navigation system, and projector headlights.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus RC coupe is a two-door, four-seat coupe that was new for the 2015 model year.</p>, <p>The RC follows in the footsteps of the old, pricier SC coupes that helped launch the Lexus brand in the 1990s, although it was easily the sportiest two-door for the brand since the wild and exotic LFA supercar.</p>, <p>With the RC, Lexus has a direct rival for cars like the Audi A5, BMW 4-Series, Infiniti Q60, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe, as well as Cadillac's two-door ATS.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_rc_2018">2018 Lexus RC review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>A spin-off of the Lexus IS sedan range, the RC is offered with a wide range of powertrains, everything from a turbo-4 to a V-8. In its first year, its models included a V-6-powered rear-drive RC 350, an RC 350 with all-wheel drive, and a high-performance RC F, powered by a brawny V-8 engine. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lexus_rc-f">RC F is covered separately</a>.</p>, <p>RC 350 models are motivated by a 311-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 and are offered with rear-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic transmission or all-wheel drive and a 6-speed automatic. There is no manual transmission available.</p>, <p>For 2016, Lexus added the base RC 200t; it was powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 with 241 hp, sent to the rear wheels by an 8-speed automatic transmission. A new mid-range RC 300 was also added. It comes only with a 30/70-split, rear-biased all-wheel-drive system and a 6-speed transmission mated to 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 255 hp.</p>, <p>In the 2018 model year, Lexus renamed the RC 200t and made it the RC 300. It’s the sole 4-cylinder coupe; the 300 AWD, 350, and 350 AWD models each have a V-6 engine, and each offers a tuned F Sport model.</p>, <p>At about 185 inches long, the RC is just slightly longer than the IS sedan and, like that car, shares a platform with the somewhat larger GS sport sedan, though the midsection is derived from the outgoing IS C convertible and the rear end from the new-for-2014 IS sedan. A wheelbase that's several inches shorter gives the proportions a different look than either sedan; it has a more swept-back appearance, with some fairly ostentatious accents—not just for Lexus, but for any brand playing in the segment.</p>, <p>The spindle grille in front is the most abrasive part of the appearance, as it is on most other modern Lexuses. Behind there it's all grace, however, with nice, flowing sheet metal from the fenders, a smooth roofline, and a surprisingly well-sculpted rear deck that escapes the brand's usual anonymity. Sporty 18- and 19-inch alloys fill out the fenders nicely and set a good stance. Inside, the multi-tier cockpit look given to the latest IS and GS looks fresh here, too, with excellent materials, including real wood and leather.</p>, <p>The base RC coupe has only adequate acceleration and a supple ride, but they're considerably dialed down from the stiffness baked into a garden-variety BMW 4-Series. A sporty F Sport package is available for every model, and it adds suspension, wheels, brakes, and exterior components that amp up the excitement.</p>, <p>The RC coupes can fit full-size adults in their rear seats a pinch, but you'll want to avoid long-distance cruising with four on-board. Like in the latest IS sedan, the interior boasts quality materials that avoid the dark and dreary look of predecessors, with Lexus recently adding leather outside the black and beige spectrum. The front seats are also very supportive.</p>, <p>On the tech front, the RC was the first Lexus to get the brand's latest blind-spot monitors, which can better detect fast-moving vehicles approaching from behind. The Lexus Remote Touch interface uses a touchpad in place of the finicky mouse-like controller that was used previously. Remote Touch is the console-mounted control for things such as audio, navigation, and system settings.</p>, <p>Like most Lexus models, the RC is well-equipped when it comes to safety. The RC has been named an IIHS Top Safety Pick+, as it scores top "Good" ratings in all categories and also carries a sold complement of active safety features.</p>, <p>For 2017, the RC lineup gained available triple-beam LED headlights and standard Scout GPS Link, while the rear-drive RC 350 added standard performance dampers.</p>]

[<p>The <a>Lexus RC F is the performance version of the Japanese luxury brand's two-door sports coupe, a bold entry into a crowd of quick coupes from German, American, and Korean automakers.</a></p>, <p>Like the rest of the RC range, the RC F is a relative of the IS sedan lineup. The RC F was new for the 2015 model year. The RC picked up where the old SC coupe left off—kind of. The RC is available with all-wheel drive, but the RC F offers performance that the SC never really achieved. Like the SC, the RC F comes equipped with a V-8, albeit with very different intentions.</p>, <p>That makes it a rival for vehicles such as the BMW M4, Cadillac ATS-V, and Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG. That's some formidable, well-established competition, but the RC F brings a lot of punch to the table. </p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_rc-f_2018">2018 Lexus RC F review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>While the base cars come equipped with a choice of turbo-4 and V-6 engines, with rear- or all-wheel drive, the RC F has more horsepower than the vaunted M4. It's powered by a 467-hp V-8 inherited from the last-generation IS F sedan. There's no manual gearbox offered, but the RC F has paddle shift controls to harness its 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p>What that drivetrain brings to the two-door is essentially a "beast mode." Stomp on the throttle and the RC F is good for a 0-60 mph time of 4.4 seconds, a top speed of 170 mph, and a manic, raw V-8 snarl that's absent from all its rivals. It reaches and comes close to the standard set by the ATS-V, AMG, and M4 in terms of high performance and high-speed handling stability—but it's also a hefty car, with nearly 4,000 pounds squishing its wheels to the ground.</p>, <p>The RC's styling carries over mostly intact to the RC F. Its showy spindle grille works better here than on almost any other Lexus, because brash is part of the mission. From the nose rearward, the RC F is graceful, with a handsome flow to the sheet metal, from fenders to tail. Sporty 19-inch alloys fill out the fenders nicely and set a good stance. Inside, the multi-tier cockpit look given to the latest IS and GS looks fresh here, too, with excellent materials, including real wood and leather.</p>, <p>At about 185 inches long, the RC is just slightly longer than the IS sedan and, like that car, it shares a platform with the somewhat larger GS sport sedan, though the midsection is derived from the last IS C and the rear end from the IS sedan. A wheelbase that's several inches shorter gives the proportions a different look than either sedan; it has a more swept-back appearance, with some fairly ostentatious accents—not just for Lexus, but for any brand playing in the segment.</p>, <p>Inside, the RC F is comfortable and supportive, with rear seats that can fit full-size adults in a pinch. Like in the latest IS sedan, the interior boasts quality materials that avoid the dark and dreary look of its predecessors, with Lexus recently adding leather outside the black and beige spectrum.</p>, <p>Like most Lexus models, the RC is well-equipped when it comes to safety. The RC has been named an IIHS Top Safety Pick+, as it scores top "Good" ratings in all categories and also carries a sold complement of active safety features. It hasn't yet been tested by the NHTSA. Automatic emergency braking is affordably priced at $500—and it is a stand-alone option on the RC F. </p>, <p>On the tech front, the RC is the first Lexus to offer the brand's latest blind-spot monitors, which can better detect fast-moving vehicles approaching from behind. The Lexus Remote Touch interface has also been updated, now using a touchpad in place of the finicky mouse-like controller that was used previously. Remote Touch is the console-mounted control for things like audio, navigation, and system settings.</p>, <p>Fuel economy is set at 16 mpg city, 25 highway, 19 combined, according to the EPA.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus GS F is the high-performance version of the brand's mid-size four-door sedan.</p>, <p>Introduced for the 2016 model year, it is complemented by the RC F coupe as the only two models in Lexus' F performance line—though just about every Lexus offers a zippier F Sport model as well. F Sports offer some of the looks and suspension bits of the F models, without the extra power or track-ready handling.</p>, <p>Lexus has offered two other F models in the past. There was the IS F compact sedan starting in 2008, and the 2012 LFA carbon-fiber supercar, which was limited to just 500 examples.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_gs-f_2018">2018 Lexus GS F review</a><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>Styling is far more aggressive than base versions of the GS sedan, mostly in the name of cooling and aerodynamics. The front end is unique from the A-pillars forward. The front fenders are wider and feature air outlets that vent air from the engine compartment. The spindle grille is even more aggressive than that of the GS F Sport, and it is flanked by a pair of air intakes that send air to a transmission cooler and an oil cooler. Prominent rocker panels visually lower the car along the sides, and the rear end features a carbon fiber reinforced plastic lip spoiler and quad exhaust outlets that jut through a lower diffuser. Under-body covers also smooth out airflow underneath the car to improve overall stability.</p>, <p>The GS F starts with the fairly sporty platform from the base GS model and adds four underbody braces to improve body rigidity. It also uses more sophisticated suspension and chassis hardware. The GS F gets the GS’s double-wishbone front suspension and multi-link rear suspension. Two front arms and two rear links are aluminum to reduce unsprung weight, the front and rear geometry is tweaked, and spring and bushing rates are stiffer. Brembo brakes are used at all four corners, with big 15-inch front rotors and 13.5-inch rear rotors. At the rear, the GS F also comes standard with the electrically controlled, clutch-actuated torque-vectoring differential that is optional on the RC F.</p>, <p>It shares its 467-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 with the RC F, though the GS F is bigger than that car and offers a far more usable rear seat. The engine features both port and direct fuel injection and can run on different cycles to maximize efficiency. Those traits allow it to deliver decent fuel economy of 16 mpg city, 24 highway, 19 combined.</p>, <p>Inside, the GS F has room for five in a cockpit-style environment. Over and above the standard GS, the F gets high-back front sport bucket seats; aluminum pedals; perforated leather on the seats and steering wheel; available carbon fiber trim; and Alcantara on the meter hood, instrument panel, door trim, center console, and Remote Touch palm rest.</p>, <p>Lexus’ Remote Touch system is standard. It uses a center console-mounted joystick to enter controls on the massive 12.3-inch dashboard screen. Haptic feedback makes “buttons” on the screen provide resistance through the joystick.</p>, <p>The GS F comes standard with 10 airbags, including driver and front-passenger knee airbags, and rear-side airbags. The Lexus Safety+ system is also standard. It includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, and automatic high-beam headlights. The GS and GS F have not been tested by the NHTSA, but the GS has received some good crash scores from the IIHS, though that testing is not complete.</p>, <p>Changes for 2017 included making adaptive dampers standard, the choice of painted or hand-polished forged alloy wheels, and an optional head-up display.</p>, <p>For 2018, the lane departure warning system becomes active lane control and the Enform Safety Connect and Service Connect is included for 10 years.</p>]

[<p>The Lexus CT 200h is a compact 5-door hatchback hybrid in a class almost by itself.</p>, <p>With the CT 200h, Lexus has adapted some of Toyota's gas-electric drivetrain technology from the evergreen Toyota Prius, but infused it with a personality that's not as dowdy as the all-business Toyota. The Lexus is meant to attract younger and greener new buyers into the brand's showrooms—from both Generation X and Generation Y—and does so in part by injecting some fun into Toyota's standard hybrid equation.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lexus_ct_2017" title="2017 Lexus CT - review">2017 Lexus CT 200h review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The CT 200h was the only such vehicle sold in the States—at least until the Audi A3 e-tron arrived in 2016. Rivals are few, what with the CT's hybrid powertrain and hatch shape, but shoppers would do well to compare other alternative-drivetrain vehicles such as the Audi A3 e-tron or the Ford C-Max Hybrid or Energi plug-in hybrid.</p>, <p>Changes for 2017 are confined to three new paint colors. The CT 200h was removed from the Lexus lineup after 2017.</p>, <p>The CT arrived while the slow-selling and unloved HS 250h sedan, the first dedicated hybrid from Lexus, was still on the market. Now that the HS is no longer sold, the CT is the brand's sole hybrid-only offering. Most other Lexus models do offer a hybrid option, however.</p>, <p>The unexpected aspect of the CT hatchback is that it is also one of the more entertaining Lexus models to drive. The Lexus CT is powered by the same 98-horsepower, 1.8-liter inline-4 and twin motor-generators that are used in the Toyota Prius; altogether, the powertrain can provide a peak of 134 hp. While that figure isn't terribly thrilling, the fact that the CT is smaller than the Prius helps it move with some added verve, while a sportier control calibration works in the Lexus's favor as well.</p>, <p>The nickel-metal-hydride battery pack that delivers electricity to the motor is located behind the rear seat and under the load deck, somewhat reducing cargo capacity. With the CT's already-squat roofline, that makes the load bay remarkably shallow—there's less than a foot of height below the rollout security cover. Another example of utility given up for the sake of style.</p>, <p>Among small hybrids, the CT 200h is fairly sporty. Three selectable driving modes are available: Eco is almost painfully slow; Normal reacts like a normal hybrid; and Sport makes the experience much more interesting at the expense of some fuel economy. Sport affects the powertrain along with the steering weight and throttle mapping, while also providing more help from the electric motor under acceleration. When Sport is selected, the blue power gauge transforms into a red tachometer as Lexus's way of making the mode a little more special, bringing what the driver sees as most important at the time to the front.</p>, <p>The CT's lines are unique. It sits squarely on the street, with slab sides and thick roof pillars, giving it an interesting, slightly sporty stance. In the end, its lines say it's a standard, somewhat squat five-door hatchback—meaning it not only goes unnoticed on the street, but is hardly recognizable as a Lexus. Inside, the cabin is wide and surprisingly roomy, though all passengers sit low—especially on the short seat cushion in the rear—and the view out the slit of a rear window is minimal.</p>, <p>The CT 200h has a healthy list of standard equipment, although it doesn't quite have the feeling of effortless luxury that the larger Lexus vehicles carry. All CTs come with keyless ignition, iPod/USB integration, hands-free calling and audio streaming over Bluetooth, and satellite radio functionality. Options include LED headlights and rain-sensing windshield wipers, and dealers offer a host of F Sport appearance- and performance-enhancing parts.</p>, <p>The CT 200h has changed very little since its launch. The base price of a Lexus CT is around $30,000, but a heavy hand on the lengthy options list—especially in the electronics and safety area—can put stickers as high as $40,000. For 2015, the CT adds Siri Eyes Free capability and an updated Lexus  infotainment system with an improved control interface.</p>, <p>The CT 200h excels at fuel economy and has the figures to back it up. The Lexus CT 200h manages 43 mpg city, 40 highway, 42 combined, according to the EPA.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lincoln_navigator
[<p>The Lincoln Navigator helped create the full-size luxury sport-utility category. Lincoln's biggest, most expensive vehicle to date, the Navigator was introduced in the 1998 model year, before the Cadillac Escalade. Since then, the Escalade has sold far more examples than the Lincoln.</p>, <p>But the Navigator is new for 2018 and it brings a lot to this very exclusive party. </p>, <p>The long-running Navigator sits at the top of Lincoln's SUV lineup, above the MKT and Nautilus crossover SUVs, and the MKC compact crossover.</p>, <p>Today, the Navigator's main competitor is still the Cadillac Escalade, while the GMC Yukon Denali, Chevrolet Suburban, Infiniti QX80, Lexus LX, Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class—and perhaps even the Mercedes G-Class—can be considered rivals as well.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lincoln_navigator_2018">2018 Lincoln Navigator review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Lincoln Navigator</strong></p>, <p>For 2018, the Navigator is all-new. It remains closely related to the Ford Expedition, but the Navigator moves considerably upscale with a far more sophisticated interior and no shortage of available luxury features.</p>, <p>The Navigator sheds a good bit of weight thanks to new aluminum body panels, but it also adds more power. Its 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 grows to 450 horsepower and it now uses a high-tech 10-speed automatic gearbox to direct power to the rear or, when equipped, all four wheels. A fully independent suspension remains underneath, as does a truck-type ladder frame. That frame helps deliver what Lincoln says will be an excellent towing capacity. </p>, <p>But buyers will really notice the upgrade inside. We've only seen high-spec Navigators so far, but they're lavishly outfitted with tasteful teak wood trim, acres of leather, and numerous LCD screens. Though its basic proportions are shared with the Expedition, the Navigator truly stands on its own for the first time ever.</p>, <p><strong>Lincoln Navigator history</strong></p>, <p>In its first generation, which included the 1998-2002 model years, the Navigator gained instant status among celebrities, athletes, and music stars for its urbane touches and its tough ability. SUVs were popular, gas was cheap, and the chrome-crusted Navigator hit an upscale demographic right on target. Its 230-hp V-8 teamed with a 4-speed automatic for uninspiring acceleration, and handling rated along the same lines—with even its off-road ability ignored in favor of wood trim, high-powered audio systems, and rear-seat LCD screens with DVD players. Power rose to 300 hp through the years, and the Navigator added side airbags, reverse parking sensors, and an optional navigation system to its equipment list.</p>, <p>For the second-generation Navigator—sold in the 2003-2006 model years—Ford spent ample time on the SUV's styling and safety. The new Navigator received a larger grille, a better integrated look with smoother sheet metal, and a new interior with twin binnacles, soft white instrument lighting and satin-nickel and matte wood trim. Curtain airbags were added, and the third-row seat and tailgate both added power controls. The biggest improvement came in ride quality and packaging: a new independent rear suspension opened more cargo space in back, and softened the Navigator's trucky ride. In its final years, this Navigator also upgraded to a six-speed automatic and to stability control with anti-roll technology.</p>, <p>Introduced as a 2007 model, the third generation also comes in a long-wheelbase Navigator L edition with even more cargo room—better to take on the Cadillac Escalade ESV and Chevrolet Suburban. The uniquely American-inflected styling remains, and it's a less brash, more evocative set of details than you'll find in the outright glitzy Escalade—especially inside. At the beginning of the third generation, power still came from the 310-hp V-8 and was channeled through a 6-speed automatic—and so outfitted the Navigator got a tow rating of 9,100 pounds. Handling was SUV-sized but fine, and the ride quality was good, though we wished there were less road noise and more speed payoff for the big, torquey V-8.</p>, <p>For 2012, the sideview mirrors got new integrated spotter mirrors, and Lincoln added AppLink, a system that lets the Navigator control mobile apps like Pandora with built-in Bluetooth and voice commands.</p>, <p>A much needed heavy update came for the 2015 model year. Fuel economy rose, thanks to a new EcoBoost (turbocharged and direct-injected) V-6 engine subbed in for the V-8 across the model line, and the front-end styling joined the latest Lincoln design themes—although the rest of the body remained largely the same as the 2007.</p>, <p>Until this point, the big Lincoln SUV had been powered by one engine, a 5.4-liter V-8, paired with an automatic transmission and a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The package has also included seating for seven, a leather-lined interior, and Lincoln styling to differentiate it from its near-twin, the Ford Expedition.</p>, <p>The new EcoBoost V-6 cranked out 380 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque—more than the V-8 on both counts—and the Navigator added standard magnetic ride control with continuous damping. Inside, the instrument panel was refreshed, and the Navigator at last included the latest version of MyFord Touch, plus blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert, and a revised feature set. Gas mileage numbers were up to 16 mpg city, 22 highway, 18 combined with rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Navigator continued to be offered in both Navigator and Navigator L versions; the L adds 12 inches to the wheelbase and is nearly 14 inches longer. It doesn't make the third row all that much more spacious, but it's at least easier to get to, and there is more space for cargo behind the rearmost seats.</p>, <p>The Navigator was unchanged for the 2016 and 2017 model years.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lincoln_aviator
[<p>The Aviator was a somewhat more luxurious, Lincoln-badged version of the Ford Explorer, sold from the 2003-2005 model years. The Lincoln MKX officially succeeded the Aviator (and was originally intended to carry on the name); however today's MKT lands closer to the purpose and size of the original Aviator.</p>, <p>The Aviator was powered by a 302-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8, with a five-speed automatic transmission and a choice between rear- or all-wheel drive systems. Rear-drive Aviators could tow up to 7,300 pounds.</p>, <p>While the Aviator was quick, it didn't handle well, and the Aviator's ride was soft and well-suited for flat, Midwestern-style highways and not at all hilly, curvy roads. With a hefty curb weight of about 5,000 pounds in all-wheel-drive form, even a four-wheel independent suspension couldn't save this vehicle from pitching, bounding, and wallowing.</p>, <p>While these models have proven reliable over the long run, the Aviator's embarrassingly low fuel efficiency can make it a poor choice for an everyday-driver used vehicle. The Aviator arrived with EPA fuel economy ratings of 13 mpg city, 18 highway (or 11/16 mpg for AWD models) back then—under a more lenient test method—and we can say from our drives from that era that you're likely to see combined numbers in the low teens with either version. Keep in mind that the all-wheel drive system here is one that maintains a permanent torque split (65 percent rear, 35 percent front) under normal conditions, so it adds thirst to the Aviator at nearly all times.</p>, <p>For the second row, you could choose between two captain's chairs with a center console or a bench for three, so the Aviator could fit either six or seven in all. The third row was usable by kids, although there really wasn't significant cargo space back there when you had the third row up. In either case, the third row flips forward, while the second row—no matter which configuration—has a fold-and-tumble feature for third-row access. Fold it all and there is a very significant 77 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>, <p>Standard features were abundant on the Aviator and included dual-zone climate control, a separate climate system for the second and third rows, cruise control, power front seats, power windows, locks, and mirrors, and a 60-watt 'premium' sound system. Interiors were plush, with satin-nickel trim, white LED ambient lighting, real walnut wood trim, and pebble-grain leather.</p>, <p>By the time the Aviator was discontinued, in 2005, it was clear that Americans' obsession with truck-based SUVs was over, and most shoppers were either stepping up to the Expedition-based Navigator if they wanted space and trailer-towing, or settling on a car-based crossover utes like the Acura MDX, Chrysler Pacifica, or Lexus LX if passenger comfort was the priority.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lincoln_mkc
[<p>The Lincoln MKC is the Ford luxury brand's entry in the burgeoning compact crossover class.</p>, <p>With the MKC, Lincoln has filled out its lineup of SUVs. It's the smallest of a family of utility vehicles that includes the MKX, the MKT, and the Navigator.</p>, <p>The five-seat MKC is a competitor for the Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC, and Acura RDX, among many others.</p>, <p>For 2019, the MKC received new exterior looks, although not much else was changed from the prior year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1117097_2019-lincoln-mkc">2019 Lincoln MKC review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>On the outside, the MKC's pretty exterior theme wears a version of the split-wing grille that Lincoln is beginning to move away from, and the rear may be the most interesting angle, with its full-width taillights. Lincoln's new MKX follows the MKC's lead with a very similar design that has basically just been upsized to fit its larger body.</p>, <p>The MKC shares the Escape's electric power steering and its basic suspension, but the Lincoln crossover can be equipped with a set of adaptive dampers that drivers can set in comfort, sport, or normal modes for a more finely tuned ride. The MKC comes with 18-inch wheels, while 19- and 20-inchers are optional.</p>, <p>The MKC's base powertrain is the same 240-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbo-4 that's optional in the Escape; it can be had with either front- or all-wheel drive. The upgrade engine is a 2.3-liter turbo-4 with 275 hp and 300 pound-feet of torque; it is offered only with all-wheel drive. This is the same engine offered in the Ford Mustang as well as some future Ford and Lincoln products.</p>, <p>Inside, there's nearly the same interior space as in the snug-fitting Ford crossover. The sensation of space is greater in the Lincoln, however, thanks to its different console design. It passes on a conventional shift lever, opting instead for buttons located on the left side of the center stack to activate the transmission. Leather and wood trim are available.</p>, <p>Split-folding and reclining back seats are standard in the MKC, though rear seat space is tight. An available version of the power tailgate can be opened with the wave of a foot under the rear bumper, as long as the foot waver has the key fob on their person.</p>, <p>The MKC doesn't perform very well in crash tests. In NHTSA testing, the MKC earns four stars out of five overall, while most competitors get five. The MKC has not been fully tested by the IIHS, but it scores "Good" ratings in the side and moderate front overlap tests. Unfortunately, the Escape upon which it is based scored "Poor" in the tough small front overlap test. The MKC's optional front crash prevention system earns a "Basic" nod from the IIHS.</p>, <p>At least the MKC's safety features are up to snuff. It comes standard with a driver's knee airbag and a rearview camera. Blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts are standard on higher line models and buyers can get a Technology package with adaptive cruise control, active lane control, parking assistance, and a forward collision warning system.</p>, <p>Other tech features on the MKC include Bluetooth connectivity; proximity illumination—the mirrors cast light on the ground when the car's keyfob is detected nearby; and an embedded data service that links with a smartphone app to provide services like remote unlocking, fuel-level checks, climate conditioning When it launched the MKC also came with the much maligned MyLincoln Touch infotainment system. Starting for the 2016 model year, Lincoln switched over to Sync 3, which appears much easier to use. It includes a capacitive touchscreen, voice controls, access to apps on owners' smartphones, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.</p>, <p>Along with the MKZ sedan and MKX, the MKC is offered as part of Lincoln's Black Label program. It is the top model in the lineup, which also includes Premiere, Select, and Reserve models. Black Label buyers get a "curated" palette of colors and trim options, using finer trimmings and offered in a handful of design themes, as well as a host of special extras, including in-home ordering and an annual detail of their vehicle.</p>, <p>In addition to the switch over to Sync 3, the 2016 MKC received some new color options inside and out and a Climate package with a windshield wiper de-icer. A power liftgate was added to the Select model, and the towing capacity improved from 2,000 to 3,000 pounds for the 2.3-liter engine equipped with the Trailer Tow package. Oddly, the 2.0 had already been rated to tow up to 3,000 pounds.</p>, <p>For 2017, the power liftgate becomes standard, as does an auto hold feature that keeps the vehicle in place at a stop without the driver's foot on the brake. The 2.0-liter engine also gets automatic stop/start standard with front-wheel drive and optional with AWD. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lincoln_mkx
[<p>The Lincoln MKX is a five-seat crossover SUV that occupied the middle slot in the luxury brand's utility-vehicle lineup. It sits between the compact MKC crossover and the three-row MKT and Navigator SUVs.</p>, <p>The automaker shelved the MKX name for 2019 and rebranded the crossover as the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lincoln_nautilus">Lincoln Nautilus</a>.</p>, <p>The MKX was new for the 2016 model year and largely carried over into 2018. It's based on the latest Ford Edge running gear, but with its own styling, drivetrain choices, and and a new mission to pull Lincoln buyers higher up the price spectrum.</p>, <p>With prices starting just below $40,000 but approaching $70,000 in fully outfitted versions, the MKX is likely to be cross-shopped against crossovers like the Lexus RX 350, Acura RDX and MDX, Cadillac SRX, Buick Enclave, and Volvo XC60.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lincoln_mkx_2018">2018 Lincoln MKX review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>For 2016, the MKX was completely restyled with handsome lines borrowed from the smaller MKC crossover. The latest MKX has a design meant to appeal to upper-class suburbanites who need all-weather usability in a roomy, comfortable car. The feeling is much more dynamic overall, with the somewhat stodgy air of the last model now completely washed away. Interior quality is improved as well, and the cabin design is much more interesting, although there are a lot of different surface treatments competing for the eye's attention. The new model offers 22-way power seats and available Black Label trim, which is Lincoln's top trim designation.</p>, <p>Features include lots of touches unavailable on the similar Ford Edge. There's a surround-view camera system, a set of premium interior themes with coordinating leather and wood trims, and a panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>Revel is now Lincoln's top-of-the-line audio partner beginning with the new MKX. The partnership also means an end to the deal Lincoln had with THX sound in the past.</p>, <p>The MKX was carried over with only minor changes for the 2017 and 2018 model years. The name was discontinued for 2019.</p>, <p><strong>Lincoln MKX history</strong><em><br/></em></p>, <p>The MKX was originally going to be called Aviator, a name that was available after the Ford Explorer-based Lincoln that used it was discontinued. Instead, the crossover got its current three-character badge, as at the time Lincoln was transitioning to a letter-based naming scheme, having recently renamed the Zephyr the MKZ.</p>, <p>Aside from the different grille and trim, the MKX's similarities to the Edge are easy to see from the outside, but the Lincoln looks significantly different on the inside, with satin-nickel and wood trim as well as upgraded upholstery. The MKX is also significantly quieter, with more sound-deadening material and an acoustic windshield.</p>, <p>The MKZ has an amazing feature set, even when compared against the segment benchmark, the Lexus RX 350. In a single trim, the MKX comes with standard perforated leather heated-and-cooled seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, and rear park assist, among many other features. Options (some of them in packages) include heated rear seats, DVD entertainment, adaptive headlamps, and a power liftgate. An EasyFold remote seat-folding feature is also on offer, and the MKX is also available with the long Vista Roof, as offered in the closely related Ford Edge. All MKX models have two rows of seating and decent space for five adults, though cargo space isn't quite as ample as in some other crossover models.</p>, <p>Power is provided by the same V-6 engine as in the Edge, with a 6-speed automatic transmission and a choice of either front- or all-wheel drive. The driving experience isn't very sporty,  but the MKX handles quite well for such a heavy vehicle. Ride quality is excellent as well—firm enough to yield good driver control but not so soft as to be bouncy and wallowy like many Lincolns of the past. The MKX doesn't offer the turbocharged 4-cylinder that's new to the Edge, though, and fuel economy is a bit above average, at 19/26 mpg in front-drive form, 17/23 mpg with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Ford's Sync system, which permits voice-activated interfacing with cellphones, media players, the navigation system, radio, and other devices, became available in 2008. It was standard on the second-generation MKX, which arrived for the 2011 model year with refined styling inside and out, and slightly better performance from a retuned suspension. This MKZ also made use of Ford's then-new 305-hp, 3.7-liter V-6, a version of which is also used in the Mustang among other vehicles.</p>, <p>Also standard: A newly designed instrument panel featuring the all-new MyLincoln Touch touchscreen, which integrates voice controls, navigation and sound system functions, and personal phones and audio devices, as well as in-car wireless internet, using Ford's Sync interface. MyFord Touch proved to be unduly complex for those wanting a traditional luxury vehicle, although the system was a bit more straightforward in this iteration.</p>, <p>Both the vehicle and the interface got a cosmetic refresh for 2013, while the 2014 MKX was essentially carried over unchanged. The 2015 model year brought no real changes.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lincoln_continental
[<p>The Lincoln Continental name was used for some of the most iconic large luxury sedans ever built by Ford's luxury brand, but it hasn't been seen on a new car in 15 years. It long ago lost its top-of-the-line position at Lincoln, having been used for smaller, less distinguished cars starting in the mid-1980s.</p>, <p>That all changed for the 2017 model year, when Lincoln launched an all-new Continental flagship to replace its outgoing MKS sedan.</p>, <p>The company says the new Continental is an "elegant, effortlessly powerful, serene full-size sedan that delivers quiet luxury." Unlike sedans of the same size from Infiniti and Lexus, even Mercedes-Benz, the big Lincoln doesn't have particularly expressive design. It's distinctive, but it won't stop traffic.</p>, <p>With prices ranging from more than $45,000 to more than $80,000, the new Continental competes with cars such as the Volvo S90, Cadillac CT6, and Genesis G90.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lincoln_continental_2018">2018 Lincoln Continental review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Lincoln Continental</strong></p>, <p>It's the interior that Lincoln plans to use to distinguish the Continental from other luxury competitors. The cockpit wears lots of glossy wood trim, lots of shiny metal, and big and glossy digital displays. It's unapologetic old-school style.</p>, <p>The new Continental is based on enlarged underpinnings from the mid-size Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans. That means a V-6 powering the front wheels, or all four wheels, although the most powerful engine—a 400-horsepower twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6—isn't available on the Ford. The base engine is a 3.7-liter naturally aspirated V-6, while mid-level models sport a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6.</p>, <p>All models shift with a 6-speed automatic, and all-wheel drive is available on most versions.</p>, <p>The Continental rides on an independent suspension, which features adaptive dampers on some models, as well as a driving-mode system that can control the transmission, steering, and throttle. Wheel sizes range from 18 to 20 inches.</p>, <p>Inside, the Continental offers large-car space. Front seats can have up to 30-way adjustment, while the rear seat can be fitted with USB charging ports and armrest-mounted temperature controls.</p>, <p>A host of active-safety systems are offered, but only the most expensive versions can be fitted with a surround-view camera system, forward-collision warnings, and adaptive cruise control. The Continental has received top safety scores from federal and independent testers including a Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS.</p>, <p>Standard features include Sync3 infotainment, automatic climate control, and satellite radio. Major options include leather, high-end Revel audio, and a twin-panel sunroof.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 amounted to just a few feature additions on certain trims.</p>, <p><strong>Lincoln Continental history</strong></p>, <p>Before the 2017 rebirth, the Continental had essentially become a long-wheelbase Ford Taurus from 1988 through the 2002 model year. But the name began as a brand unto itself, christened in the World War II era as a personal car for Edsel Ford, and produced in limited numbers just before and after the war. Ford revived the name in 1956 and applied it to a stunning, expensive Lincoln two-door hardtop coupe dubbed the Mark II.</p>, <p>The Continental coupe ran through Roman numerals III through VIII as it mostly grew larger, becoming a more direct rival for more popularly priced Cadillacs of the day, though never as innovative as the first front-wheel-drive Eldorado of the late 1960s. The Mark VII of 1984 brought some fresh air to the brand, especially with its LSC performance version, but the last of the Marks—the Mark VIII of 1993—lost the touch again. The Mark coupes were permanently retired after 1998.</p>, <p>The design heights for the Continental name, however, were reached with the 1961-1967 Continental, offered as a two-door coupe, a four-door sedan with suicide rear doors, and one of the few four-door convertibles ever built in volume. This Continental was the one converted for presidential use; one became the limousine in which President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Its classically Modern lines were a decisive break from baroque late 1950s styling, and are revered even today as iconic designs.</p>, <p>By the end of the decade, the pricey Continental was due for a redesign, which it received in rather inglorious form, starting a downward trend in appeal and in construction quality that continued until it was killed. The hopelessly baroque Town Cars of the early 1980s were a grim sight, for any fan of the Mark II or the classic early 1960s cars.</p>, <p>With its 1988 redesign, the Continental found a new niche, as a spin-off of the wildly successful Taurus. Given its own smooth and less radical shape to distinguish it from the Taurus, the longer, long-wheelbase Continental also came with front-wheel drive—but, pointedly, no V-8 engine. Ford's 3.8-liter V-6 did the honors, through a 4-speed automatic transmission. This edition was relatively well received, and sold through the 1994 model year.</p>, <p>In 1995, the Continental was revamped, riding on a new generation of the same platform. The V-8 returned, in the form of a 4.6-liter engine coupled to a 4-speed automatic, but the front wheels were still the ones powering the car. The major innovations in this era were an air suspension and airbags. The model was perceived, though, as a car for older drivers.</p>, <p>As Ford began to absorb storied European luxury brands in the late 1990s, the business case for the Continental made less and less sense. Ford announced the end of Continental production in 2002, and the final models rolled off the assembly line that year.</p>]

[<p>The Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size premium sedan with seating for five. With the MKZ, Lincoln has a rival for vehicles like the Acura TLX, Volvo S60, Buick LaCrosse, and Lexus ES.</p>, <p>The MKZ name was introduced in 2007, after essentially the same vehicle appeared for the 2006 model year as the Lincoln Zephyr—which had replaced the rear-drive Lincoln LS sedan in the luxury brand's portfolio.</p>, <p>The entry-level MKZ received a dramatic redesign for 2013 further separating it from the mid-size four-door Ford Fusion on which it is based. But there's more coming as Ford tries to separate the Lincoln brand even more. For 2017, Lincoln has reshuffled the MKZ's features and trim levels, adding a Black Label "membership experience" at the very top, and both restyled the front end and provided a new and more powerful twin-turbo V-6 engine that develops 400 horsepower when paired with all-wheel drive. For 2018, the car was relatively unchanged.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lincoln_mkz_2018">2018 Lincoln MKZ review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Lincoln MKZ</strong></p>, <p>The 2017 MKZ model adopts a number of design cues from Lincoln's new Continental sedan flagship. The twin-wing grille used for nearly a decade has been axed in favor of a rounder mesh grille with a more ubiquitous look. The cabin keeps its push-button drive selector, but thankfully drops the last of its swipe-activated volume and fan controls in favor of conventional dials and levers.</p>, <p>The big news is under the hood, where the 2017 MKZ gets its own top-of-the-line powertrain, one not shared with any Ford. It's a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 engine, making 400 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque with all-wheel drive, or 350 hp and 400 lb-ft in front-wheel-drive form. The AWD version of this powertrain is offered with an optional Driver’s Package that includes torque vectoring, sport-tuned suspension, and 19-inch alloy wheels with low-profile tires, as well as tossing in multi-contour seats, carbon fiber appliques, and aluminum pedal covers.</p>, <p>As before, the base engine is a 245-hp, 2.0-liter turbo-4, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive as an option. The MKZ Hybrid also carries over, though it doesn't offer the AWD option. The MKZ has one of the widest ranges of EPA fuel-economy ratings of any car we know, with the powerful new 400-hp twin-turbo AWD model rated at 20 mpg combined, and the 2017 MKZ Hybrid coming in at exactly twice that, or 40 mpg combined.</p>, <p><strong>Lincoln MKZ history</strong></p>, <p>The MKZ started life as the Zephyr, which was a very thinly veiled version of the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan twins, adding just a touch more luxury inside and enough design modifications to differentiate it from the other models. Though it did not offer an entry-level 4-cylinder powertrain like the Mercury and Ford, the Zephyr did use the 3.0-liter V-6 those cars shared, including it as standard equipment. While the exteriors of all three cars were very similar, Lincoln went its own direction with interior design; the brand's two-binnacle dash layout was used, leaning on themes that originated in Lincoln models of the 1960s.</p>, <p>For 2007, the Zephyr was renamed MKZ, carrying over the same mechanicals and chassis until 2009. The 2007 model year also brought with it an upgraded engine, with a 3.5-liter V-6 making 265 hp replacing the original 3.0-liter; the MKZ was also offered with optional all-wheel drive. This was the start of Lincoln's renaming spree, which has now touched everything but the Navigator SUV. The naming scheme was supposed to recall the older "Mark" cars, with pronunciation to match, but Lincoln soon gave up on that fight and reverted to saying each letter individually.</p>, <p><a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/mkz">The MKZ</a> got a heavily revised interior with improvements to its materials and sound quality for the 2010 model year. The excellent new interior and subtle changes elsewhere sharpened its luxury focus, but the MKZ still couldn't match European sport sedans like the BMW 3-Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class for crisp driving responses. It still was more a luxury touring sedan along the lines of the Lexus ES 350 and Volvo S60 and Buick LaCrosse. The big back-seat room was an MKZ selling point, and so was the raft of interior goodies like Ford's SYNC entertainment controller and THX surround sound.</p>, <p>For 2011, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079851_2013-lincoln-mkz-hybrid-rated-at-45-mpg-combined-by-epa">Lincoln MKZ added a Hybrid model</a> to its lineup. Mechanically similar to the Ford Fusion Hybrid, the gas-electric Lincoln sedan posted fuel-economy numbers as high as 41 mpg, and allowed electric-only operation up to 47 mph. The sedan had gauges that helped teach efficient driving, using flowers as a clean-driving metaphor. It also offered standard SYNC and 10-way power front seats with heating and ventilation, putting it at the upper end of the MKZ range.</p>, <p>For the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1077919_2013-lincoln-mkz-configurator-and-pricing-estimator-goes-live">2013 model year</a>, the MKZ received a complete redesign, adopting a new architecture that again is shared with the Ford Fusion, but distancing itself even more strongly from that sedan with distinctive styling and features.</p>, <p>The new MKZ arrived in mid-2012 with a trio of powertrains that include a base 2.0-liter turbo-4 with 240 hp, offered with front- or all-wheel drive, and good for up to 33 mpg highway; a front-drive hybrid model that was rated at 38 mpg combined; and a V-6 with 300 hp, front- or all-wheel drive, and gas mileage of up to 26 mpg highway. New features included a push-button transmission; updated MyLincoln Touch voice and touchscreen controls; and an optional huge retractable glass roof with a single, 15-square-foot panel, the largest in the industry.</p>, <p>Over time, fuel-economy ratings of the Hybrid model were changed to reflect real-world disappointment with gas mileage. While nothing changed mechanically on that model, Ford was forced to adjust its fuel-economy ratings from 45 mpg city, 45 highway, 45 combined to 38/37/38 mpg as a result of complaints from buyers who were unable to achieve the lofty numbers. Ford also adjusted the numbers for several other hybrid models at the time, citing errors in initial calculations, and offered cash payments to owners based on how much they'd driven their cars up to that point.</p>, <p>As part of its attempt to remain relevant in the American luxury market, Lincoln launched a Black Label program that was first applied to MKC crossover and MKZ sedan models. <span>For an extra $5,995, buyers got a "curated" palette of colors and trim options, using finer materials and offered in a handful of design themes, as well as a host of special extras, including in-home ordering and an annual detail of their vehicle</span>.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lincoln_mkt
[<p>The Lincoln MKT is a large luxury crossover SUV with seating for up to seven passengers. A relative of the very differently styled Ford Flex, the MKT was new in the 2010 model year, built off a platform that traces its origins to the first Volvo XC90.</p>, <p>The MKT sits between the MKX mid-size crossover and the Navigator full-size SUV in Lincoln's lineup. It's never been a strong seller, but it's become popular with limousine and black-car services, as well as Uber, for its big interior room.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: See our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/lincoln_mkt_2018">2018 Lincoln MKT review</a></strong><br/></em></p>, <p>The MKT has interesting sheet metal—an attempt to adapt design idioms of classic Lincolns from previous decades to the shape of a crossover utility vehicle. In previous decades, the large utility vehicle would have simply been called a wagon. </p>, <p>While the Flex is all angles and straight lines, the MKT riffs on the heritage of 1960s Lincolns with big bands of chrome and a kinky uptick in its greenhouse, splitting the air with a massive batwing grille that's easily the most daring and controversial thing the brand has done in decades. Inside, it's much less divisive: there's a high-quality dash well tailored in wood, leather, and metallic accents, lit brightly by white LEDs, and capped by a big LCD screen for infotainment and ancillary controls.</p>, <p>Lincoln offers a choice of two 6-cylinder engines in the MKT. The base model originally included a 268-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 and a 6-speed automatic—a close relative of the powerplant in the Lincoln MKS sedan and even the related Mazda CX-9 crossover. For 2013, the engine was upgraded to a new 303-hp version. The sportier models get a twin-turbocharged EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 that originally made 355 horsepower but was upgraded to 365 hp for 2013; like the 3.7-liter, the EcoBoost engine is mated to a 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Naturally aspirated models come with front-wheel drive, while the EcoBoost MKT has standard all-wheel drive. Both come with standard shift paddles for their 6-speed automatics. It's a somewhat odd sensation, paddle-shifting a vehicle this large, but the MKT responds very well to a heavy foot and quick fingers: electric power steering is light and quick, body motions are as well-controlled as they can be for such a long vehicle, and while you wouldn't call it nimble, the MKT isn't numb or indecisive during fast-paced driving maneuvers.</p>, <p>The MKT can be had in six- and seven-passenger versions, with bucket seats in the second row an option over the standard 60/40-split folding bench seat. The front seats are large and cozy, even if the active headrests push on the back of passengers' heads a little too intently. Second-row seats have copious foot and leg room, and the third row is almost large enough for some adults, though mainly intended for children. Power "fold and tumble" second-row seats with heating, cooling, and power-assisted lumbar adjustment are included with the six-passenger option; when equipped, third-row passengers can fold second-row seats out of the way by pressing a button—a nice touch that is oddly not more prevalent in other three-row vehicles. Cargo room behind the third row is 17.3 cubic feet; fold down the rearmost seat and it rises to 39.6 cubic feet. With both rear rows folded, the MKT has a cavernous 75.9 cubic feet of room for hauling home estate-sale finds.</p>, <p>Comfort and convenience features ladled on the MKT include a large, standard, fixed-panel sunroof; dual-zone climate control; the Bluetooth-and-voice-controlled SYNC system; a keyless entry pad on the door frame; high-intensity discharge headlights with automatic high beams; and pushbutton start with MyKey features that allow drivers to set preferences for speed controls, radio functions, and seat/mirror memory positions. A handful of options can be specified to bring the most expensive MKTs to nearly $55,000, including a power panoramic sunroof; 20-inch polished aluminum wheels; a rear-seat DVD entertainment system; active parking assist and adaptive cruise control; a navigation system with a music hard drive and THX II-certified speakers; and a five-quart refrigerator mounted between the middle row's bucket seats.</p>, <p>For 2013, the MKT received many drivetrain and interior changes, starting with a more powerful 3.7-liter V-6 that's good for both 303 hp and 25 mpg highway fuel economy; also new were Town Car livery versions that offer a higher-mileage EcoBoost 4-cylinder alternative that won't be sold to the general public. The 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 returns with 365 hp and a 23-mpg highway rating. Both are teamed to a 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters and full manual control, as well as rev-matched downshifts. Some versions are fitted with Lincoln Drive Control, which allows the driver to select between Normal, Sport, and Comfort modes, depending upon conditions, road and passenger feedback.</p>, <p>Models equipped with the EcoBoost V-6 also include an adaptive suspension that Lincoln calls Continuously Controlled Damping. It's adjusted through the Lincoln Drive Control settings, and Lincoln claims it is tuned to balance ride comfort and handling. The MKT is also available with inflatable rear safety belts and includes the latest version of MyLincoln Touch for infotainment duties.</p>, <p>In 2014, Lincoln began marketing a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1055382_lincoln-mkt-town-car-is-your-next-limo">Town Car version</a> of the MKT to livery fleets. It is sold with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost inline-4 and front-wheel drive, with fuel-economy ratings of 20 mpg city, 28 highway. The body is the same length, but the third row is removed and the second row pushed back to create extra room for passengers. There were few other changes to the MKT in 2014.</p>, <p>Lincoln has made no major changes to the MKT since the 2014 model year aside from the addition of its updated Sync 3 infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lotus_evora
[<p>
Sleek and low-slung with a wide-bodied stance, the Lotus Evora looks like an exotic, despite carrying a price tag that's about half that of most cars that typically own the epithet. Simple details, clean, smooth surfaces, and a narrow slit of glass surround a form that's as minimalist as this rather luxurious take on Lotus' ethos will allow.</p>, <p>
The Lotus Evora offers two-seat or two-plus-two seating arrangement; in either case, the area behind the front seats is best reserved for small packages. A Toyota-sourced, but Lotus-improved V-6 engine lies amidships in the base Evora; the Evora S gets a supercharged version of the engine.</p>, <p>
In base form, the Evora generates 276 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque from its 3.5-liter V-6 engine. With a curb weight of as little as 3,042 pounds, it's a nimble, luxurious sports car. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, while a six-speed automatic with "Intelligent Precision Shift" function is available. A Bosh electronic differential lock is standard on all models. In manual form, the base Evora can hit 60 mph in 4.8 seconds, while the IPS automatic model does the job in 5.0 seconds.</p>, <p>
The Lotus Evora S packs 345 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque in its V-6 engine thanks to the addition of a supercharger. The Evora S weighs a bit more than the base model, tipping the scales at a minimum of 3,161 pounds, but nevertheless gets to 60 mph quicker, requiring just 4.4 seconds for the manual-equipped Evora S, or 4.5 seconds with the automatic transmission.</p>, <p>
Inside each Evora you'll find a cabin that's snug, almost to the point of being a bit too small for the typical American, but despite the short space (most notable in the foot areas for each front seat), the quality and look of the interior is generally very high-end. At the same time, there's a stripped-down aesthetic to the cabin that makes it clear that, however luxurious the Evora might be, it comes from a long line of dedicated sports and racing cars.</p>, <p>
Standard equipment on all models includes: adjustable Recaro leather sport seats; a flat-bottomed steering wheel trimmed in leather; unique aluminum switches and knobs; Lotus' command center infotainment/vehicle information display; an Alpine CD/MP3/WMA audio system with iPod connectivity; remote locking; and air conditioning. Available options include: a Sport pack, a Premium pack, a Premium pack with Suedetex synthetic leather, a Tech pack, and a Premium/Sport pack.</p>, <p>
At the pump, the Lotus Evora is fairly efficient for a high-performance luxury car, thanks largely to its relatively low weight. In base form, the Evora scores 19 mpg city, 28 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined with the automatic transmission; the manual Evora rates 18 mpg city, 26 mpg highway, and 21 mpg combined. The more powerful Evora S very nearly matches these numbers, earning an identical score to the base Evora when equipped with the automatic transmission, and 17 mpg city, 26 mpg highway, and 20 mpg combined with the manual.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/maserati_levante
[<p>The Maserati Levante is the Italian automaker's first SUV. It was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva auto show and released in North America roughly six months later for the 2017 model year.</p>, <p>Available in base Levante or Levante S configuration, the four-door crossover is also sold with a diesel engine in other parts of the world.</p>, <p>With the Levante, Maserati takes head-on the burgeoning luxury crossover crowd that includes the Audi Q7, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Porsche Cayenne, and BMW X5.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1110682_2017-maserati-levante">2017 Maserati Levante review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Maserati Levante arrived in the U.S. in summer 2016 in two configurations. The base Levante is powered by a 350-horsepower, twin-turbo V-6, and a higher performance Levante S boosts performance from the turbo-6 all the way up to 450 hp.</p>, <p>Although the SUV is a new segment for the luxury automaker, the SUV doesn't stray far from the hallmark details made famous by the luxury automaker. The Levante proudly sports the trident in its concave grille, and a long curvaceous hood that reaches back into the passenger cabin. An aggressively sloped roofline cuts down from the rear doors dramatically, and meets with wide rear haunches that flare over the 255-mm wide tires.</p>, <p>Quad-tipped exhausts blast the V-6's signature sound from the back of the Levante, and bypass valves open further in Sport mode to announce the Levante's rapid approach—or equally rapid departure.</p>, <p>The aforementioned twin-turbo V-6 is sourced from Ferrari and planted in the Levante—alongside similar versions found in the Quattroporte and Ghibli sedans—and mated exclusively to an 8-speed automatic. According to Maserati, the Levante and Levante S run up to 60 mph in 5.8 and 5.0 seconds respectively, and both are equipped with all-wheel drive as standard. An adjustable air suspension system is standard on all models, and paired with a torque vectoring system that helps the Levante carve corners and tackle mild off-road obstacles. (Maserati says that the Levante has the lowest center of gravity in its class, which doesn't necessarily bode well for bouldering, we suspect.)</p>, <p>The Levante boasts a 50/50 weight distribution and mechanical locking rear differential for sportier behavior and a top speed of 155 mph, which we don't suggest on public roads.</p>, <p>Inside, the Levante is awash in the luxury and leather fittings that would be expected with its luxury price tag. The SUV is equipped with an 8.4-inch touchscreen, adapted from parent-company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and a rotary controller for volume control and settings. Ultra-luxury fittings such as Ermenegildo Zegna silk are available in the Levante, which can boost the base price tag of nearly $74,000 for a Levante up to nearly six figures for a fully equipped Levante S.</p>, <p>The Levante is built at the automaker's Mirafiori plant in Turin, Italy.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/maserati_ghibli
[<p>The Maserati Ghibli is a four-door, mid-size sedan from Italy. It was added for the 2014 model year in the U.S. and is related to the Quattroporte sedan.</p>, <p>Maserati's smaller sedan is a rival for vehicles such as the Jaguar XF, Audi A6/A7, BMW 6-Series Gran Coupe, and Cadillac CTS.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our</em> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/maserati_ghibli_2017"><em>2017 Maserati Ghibli review</em></a></strong></p>, <p>The Ghibli name may be new for some shoppers, but it's a relatively old name for Maserati. The word is derived from an Arabic term meaning "hot wind from the Sahara Desert." For 2017, the Ghibli adds more power and safety features into the lineup.</p>, <p><strong>The new Maserati Ghibli</strong></p>, <p>
Maserati re-introduced the Ghibli nameplate to the U.S. market with a dramatic and cinematic Super Bowl ad. No longer a coupe, but a four-door sedan with a somewhat coupe-like profile, the new Ghibli has some ties to the past. Power, for example, comes from a twin-turbo V-6, though displacement has risen to 3.0 liters. The 410-horsepower output of some U.S. models makes it the strongest Ghibli to date. A rear-wheel-drive model is joined by an all-wheel-drive model, while an 8-speed, paddle-shifted automatic is standard.</p>, <p>Today's Ghibli has a lot in common with the larger Quattroporte sedan. The basic structure is shared, along with some powertrain components. The two also have similar styling—for example, the portals along the front fenders as well as the overall silhouette. The Ghibli's interior is luxurious but not overly styled, offering nice wood and leather from Poltrona Frau.</p>, <p>The Ghibli is 11 inches shorter than its Quattroporte cousin, offering five seats and a much tighter back seat. It's the entry-level Maserati, the smallest offered, but still includes much of the same equipment, design and overall passion of the other models in the range. Its similarity to the Quattroporte may help or hurt it, depending on whether buyers are looking for the best the brand has or the least-expensive Maserati.</p>, <p>High-tech features are also available, including audio by Bowers &amp; Wilkins, an in-car wi-fi hot spot, a rearview camera, and a center touchscreen.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the Ghibli added stop-start, a hands-free trunklid, blind-spot monitors, a 900-watt Harman Kardon audio system or a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio system, and new Zegna-penned trim packages.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Ghibli's base V-6 engine adds 20 horsepower for a total of 350, increasing the top speed to 166 mph. The Ghibli also gets Luxury and Sport packages, the new Maserati Touch Plus infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a standard air quality sensor, and several new safety features, including adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, lane departure warnings, forward collision warnings with emergency braking, and a surround-view camera system.</p>, <p><strong>Ghibli history</strong></p>, <p>Maserati's first Ghibli was a two-door grand touring car with a V-8 engine wrapped in styling by Giorgetto Giugiaro. It was small and low to the ground, with up to 350 hp for the SS model, which made it very popular among sports-car enthusiasts when it came out in 1967</p>, <p>In 1969, a convertible, or spider, was added to the Ghibli range, but by 1973 the Ghibli ceased production.</p>, <p>
The name came back in 1992, this time on an angular, modern two-door coupe powered by a pair of small (2.0- and 2.8-liter) but potent twin-turbo V-6 engines. Known as the Ghibli II, this car was less popular and less successful than the original, with production lasting just five years. Nevertheless, the car saw several special editions produced, including a racing version, the Ghibli Cup. In its day, the 330-horsepower, 2.0-liter Cup claimed the specific-horsepower crown, beating out exotic supercars like the Jaguar XJ220 and Bugatti EB110.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/maserati_granturismo
[<p>The Maserati GranTurismo is the brand's sportiest model. The classically styled 2+2 is also Maserati's only two-door model in its current lineup.</p>, <p>With the GranTurismo, Maserati has a coupe or convertible with a V-8 heart from Ferrari. The interior can be customized and designed with numerous trims, colors, materials—even unique luggage.</p>, <p>The GranTurismo remains a rival for cars such as the Porsche 911, Ferrari California, and Aston Martin Vantage—and it is unchanged for 2017.</p>, <p><strong style="font-style: italic;">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/maserati_granturismo_2017">2017 Maserati GranTurismo review</a></strong></p>, <p>The GranTurismo replaced the simply named Maserati Coupé in 2007, bringing the performance of that car together with increased refinement and plenty of Italian flair. It is easily the most aggressively styled Maserati in the current lineup, with an exotic look and a curvaceous profile expected of a high-performance Italian two-door. It is one of very few cars that looks as good or even better in convertible form, the lowered roof accentuating the strong rear fenders. In markets outside our own, Maserati markets the drop-top GranTurismo as the GranCabrio.</p>, <p>With its quick-ratio steering and a Skyhook air suspension with Sport mode, the GranTurismo manages to feel surprisingly nimble, considering that it's heavier than most other rival coupes. The Sport and MC models have their own specific suspension settings, offering an even firmer ride. The MC has excellent brakes with a pedal feel on par with those of other exotics.</p>, <p>A 405-horsepower, 4.2-liter V-8 was originally standard on the GranTurismo, and GranTurismo S models initially got a 433-hp, 4.7-liter version. For the 2012 model year, the 4.2-liter V-8 was discontinued, and all GranTurismo models now have a 4.7-liter V-8, with base cars rated at 444 hp and others at 454 hp. Maserati estimates 0-60 mph times as low as 4.7 seconds and a top speed maxing out at 185 mph. A GranTurismo MC edition inspired by Maserati's racing efforts sports 20-inch wheels and dark metallic trim.</p>, <p>In all forms, the engine lives up to its Ferrari pedigree, emitting a low rumble at idle and a tuneful wail under full acceleration. All GranTurismos now have a 6-speed ZF automatic transmission and excellent column-mounted steering-wheel paddles for shifting. The setup works well, with the transmission shifting quickly and decisively. Some previous models came with the brand's Duo-Select automated manual gearbox, which we recommended against due to exceptionally rough shifts during leisurely driving.</p>, <p>The Maserati GranTurismo feels snug, because of its quite narrow footwells and tight sport seats, but it's also warm and inviting thanks to soft leather and other excellent cabin details. There are back seats in the GranTurismo, but they're mostly for small adults and children, though they look enticing enough to try. The front seats provide enough space for taller adults, and trunk space should be just enough for a weekend trip. Maserati sells most of its GranTurismo and Quattroporte models by special order rather than off the lot, with a long list of customization options, interior trims, and luxury features, including a navigation system by Magneti Marelli, "trident" logo stitching on the seats, and carbon-fiber trim for the MC edition.</p>, <p>A new <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1077155_maserati-shows-off-the-2013-granturismo-sport">Sport version of the 2013 GranTurismo</a> debuted at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, joining the GranTurismo convertible Sport from the previous year. Sport models received a 460-hp version of the 4.7-liter V-8 engine, helping the cars run to 60 mph in about five seconds. At the 2013 Geneva show, an updated version of the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1052127_maserati-updates-granturismo-mc-stradale-for-2013-geneva-show">more hardcore MC Stradale</a> was unveiled, potentially previewing updates for the U.S.-market <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1063892_2012-maserati-granturismo-mc-priced-from-143400">GranTurismo MC</a>.

It continues to be available in the MC Centennial Editions, even though the 100-year anniversary has passed.</p>, <p>Looking forward, the GranTurismo is <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1103534_fresh-details-on-maseratis-alfieri-sports-car-new-granturismo">expected to be replaced soon</a> with both a new GranTurismo and a smaller model tentatively called Alfieri. The brand showed its Alfieri concept at the 2014 Geneva motor show. It is based on a shortened GranTurismo platform and envisions a more compact and very striking 2+2 that is meant as an homage to the company's 100-plus-year history. The GranTurismo is expected to be a grand tourer and the Alfieri will be more of a rival for the Porsche 911.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/maserati_quattroporte
[<p>The Maserati Quattroporte is a four-door sedan from the Italian luxury automaker.</p>, <p>This new four-door also gave light to a smaller version, which revives the Ghibli nameplate and shares some powertrain components. For the first time, Maserati offers all-wheel drive on the Quattroporte, along with its new smaller sibling, the Ghibli.</p>, <p>Its name translates into English as "four doors" and has been part of the Maserati stable since the 1960s. Initially a pure luxury car, the Quattroporte changed tack in the 1990s when a Ferrari-sourced V-8 was planted under the hood.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1110692_2017-maserati-quattroporte">2017 Maserati Quattroporte review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Quattroporte—Q-porte for short—can be considered a four-door coupe as a result of its latest styling, but is classified as a four-door luxury performance sedan. As such, it is a rival for vehicles like the Jaguar XJ and Audi A7/S7/RS 7, and perhaps even the Aston Martin Rapide.</p>, <p><strong>The new Maserati Quattroporte</strong></p>, <p>Up close, the details of the new Quattroporte aren't clearly related to its predecessor, but step back a few feet and the flowing proportions resolve into perfect, familial clarity. Crisp creases and angular accents dominate the new exterior design. An ovoid grille with a large trident emblem dominates the nose, sweeping up to the curved hood and into the fenders. A character line traces along the side and over the flanks, into a simple, understated rear end. The overall effect is one of refinement and class, as well as emotive style. Inside, the look is more subdued, but no less well-executed. Satin woods and fine leathers meet with metal accents in a clean, two-tone finish.</p>, <p>There are two engine options in the latest Quattroporte, both of which are twin-turbocharged: a 3.0-liter V-6 making 404 to 410 horsepower in the S and a 530-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-8 for the GTS. The V-6 model hits 60 mph in around five seconds, while the V-8 reduces the time to 4.7. Rear-wheel drive is standard with both engines, while all-wheel drive is an option on the V-6 model. Both engines use a ZF-sourced 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters. The all-wheel-drive system, dubbed Q4, can apportion up to 50 percent of torque to the front wheels when necessary, but usually sends all of it to the rear otherwise, for a sportier experience.</p>, <p>Equipment and features are, as with any Maserati, quite good even in base form, and there are many possibilities for personalization and customization. Available features include a 1,280-watt Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio system; Maserati Touch Control screen; adjustable pedals; a reverse camera; and in-car wi-fi. Maserati offers an <span>Ermenegildo Zegna Limited Edition model of the Quattroporte named for the famed Italian design house and featuring finishes chosen by the fashion experts.</span></p>, <p><span>The Quattroporte received several minor updates for 2015, most of them related to aesthetics or increased feature availability. Cars now </span>come with a three-month subscription to the SiriusXM "All Access" package as well as a wider selection of trim options, such as contrast stitching, red leather upholstery, and piano black dash accents. The in-car wi-fi system is now standard, as well. The GTS gets lower body trim that matches the color of the rest of the car, a trident badge with some red accents, and red-accented wheel center caps, all of which help set it apart from the S model.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the big Maserati sedan adds a rear-drive Q-Porte powered by the V-6. The new Quattroporte S has the twin-turbo V-6 rated at 404 hp. New features for 2016 include a hands-free trunklid, stop-start, blind-spot monitors, new Zegna-penned trim packages, and a 900-watt Harman Kardon audio system or a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio system.</p>, <p>An update in 2017 included a new 8.4-inch touchscreen, slightly restyled front and rear bumpers, and Quattroporte GranLusso and GranSport trims to emphasize the car's luxury or sporty characters, respectively.</p>, <p><strong>Maserati Quattroporte history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>Following on the sedans of the past, the Quattroporte that bowed in 2004 was designed by famed Italian styling house Pininfarina. It blended the sense of exclusivity and lavish feel found in a low-volume model with the passion of an Italian sports car. Introduced in that year, the fifth-generation Q-Porte had a shark-like front end, an aggressively raked windshield, and classic, elegant roofline fronted by a long hood, the Quattroporte's styling struck a middle ground between sports-car athleticism and sedan elegance. Almost no two Quattroportes of this generation were the same. Most were built to order, with many upholstery, paint, trim, and interior possibilities.</p>, <p>The more savage, sonorous character of this era of the Quattroporte is one of its most desirable aspects. It packed a Ferrari-built 400-hp, 4.2-liter dry-sump V-8 under its hood, and the engine seldom went quietly. It felt more like a sports coupe than a sedan from the driver's seat, thanks to the combination of excellent sport seats and quite narrow footwells. Comfort wasn't really a strong point for this Quattroporte; there was enough back-seat space for two adults, and the trunk was surprisingly small.</p>, <p>Over the years, this Quattroporte gained new variants. The S model upgraded to a 425-hp, 4.7-liter V-8, while the Sport GT S had a 434-hp version of the 4.7-liter. By 2013, the Quattroporte was only offered in S and GT S models, making 434 hp and 444 hp respectively.</p>]

[<p>The four-door, mid-size Mazda 6 has been a part of the Japanese automaker's lineup for nearly 15 years, but it remains something of a hidden gem not often cross-shopped against its segment rivals.</p>, <p>Redesigned for 2014 and updated in 2016, the 6 brings a few updates to the table for 2018. A new turbo-4 is on offer and more premium amenities are available.</p>, <p>With the 6, Mazda has a mid-size sedan to compete against the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, and particularly the Ford Fusion, which also sports good looks.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mazda_mazda6_2018">2018 Mazda 6 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Mazda 6</strong></p>, <p>The third-generation Mazda 6 arrived in early 2013 as a 2014 model, with <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1061116_new-mazda-6-sedan-coming--just-not-from-michigan">production of the U.S. version</a> shifted back to Japan from Michigan. The car is lighter and leaner, with great fuel economy courtesy of two gas engines from Mazda's SkyActiv family. A diesel has been promised since launch, but delays have kept it from us, and it may or may not still make it here for this generation; that decision has likely been complicated by the drop in gas prices that makes diesel fuel more expensive.</p>, <p>In design, the latest Mazda 6 follows the radical Takeri Concept introduced at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. It's sleek, elegant, and noticeable. We have also found the new Mazda 6 to be more refined than ever—with responses that are athletic, if not overly sharp and sporty. A 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter gasoline SkyActiv inline-4 is standard, along with the choice of either a new 6-speed manual gearbox (a rarity among mid-size sedans) or a 6-speed automatic. <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1069924_mazda-improves-fuel-saving-start-stop-system-with-capacitors">Mazda's mild-hybrid system</a> is also offered in the top-of-the-line Grand Touring model, using capacitors to rapidly store energy during braking or deceleration and make a further improvement to fuel efficiency.</p>, <p>Standard features have been boosted throughout the lineup, although we've found that the latest infotainment interface in the 6 is a little disappointing compared to others in the class. There is plenty of standout active-safety technology in the Mazda 6, including adaptive front lighting, blind-spot monitors and rearview camera, an automatic emergency braking system, and a lane-departure warning system. </p>, <p>Mazda gave the 6 a major update for the 2016 model year. The interior and exterior were lightly refreshed, and cabin materials are improved. Mazda also fit the latest version of its infotainment system, which includes an optional head-up display; the infotainment system was first used in the new Mazda 3 and remains a marked improvement over the one in early versions of this 6 sedan, featuring a better screen and quicker responses. The 2016 car also switched to an electronic parking brake, which frees up some space on the redesigned center console.</p>, <p>For 2017, Mazda has added to the range-topping Grand Touring optioned up with the Premium Package its new G-Vectoring Control System, which works like "trail braking" by applying engine braking when the wheels are turned to shift weight forward. The end goal is to increase grip on the front tires in order to maximize turn-in tenacity. Once the turn is held, the system releases the torque load to transfer weight to the rear of the car. Mazda says that the deceleration force is subtle—just 0.01 g or less—in order to retain a more natural feel on the road. </p>, <p>For 2018, Mazda revised the interior with more premium amenities such as ventilated and offered an uprated turbo-4 borrowed form the CX-9 crossover. It makes 250 horsepower (using premium unleaded) in the Mazda 6 and is paired exclusively to a 6-speed automatic transmission; a manual is standard with the largely carried-over non-turbo base engine. Mazda improved the suspension and chassis in the sedan for 2018, offering a more composed ride. What wasn't added? An updated infotainment system, natch.</p>, <p><strong>Mazda 6 history</strong></p>, <p>The first Mazda 6 was a follow-up to the Mazda 626, which came before Mazda's shift to single-number model names. The first-generation car hit the market in 2002 as a 2003 model and ran for five years. It was available as a standard sedan, a sedan-like five-door hatchback, and a five-door station wagon. It offered a choice between a 2.3-liter inline-4 and a 3.0-liter V-6, and could be paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission or 6-speed manual. A Mazdaspeed version of the sedan was also available in 2006 and 2007 only. The Mazdaspeed6 offered an interesting combination of a turbo-4, a manual transmission, and all-wheel drive; the chassis was tweaked and the body and trim received had a sportier take as well.</p>, <p>A second-generation Mazda 6 arrived in the U.S. in 2008 as a 2009 model. Its design was specific to the U.S., a sort of Americanization to try and better capture mid-size buyers in this market. Engines received an upgrade in output and size; the inline-4 grew to 2.5 liters while the V-6 expanded to 3.7 liters. Mazda kept the four-door sedan, but dropped the wagon and five-door hatch for this market. A Mazdaspeed also did not return.</p>, <p>Though it came in just the single sedan body style, this 2009-2013 Mazda 6 offered a full seven trim levels over its life span, ranging from economical family-sedan models to luxurious grand tourers. The entry-level Mazda 6 i SV offered a strong base feature set including a 6-speed manual transmission, the 170-horsepower inline-4 engine, and standard stability control and anti-lock brakes, but did without alloy wheels, keyless entry, or an advanced stereo system. The Mazda 6 i Sport added the option of a 5-speed automatic transmission, keyless entry, cruise control, and steering-wheel audio controls, among other features. The Mazda 6 i Touring had 17-inch alloy wheels, an eight-way power driver's seat, halogen fog lights, and an upgraded six-disc stereo system. Upgrading to the Mazda 6 i Touring Plus deleted the option of a manual transmission while adding a power moonroof, electroluminescent gauges, blind-spot monitoring, and an anti-theft system.</p>, <p>The Mazda 6 i Grand Touring was the highest-end model. It was fitted with the four-cylinder engine, sharing most of its features with the V-6-powered Mazda 6 s Grand Touring except for the six-cylinder car's 18-inch alloy wheels and 6-speed automatic transmission. The Mazda 6 s Touring Plus offered the same features as the Mazda 6 i Touring Plus, with the substitution of the V-6 engine and 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>From 2009 through 2013, the Mazda 6 changed very little.</p>]

[<p>The Mazda CX-5 is a compact five-seat crossover SUV. It replaced the CX-7 in the company's lineup in the 2013 model year, and now is slotted between the smaller CX-3 and the three-row CX-9 in the Japanese automaker's sport-utility lineup.</p>, <p>The CX-5 is is a handsome crossover utility vehicle offering better-than-average interior space and flexibility, as well as excellent roadholding and surprisingly high gas mileage in real-world usage.</p>, <p>With the CX-5, Mazda has a rival for such compact crossover mega-sellers such as the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Subaru Forester, Jeep Cherokee, among many others.</p>, <p>For 2018, the CX-5 adds cylinder displacement technology that helps improve its fuel economy, although only slightly.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read</strong> <strong>our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mazda_cx-5_2018">2018 Mazda CX-5 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Mazda CX-5</strong></p>, <p>A new Mazda CX-5 made its debut for 2017 with some familiar numbers. The car was powered by the same 2.5-liter inline-4 found on older models, although heavily reworked, and the dimensions were largely unchanged—the car's interior and wheelbase were mostly unchanged.</p>, <p>The exterior sheet metal was revised for simpler, more elegant lines, and the interior of the new CX-5 borrowed heavily from the CX-9 that was released just a year earlier. A 7.0-inch touchscreen was standard on all cars, but initially wasn't offered with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Rear seats added a small reclining feature—helpful for longer torsos—and upscale materials were added throughout the cabin.</p>, <p>Mazda said they would offer a turbodiesel in the CX-5 later in the year, but similar promises for the Mazda6 never panned out years earlier.</p>, <p>Despite the lack of engine options at launch, the CX-5 managed impressive handling and sharp acceleration—something the earlier generation had in spades—while improving on interior materials and quieter ride. Fuel economy hovered in the high-20s combined for both front- and all-wheel drive cars, and although the returns were impressive, smaller-displacement engines in some competitors started to catch up to the CX-5.</p>, <p>For 2018, the CX-5 added more standard equipment at every trim level and its inline-4 was upgraded with cylinder deactivation technology that lets it run on just two of its four cylinders.</p>, <p><strong>Mazda CX-5 history</strong></p>, <p>Despite the roominess inside, the base CX-5 was powered by only a 155-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-4, producing 150 pound-feet of torque, which could be ordered either with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. If you want all-wheel drive, you can get it with any trim level—which we applaud—but only with the automatic transmission.</p>, <p>The base SkyActiv powertrain delivers remarkable fuel efficiency. Both front-wheel-drive versions were EPA-rated at 29 mpg combined, with the all-wheel drive model (automatic only) dropping to 28 mpg. But we did much better than that, as Mazda quietly says many drivers will.</p>, <p>Just a year after its launch, the CX-5 received a solid update for 2014. The most obvious change was the addition of a larger engine for higher trim levels; Sport models retained the 2.0-liter, while Touring and Grand Touring CX-5s use a 2.5-liter SkyActiv 4-cylinder that delivered 184 hp. The bigger engine takes a second off the 0-to-60-mph time and only gives up 1 mpg in the EPA's combined rating, while bringing power that some thought was lacking from the 2013 models. </p>, <p>From the outside, the CX-5's lines are typically Mazda. The styling married a swoopy profile and strong accent lines to a restrained but still aggressive trapezoidal grille and relatively slim headlights that are swept back into the fenders. It's a sporty look for a crossover, though rear three-quarter vision is hurt by the rising beltline and tiny triangular third window on each side. And it's a shape surprisingly sensitive to color choice. Certain shades—dark gray is one—belie the crossover's body height and make it look almost svelte, though others show the tall doors all too plainly.</p>, <p>While certainly attractive, the CX-5 really stands out for its excellent handling. It acts more like a large hot hatch or a sports sedan than it does a crossover; sharing much with the Mazda 6 sedan, it feels very similar, just with a different point of view on the road. There's little roll in cornering, the steering has the right amount of effort and decent feedback, and there is ample grip to push it on on-ramps. If you feel you must have a SUV for family reasons, this is one way to still have fun on the occasional back road or even your commute.</p>, <p>Inside, the driver sits high, but not as high as in some competitors. Mazda says seat height is exactly halfway between a standard sedan and the typical crossover, which we think is a good compromise. The dashboard is straightforward and handsome, with soft-touch materials on most surfaces. Seats are comfortable and there's a lot of rear leg room with the front seats positioned for 6-foot-tall occupants. The load deck is surprisingly large, and a clever articulated seat mechanism moves the rear-seat cushion forward and down when the seatback is folded forward—giving a lengthy and completely flat load floor.</p>, <p>The CX-5 came with only six airbags, but it immediately earned a Top Safety Pick nod from the IIHS and was upgraded to Top Safety Pick+ for the 2014 model year after an improvement to its small overlap front score and the addition of active-safety features.</p>, <p>The CX-5 was updated again for the 2016 model year, mostly for aesthetics and with features. A new version was released for 2017.</p>]

[<p>The Mazda 3 is the Japanese automaker's family of compact cars. Offered as a sedan or as a hatchback, the 3 is powered by a choice of 4-cylinder engines, offers manual and automatic transmissions, and is front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Over its three generations, the Mazda 3 has earned a reputation for having above-average handling and driving fun. The newest model isn't available as a Mazdaspeed3, which has been a performance version for past generations.</p>, <p>The Mazda 3 is a rival for vehicles including the Toyota Corolla, Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, and Kia Forte.</p>, <p>For 2018, Mazda made standard on all models of the Mazda 3 a low-speed automatic emergency braking system that is quickly becoming universal among small cars.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111936_2018-mazda-3" target="_blank" title="2016 Mazda Mazda3 - review">2018 Mazda 3 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Mazda 3</strong></p>, <p>A new Mazda 3 arrived for 2014, bringing with it sleek new styling, a classy interior, even better driving dynamics, and greater fuel efficiency. We nominated it for our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/bestcartobuy">Best Car To Buy</a> award. Our only problem with the latest 3 was that the new profile cuts into rear-seat head room a little too much for the sake of style, with even the hatchback now having a head room-robbing look instead of the old upright appearance. The hatchback is also slightly less commodious as a result.</p>, <p>Power comes from a choice of 4-cylinder engines, with base Sport and Touring models using the 2.0-liter SkyActiv engine and the Grand Touring versions getting a 2.5-liter version of that engine. A manual was initially only available with the 2.0-liter, while both engines can be had with Mazda's slick-shifting 6-speed automatic. Changes for 2015 were few, although Mazda offered the larger engine with a manual transmission and it was easily the enthusiast's choice, the 2.0-liter has plenty of grunt to swiftly move the Mazda 3.</p>, <p>The current 3's interior also brings a slightly premium feel compared to many of its competitors. The materials are a step up from what's been offered in the past, the styling more cohesive yet usable, and build quality is up there as well. The 3 offers several advanced features, including a form of head-up display.</p>, <p>For 2015, Mazda improved the equipment list, and it's done the same again for 2016. The Mazda 3 now carries a lower price in base form, and offers more features as standard. The 2016 lineup spanned a base SV, Sport, Touring, and Grand Touring models. All models come with a rearview camera system, and two new packages allow you to add popular equipment to the Sport and Touring models, respectively. Luxury items such as perforated leather upholstery, adaptive front lighting, and moonroof are reserved for the top Grand Touring.</p>, <p>The revisions for 2017 included a new front face (and rear bumper for hatchback models), a slightly updated interior and new safety equipment for some models.</p>, <p>A new Mazdaspeed3 is expected soon, based on the newest 3 hatchback. The lightweight architecture should help things, and there's hope that Mazda will choose an engine that won't muscle the steering wheel out of the driver's hands with enormous amounts of torque. A new 'speed3 is likely to employ different steering and suspension designs to handle increased output, such as Ford does with its Focus ST.</p>, <p><strong>Mazda 3 history</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation Mazda 3 launched in 2004 and lasted through 2009. Its delightfully unconventional lines and tight handling put it head and shoulders above the Mazda Protege sedan it replaced (and prior to that, the 323 and GLC), and it was an instant sales success. Base versions were fitted with a 150-horsepower, 2.0-liter inline-4 and a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, while “s” models upgraded to a 160-hp, 2.3-liter inline-4 with 5-speed manual or automatic transmissions. For 2006, a Grand Touring model was added to the line as well.</p>, <p>The next Mazda 3 bowed in 2010, and would get significant updates for the 2012 model year. This second-generation Mazda 3 sported more exaggerated styling than its trim, taut predecessor. For 2012, the "smiling" expression of its front grille and air dam were given a new look with a softened grin and more flowing air dam, plus more body-color bodywork and a more refined interior. This version offered several advanced features not found on most of its competitors, including rain-sensing wipers, bi-xenon adaptive lighting, and three-position memory for the available power seats.</p>, <p>Two models were offered in 2010, each with a different engine. The base Mazda 3 "i" model that year sported a 148-hp, 2.0-liter inline-4, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. The sportier Mazda 3 "s" had a 167-hp, 2.5-liter inline-4 with a 6-speed manual as standard, with an available automatic. Gas mileage ranked near the bottom of the compact class, with ratings as low as 22 mpg city, 29 highway for the "s."</p>, <p>For hard-core enthusiasts, the Mazdaspeed3 was offered, to face off against all-wheel-drivers like the Subaru WRX and Mitsubishi Evo models as more similar front-drive turbo models like the Ford Focus ST. It was able to reach 60 mph in less than six seconds. Power came from a direct-injected, turbocharged, and intercooled 2.3-liter inline-4 that pumped out 263 hp and came only with a 6-speed manual.</p>, <p>The 2012 model year brought upgraded, the most significant of which were under the hood and enabled new <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1064367_2012-mazda3-40-mpg-highway-zoom-zoom-intact">fuel economy ratings of up to 40 mpg</a>. A new Sky-G 2.0-liter inline-4, combined with all-new 6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmissions, brought <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1067367_2012-mazda-mazda3-skyactiv-first-drive">performance approaching the 2.5-liter "s" models</a>, with fuel economy about 20 percent better than that of the older 2.0-liter. Both of the previous engines remained available for 2012, with the 2.0-liter on the base 3 i SV and Sport and the 2.5-liter on "s" versions.</p>, <p>For 2012, blind-spot monitors were added to the Tech Package offered on the Grand Touring. The Mazda 3 had the usual raft of options: a Bose premium stereo, Bluetooth connectivity, an iPod interface, satellite radio, and keyless entry, for instance.</p>, <p>The i Sport model was treated to the new 2.0-liter SkyActiv engine for 2013, bringing the efficient powertrain to a less-expensive model. The 2013 model year also brought standard air conditioning to the base SV model, while the i Sport received the multi-information display and a USB port. The more expensive trim levels also saw expanded equipment.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mazda_mx-5-miata
[<p>The Mazda MX-5 Miata has kept alive the dream of pure two-seat sports cars for more than a quarter century. While it's rekindled a love of classic roadsters, it's also converted a new generation to the joys of top-down driving in a simple, nimble, back-to-basics two-seater without excessive power.</p>, <p>A 2016 redesign marked the launch of the Miata's fourth generation, internally known as ND. After adding the RF hardtop variant last year, the Miata lineup's 2018 changes include a red soft-top option and available Recaro sports seats.</p>, <p>With the Miata, Mazda has one of the last, true sports cars on the road. Designed in the 1980s as an homage to the classic British roadster, the Miata offered up all the driving fun of those sports cars, but virtually none of the ownership pains. That combination continues today.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mazda_mx-5-miata_2018">2018 Mazda MX-5 Miata review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>Today's Mazda MX-5 Miata</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The re-engineered and redesigned fourth-generation Miata was a classic on arrival.</p>, <p>The 2016 redesign brings the Miata in line with some modern safety, efficiency, and tech expectations, all while preserving that delicate sweet spot that makes it different from anything else on the market.</p>, <p>Versus the prior (NC) generation, the current Miata is shorter and sits lower. Its styling follows Mazda’s latest "Kodo" design language, evolved from the Mazda 6, Mazda CX-5, and Mazda 3, and made a little more pert. Inside, the Miata features low-slung seating, a prominent center console, big analog gauges, and a horizontal, shelf-like instrument panel. One notable concession to modernity is the available 7.0-inch standalone infotainment screen.</p>, <p>Under the hood is Mazda’s 2.0-liter "SkyActiv" direct-injection inline-4, which runs a high 13:1 compression ratio. The engine’s 155-horsepower and 148 pound-foot ratings aren't impressive on their own, but considering the car's light weight (as low as 2,331 pounds), it's plenty—provided you keep the engine revving. The electric-assist rack-and-pinion steering is very precise, and the front wishbone, rear multi-link suspension helps keep the driver feeling bonded with the car in every twist and turn.</p>, <p>The Miata remains a two-seater with a limited amount of space—just enough for the driver and passenger. Ride quality is reasonably good (although the Club is noticeably stiffer), and wind buffeting with the top down is impressive. The RF shuts out some of that wind and road noise, and adds a measure of security. The roadster's manual top can be raised or lowered with one arm (thanks to a helper spring) in less than 10 seconds, while the RF's power top takes 13 seconds to open or close. </p>, <p>Three different models of the Miata are offered, though the RF is only available in two. The roadster gets a base Sport model, and both body styles come in an enthusiast-oriented Club model and a more luxurious Grand Touring. The Club model is the most aggressive performance setup available; outfit it with the manual transmission and you get a limited-slip differential, Bilstein shocks, and a shock tower brace. You can go even further with a Brembo/BBS brake-and-wheel package. GT models add Bose audio with a subwoofer, a universal garage-door opener, heated seats, automatic climate control, and leather upholstery, plus 17-inch bright alloy wheels. The Club gets some active safety features and the Grand Touring adds even more, but no Miata comes with forward collision warnings or a rearview camera.</p>, <p>The 2017 Fiat 124 Spider is assembled alongside the Miata in Japan.</p>, <p>For 2017, Mazda added the RF body style. RF stands for retractable fastback. It boasts a retractable hardtop that gives the Miata a coupe-like roof with the top up and a targa-like appearance with the top down. Changes for 2018 included a new red softop option and available Recaro seats.</p>, <p><strong>Mazda MX-5 Miata history</strong></p>, <p>With Japanese reliability and the personality of something like the legendary Lotus Elan (not to mention similar hideaway headlights in the first generation), the Miata was nothing short of a revolution when it first went on sale for the 1990 model year. A small, two-seat sports car, the Miata was an instant classic. Everything about it recalled classic roadsters, with a long hood and short cabin; a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout; and a design that kept it lean and simple, sometimes at the expense of some comfort.</p>, <p>The Miata's success inspired other automakers to build their take on the classic sports car. The BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster, and Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class arrived over the next decade. Those German models, though they started out as more stripped-down machines, quickly went upmarket, with the BMW and Mercedes trading in 4-cylinder engines for 6 cylinders. GM even got in on the act, with the short-lived Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky.</p>, <p>The powertrain in the original Miata was a 1.6-liter inline-4 available with a choice of 5-speed manual or automatic transmissions, growing slightly with each new generation. In 1993, the engine was enlarged to 1.8 liters, and in 1998 the second-generation car was introduced. The same 1.8-liter engine powered the second MX-5 Miata, though it received a slight increase in power. The second-generation Miata offered a Mazdaspeed version in 2004 and 2005, which added a turbocharger to the 1.8-liter engine, increasing output significantly from 130 hp to 178 hp.</p>, <p>The third-generation car was introduced in 2005 for the 2006 model year. It again gained a larger engine, up to 2.0 liters and 160 hp standard (167 hp in 2009-2010 models), with a 5- or 6-speed manual transmission, or a 6-speed automatic, though the engine was detuned to 158 hp when paired with the automatic. Models with the 6-speed manual were available with a limited-slip differential.</p>, <p>While the Miata maintained a go-kart-like handling feel, with a low-to-the-road driving position that tended to exaggerate the feeling of speed without breaking the speed limit, the tight cabin could lend a feeling of vulnerability—or intimacy.</p>, <p>True to its essence, the base cloth top on the Miata hasn't ever been power-operated, but it remained fairly easy to open and close with a single hand. For the 2007 model year, however, a clever power-retractable hardtop version of the Miata was introduced. Thanks to smart design, the hardtop opened and closed quickly, preserved head room, took up no more trunk space than the cloth top, and created a tight, quiet cabin environment that made driving in cold weather considerably more civilized.</p>, <p>An MX-5 Miata Club trim was new for 2013. With a 6-speed manual transmission and a stiffer suspension tune, it had a somewhat sharper driving feel. For the 2015 model year, Mazda effectively signed off on the third-generation Miata with a special <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1091022_2015-mazda-mx-5-miata-25th-anniversary-edition-debuts-in-new-york">25th Anniversary Edition</a>.</p>]

[<p>The Mazda CX-3 is a compact crossover SUV that might be the most car-like of all the vehicles now occupying that niche. It deftly blends hatchback, wagon, economy-car and, yes, crossover traits. It lags in utility because of a small cargo area and light-duty, all-weather all-wheel drive. It went on sale in 2015.</p>, <p>With the CX-3, Mazda has a subcompact crossover to complete its line with the larger CX-5 and CX-9 crossovers. Rivals include vehicles such as the Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Fiat 500X, and the Chevrolet Trax.</p>, <p>For 2018, Mazda added low-speed automatic emergency braking to all CX-3 trim levels, an important safety feature that's becoming commonplace among small cars.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mazda_cx-3_2018">2018 Mazda CX-3 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The CX-3 is on a mission to deliver Mazda road manners and styling in a package that's as safe and roomy as other small crossover SUVs.</p>, <p>The CX-3 wears a shape that's much more interesting than that of the bigger CX-5. It's more heavily sculpted, with narrow headlights linked to the grille by slim strips of brightwork. The arced shoulder lines meet between the doors in a complex intersection of surfaces, and the rearmost pillar is black, giving the CX-3 the appearance of a floating roofline. From the back, the car has an Italian flavor, evoking some recent Alfa Romeo shapes. The cabin is adorned sparsely, with just a dash-mounted screen and round climate controls and vents breaking up the expanse.</p>, <p>The CX-3 gets its power from Mazda's newest 2.0-liter inline-4. Output is rated at 146 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque. A 6-speed automatic is the only transmission available in the CX-3, and the little crossover returns solid fuel-economy numbers, with the front-drive version seeing 29 mpg city, 35 highway, 31 combined, according to the EPA. The all-wheel-drive version is rated at 27/32/29 mpg.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive with active torque control is available on the otherwise front-drive CX-3. In either configuration, the crossover has good handling from its combination of electric power steering and front-strut and rear-torsion-bar suspension. Underlying those basics is a strong body structure with lots of high-strength steel for less flex, more precise control, and low weight.</p>, <p>The CX-3 is short in overall length (168.3 inches) and wheelbase (101.2 inches). It's very close to the dimensions of the Honda HR-V, but while Honda's placed a best-in-class marker on interior space, Mazda's cockpit isn't as roomy. Drivers will enjoy the CX-3's high driving position and even higher seating position for the people riding on the CX-3's three-person rear bench, while rear-seat leg room and cargo room are on the lean side.</p>, <p>The IIHS called the CX-3 a Top Safety Pick and federal testers agreed with a five-star overall score.</p>, <p>Like the new Mazda 3, 6, MX-5, and CX-5, the CX-3 offers the Mazda Connect infotainment system, which includes a 7.0-inch center display, a knob-type controller, smartphone connectivity for phone and audio steaming, and an available head-up display for the driver. Other features include 18-inch wheels and leather and sueded upholstery, and of course the optional all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>The CX-3 didn't change much for 2017, its second year on sale. Bigger, 18-inch wheels are now standard on mid-grade Touring models and Mazda reduced the price of its active safety feature suite—however it's still only available on top Grand Touring models.</p>]

[<p>The Mazda CX-9 is a seven-passenger crossover SUV. Introduced for the 2007 model year, the CX-9 is now in its second generation, with a new model that bowed for the 2016 model year.</p>, <p>With the CX-9, Mazda has a sportier alternative to other three-row crossovers such as the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, and Toyota Highlander—although we'd stop far short of calling it a sports car.</p>, <p>For 2018, Mazda added low-speed automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitors standard across all trim levels.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mazda_cx-9_2018" title="2017 Mazda CX-9 - review">2018 Mazda CX-9 review</a></strong><br title="2015 Mazda CX-9 - review"/></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Mazda CX-9</strong></p>, <p>The 2016 model year marked the debut of the second-generation CX-9. The latest CX-9 gets a new exterior design incorporating the brand's "Kodo" design language. The vehicle is 1.2 inches shorter, but the wheelbase is 2.2 inches longer, providing short front and rear overhangs and more interior space.</p>, <p>Inside, the design is more car-like, with a low-set version of the horizontal, shelf-like dash that’s been used in Mazda’s other contemporary models. There’s a very warm look to the cabin appointments, with supple nappa leather, Japanese rosewood, and available aluminum trim. Thinner seats offer more space, and Mazda provides two storage bins under the rearmost load floor. An additional 53 pounds of sound-deadening results in more interior isolation, but the 2016 CX-9 is up to 300 pounds lighter overall.</p>, <p>For its redesign, the CX-9 trades its 3.7-liter V-6 for a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-4. Paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, it uses up to 17.4 psi of turbo boost to help make 250 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque. The platform offers front- and all-wheel drive, and the new all-wheel-drive system can send up to 50 percent of engine power to the rear wheels. </p>, <p>New features include it comes Mazda's newest infotainment, with either a 7.0- or 8.0-inch display depending on the trim level, a 4.6-inch driver information screen, a color head-up display, white LED accent lighting up front, and an available 12-speaker Bose sound system. New safety features consist of adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, active lane control, lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p><strong>Mazda CX-9 history</strong><em><br/></em></p>, <p>The Mazda CX-9 was launched as a 2007 model and received a substantial update for 2013 to make its lines more similar to those of the compact CX-5 crossover. That <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1079241_2013-mazda-cx-9-gets-design-update-active-safety-features">significant 2013 refresh</a> <a>gave the CX-9</a> new front and rear styling, as well as new interior appointments, all influenced by the automaker's Kodo design language pioneered by the smaller CX-5. The 2013 CX-9 also brought significant upgrades to audio and navigation, as well as new active safety features such as frontal-collision warning, lane-departure warning, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>The CX-9 utilized V-6 power in a Mazda lineup that otherwise shifted completely to four cylinders. Its size and capabilities now neatly complement the CX-5, which won rave reviews for being both practical and fun to drive, and offered an alternative for families who need more space but don't want to give up driving pleasure. The underpinnings of the CX-9 were related to those of the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX, but Mazda has produced a very different look and a far sportier driving feel than either of those models.</p>, <p>The styling of the Mazda CX-9 is curvier, with more aggressive sheet metal and flared fenders, than the related Ford products. It maintains an overall look that makes no allusions to off-roading. Its strong, 273-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 feels more powerful than most engines in its class, and it's paired with a 6-speed automatic that does a great job on quick downshifts when needed. Buyers could opt for front- or all-wheel drive. Rated towing capacity is up to 3,500 pounds.</p>, <p>Because of its relatively old powertrain, the CX-9 doesn't didn't that well when it comes to fuel economy. The front-drive model was rated at just 17 mpg city, 24 highway; with all-wheel drive, those figures dropped to 16/22 mpg, according to the EPA. The engine is at least up to the task of moving the crossover around; that was even the case of 2007 models, which used a 263-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The CX-9 handles very well for something of its size, striking a nice balance between driver control and passenger comfort.</p>, <p>With three rows of seating and a third row that folds flat easily for cargo duty, the CX-9 has an especially handy layout for larger families and those who occasionally need some extra spots for the kids’ team members. The second and third rows can be folded flat together to open up 101 cubic feet of cargo space. First and second rows have plenty of room for adults, even remaining comfy on long trips, while the CX-9’s interior appointments, overall, do not disappoint.</p>, <p>The CX-9 is well built and offers a strong list of standard safety items, as well as options like a rearview camera and blind-spot monitors, which are helpful for family vehicles of this size. It should be noted, however, that the CX-9 received a roof-strength score of "Marginal" from the IIHS. The NHTSA gave the CX-9 four of five stars for rollover.</p>, <p>A loaded Mazda CX-9 Grand Touring carried a sticker price north of $40,000, which brought it into competition with several luxury-brand models, including entry-level German makes. But the Grand Touring comes with some tempting features, including HID headlights, nice leather seating, and rain-sensing wipers. Top options include a DVD entertainment system, a navigation system with real-time traffic, and a Bose Centerpoint surround-sound system.</p>, <p>Mazda made some minor changes to options packaging for 2015. The base Sport model now includes power lumbar adjustment for the driver's seat, and the two available packages now come bundled with roof rails, crossbars, a cargo net, and a rear-bumper pad.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is a mid-size luxury sedan, wagon, coupe, or convertible with an equally dizzying number of powertrain possibilities.</p>, <p>The common thread? They're all packed with a tremendous amount of technology.</p>, <p>New for the 2017 model year and boosted with more body styles for 2018, the revamped E-Class is built on a new platform.</p>, <p>With the E-Class, Mercedes has an established benchmark for rivals seeking to rise in the luxury ranks. Those rivals include vehicles such as the BMW 5-Series, Cadillac CTS, Jaguar XF, and Audi A6.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_e-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz E-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The new E-Class brings a familiar look to the table, but it's not a carryover design. Instead it owes a lot to the current C-Class and S-Class, with a long nose and a short decklid emphasizing its sporty intent.</p>, <p>The E-Class has grown in its latest edition. It now measures 193.8 inches long, or about 1.7 inches longer than the predecessor. The wheelbase is also up by 2.6 inches, to 115.7 inches.</p>, <p>As with the other Mercedes sedans, the interior is the showpiece. Here it's a direct homage to the cabin in the S-Class, with a large horizontal screen at the center of the dash for infotainment systems. Most versions have conventional dials for gauges, but a second 12.3-inch screen can be fitted in the gauge cluster. The steering wheel has touch-sensitive surfaces that respond to touch and swipe gestures, giving the driver easy control over the infotainment system, which can also be controlled by voice commands and by a touch-sensitive puck on the center console.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the sedan was offered as the mainstream E300 and the more performance-oriented Mercedes-AMG E43. In 2018, Mercedes added E400 wagons and sedans, E400 coupes and cabriolets, and massively powerful AMG E 63 S sedan and wagon.</p>, <p>In the E300, you'll find a 2.0-liter turbo-4 with 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. A 9-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive are standard, though all-wheel drive is available. The E400 has a 329-hp twin-turbo V-6, while the E43 adds more boost to bring that six to 396 hp and 384 lb-ft of torque  and it sends power to all four wheels via a sport-tuned 9-speed automatic. The E43 gets the full AMG treatment and rides on a special air suspension. The E 63 S sports a 603-hp 4.0-liter V-8, sport-programmed all-wheel drive, and a 9-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Plug-in hybrid and diesel models have been put on the back burner, and may not arrive in the U.S. until the end of the decade.</p>, <p>A steel-spring suspension is standard, but most models will come with one of two kinds of adaptive suspension. The simpler version adds adaptive air dampers; the more complex version gets three-stage air springs with variable control over ride height and body control, all selectable by the driver.</p>, <p>These updates make the new E-Class a formidable performer, but without a doubt, its calling card will be in its piloted-driving hardware and software. Under the aegis of Drive Pilot, Mercedes fits the new E-Class with features like adaptive cruise control that can stop and follow cars on the road ahead at speeds up to 130 mph. The autonomous Steering Assist feature also works up to 130 mph, when conditions are ideal, and can actively intervene to prevent an accident at up to 81 mph, even if road lines are unclear or non-existent, such as at a construction site. Finally, automatic lane changing for the highway has also been included.</p>, <p>Rolling out over time in the new E-Class are more advanced technologies, including a remote parking function that lets drivers move the car into a garage or parking spot via a mobile app. In the future, the E-Class also will be fitted with a vehicle-to-object (V2X) communications system that exchanges information via a built-in mobile-phone transponder with other vehicles that are appropriately equipped. The result: real-time, car-to-car communication that could help mitigate accidents or avoid them entirely.</p>, <p><strong>Mercedes-Benz E-Class history</strong></p>, <p>Tracing its roots—if not its name—back to just after World War II, the E-Class has traditionally been one of the leaders in the mid-size luxury segment. Eight generations of E-Class cars have graced the road, starting with the Mercedes "Ponton" or W120, its internal designation. Built from 1953-1962, this car set the stage for the models to follow, with abundant interior space and mid-size exterior dimensions. Power ramped up over the model run, and a roadster was introduced in 1955.</p>, <p>The second generation "Fintail" or W110, introduced not only tail fins, but also more importantly, a 6-cylinder engine (up from four), front disc brakes, and an automatic transmission. Again engine sizes grew, up to 2.3-liters in the 230, as did power and performance. Next came the "Stroke-8," or W114/W115, which included both 4- and 6-cylinder engines, a new, elegantly simple exterior design that canned the tail fins, and an all-new chassis. It ran from 1968 to 1976.</p>, <p>In 1977, the "Wedge" or W123 hit the streets, bringing a hint of the larger Mercedes 450SEL to the design, along with safety improvements such as a better protected fuel-tank location. The W123 was also the first E-Class to get fuel injection, which was then a relatively new technology. When the Wedge ended its run in 1986, the W124 arrived, sporting the "E" name for the first time. Models were badged with numbers reflecting engine displacement, followed by the letter E, i.e. the 3.0-liter 300E.</p>, <p>In 1994, toward the end of the W124's run, the E was switched to the front of the name, officially creating the E-Class. The "Four-Eyed" W210 followed in 1996, bringing with it the seeds of the next two generations of E-Class styling. Safety, performance, and size all increased with this generation, which also saw the first high-performance AMG-tuned and branded E-Class, the E55, in 1999.</p>, <p>The seventh-generation E-Class, the 2003 W211, saw a rounder, more aerodynamic styling theme, with a range of V-6 and V-8 engines powering the lineup. A new station wagon was introduced in 2004, and all-wheel drive was available once again. The W211 was replaced in 2009 with today's W212.</p>, <p><strong>Mercedes E-Class, 2010-2016<br/></strong></p>, <p>The last generation E-Class family was launched in the 2010 model year as a sedan, with coupe, convertible, and wagon models added over time.</p>, <p>When it launched, this generation gained sharper, more modern styling, and advanced safety features, including Night View Assist, Attention Assist, Adaptive Main Beam Assist, seven standard airbags, and automatic emergency braking. A more rigid unibody, uprated engines, improved fuel efficiency thanks to direct injection, and automatically adjusting shock absorbers all added up to a refined and capable luxury car.</p>, <p>Initial engine offerings were a choice between the V-6-powered E350 and V-8-powered E550. A range of engine upgrades has filtered through the current E-Class lineup since.</p>, <p>The E63 AMG's previous 451-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 engine was replaced by a twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8 initially rated at 518 hp and 516 pound-feet of torque. Those numbers eventually rose to 577 hp and 590 lb-ft.</p>, <p>A new E400 Hybrid Sport Sedan model made its debut in 2012 as a 2013 model, featuring a 302-hp gasoline V-6 engine paired with a 27-hp hybrid unit. That model was discontinued before the sedan was replaced in 2017.</p>, <p>For 2013, the E-Class moved forward with upgrades its infotainment system, a new selection of alloy wheels, and upgraded features and options packages, as well as enhanced standard equipment levels.</p>, <p>As part of larger efforts to downsize powertrains and reduce fuel consumption in mainstream Mercedes-Benz models, the E-Class saw several engine changes. For 2014, the BlueTec diesel went from a 3.0-liter V-6 in the E350 to a 2.0-liter turbodiesel inline-4 in the E250. The 2015 model year brought a twin-turbocharged gas V-6 in a new E400 model to replace both the twin-turbo V-8 (in the E-Class sedan) and the base V-6 (in coupes and convertibles).</p>, <p>Depending on body style, the E400 either replaced the E550 (sedan) or E350 (coupe and convertible) model; the wagon remained available only as an E350 or E63 S-model and with standard all-wheel drive in either version.</p>, <p>By the time the new generation began to roll out, the 2016 Mercedes E-Class family in the U.S. included the V-6-powered E350 four-door luxury sedan; an E350 wagon; a high-powered E63 AMG performance sedan and wagon; an E250 BlueTec sedan with turbodiesel power; the E400 coupe, sedan, and cabriolet, all with a powerful twin-turbocharged V-6 engine; and E550 versions of the coupe and convertible, which retained their V-8 engines.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class is royalty, literally and figuratively. The sedan, coupe, or convertible are flagships for the automaker and have served many heads of state for decades.</p>, <p>Along with its traditional four-door sedan body style, the S-Class has absorbed the former CL-Class coupes, and offers convertibles called Cabriolets, as well as the revived, range-topping Maybachs.</p>, <p>With the S-Class, Mercedes-Benz not only has a rival for traditional foes such as the BMW 7-Series and Audi A8, but also for the Bentley Flying Spur and Continental, and even Rolls-Royce sedans, coupes, and convertibles.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_s-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz S-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The current S-Class made its debut in the 2014 model year, with two-door coupes joining the lineup in 2015, along with AMG performance models, while a Mercedes-Maybach S600 sedan was added for the 2016 model year. For 2017, Mercedes added the Maybach S550 and S650 Cabriolet.</p>, <p>The S-Class received an update for the 2018 model year and momentarily reverted to a sedan-only lineup, though the Maybachs are still available. The updated coupe and Cabriolet were introduced at the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1111551_2018-mercedes-benz-s-class-coupe-and-cabrio-to-debut-at-2017-frankfurt-auto-show">Frankfurt auto show in September</a>.</p>, <p>The current S-Class has cycled through powertrains, with new engines arriving with the 2018 update. The new base model, called S450 features a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. A new twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 resides under the hood of S560 models. It puts out 469 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque and is mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. A more powerful version of that engine powers the AMG S63 model, where it makes 603 hp and 664 lb-ft of torque. Its 9-speed automatic uses a wet starter clutch instead of a torque converter; Mercedes says it saves weight and responds more quickly to throttle inputs. All-wheel drive is standard on the S63, and can run up to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds</p>, <p>Both 4.0-liters shut down four cylinders to save fuel under light load conditions. The S450 and S560 are available with rear- and all-wheel-drive, called 4Matic, while the S63 gets the new 4Matic+ that can vary torque continuously and completely front to rear.</p>, <p>Also offered are the Mercedes-Maybach S650 and Mercedes-AMG S65, both of which feature a 6.0-liter V-12 making 621-hp and 738 lb-ft of torque. The V-12 is paired with a 7-speed automatic. Despite the added power, the S65 AMG is slightly slower to 60 mph than the S63 AMG, due to its rear-drive-only arrangement.</p>, <p>The S560 replaces the S550, which had a 449-hp twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8. It was mated to a 7-speed automatic transmission, then received the 9-speed for 2017. The S63 was formerly powered by a twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8 churning out 577 hp and 664 lb-ft of torque. Zero to 60 mph took 3.9 seconds.</p>, <p>An S-Class hybrid sedan, dubbed the S550e Plug-In Hybrid, arrived for the 2016 model year and is suspended for 2018. This model featured a twin-turbocharged V-6 paired with an in-transmission electric motor and a lithium-ion battery pack. Electric-only range was about 12 miles, and it achieved an EPA combined fuel economy rating of 26 mpg or a 58 MPGe rating. The S550e employed some clever tricks to get maximum economy, including the use of GPS to determine when a particular driving mode was the most efficient choice.</p>, <p>The standard air suspension with adaptive dampers carries over but the available Magic Ride Control system gets a new feature for 2018. This system uses steel springs with active hydraulics and the new Curve feature tilts the car inward 2.65 degrees in turns to counteract g forces.</p>, <p>Each model in this sixth-generation Mercedes-Benz S-Class is packed with technology aimed at not only entertaining and coddling, but protecting the vehicle’s occupants.</p>, <p>The S-Class's Level 2 self-driving capabilities are updated for 2018 with improved cameras and radar sensors and increased use of map and GPS data. The map data allows the car to slow for twists and turns, as well as junctions.</p>, <p>Inside, the 2018 S-Class adds the Energizing Comfort system that uses the climate control, fragrance diffusion system, ambient lighting, music, seat heaters/coolers, and seat massagers to create five 10-minute programs aimed at helping the driver relax. They have names like Joy and Well-being and the programs range from warm and calming to upbeat and cool. For those who really want to reward themselves, Mercedes offers the Executive Rear Seat Package Plus option package, which adds reclining rear seats with fold-out footrests, a central console with laptop trays, a hot-stone massage function, and heated armrests.</p>, <p>Mercedes relaunched the Maybach brand on the S-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach sub-brand, with its first endeavor being an extra-luxurious version of the S600. This V-12 mega-sedan and the S550 Maybach added for 2017 were stretched compared to the long-wheelbase S-Classes we normally get, with the back-seat passengers benefiting from the extra room.</p>, <p>Finishes and appointments of all Maybachs are a step above those found in standard S-Classes, and the Maybach badge appears in several places inside and out, while the exterior remains very close to the S-Class sedan's look. An even longer version of the Maybach, dubbed Pullman, will also be available for a true, personal limo experience.</p>, <p>Further changes for 2017 included a new Magic Sky Control sunroof option and the mbrace2 Connect package as standard equipment. The Magic Sky Control panoramic sunroof can be adjusted for opacity front and rear. The mbrace 2 Connect package comes with five years of service and includes a mobile app, non-streaming apps, web services, a roadside connection, and diagnostics data.</p>, <p><strong>S-Class History</strong></p>, <p>Though the S-Class can trace its roots to some of the same W-sedan models of the 1950s and 1960s as the E-Class, its true history begins with the 1972 debut of the classically styled W116, the first car to be called an S-Class. Available with a range of 6- and 8-cylinder engines, the first S-Class was one of the first cars to offer airbags, anti-lock brakes, a passenger safety cell, and a turbodiesel engine. The second-generation S-Class, the W126, took over from the W116 in 1980, featuring a completely redesigned, more modern, aerodynamic exterior and an updated chassis. Aluminum-block engines lightened the car, and coupe models were introduced to the range at the middle of the car's cycle. In 1991, the W140 once again led the Mercedes design theme update, bringing an even fresher face and more aerodynamic shape. Some of the extensive features available include double-pane glass, self-closing trunk and doors, and rear-parking markers.</p>, <p>The W220's debut in 1999 marked a change in direction for the S-Class, shrinking in overall exterior size while offering more interior space than the W140. Unfortunately, despite—or perhaps because of—extensive safety, technology, and performance options, the W220 S-Class suffered from a poor reputation for reliability. Nonetheless, it marked the introduction of some of Mercedes-Benz's most innovative safety technology, including the debut of the PreSafe system, a collision avoidance and response system.</p>, <p>The W220 led directly to the W221, introduced in 2005, the fifth S-Class generation. New technology advances included night-vision cameras, the most advanced iteration of Mercedes collision avoidance systems, and, as of 2010, daytime LED running lights. A facelift included LED tail lights and restyled front and rear fascias. Reliability and quality were not been an issue with the W221 the way it was with the W220, with the S-Class winning numerous comparison tests against its competition from BMW and Audi. This generation of S-Class also spawned the Maybach cars, a revived lineup of ultra-luxury sedans that were sold in very limited numbers in the U.S. through the 2012 model year.</p>, <p>Six variants of the sixth-generation S-Class were available, including the S350 turbodiesel and the S400 Hybrid, both with six-cylinder engines; the S550 and the S63 AMG, both twin-turbo V-8s; and the S600 and S65 AMG, both turbocharged V-12s. The S350 BlueTEC made 240 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque, and offered standard all-wheel drive. The S400 Hybrid was the first production lithium-ion hybrid to go on sale in the world, further entrenching the S-Class's reputation for advanced technology. Its 3.5-liter V-6 engine and electric motor combined for a total output of 295 hp. A 7-speed automatic sent the power to the rear wheels.</p>, <p>The S550 sedan was available with all-wheel drive, and featured a 429-hp, 4.6-liter V-8 engine paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The S63 had a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 with 536 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque, with thrilling acceleration and all kinds of adaptive electronics for ride and steering. At the top of the range in price and prestige was the S600, powered by a 510-hp, 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V-12 engine that routed its power through a five-speed automatic transmission, and the S65 AMG, which got its power from a 625-hp, 6.0-liter twin-turbo V-12 engine that churned out a massive 738 lb-ft of torque via a 5-speed automatic. All of that power enabled the big sedan to rocket to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is a compact crossover that joined the range in 2016. It is the replacement for the GLK SUV, but with a curvier exterior.</p>, <p>The GLC-Class sits at the large end of the compact luxury SUV segment in the U.S. market. It faces a tough set of rivals including the Range Rover Discovery Sport, BMW X3, Volvo XC60, and Audi Q5, as well as the Lincoln MKC and upcoming Jaguar F-Pace.</p>, <p>For 2017, the GLC lineup expanded with the introduction of an AMG-tuned GLC43 that delivers more performance than the GLC300. For 2018, Mercedes added an even more powerful 503-hp GLC63 S.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_glc-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The former GLK had a design that was angular and squared-off, with an ample greenhouse, more chiseled corners and upright pillars. In contrast, the GLC makes an about-face in design, adopting a softer, sleeker, and more rounded look that echoes what’s seen in the latest GLE family (formerly the M-Class).</p>, <p>Inside, the GLC borrows some of the best elements of the C-Class design, including a clean, horizontally oriented dash design, flanked with round vents and a wide center console. Lavish detailing, including beveled metallic trims and plush, soft-touch elements add up to an interior ambiance above most of this segment.</p>, <p>The GLC lineup consists of the rear-wheel-drive GLC300 and all-wheel-drive GLC300 4Matic models, plus the Mercedes-AMG GLC43. Both of the 300s are powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-4 making 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. Shifts are handled by a 9-speed automatic transmission, with drive modes including Eco that allows extended coasting for enhanced fuel economy.</p>, <p>The GLC is nearly five inches longer in wheelbase than the GLK it succeeds, as well as slightly taller and wider. That extra length especially goes to back-seat leg room, but overall interior space is significantly improved. The cargo floor is both longer and wider than before, and the GLC offers easier loading thanks to the available air suspension.</p>, <p>Built on underpinnings derived from the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the GLC-Class sheds as much as 300 pounds in some forms thanks to novel construction that incorporates carbon fiber, aluminum, and high-strength steel. Safety is expected to be improved versus the GLK, and occupant safety is aided by new airbags plus a slew of active-safety systems, which can include automatic braking, active lane-keeping, and active blind-spot assist, among other features.</p>, <p>Infotainment systems follow Mercedes-Benz’s current strategy of standalone screens, with a combination of a touchpad and rotary controller. A head-up display is newly offered in the GLC, and high-end Burmester sound is available, with various other options that upgrade trims, materials, and the GLC’s general look.</p>, <p><span>The GLC-Class hit the U.S. market in fall of 2015 as a 2016 model. For 2017, Mercedes added a Coupe model to the lineup—essentially the same vehicle but with a sloped rear roofline and a lowered suspension, meant as a sporty Benz alternative to vehicles such as the BMW X4.</span></p>, <p><span>Also in the 2017 model year, Mercedes announced <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1102903_2017-mercedes-amg-glc43-revealed-before-new-york-auto-show">the GLC43 AMG</a>, a higher-performance version of the Coupe. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged V-6 with 362 hp, coupled to a 9-speed automatic and all-wheel drive.</span> Mercedes says the GLC43 can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds on its way to a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph. A higher output GLC63 is on the way for next year.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a line of sedans and coupes from the high-end German automaker. At one time the automaker's entry-level U.S. model, the C-Class has evolved to become more of an executive-luxury car—one that closely resembles a shrunken version of the brand's larger, flagship Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</p>, <p>Today's lineup of C-Class cars includes the C300, the AMG C43, and the AMG C63, which are offered in sedan, coupe, or convertible body styles. All-wheel drive is available on the C300, and a coupe model joined the lineup in the 2016 model year, while a convertible joined in 2017. A plug-in hybrid C350e arrived in the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_c-class_2019">2019 Mercedes-Benz C-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>With the C-Class, Mercedes-Benz has rivals for cars that include BMW's 3-and 4-Series cars, the Audi A4 and A5, and the Cadillac ATS coupe and sedan.</p>, <p>For 2018, C300 cars adopted a new 9-speed automatic transmission. In 2019, the C-Class gained a new base turbo-4, a more powerful version of its V-6, and more safety equipment.</p>, <p><strong>The new Mercedes-Benz C-Class</strong></p>, <p>The latest C-Class sedan sports a new architecture, excellent interior styling and features, and advanced safety equipment, all put together in a way that creates a very charming, very good luxury sedan.</p>, <p>Exterior styling on the C-Class is striking, a scaled-down homage to the S-Class without being a mimic. Inside, the cabin continues themes first shown on the big S-Class with large round vents, a flowing center console, and inlaid metallic-look panels that speak to a grade of luxury higher than the C has ever had.</p>, <p>Two C-Class models were offered for 2015, the C300 and the C400. Initially, both came standard with the Mercedes all-wheel-drive system, but the C300 added a rear-drive variant later in the model year. A 241-hp 2.0-liter turbo-4 powered the C300; the C400 got its power from a 329-hp twin-turbo V-6.</p>, <p>For the 2015 model year, Mercedes also added both the AMG C63 sedan, powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-8 engine, available in 469-hp or 503-hp trim.</p>, <p>In 2016, Mercedes replaced the C400 model with a new C450 AMG Sport, carrying a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 with 362 hp. An air suspension is standard on the C-Class, as is a 7-speed automatic transmission. Mercedes later dropped the "Sport" name from the sedan.</p>, <p>The cabin of the C-Class is larger than the previous generation, with more rear-seat leg room. The highlight, though, is the avant garde console that houses features like a Burmester sound system and a new touch-controlled infotainment system.</p>, <p>The federal government has given the C-Class excellent safety scores, including a five-star overall rating and the C-Class has myriad new safety systems, many bundled under an "Intelligent Drive" package. It includes adaptive cruise control and steering assist, a stereo-camera system that further aids lane-keeping and semi-autonomous functions, brake assist, active parking assist, and a 360-degree camera system.</p>, <p>Fuel-economy ratings are respectable, with the C300 posting 25 mpg city, 34 highway, 28 combined on the EPA cycle.</p>, <p>A plug-in hybrid version of the C-Class, dubbed C350e Plug-In Hybrid, is on the horizon. It combines a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with a hybridized 7-speed automatic transmission for total system output of 275 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. It can drive for 20 miles on electric power and should return impressive fuel economy. The system is related to that in the S550 Plug-In Hybrid and offers many of the same fuel-saving technologies and tricks.</p>, <p>In 2017, a convertible model joined the fray and mirrored the sedan and coupe in trim availability and powertrain configuration. The C450 AMG was renamed (again) to the Mercedes-AMG C43, and its 7-speed autobox was swapped out for a 9-speed unit.</p>, <p>In 2019 a new 2.0-liter turbo-4 arrived, with 255 hp, while the C43's twin-turbo V-6 cranked power up to 385 hp. The C-Class' adaptive safety systems gained more features including active lane-change assist and active blind-spot monitors with steering assist. An optional 10.3-inch display improved on the base 7.0-inch screen.</p>, <p>Since 2015, C-Class sedans are <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1067604_mercedes-benz-to-build-fifth-model-at-u-s-plant-from-2015">built in the company's plant in Vance, Alabama</a>, while coupes are manufactured in Germany.</p>, <p><strong>Mercedes-Benz C-Class history</strong></p>, <p>The C-Class luxury sedan replaced the former Mercedes 190E in American showrooms in the 1994 model year. The first generation of the C-Class was a conventional sedan with relatively safe styling and a range of economical four- and six-cylinder engines. Of course, there was also a V-8 engine used in a high-performance AMG variant, but few cars were imported to the U.S.</p>, <p>Mercedes launched its second-generation C-Class in 2000. The car's design went curvy, a daring departure from the boxy first attempt, but something more in lime with the brand's designs of the day. A year after the sedan, a C-Class SportCoupe (really a three-door hatchback) debuted. It didn't sell well, in part due to price and also because of its odd silhouette; it left the U.S. lineup in 2005. Mercedes created a follow-up hatch coupe called CLC, which was launched overseas for 2008.</p>, <p>The third generation of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class arrived on the market as a 2008 model, on a new platform, upmarket styling derived from the bigger S-Class and new levels of quality and refinement. Most notably, the 2008 Mercedes-Benz C-Class set two distinct styles, with separate Luxury and Sport models that catered to different types of C-Class buyers (Sport models were our favorites, as they have better performance, and ride quality doesn't suffer).</p>, <p>No major changes were implemented from then through 2011, with recent model years offering the choice of two V-6 engines—a 228-hp, 3.0-liter unit and a 268-hp, 3.5-liter engine, as well as a 451-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 in the high-performance AMG C 63 model. </p>, <p>The 2012 model year marked a significant change for the C-Class. In addition to a light facelift inside and out, a new C250 model was introduced, with a fuel-efficient turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine under the hood. The C300 continued with 228 hp, while C350 models gained a new 302-hp, 3.5-liter 60-degree V-6. Also, a new Coupe model joined the range, as did the brilliant C63 AMG Coupe, with its 457-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and 186-mph top speed.</p>, <p>For the 2013 and 2014 model years, few changes were made, although Mercedes-Benz packed in a new telematics system, with emergency assistance, destination planning, a smartphone app, a suite of in-car apps, and new controls for teen drivers or valet parking. For the final 2014 model year of the sedan, Mercedes offered a limited-edition run of the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082054_mercedes-benz-launches-more-powerful-c63-amg-edition-507">C63 AMG dubbed the Edition 507</a>.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mercedes-benz_cla-class
[<p>The Mercedes-Benz CLA compact sedan is the German automaker's first front-wheel-drive offering in the U.S. and is derived from the A-Class hatchback offered in other markets. The CLA-Class borrows its coupe-like body style from the larger CLS sedan, the vehicle that popularized the "four-door coupe" niche.</p>, <p>Competing on size alone, the CLA-Class is on par with the Acura ILX and Audi A3. With the cachet of the Mercedes-Benz name and an options list that can drive the CLA's price well past its $30,000 entry price, it quickly outclasses all those.</p>, <p>In the CLA, Mercedes-Benz has its least expensive model in the U.S. Buyers can choose from the sporty CLA45 AMG, the base CLA 250 sedan and the GLA SUV which uses the same architecture and powertrains as the CLA. All-wheel drive comes standard on the AMG but is optional on the CLA 250.</p>, <p>For 2018, not much has changed on the CLA-Class beyond a few new package options to help bring buyers into the Mercedes-Benz fold.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_cla-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class review</a><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class gets some modest cosmetic upgrades inside and out, including new bumpers and a revised front-end look, Other improvements for 2017 include new seat covers, new chrome-plated controls, and new trim pieces; and the instrument cluster gauges have a new look, with red needles. Some of the new trims include a “sail-look finish,” as well as matte black ash wood and black Dinamica microfiber.</p>, <p>For 2016, there were a handful of feature and option changes to the standard CLA 250, but the performance CLA45 AMG gets a power boost. It now produces 375 horsepower (up 20 hp) and 350 pound-feet of torque (up 18 lb-ft). The added power rockets the littlest AMG sedan to 60 mph in a startlingly low 4.1 seconds.</p>, <p>In looks, Mercedes-Benz has scaled down the stunning shape of the larger CLS sport sedan in hopes of luring a new generation of younger customers interested in a sporty, entry-level compact. The CLA may be similar in length to a Verano or even a Honda Civic, but visually it's a dead ringer for the CLS. Frameless windows and a distinctive profile that claims one of the most aerodynamically efficient bodies in the auto world set it apart from any other compact. The cockpit is patterned after those in Mercedes' sporty cars, with round vents punctuating the dash, and a low cowl interrupted only by an LCD screen plunked in its midst.</p>, <p>Compact dimensions mean the CLA is in a vast class of cars that ranges from the Ford Focus to the Honda Civic, or to more upscale machinery like the BMW 1-Series, Acura ILX, Audi A3, and Buick Verano. It's 182.3 inches long, with a wheelbase of 106.3 inches. As with most of those cars, backseat room is tight, with minimal head room for medium-sized adults and somewhat difficult entry and exit in through the rear doors. Trunk space is good, with a flat load floor, and the CLA has a few useful storage bins in the cabin for small items.</p>, <p>The CLA 250 is an efficient performer, utilizing a 2.0-liter turbo-4. It's good for 208 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque in the CLA 250, allowing a 0-to-60-mph time of 6.7 seconds; top speed is capped at 149 mph. As is the case in most modern Mercedes, only one transmission is offered, and it's an automatic. Unlike most current Benz products, however, it's a dual-clutch unit with seven speeds. Shifting is accomplished by a column-mounted stalk, leaving more room on the center console. The CLA 250 can be optioned with all-wheel drive, which in this case has a variable torque split with the ability to send half of the available twist to the rear wheels when necessary.</p>, <p>In the name of efficiency, the CLA employs electric power steering and an engine stop/start system. With help from a very low coefficient of drag, the front-wheel-drive CLA 250 returns a 30-mpg combined number in EPA testing; the all-wheel-drive and CLA AMG versions drop to 27 mpg combined.</p>, <p>That sporty feel in the U.S. version is due in part to a standard sport-suspension setup, which is lower and less compliant than the comfort setup offered in other markets. Front struts and a four-link independent rear suspension (isolated by a subcradle) are paired with 17-inch run-flat tires in base versions. Most U.S. vehicles come with 18-inch AMG-style alloy wheels and summer tires, as well as slotted front brake discs. Handling is responsive, and ride quality is very firm, far more so than with the Verano, A3, or ILX.</p>, <p>Among its standard safety features, the CLA boasts a new automatic braking function that uses radar and the CLA can alert the driver of upcoming obstacles when it's traveling at more than 4 mph and can calculate the amount of brake force needed to avoid an impact. Mercedes-Benz made a rearview camera system standard for 2017. Also standard are fatigue alerts and its coffee-cup reminder to pull over and avoid drowsy driving, and a driver knee airbag. Safety options include adaptive cruise control; blind-spot monitors; lane-keeping assistance; and parking sensors with parking assist.</p>, <p>On the infotainment side, the CLA comes with standard Bluetooth, cruise control, a power driver seat, and vinyl upholstery. It also sports the latest smartphone connectivity functions via Mercedes-Benz's latest infotainment system, all displayed on a 5.8-inch screen, with basic navigation functions available. An intermediate Becker navigation system is offered, while the most elaborate, and optional, infotainment system offers a 7.0-inch screen and Mercedes-dubbed COMAND system, which controls the multimedia package's navigation system, DVD changer, 10GB music drive, or SD card (as well as phone services) with voice commands.</p>, <p>A Premium package bundles an iPod interface with satellite radio, surround sound, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, and a garage door opener. A panoramic sunroof is a stand-alone option, as are leather seats, summer tires, parking assist, blind-spot monitors, and heated front seats.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082689_2014-mercedes-benz-cla45-amg-coming-this-november-stats-info">Mercedes-Benz CLA 45 AMG is a much different car</a>—an exciting performer with 375 hp and standard all-wheel drive, which combine for a 0-60 mph time of 4.6 seconds. In its first year on sale, it was named <em>Motor Authority</em>'s Best Car To Buy 2014. It is much more rare on roads than the CLA 250, as is the case with most AMG-fettled Mercedes models.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mercedes-benz_gla-class
[<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class is a compact hatchback that blends in some elements of crossovers and SUVs, including more ride height and available all-wheel drive. A relative of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mercedes-benz_cla-class">CLA-Class</a>, the GLA-Class is also based on the A-Class hatch that's not available to buyers in the U.S. </p>, <p>With the GLA-Class, Mercedes trades the CLA's sexy sedan body for a hatchback/wagon shape, creating a pint-size rival for vehicles such as the BMW X1, Buick Encore, and Audi Q3.</p>, <p>For 2018, its fourth model year, the GLA gets cosmetic changes inside and out, a new surround-view camera system, a hands-free tailgate, and a special edition option for the GLA45 AMG.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_gla-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>While Mercedes has renaming most of its crossover and SUV lineup to better align with its sedan offerings, the GLA escaped this fate as it was already named for the A-Class models to which it's related. The rest of the crossovers now have a name beginning with GL and ending in the letter of the closest size sedan, creating the GLC, GLE, and GLS in place of GLK, ML, and GL. The G-Class keeps its one-letter prefix, however.</p>, <p>Rather than simply scale down the proportions of its larger utility vehicles, Mercedes-Benz wisely chose new ones, which resulted in an exterior profile that looks part sporty hatchback, part rugged crossover, part tall wagon. Dramatically sculpted side sheet metal gives the look some punch; so do the rakish nose, upright front end, and wide-set taillights, which are now LEDs. Meanwhile some rugged details in the lower body, like a prominent front skid-plate area and sill extensions help signal that this vehicle has some toughness to go with its sportiness.</p>, <p>
The GLA arrived in the U.S. for the 2015 model year as the GLA 250, with a 2.0-liter turbo-4 making 208 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. With the help of a 7-speed dual-clutch automated gearbox, the GLA 250 is able to sprint to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds, and up to a speed of 130 mph. The suspension has a multi-link setup in back and MacPherson struts in front, and the steering is electromechanical. The GLA 250 made its debut in all-wheel drive form—dubbed 4Matic—but a front-wheel-drive GLA 250 is also available.</p>, <p>AMG offers its own version of the little crossover, the GLA 45. It uses the same turbocharged 2.0-liter that is found in the CLA 45 AMG, and comes with standard all-wheel drive. In 2016, the power climbed from 355 hp to 375 hp. (Fun fact: The busy little mill inside the GLA 45 and CLA 45 holds the title of highest specific output from any production engine at 187.5 hp per liter.) AMG's GLA 45 carries upgraded suspension, brakes, wheels, and tires, along with its own styling elements to differentiate it from the standard-issue crossover.</p>, <p>
Inside, the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class offers seating for five, although the back seat is relatively tight, even within its class. Cargo space in the GLA is ample, however, it has a low, flat floor. In front, the GLA follows some of the design direction of recent Mercedes-Benz models, with a shelf-like instrument panel, complemented by round details and dramatic circular vents, as well as plenty of brightwork. Upper and lower dash areas have different materials, with some of the best, eye-catching wood and semi-metallic trims saved for the upper area.</p>, <p>
You'll find the latest Mercedes telematics system in the GLA-Class, as well as the automaker's infotainment interface. It uses a tablet-like screen that hovers above the instrument panel in a way that doesn't disrupt the design, but should be right in the driver's line of sight.</p>, <p>Safety technology is plentiful, including drowsy-driver detection, blind-spot monitoring and lane keep assist, a new 360 degree camera, and a crash prevention system that can brake the vehicle autonomously at up to 124 mph to reduce crash severity. The GLA has not yet been put through safety evaluations by the NHTSA or the IIHS.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, Mercedes changed the dashboard center screen from 5.8 to 8.0 inches.</p>, <p>The changes for 2018 amount to a mid-cycle refresh. The exterior changes affect not only the looks but also the aerodynamics, and optional bi-xenon headlights are replaced by LED headlights. LED taillights are added, too. Notable new features include a hands-free tailgate that can be opened with the swing of a foot and the surround-view camera system. The GLA45 adds a new AMG Performance Studio package, which is known as the Yellow Night Edition in other markets. It features black and gray paint, with yellow trim inside and out.</p>]

[<p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_gle-class_2016">Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class</a> is a family of luxury mid-size SUVs with admirable on-road manners that can still take on the trails. As such, it competes handily with the Porsche Cayenne, BMW X5 and X6 and the Range Rover Sport. Powertrain options on both the GLE and coupe styles include gasoline and plug-in hybrid options. A diesel version was initially available, although it was dropped for 2017.</p>, <p>GLE-Class vehicles are offered in standard, SUV-style GLE and "coupe" body styles. Mercedes claims both can fit five passengers. (It's debatable if an SUV can really be called a coupe, in our book.)</p>, <p>Like the M-Class before it, the GLE-Class for U.S. customers is assembled in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_gle-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The GLE-Class family contains two different vehicles. One is a refreshed, mid-cycle revamp of what has since 1998 been called the Mercedes-Benz M-Class, or ML.</p>, <p>The name change is the first of an across-the-board nomenclature revamp at Mercedes-Benz, in which utility vehicles will all get names that begin with "GL" and end with the letter of the sedan that's closest in size. So the M-Class becomes the GLE-Class, as it is sized most similarly to the E-Class family. The exception is the G-Class, which will keep its one-letter prefix.</p>, <p>The other model in the GLE lineup is a new GLE Coupe model that mates proven M-Class underpinnings with a more rakish, coupe-like roofline—one that will be a direct rival to the BMW X6. The GLE Coupe is a coupe in the same way that the CLS sedan is a coupe; it keeps four doors but has a different roofline to give it a coupe-like air.</p>, <p>The GLE coupe gives up some cargo space and utility in favor of that sexier look, although Mercedes-Benz says that the GLE Coupe has room for five adults.</p>, <p>The entire GLE-Class lineup wears a new front-end look—one that's a little sportier than the current M-Class's and a little more in line with the look of the smaller GLA-Class. AMG models get more aggressive front-end styling plus larger wheels and metal side steps.</p>, <p>Mercedes announced two variants of the new coupe-like crossover at launch: the GLE450 AMG 4Matic, which was one of the first AMG Sport models that straddle the Mercedes-Benz and AMG lineups; and a full-on AMG variant of the Coupe, the Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S Coupe 4Matic. The 450 is powered by a 362-horsepower twin-turbo V-6, while the GLE63 gets the AMG twin-turbo V-8, which makes 577 hp.</p>, <p>Powertrains for the standard-silhouette GLE included diesel, gas, and a new plug-in electric version at first. The base engine was and continues to be found in the <span>GLE 350. It features Benz's naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6. It continues to produce 302 hp and 273 lb-ft.</span></p>, <p><span>The GLE 550e plug-in hybrid uses the same twin-turbo V-6, but adds a 114-hp electric motor for total system output of 436 hp. The plug-in model can travel up to 18.6 miles on electricity alone.</span></p>, <p>The <span>GLE 300d was powered by a 201-hp, a 2.1-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel that makes a stout 369 lb-ft of torque. The GLE 400 offered more power as well as greater efficiency as compared to the 350 motor; its twin-turbocharged V-6 developed 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque.</span></p>, <p><span><span>For 2017, the diesel and GLE400 powertrains were dropped. The previously named GLE450 AMG was renamed as the Mercedes-AMG GLE43, in line with the rest of the models to carry that engine.</span></span></p>, <p><span>Above those models is the top GLE performer, the GLE63 It sports a twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8 and is sold as the 550-hp GLE 63 or the 577-hp GLE 63 S model.</span></p>, <p>Capability for all-weather and trail conditions is renewed, with mainstream models getting an all-wheel-drive system that splits torque 50/50 between the front and rear axles, or nearly all torque to the wheels that can use it best for traction. AMG models have a different, rear-biased setup. An air suspension with continuous damping is offered in upper models of the GLE-Class—as is a set of safety and infotainment features carried over from the latest refreshes of the C-Class, E-Class, and S-Class sedan families.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mercedes-benz_amg-gt
[<p>The Mercedes-Benz AMG GT—shortened to Mercedes-AMG GT by the automaker—is a two-door, high-performance luxury coupe and convertible range that succeeded the SLS AMG as the automaker's halo car.</p>, <p>However, Mercedes doesn't consider it a direct successor. Though the GT uses some of the SLS's structure, it is shorter overall, drops that model's gullwing doors, and costs less. </p>, <p>The AMG GT is the second car built by the AMG brand on its own without a Mercedes-Benz production car as its basis and it's gunning straight at the Porsche 911.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT adds to its roster a more powerful GT C coupe and the blisteringly fast GT R.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_amg-gt_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The first AMG GT models arrived in 2015 for the 2016 model year. With similar proportions to the SLS, the AMG GT comes off as prettier, and one of the most attractive Mercedes designs in a long time. The interior adopts an aviation-influenced concept, with just enough buttons on the center console to control all of the car's mechanical systems—no need to dig through pages of menus, which is much appreciated in the heat of the moment.</p>, <p>Under its hood, the AMG GT offers a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine in two states of tune, one for each of a pair of variants of the car: the AMG GT and AMG GT S. The GT is the entry point to the range, offering 456 horsepower and 443 pound-feet of torque. The car can dash from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds and hit an electronically limited top speed of 189 mph. The more potent GT S is rated at 503 hp and 479 lb-ft, reducing the 0-to-60-mph sprint to 3.7 seconds and with an electronically limited top speed of 193 mph. Both versions of the car use the same 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox, which is carried over from the SLS AMG. The GT S was offered in the first year of production, including a special Launch series, with the GT added for subsequent model years.</p>, <p>
The AMG GT offers a unique engine configuration—one it claims to be a world first in a sports car: the combination of dry-sump lubrication with a “hot vee” turbocharger layout. The dry-sump lubrication system means the AMG GT dispenses with the bulky oil pan below the engine, instead relying on a remote reservoir and pump, allowing for lower mounting and a correspondingly lower center of gravity for the car. The “hot vee” layout means the AMG GT’s intake and exhaust manifolds flow in the reverse direction of a typical engine, allowing for the turbochargers to be placed in the engine's valley, which creates a more compact and thermodynamically efficient package of the whole unit.</p>, <p>
Built of aluminum, the AMG GT promises to be especially light; the space frame itself weighs just 509 pounds. AMG was able to shed mass compared to the SLS by using conventional doors instead of the gullwings of the prior model, which required extra strengthening. This also allowed the designers to pen a curved roof rather than the flat top needed for the gullwings to work. The shorter overall length also contributed to the weight reduction.</p>, <p>
In addition to the high-performance hardware, the AMG GT offers some interesting performance-enhancing electronics. The drive-select system offers C, S, and S+ modes for progressively sportier responses, affecting the shift characteristics, throttle response, and dynamic adaptive dampers; the GT S model offers an additional RACE mode to better suit track use. An available set of active powertrain mounts stiffens the connection between engine and transaxle and body when necessary to help transfer loads at just the right time, and can do so independently at each point for properly timed reactions to body movements. The AMG GT can also factor in lateral acceleration load (cornering force) to help adjust the amount of power sent to the rear wheels when the driver applies the throttle. This system is meant to improve both cornering stability and corner-exit traction.</p>, <p>

For 2017, the lineup includes the AMG GT S and base GT. Both have the same 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8, but the base GT makes 456 hp (versus 503) and 443 lb-ft of torque (versus 479). A 7-speed dual-clutch AMG SpeedShift gearbox also comes standard, but the base GT does without the GT S model's AMG Adaptive suspension, AMG Adaptive exhaust, and "Race" mode for its Dynamic Select system.</p>, <p>For 2018, the AMG GT lineup grew to include a GT roadster, a GT C roadster, and the GT R. The Roadsters share most of the specs of the GT and GT S coupes; the GT R gets a litany of changes, from active rear steering to exotic Michelin tires to a high-output version of the twin-turbo V-8.

[<p>Although it might look at first glance like a minivan, the Mercedes-Benz Metris is an exceptionally well-packaged vehicle aimed at commercial users looking for more space than they'll find in a compact van with better maneuverability than a big hauler like a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. </p>, <p>The Metris has its roots in the European-market Mercedes V-Class, but a number of features and trim configurations have been revised for consumers in North America.</p>, <p>With the Metris, Mercedes-Benz has a relatively versatile package configurable in myriad ways—from overlander to urban runner.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_metris_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz Metris review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Only one engine and transmission combination is offered on the Metris, but it's well-suited to the van's intended use. It's a turbo-4 rated at 208 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, and it sends power to the rear wheels via a 7-speed automatic; a powertrain that's shared with several Mercedes passenger cars globally. That combination makes the Metris surprisingly entertaining to drive, even though it has clearly been set up with cargo and passenger hauling in mind rather than carving through a winding canyon road. </p>, <p>The Metris is available as either a cargo van with an unfinished area behind the front seats and no side windows, or as a passenger van with seating for up to eight in three rows. All models ride on the same 126-inch wheelbase and their bodies stretch to just over 202 inches. That puts them right between the big Sprinter and smaller models like Nissan NV200. For many users, the Metris' combination of more usable interior room than small vans and its superior in-town maneuverability may make it the "sweet spot" among commercial vehicles. </p>, <p>The van's body offers a choice of liftgate or barn-style rear doors, as well as sliding doors on both sides of the body. On the passenger model, those sliding doors can be power-operated.</p>, <p>As it shares its platform with a model that can be outfitted as a decidedly upscale executive-oriented vehicle overseas, the Metris may surprise some commercial buyers with its comfortable and well-outfitted interior. Materials and features are definitely several steps down from what you'll find in a Mercedes E-Class sedan, but the Metris is sturdy and can be optioned up with some nice comfort and convenience features. Notable options include heated seats, navigation, and a system that can automatically parallel park the Metris.</p>, <p>On the safety front, the Metris offers far more features than its rivals. The passenger model includes eight airbags and all variants can be ordered with automatic emergency braking designed to mitigate or avoid a frontal collision. </p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a full-size luxury sport-utility vehicle, with three rows of seating and space for up to seven. It was a new nameplate introduced for the 2017 model year, but this big SUV is conceptually a continuation of the GL-Class model line.</p>, <p>As part of a comprehensive nomenclature change, affecting nearly every model in the Mercedes-Benz lineup other than its core sedans (the C-Class, E-Class, and S-Class), the brand’s SUVs are being renamed according to their respective size—GLC, GLE, and GLS—with the GLS taking a clearer position as the brand’s SUV flagship.</p>, <p>With the GLS-Class, Mercedes-Benz has a rival for big luxury SUVs including the Lincoln Navigator, Audi Q7, and upcoming BMW X7.</p>, <p>For the 2018 model year, it carries over with no changes.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_gls-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The GLS is a very large vehicle—more than 200 inches long, with a wheelbase of 121 inches—and isn’t all that maneuverable. But with seven-place seating—all spacious enough for adults—and towing capability up to 7,500 pounds, the GLS covers some of the same bases as vehicles like the Cadillac Escalade, Lincoln Navigator, and Lexus LX 570, yet with a little more finesse.</p>, <p>As part of the translation from GL to GLS, the lineup got a mid-cycle refresh, with front-end styling that puts it more in line with other recent model introductions. The grille is a bit larger and more upright, with larger air intakes in front, plus a more swept-back lower fascia and sculpted fenders. Inside, the GLS inherits the standalone infotainment systems that have propagated throughout most of the Mercedes-Benz lineup by now—only here without the latest details like the round vents and showy bezels.</p>, <p>The GLS model line includes the twin-turbo V-6 GLS450 4Matic, the twin-turbo V-8 GLS550 4Matic, and the top-performance 577-horsepower AMG GLS63.</p>, <p>Nine-speed automatic transmissions have been introduced across the model line, while the adaptive air suspension that’s available has become just a bit more oriented toward on-the-road performance—although there’s still a serious off-road package that brings far more ground clearance and capability.</p>, <p>Interior accommodations for the GLS-Class are entirely luxury-caliber. Upholsteries and trims were revisited and upgraded for 2017, and all three rows of seating can fit adults easily—although the third row is a little more difficult to get into and out of.</p>, <p>The GLS has a great reputation for safety, and while there aren’t any U.S. crash-test results to go by, it does include a rearview camera, seat belt pre-tensioners, Attention Assist to help warn you if you’re drowsy, and a full suite of airbags and stability controls.</p>, <p>Options include blind-spot monitors; active lane control that steers to keep you in your lane (hands on the wheel, though); and forward-collision alerts with automatic braking. A heated adaptive windshield wiper system should help visibility in winter weather, too.</p>, <p>The company has hinted that it may add a Mercedes-Maybach version of the GLS-Class, but such a model hasn’t yet been announced. Unlike the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, whose wheelbase was extended beyond that of the longest S-Class, a GLS in Maybach trim would likely have the same dimensions—but considerably more luxury to let it compete with the ultra-luxe Range Rover SV Autobiography series.</p>, <p>The GLS, like the GL it succeeds, is built in Alabama.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class is a luxury two-door with an admirable pedigree. It's currently sold only as a roadster with a power-retractable metal hardtop. In one form or another, though, the SL has served as the brand's boulevard cruiser—and more—for a half-century.</p>, <p>The SL-Class was redesigned in 2017 with a revamped, clean look that includes new LED headlights, a reshaped twin-powerdome hood, and a somewhat more upright grille, its face is a little more brawny. And inside, it gains a larger infotainment screen, with the addition of Apple CarPlay compatibility.</p>, <p>With the SL-Class, Mercedes-Benz has few rivals. It competes against the BMW 6-Series (and upcoming 8-Series), Chevrolet Corvette, and Porsche 911.</p>, <p>For 2018, the roadsters were unchanged.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1112012_2018-mercedes-benz-sl-class">2018 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>Today's SL-Class</strong></p>, <p>The latest generation SL <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075658_2013-mercedes-benz-sl-class-official-walkaround-video">made its debut</a> at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as a 2013 model. Its new styling brought a more buff front end, while the rear end adopted the tapered taillights of the SLS supercar. A new twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 took over for the old normally aspirated V-8 <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1070628_2013-mercedes-benz-sl550-preview-2012-detroit-auto-show">in the SL 550</a>. It was originally rated at 429 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque, but horsepower eventually was pushed to 449 hp. As such, it was capable of a 0-60 mph run in the mid-4-second range.</p>, <p>The SL 550 was joined in this generation by <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075762_2013-mercedes-benz-sl-63-amg-first-drive">the high-performance SL63 AMG</a> and <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1074433_2013-mercedes-benz-sl65-amg-teased-in-new-trailer-video">SL65 AMG roadsters</a>. The $147,000 SL63 AMG gets a brawny 530-hp, twin-turbo AMG-built V-8 and its own suspension tuning and performance equipment, while the SL65 AMG sports a twin-turbo V-12 engine good for a massive 621 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque. Most SL models come with a hydraulic suspension system that makes the SL corner nearly flat like a smaller, lighter car, while not flustering occupants.</p>, <p>Most people buy an SL to be comfortable, and this roadster doesn't disappoint. The auto-dimming roof is optional, allowing occupants to choose between clear glass above when the top is up or an opaque filter to block out heat and light. The Airscarf neck-warming vents are again available, making cool-weather top-down driving supremely comfortable with warm air vents placed behind the necks of driver and passenger. A decent standard Harman Kardon audio setup can be replaced by a Bang &amp; Olufsen system that includes an ingeniously packaged subwoofer in the passenger footwell. The Mercedes infotainment interface is standard, controlling the infotainment setup through a console-mounted knob and a 7.0-inch display. The system also offers navigation with Google search capability.</p>, <p>A new "entry-level" model joined the SL lineup for 2015 and marked the end to a long absence of 6-cylinder power in the model's U.S. range. This twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 was offered in the SL 400, where it produced 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque, sent to the rear wheels through a 7-speed automatic like in other SLs. The SL65 AMG also switched to a 7-speed automatic for 2015.</p>, <p>For 2016, all SL 550 models gained 20 hp for a total of 449 hp. Mercedes also offered a limited run of 400 Mille Miglia Edition SL 550s with special paint, upholstery, and trim pieces.</p>, <p>For power, the 2017 SL range adopted new non-AMG engines and transmissions, again offering a wide variety of choices for discerning buyers. The lineup starts with the SL450, with a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 362 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. Above it, the SL550 offers a twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8, now upgraded to 449 hp and 516 lb-ft. Both are teamed to a new 9-speed automatic. AMG models carry over with their existing—and powerful—drivetrains.</p>, <p><strong>Mercedes-Benz SL history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class can trace its lineage all the way back to the 1950s 300SL, which began with the original Gullwing and was later offered as a roadster. Through the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, the SL stayed roughly the same size but became heavier and more luxurious, with progressively larger and more powerful engines.</p>, <p>In the mid-1990s, Mercedes-Benz's nomenclature changed, with the old 320SL and 600SL becoming the SL320 and SL600. The former had a 3.2-liter inline-6, while the SL600 came with a 389-hp, 6.0-liter V-12, the first to grace an SL. This generation also saw the start of AMG tuning of the SL, with very limited runs of the V-12-powered SL70 and SL73 as well as the SL55 and SL60, which used V-8 power.</p>, <p>For 2003, the SL-Class was completely redesigned for the first time since 1990, and though it again maintained roughly the same exterior size, it had an edgier, sportier feel to go with its extensive luxury feature set. Most noteworthy was its new retractable hardtop, an evolution of the roof design in the compact SLK-Class roadster.</p>, <p>Starting in 2003, the lineup included the 302-hp SL500, the 493-hp SL55 AMG, and the 493-hp SL600. In 2007, the lineup was changed to the 382-hp SL550, 518-hp SL63 AMG, 510-hp SL600, and 604-hp SL65 AMG. These models were confident touring machines when covering distance, and tenacious handlers on a curvy road. With excellent seats and great suspension tuning, the SL had become an ideal pick for those—even taller drivers—who wanted a sports car capable of covering 500 miles a day or more in absolute comfort.</p>, <p>Mercedes gave the SL a visual update for 2009, which coincided with changes to the interior and some of the equipment. There was new styling for the previously cheap-looking instrument panel, and the steering wheel was replaced with a new version that used the same design as other new Mercedes models. Mercedes offered an SL AMG Black Series model for 2010, with an uprated V-12 engine, a fixed roof, and a $300,000 price tag. In the 2012 model year, the SL lineup was reduced to a pair of V-8 models: the SL 550 and SL 63 AMG.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mercedes-benz_g-class
[<p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a time machine of an SUV, even though it was redesigned for the 2019 model year. Developed as a military-grade off-road specialty vehicle, it's since had layers of luxury applied to its hardcore hardware. The latest G-Wagen stays true to its heritage, but is roomier and more luxurious than ever.</p>, <p>The G-Class hasn’t changed much outwardly over the years, though mechanically it's been continually upgraded with modern running gear. With the G-Wagen, Mercedes has a cult favorite that appeals to off-road enthusiasts and socialites equally.</p>, <p>A new G-Wagen bowed for the 2019 model year, the SUV's first clean-sheet redesign in four decades.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our preview of the <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_g-class_2019">2019 Mercedes-Benz G-Class</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Deriving its name from Geländewagen, literally German for "off road vehicle," the G-Class is truly unlike anything else on the road. </p>, <p>An all-new model arrived for 2019, sharing little more than an engine and door latches with its predecessor. The redesign retains the boxy, upright styling—so much so that casual observers might not notice the cleaner, but hardly more streamlined shape. Inside, the 6-inch wheelbase stretch pays dividends in rear-seat leg room and the G-Wagen boasts more shoulder room. The view out remains expansive, albeit with a dashboard and instrument cluster from the modern era. Switchgear and even the available dual 12.3-inch displays that share a single glass pane are pulled from Mercedes' high-end sedans.</p>, <p>Under its hood, the G550 that debuted first features a familiar 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 rated at 416 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque. Mercedes says that while the engine is unchanged, a new 9-speed automatic takes the place of the outgoing model’s 7-speed.</p>, <p>That 9-speed pays dividends both on-road and off, with fuel economy improved over the dismal figures from its predecessor and the wider range of ratios to enable slower going off-road. The G-Class discards its old solid front axle for an independent suspension, which Mercedes says will help on-road handling. Off-road, the G-Class doesn't offer the wide range of traction control modes seen in Land Rovers and Toyotas, instead relying on a trio of differential locks.</p>, <p><strong>Mercedes-Benz G-Class history</strong></p>, <p>The G-Class originally was developed by Mercedes-Benz for the Shah of Iran and military use, but was introduced for civilian buyers in 1979, after the Shah was deposed.</p>, <p>Hand-assembled in Austria, the so-called G-Wagen fit the part of basic off-roader at first, with a modest lineup of gasoline and diesel engines and three body styles—two- or four-door hardtop, or two-door softtop. Although it wasn't officially sold in the U.S., a number of G-Wagens were imported as a gray-market product and sold to the wealthy as a status symbol in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s, a V-8 version had been introduced, as well as a power-convertible version, and interior appointments became more luxurious.</p>, <p>Mercedes finally began importing the G-Class to the U.S. for the 2002 model year. It was initially offered here only as the V-8-powered, 292-hp G500; the AMG-tuned G55 followed a year later with 349 hp and later received a power upgrade to 476 hp thanks to a supercharged V-8. For 2012, Mercedes offered a 382-hp, 5.5-liter V-8 in the G550 and a 500-hp version in the G55 AMG. Fuel economy has never been a strong point for the G-Wagen, dipping down as low as 11 mpg city, 13 highway for the thirstier AMG model.</p>, <p>The G-Class has been changed very little in the time it has been on sale here, but an updated version arrived to the U.S. market for the 2013 model year. At that time, the 388-hp G550 was joined by a revamped AMG model, the G63, outfitted with a new twin-turbo, 5.5-liter V-8 with 544 hp, a stop-start system, and a 7-speed automatic. Most other hardware was carried over, but American versions got new round dials in the instrument cluster, a fixed LCD screen mounted on top of the dash for display of the navigation system, and the latest version of Mercedes' infotainment controller, which also operates an app and connectivity suite.</p>, <p>Mercedes-Benz recently ended limited production of a special 6x6 (<a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082928_2013-mercedes-benz-g63-amg-6x6-mega-gallery">six-wheeled, six-wheel-drive</a>) version of the G-Class outfitted with a small pickup bed in the back. About 100 were built and cost more than $500,000 each. At the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Mercedes also unveiled a 4x4 version with the same enhanced off-roading equipment—including high-clearance portal axles and modified suspension with remote-reservoir shocks—but in the normal G-Class. It is called the G500 4x4², and it is currently available overseas. This model's shorter length compared to the 6x6 certainly makes it more maneuverable off-road, not to mention friendlier to city streets and garages, assuming it isn't too tall to clear the entrance. Its high-clearance axles let it roll over just about anything on its 18-inch beadlock wheels wrapped in aggressive off-road rubber.</p>, <p><strong>The classic Mercedes-Benz G-Class</strong></p>, <p>The G-Class' engines changed for 2016. The base G550 swaps out its naturally aspirated 388-horsepower 5.5-liter V-8 for a 416-hp twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8. The G63 AMG's twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8 gets a bump in horsepower from 544 hp to 563 hp, and Mercedes also introduced the V-12-powered G65 AMG, now with 621 hp and massive 738 pound-feet of torque. Other 2016 changes for the Geländewagen included new bumpers, adjustable shocks for the G550, a new gauge design, and an expanded color palette.</p>, <p>A boxy, tall, flat-sided SUV, the G-Class is unique in its design and its longevity, with only the Jeep Wrangler lending the same off-road-centric, retro feel. Those who want the same kind of old-school manners would have to otherwise consider a used Land Rover Defender or ancient Toyota Land Cruiser, now that the entire HUMMER brand has been consigned to history's junkyard and Toyota has discontinued the FJ Cruiser.</p>, <p>Driving the G-Wagen is unlike piloting any newer vehicle. The belt line is rather low, and passengers are surrounded by tall glass windows, with a good view ahead over the hood. There’s barely seating for five, entry/exit is challenging, and the seats are somewhat flat with short bottom cushions. Although today's G-Wagen has plenty of power on tap, the big 'ute feels top-heavy and cumbersome and won’t respond kindly to quick changes of direction. There’s also considerably more road noise than anything else in the Mercedes-Benz stable, though upholstery and trim are top-notch, with heated-and-cooled seats, a heated-steering wheel, and a leather-padded dash.</p>, <p>A few times in the past the G-Class has been nearly axed from the lineup, with Mercedes-Benz unsure whether it should continue to engineer and develop future models, given such niche appeal. However, its future seems safe for now.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a tall-roof commercial van available in a wide array of body styles. There's a Sprinter for just about every conceivable need. </p>, <p>Like many other vans including the Sprinter, Mercedes-Benz offers the passenger van finished inside, with two to four rows of seating for up to 12 passengers.</p>, <p>A new Sprinter van made its debut in early 2018. The van's proportions and utility don't change, but the powertrain will. Alongside a diesel-powered Sprinter, a gasoline engine will be available in the U.S. An electrified version is reportedly in the works as well.</p>, <p>The new Sprinter should go on sale in the U.S. in fall 2018.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115337_2018-mercedes-benz-sprinter">2018 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Mercedes-Benz Sprinter</strong></p>, <p>The new Mercedes-Benz Sprinter made its debut in February 2018.</p>, <p>The big cargo van is nearly indistinguishable from the van it replaced, except under the hood. Mercedes-Benz didn't specifically outline the powertrain configuration that will make it to the U.S., however it's clear that the automaker will bring a gas-powered version to the U.S. Previously, a 3.0-liter V-6 turbodiesel and 2.1-liter inline-4 turbodiesel powered the van in the U.S. A 7-speed automatic will be fitted to diesel-powered vans, the gas version may receive a 9-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Upfitters and overlanders may appreciate the all-wheel-drive system fitted to the new Sprinter. The Sprinter in the U.S. will be standard with rear-wheel drive, however a front-wheel-drive version will be sold outside the U.S.</p>, <p>Like the vans before it, the Sprinter will be available in myriad configurations and three different wheelbases. Cargo and passenger configurations will be available in a range of sizes.</p>, <p>The new Sprinter largely turns toward tech with an available 10.25-inch touchscreen, fleet telematics system, and connected apps that virtually connect the van wherever it may roam.</p>, <p><strong>Sprinter history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The Sprinter nameplate has been around for more than two decades. It launched in Europe and has since made waves in the American van market. Offered here over the years as both a Dodge and a Freightliner, the latest versions are badged Mercedes-Benz and are sold through that brand's dealerships. Yes, it's a little odd to think that a Mercedes-Maybach sedan worth over $200,000 shares showroom space with a work van, but that's just a taste of the depth and breadth of the Mercedes nameplate globally.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter passenger van shares its powertrain options with the more work-oriented versions, including a 2.1-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder and a 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6. The 4-cylinder engine generates 161 horsepower and 265 pound-feet of torque thanks to a two-stage turbocharging system, and uses a 7-speed automatic transmission. The larger V-6 is rated at 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. Both engines use Mercedes-Benz's BlueTEC system, which injects Diesel Exhaust Fluid into the exhaust to reduce oxides of nitrogen emissions, resulting in output that Mercedes claims is as clean as a modern gasoline engine.</p>, <p>
Available only in the 2500 weight rating (rather than the heavier-duty 3500 rating available on cargo models), the Sprinter passenger van can haul up to 2,422 pounds of payload or tow up to 5,000 pounds. Two roof heights are available on the 144-inch wheelbase version, including a 65.0-inch interior height model and a 76.4-inch version. The long-wheelbase (170-inch) model is only available in passenger configuration with the 76.4-inch roof height.</p>, <p>For the 2014 model year, both the exterior and interior were redesigned, bringing sharper new looks to the front end of the Sprinter, and a more modern, luxurious feel inside the cabin. Among the upgrades to the interior are a 5.8-inch color display for the infotainment system, USB connectivity, and a standard Audio 15 head unit with iPod connectivity. More supportive front seats, a revised gearshift lever, and other aesthetic upgrades were also included in the 2014 model.</p>, <p>
Those looking to put some more consumer-oriented touches on their Sprinter passenger van can opt for a number of packages, including the Driver Comfort package, which includes a 12-volt output in the driver's seat base; a hinged-lid center bin; upgraded front seats; and more. The Active Safety Plus package brings power heated exterior mirrors; a multi-function steering wheel; light and rain sensors; blind spot monitoring; collision prevention assist; active lane control; and a number of other safety and convenience features. Mercedes' Parktronic parking aid system can also be added, as well as a number of premium appearance features inside and out.</p>]

At the rear, the CLS-Class gains edgier taillights that stand in contrast to the outgoing model's softer units and its trunk lid extends further back for a more conventional feel from certain angles.</p>, <p>Inside, the CLS-Class feels more like the brand's flagship S-Class than the mid-size E-Class sedan on which it's based. Available dual 12.3-inch screens under a single glass panel give it a proper virtual cockpit look. There's more room in the rear for actual adults with improved ingress and egress, but practical buyers will still shop for an E-Class instead. After all, the CLS-Class is about swagger, not about cubic feet of storage.</p>, <p>Under its hood, the CLS debuts for 2019 with a single powertrain badged CLS400: a turbo- and supercharged 3.0-liter inline-6 paired to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Both the inline-6 and the hybrid setup are new for the three-pointed star and they combine for better efficiency and performance. Combined, the setup is good for 383 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque and it's just as complex as it sounds. But, power is power and that's just fine with us.</p>, <p>Both rear- and all-wheel drive versions of the CLS400 are on offer.</p>, <p>The CLS is loaded from the factory with safety tech, including forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control. It will even use navigation data to automatically adjust its speed to safely handle bends, roundabouts, junctions, and toll booths.</p>, <p>The 2019 CLS is due in dealers in fall 2018 and other variants will undoubtedly follow.</p>, <p><strong>Mercedes-Benz CLS history</strong></p>, <p>In its first generation, the Mercedes CLS-Class was sold in the U.S. from the 2006 model year through 2011. The CLS is the model that defined the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1104698_the-mercedes-benz-glc-coupe-is-not-a-coupe-and-neither-are-these-other-things-either">somewhat nonsensical "four-door coupe"</a> category as a sedan with a coupe-like silhouette and dramatic styling. The CLS was a bold design statement when it launched and the first-generation car managed to look modern until it was replaced. While the interior and underpinnings of the first CLS were closely related to the E-Class sedan of that time, the big difference was seen in the rear seat as a result of the extremely tapered roofline. In place of a standard bench seat, Mercedes fit two small bucket seats in the rear, which were comfortable for smaller folks but didn't provide enough headroom for tall adults. The design also hindered rearward visibility, with thick rear pillars and a short backlight.</p>, <p>The first CLS was built on most of the same mechanical underpinnings as the pre-2010 Mercedes-E-Class sedan. It was introduced as a CLS500 or CLS55 AMG—the CLS500 including a 302-hp, 5.0-liter V-8, the latter a 469-hp, 5.5-liter V-8. In 2007, those models were replaced by the 391-hp, 5.5-liter CLS550 and the 507-hp, 6.3-liter CLS63 AMG. Any of these models have the capability to accelerate confidently and smoothly from any legal or extra-legal speed and come with a responsive 7-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>AMG models come with paddle-shifters and are sport-car quick; the CLS63 AMG can get to 60 mph in less than 4.5 seconds. In any of these versions, fuel economy is unimpressive: low teens in the city, mid to upper teens on the highway. Overall, the CLS rides and handles more like a luxury car than a performance sedan; despite an air suspension in most versions, there's quite a bit of body motion if you try to drive the CLS quickly. The CLS63 AMG version handles considerably better, without riding any worse.</p>, <p>Powertrains aside, the CLS-Class changed very little from its 2006 introduction through the 2011 model year. The model got an updated grille, new wheels, and a few other small changes for 2009, along with the latest version of Mercedes-Benz's COMAND navigation and entertainment interface. Interior appointments are excellent in this generation, with more colorful and daring interior themes than M-B used in its other vehicles.</p>, <p>Completely redesigned in 2011 as a 2012 model—and including an AMG model at launch—the CLS-Class still rides atop the same architecture. It grew a bit longer, though passenger space remained similar, and trunk space was slightly reduced. The shape is even more dramatic than before, with the blocky, masculine front end now common on the Mercedes lineup fitted to a body with more crests and curves. The ponton flares stamped into the rear quarter panels are especially distinctive, while the heavy-lidded taillights may be the least inspiring detail. The current CLS interior is positively bejeweled with chrome trim, and accented with beautiful wood or aluminum, depending on the model.</p>, <p>With its aggressively arched roofline and flowing design, the CLS strikes a balance for those who want a little more versatility for carrying backseat passengers compared to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class coupes, but who don't need the room of an E-Class sedan. It's just a little tight inside; the low roofline steals head room, especially in the snug-fitting back seat, but it's good enough for occasional use or carting the little ones around.</p>, <p>When the second-generation CLS was first offered in 2012, it was available with a choice of three powertrain combinations. The CLS 550 used a downsized turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8 good for 402 horsepower and matched to a paddle-shifted 7-speed automatic transmission. It was capable of a 5.0-second 0-60 mph time and a 130-mph top speed. The same engine was also offered with all-wheel drive, as the CLS 550 4MATIC.</p>, <p>The performance version, the CLS 63 AMG, fit a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 and a clutched 7-speed automatic transmission under the polarizing body, providing up to 585 hp, a 0-60 mph time of as little as 4.3 seconds, and a top speed as high as 186 mph.</p>, <p>For 2013, a new telematics system was fitted to the CLS, bringing with it apps including Facebook and Yelp connectivity, plus remote vehicle access and diagnostics, and an mbrace Concierge service that helps customers book airplane tickets and make dinner reservations, among other tasks.</p>, <p>In 2014, the AMG CLS was updated and given a lengthier name: CLS63 AMG S-model 4MATIC. The S-model portion denotes a more powerful version of the 5.5-liter V-8, now making 577 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque. The 4MATIC addendum signifies the standard all-wheel drive that has been added to try and make sense of all that extra power and torque.</p>, <p>In the 2015 model year, the CLS was updated with a new front end, one that's less busy and more subtle than its predecessor. The cabin also was updated with the latest, cleaner Mercedes themes. Switchgear was updated inside, bringing the CLS back to the level that its E-Class relatives enjoy.</p>, <p>There were several powertrain updates for the 2015 CLS. Mercedes added a CLS 400 model, which used its new twin-turbocharged V-6, good for 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque; rear-wheel drive was standard with this engine, and 4MATIC all-wheel drive was available. The rear-drive CLS 550 received a new 9-speed automatic transmission, which sees expanded use in other CLS models and the rest of the Mercedes-Benz lineup in the 2016 model year. The CLS 550 fitted with 4MATIC all-wheel drive continued to use the older 7-speed automatic.</p>, <p>For 2017, the CLS400 received the same 9-speed automatic.</p>, <p>On the technology front, the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class offers a host of entertainment and information features, such as the COMAND Online system, operated through the central 8.0-inch color high-resolution display. From internet surfing while the vehicle is stationary to on-the-go Bluetooth streaming, weather, Google Local Search, StreetView, and more, the COMAND Online system, especially in conjunction with Mercedes-Benz Apps, offers much for the tech-head to love.</p>, <p>The 2018 model year brought back only the CLS 550 and the CLS 63 AMG in anticipation of the new 2019 CLS that debuted at the Los Angeles auto show in late 2017.</p>]

[<p>The Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class is the new name for the former SLK-Class, but its mission remains much the same. A two-seat hardtop coupe-convertible, the SLC has received a facelift and two new powertrains as it makes the transition to the new 2017 model and to its new name.</p>, <p>Mercedes offers the SLC300, powered by a turbo-4 engine, and the AMG SLC43, which sports a twin-turbo V-6.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mercedes-benz_slc-class_2018">2018 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Even with a new name, the SLC has the same mission: sporty convertible without treading to heavily into sports-car territory. More performance would likely require a Porsche 718 Boxster or Cayman, or perhaps an Audi TT S or TT RS.</p>, <p><strong>The new SLC-Class</strong></p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the SLC adopted a new front end with smoother, more handsome styling with a chrome or black-finished grille. The silhouette remained the same, with a wedgy body, a rising beltline, and LED tail lamps giving the roadster a sporty profile.</p>, <p>No major changes were made for the 2018 model year, widely expected to be the car's last on sale.</p>, <p>Under the hood, drivers are offered a choice between two powertrains for the rear-drive SLC. The base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 with 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque; Mercedes says it's good for a 0-60 mph time of 5.7 seconds when coupled to the standard 9-speed automatic transmission. In the AMG SLC43, a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 makes 362 hp and 384 pound-feet of torque, good for 0-60 mph times of 4.6 seconds. Shifting also is handled by a 9-speed automatic. Both models offer five driver-selectable performance modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport+, and Individual.</p>, <p>A power-folding hardtop is a big selling point for the SLC. In this application, the retractable roof can be raised or lowered at speeds of up to 25 mph. When it's raised, the SLC feels solid and coupe-like; with the top down and a mesh windblocker in place, turbulence is kept to a minimum. The cockpit is kept warm even in cooler months with Airscarf, which puts warm-air vents at the passengers' necks. Finally, the hardtop comes with a panoramic glass panel that can be equipped with auto-dimming glass.</p>, <p>It's finely appointed, but the SLC's interior is a bit snug for tall drivers, and not too generously sized for trunk-stored luggage. A rearview camera, forward-collision warning system with automatic braking are all standard. Other standard features include Bluetooth, navigation, HD radio, and real-time traffic.</p>, <p><strong>Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class history</strong></p>, <p>Before it was the SLC-Class, the smaller Mercedes roadster was dubbed the SLK. Introduced in the 1996 model year, it was part of a large expansion of the German automaker's product portfolio, and was pitched as the smaller, lighter, and shorter cousin to the SL-Class<em>—sportlich, leicht, und kurz, or "s-l-k."</em></p>, <p>In its first generation, the SLK was offered with a wide range of powertrains, from a supercharged 4-cylinder engine to a potent AMG-built V-8. It was 4-cylinders only at launch, but in 2001 a 3.2-liter V-6 was added to the lineup. A supercharged V-6 came in 2001 as well, which pushed the AMG edition to 354 hp. </p>, <p>The second-generation SLK arrived in 2005. It bore a much more masculine shape, and powertrains ranged from 4-cylinders to new V-8 engines, all much more powerful than before. Base U.S.-market cars came equipped with a 228-hp, 3.0-liter V-6, with a 300-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 in the middle of the range. An AMG edition came with a 355-hp, 5.5-liter V-8. A 2009 update gave this SLK some minor styling updates and a Black Series edition for the AMG model.</p>, <p>A manual transmission was offered on the first three generations of SLKs, but you're far more likely to find an automatic.</p>, <p>In 2012, the third-generation SLK bowed. At first it was offered with a 302-hp 3.5-liter V-6, but a turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder was added. For a time, it was the only Mercedes offered in the U.S. with a manual transmission. (A 7-speed automatic was otherwise fitted to non-AMG models.) An SLK with an AMG V-8 was again added to the lineup. This SLK offered more interior space and a more refined hardtop with photochromic glass and Airscarf.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the SLK adopted a new turbo-4 engine—the same 241-hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that's now sold in the renamed SLC300.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mini_cooper-hardtop
[<p>The Mini Cooper was made famous with the original 1960s Mini, penned by Alec Issigonis, and revived in 2002 under its latest owners.</p>, <p>Since its revival, the BMW-owned Mini brand has expanded from its three-door hatchback original to encompass a five-door hatchback, a convertible, an unusual small wagon called the Clubman, and for a time, two-seat Coupe and Roadster models. Each model has been offered in a John Cooper Works version, which emphasizes performance.</p>, <p>With the Cooper, Mini has a compact car with plenty of performance and luxury fittings—for a price. Although its price is relatively low in base models, Mini takes the luxury-automaker's route in charging for myriad options that can push the hatchback's price sky high.</p>, <p>Its rivals include the Volkswagen Beetle (and Golf), Audi A3, and any other small, stylish hatchback.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111649_2018-mini-cooper" title="2018 MINI Cooper - full review">2018 Mini Cooper review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The three-door hatchback, by far the most recognizable, was the first Mini Cooper offered in a new and redesigned generation for the 2014 model year. It was followed by a new five-door hatchback for the 2015 model year. The convertible model followed halfway through the 2016 model year, a couple of months behind the Clubman edition.</p>, <p>The new Mini Cooper hardtop model, as the three-door hatchback is known, is larger than either of the two previous generations—especially in the nose, which is visually longer and consequently alters the proportions of the whole car. It's larger in every dimension, though, including passenger volume and cargo space, but it's still both recognizably a Mini and substantially smaller than most other cars on the road. Performance specs for the five-door hatchback and Clubman follow the same pattern.</p>, <p>Base versions of the Mini Cooper hardtop use a new turbocharged 3-cylinder engine that displaces 1.5 liters and puts out 134 horsepower. The higher-performance Cooper S variant sticks with a turbocharged inline-4, this one at 2.0 liters and making 189 hp. Either engine can be had with the choice of a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. While the auto is fine, we tend to prefer the manual, as it's better fitting with the Mini's spunky nature.</p>, <p>EPA-rated gas mileage sees a boost in this generation despite the size increase, with the most efficient model, the manual-transmission Cooper, seeing 39 mpg on the highway; the Cooper auto hits 37 mpg, while the Cooper S variants are not far behind, at 33 mpg for the manual and automatic.</p>, <p>The handling remains flat and stick-to-the-road sharp, with better power steering and a tighter body structure adding comfort and security—not to mention all the latest modern safety features, whether standard or optional. Either engine is fun to drive, though we felt the 3-cylinder's distinctive exhaust note gave the new Mini more personality. Except for sheer straight-line acceleration, where the Cooper S triumphs, either car delivers satisfying driving in a stylish package that remains as cheerful as the very first 1959 Mini.</p>, <p>Mini began selling a new five-door Cooper hardtop here—officially, it's being called the hardtop four-door—in 2015. The engine specs are the same as with the three-door Cooper and Cooper S. The Clubman joined the lineup for 2016, with four doors and a pair of barn-style doors at the back. It's the only true compact vehicle in the Cooper lineup, at roughly the same size as a five-door VW Golf.</p>, <p>The John Cooper Works model returned to the lineup for 2015. Mini offered it first on the two-door, with the four-door to follow. The JCW is powered by a 228-hp turbocharged 4-cylinder and is available with either a manual transmission or an automatic, the first time an autobox has been offered on any JCW model aside from the Countryman.</p>, <p>For 2016, the Mini lineup has been pared down to the hatchbacks, the Convertible and Clubman. The Coupe and Roadster? They've been discontinued.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Cooper carried on largely unchanged. In 2018, Mini added a standard rearview camera and shuffled its optional packages accordingly.</p>, <p><strong>Earlier MINIs (and Minis)<br/></strong></p>, <p>The Mini is quite possibly the best-known British volume car in the world. The original 1959 model pioneered the front-wheel-drive “econobox” formula, with a transverse front-engine layout that has since become the standard layout for small cars. Small numbers were sold in the U.S. through 1967, and in Canada into the 1980s.</p>, <p>BMW acquired the rights to the brand and capitalized it to emphasize its new beginning in 2002. Then it introduced a new and larger Mini Cooper that proved even U.S. drivers would purchase premium-priced small cars, if they offered style, power, sporty handling, and good perceived value for money.</p>, <p>The first generation of the new Mini Cooper, sold from 2002 to 2006, was the first Mini sold in the States since 1967. Unlike its U.K. home market, which included an ultra-fuel-efficient Mini One model, it was only offered here in sporting Cooper trim and two model variations: The standard Mini Cooper, with a 115-horsepower, 1.6-liter engine, and the Mini Cooper “S”, with a 168-hp supercharged version of the same engine. A convertible was added for 2005. A 5-speed manual gearbox was standard, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) served the function of an automatic.</p>, <p>Completely redesigned for 2007 (the Convertible followed in 2008), the second-generation Mini Cooper closely resembled the earlier model but offered a number of feature and safety refinements. That MINI introduced a new 120-hp, 1.6-liter engine, which in the “S” model received a turbocharger that took its power up to 175 hp. A 6-speed manual was standard, with a 6-speed automatic optional. A high-performance John Cooper Works model was also available.</p>, <p>For 2011, the Cooper range was upgraded to 121 hp in base models through reduced internal engine friction, while the Cooper S increased to 181 hp with additional tuning. The John Cooper Works models from 2011 rated 208 hp, and include an upgraded suspension and unique appearance items. Other updates for the 2011 and 2012 model years include freshened exterior appearance elements including a new bumper, a new set of interior and exterior customization options, and, for 2012, a new MINI Yours personalization program.</p>, <p>A Clubman model, with a longer body and an unusual door arrangement (with a second rear-hinged door on the passenger side) joined the lineup, and in 2012, a new two-seat Coupe model was added. Soon after, a convertible version of the Coupe, dubbed the Roadster, was added as well.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mini_countryman
[<p>Though the Mini Countryman is the largest model in the brand's range, it remains true to the brand's mission and is one of the smallest crossovers on the market.</p>, <p>There's much to like about the Countryman if you're in the market for a somewhat rugged little crossover brimming with character—vehicles like the Buick Encore, Fiat 500X, Audi Q3, and Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. The Countryman is loosely related to the BMW X1.</p>, <p>A <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1077579_2017-mini-countryman-spy-shots">new Countryman</a> made its debut as a 2017 model and a plug-in hybrid version followed quickly for 2018.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111651_2018-mini-countryman">2018 Mini Countryman review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Mini Countryman</strong></p>, <p>The new Countryman is bigger and more spacious than the first-generation vehicle. It looks better, too, with a less ungainly roofline than the original Countryman.</p>, <p>The base engine is a turbocharged 1.5-liter inline-3 with 134 hp, paired to either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. A turbocharged Cooper S model sports a 189-hp 2.0-liter inline-4 with an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual. All-wheel drive is an option on Countryman SUVs.</p>, <p>A Mini Countryman John Cooper Works tops the range; it utilizes a 228-hp version of the 2.0-liter that's shared with the BMW X1, but it has its own sport-tuned suspension and steering. Unlike the BMW, which shares its platform with the Countryman, the Mini with this engine is available with a 6-speed manual. </p>, <p>A new plug-in hybrid Cooper Countryman S E ALL4 adopts the same gas engine as the base model, and standard all-wheel drive. It blends in the power from an electric motor and a 7.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, using the gas engine to power front wheels and the battery and motor, the rears.</p>, <p>The battery sits under the back seat and can power the Countryman for up to 24 miles on electric alone. In battery mode, the Countryman tops out at 77 mph, and recharging can take about three hours on a 240-volt outlet.</p>, <p>The new Countryman should do a better job at conveying people, particularly rear passengers, better than its predecessor. Head, leg, and shoulder room have all improved, Mini says, and the new Countryman has about 30 percent more cargo room. That translates to 17.6 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 47.6 cubic feet when folded.</p>, <p><strong>Mini Countryman history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The Countryman nameplate launched in the U.S. for 2011, and saw only minor updates in its lifetime, most of them cosmetic.</p>, <p>The first Countryman actually shared body panels with only one of the other smaller, shorter vehicles in the Mini lineup: the Paceman hatchback. But the family resemblance was easily spotted. All-wheel drive was available, but rear-wheel drive was standard.</p>, <p>The Mini Countryman had roughly the same footprint as a Volkswagen Golf hatchback, but it managed to look larger and offer some actual off-road capability, thanks to bulging fenders and higher ground clearance than its Mini siblings. The interior packaging provided space for five people and a decent amount of gear. Like other Mini models, the Countryman didn't come cheap, especially in higher trim levels with added equipment. Mini targeted well-off buyers who could choose something bigger or more luxurious, but instead select the brand for its size and charm.</p>, <p>The Countryman's interior layout was very similar to that of its smaller Mini friends. Retro design themes ran strongly throughout, while some of the idiosyncratic touches were smoothed over, including the location of the lock and window switches. In back, the Countryman a three-person bench.</p>, <p>When it was first launched, the Countryman had a four-seat interior with two individual rear seats. Later a three-seat bench was made standard.</p>, <p>The base model came with a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine. Up one rung on the ladder was the sportier Countryman S model, which had a turbocharged version of the base model’s engine and a 181-hp rating. Both were offered with front- or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>All Countryman models were equipped with a long list of safety items, such as stability and traction control; a number of airbags; and anti-lock brakes with corner brake control. The Countryman was one of the first models to offer the latest Mini Connected infotainment system, which not only integrated with smartphones but also offers Internet-based services encompassing infotainment, communication, and driver experience. The services were provided through a growing range of apps that ran on the display screen in the center of the dash, and operated via a joystick in the center console.</p>, <p>In the 2013 model year, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1073501_2013-mini-john-cooper-works-countryman-official-details-pics">John Cooper Works version of the Countryman</a> joined the lineup. With 211 hp and an overboost mode that kicks torque up to 221 pound-feet in bursts, the JCW can accelerate to 60 mph in about seven seconds; it's the first JCW model yet to offer an automatic transmission in addition to the standard 6-speed manual; since then, the auto has migrated to other new JCW models.</p>, <p>The 2013 model also brought a redesigned armrest with relocated power-window controls and a larger console storage area. The second-row seat is now a three-person bench, with a two-person bucket arrangement available as a no-cost option. MINI also added the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079138_2013-mini-paceman-preview-2012-paris-auto-show">Paceman</a> that year, a vehicle that was essentially a two-door version of the Countryman.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Countryman gets a new grille, with the sportier Cooper S Countryman identifiable by additional chrome detailing. Most all-wheel-drive models get standard underbody guards, which can be added to the front-wheel-drive models too. Other updates included 17-inch alloy wheel designs, LED fog lights, and accents in glossy piano black, along with a handful of new exterior colors.</p>, <p>For 2016, changes are restricted to some trim and paint color changes, and a new special-edition model called the Park Lane, following a new grille and new chrome trim on the Cooper S version for 2015. Additionally, the folks at Mini have slightly simplified the Countryman lineup by reducing the number of options available.</p>]

[<p>The Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact crossover SUV that offers three rows of seats and a stylish design that helps it stand out in a highly competitive field.</p>, <p>Now in its third generation on sale in the U.S., the Outlander was redesigned in the 2014 model year, and updated for 2016.</p>, <p>For the 2018 Outlander, Mitsubishi added a larger 7.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment and offered advanced safety features on more trim levels. A plug-in hybrid model is new for 2018 that adds a 12-kwh battery and electric motor that can power the car for up to 22 miles on electricity alone.</p>, <p>Rivals for the Outlander include the Dodge Journey, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, Nissan Rogue, and Toyota RAV4, among others.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mitsubishi_outlander_2018">2018 Mitsubishi Outlander review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Mitsubishi Outlander</strong></p>, <p>The 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander made its debut with completely different styling, doing away with the shark-like front end and more wedge-like profile. Mitsubishi was selling the Outlander on more aggressive styling and driving attributes, but it has clearly positioned the latest model toward value.</p>, <p>The Outlander has slightly more aggressive styling than many other crossovers of its size, giving it more of a sporty wagon look in some respects. Flared fenders, a sloped roofline, and a strong rear pillar define the proportions, while the Outlander's higher stance and rugged lower cladding bring it back to the crossover crowd in terms of both design and functionality.</p>, <p>The Outlander is one of the least expensive vehicles available with three rows of seating. Models equipped with the third row can carry up to seven passengers. Because of the Outlander's compact overall size, the third row is strictly for occasional kid-hauling duties. All Outlanders have an easily configurable driving position with a tilt/telescoping steering column, as well as adequate head room and leg room for adults in the second row.</p>, <p>The Outlander offers a choice of either a 4- or 6-cylinder engine. Base models use a 2.4-liter inline-4 that makes 166 horsepower and is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which is a modestly powerful combination. The more expensive GT model gets a V-6 that's good for 224 hp; the added power is nice, but not that fast, and the engine requires premium-grade fuel and isn't especially efficient. Torque is also pretty low and uninspiring. It does come with a conventional 6-speed auto, which is more to the liking of those interested in performance. A <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1089481_mitsubishi-outlander-plug-in-hybrid-suv-now-delayed-til-2015-in-u-s">plug-in hybrid version of the Outlander</a>, with a complex drive system that's capable of both series and parallel hybrid operation was released in 2018.</p>, <p>All but the GT are available with a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. The GT exclusively sends power to all four wheels. </p>, <p>Safety features for Mitsubishi in the Outlander include adaptive cruise control (with three distance settings), lane-departure warning, and a forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking. For 2017, this system added pedestrian detection and blind spot monitors, lane change assist, and rear cross traffic alerts available.</p>, <p>Today's Outlander offers one of the strongest sets of standard equipment for the money, among compact-to-mid-size crossovers. And if it’s a three-row vehicle you’re considering, the Outlander is one of the smallest and least expensive.</p>, <p>For 2016, Mitsubishi made more than 100 improvements just two years after its redesign. The company sharpened up the front-end styling, subbed in a new, more responsive CVT in 4-cylinder models, and added many refinement upgrades and cabin improvements, including the addition of lots of sound deadener. The suspension was tweaked and the body stiffened as well, and the seat-folding arrangement for the second row was made easier.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Outlander's interior has been updated with glossy black trim and an electronic parking brake rather than the traditional pull-up style. A host of optional higher-end equipment—a heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support, new active safety features, and a surround-view camera system is newly available. The base model is now offered with all-wheel drive, albeit a more basic system.</p>, <p><strong>Mitsubishi</strong> <strong>Outlander history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The Mitsubishi Outlander was first introduced for 2003. At the time, it was only offered with a 140-hp, 2.4-liter inline-4 engine and 4-speed automatic transmission. From 2004 through 2006, the Outlander got a 160-hp version that made it a bit perkier, but both versions felt adequate for around-town driving though they were somewhat overwhelmed with a full load or on the highway. A 5-speed manual transmission was introduced in 2005, but not many models were equipped with it. Overall, this generation of Outlander models was quite unremarkable to drive, with a rather soft ride, decent but uninspiring handling, and well-appointed but somewhat cheap-feeling interiors. Safety features were also rather slim, with ABS and side airbags only standard on the top XLS until 2006, and electronic stability control not available.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi redesigned the Outlander for 2007, using the new Lancer platform as the basis for its crossover. It was initially offered with a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder making 168 hp and mated to a CVT or a 3.0-liter V-6 good for 220 hp and paired with a 6-speed automatic. It continued to offer a choice of front- or all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>This time, the Outlander was a bit larger and offered a small third-row seat. In general, this generation of Outlander looked and felt substantially more sporty and upscale, and the Lancer's sporty driving character finally carried over. V-6 models weren't quite as fast as expected, and with a significant increase in weight, the 4-cylinder was overwhelmed, sounding even more coarse and boomy than in the previous generation—in part due to the CVT keeping the engine at one speed for extended periods of time.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi finally made use of the sporting heritage of the Outlander's Lancer cousin in 2010 when it added a GT model. It combined the V-6 with the S-AWC all-wheel-drive system from the Lancer Ralliart and Evo models. Snow, Tarmac, and Lock modes increased the vehicle control on various surfaces. It also received handling and suspension upgrades to improve performance all around.</p>, <p>For 2010, all Outlanders got a version of the Lancer's even more blunt, shark-like grille, along with a more car-like air dam. Interior enhancements included a padded dash for top-of-the-range models, an available navigation and entertainment system called FUSE that incorporated a voice-command interface. The XLS was later dropped, and a few more standard features were added to the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mitsubishi_outlander_2013">2013 Mitsubishi Outlander</a>.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi had announced that it would turn the Outlander name into a sub-brand, much like what Subaru had formerly done with its Outback line. And in the 2011 model year, it followed that plan and introduced the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mitsubishi_outlander-sport_2013">Outlander Sport</a>, a smaller, more car-like and fuel-efficient model with some of the same styling cues.</p>]

[<p>The Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is a new compact crossover from the automaker that borrows one of the brand's popular names for its unconventional application.</p>, <p>The Eclipse Cross is loosely based on the Outlander and Outlander Sport SUVs, but offers a sloped roofline that is all its own. It is offered in ES, LE, SE, and SEL trim levels with front-wheel drive available only on the base version, the rest of the lineup has standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With the Eclipse Cross, Mitsubishi has another entry in the crowded compact crossover field that includes the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, Chevrolet Equinox, and Ford Escape. The Eclipse Cross has a sharper style than many of its competitors, somewhat at the cost of interior space.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our full review of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114147_2018-mitsubishi-eclipse-cross">2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross</strong></p>, <p>The Eclipse Cross is the first new crossover from Mitsubishi in several years, and sandwiches between the Outlander and Outlander Sport in terms of size and price. Its exterior looks nearly nothing like the other two, even though they all share a similar platform.</p>, <p>The Eclipse Cross sports a dramatic roofline that defines its shape and packaging. The small crossover offers an aggressive wedge shape, punctuated by rising windows in the back and a dropping roof in the rear. All trim levels of the Eclipse Cross wear daytime LED running lights, which pronounce the crossover's arrival better than the chrome accents and upright grille.</p>, <p>Around back, necessity required Mitsubishi to split the rear hatchback's window, which cuts into outward vision.</p>, <p>Under the hood, a new 1.5-liter turbo-4 makes its first appearance in a Mitsubishi crossover in the States. It makes 152 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. In all cases, it's mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and in most cases it's mated to all-wheel drive. The Mitsubishi all-wheel-drive system is new for Eclipse Cross too: it's a full-time system that electronically transfers power from the front to the rear wheels for better traction.</p>, <p>Inside, the Eclipse Cross is comfortable for four—provided they're not too tall. Head space is understandably limited in the rear seats thanks to the roof line and the rear seat backs recline to accommodate as best as they can.</p>, <p>In most models, Mitsubishi equips the Eclipse Cross with a touchscreen and touchpad to control its 7.0-inch infotainment screen. Premium audio is available from Rockford Fosgate, and heated rear seats, leather upholstery, and a head-up display are offered as top-tier items.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, so are active safety features. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning are available on top trims only—something competitors are offering on base trim levels.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mitsubishi_lancer
[<p>The Mitsubishi Lancer is the brand's second smallest offering, a compact four-door sedan that sits above the diminutive Mirage in the company's limited lineup. </p>, <p>Over the last couple of years, Mitsubishi has dramatically pared back the Lancer lineup. The five-door hatchback SportBack model from prior years is gone, as are the rally-inspired Evolution and Ralliart performance versions.</p>, <p>Today's Lancer is available in ES, SE, and SEL trim levels.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our</em> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mitsubishi_lancer_2017" title="2017 Mitsubishi Lancer - full review"><em>2017 Mitsubishi Lancer review</em></a></strong></p>, <p>With the Lancer, Mitsubishi has rivals that include the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Kia Forte, Dodge Dart, Ford Focus, Chevrolet Cruze, Hyundai Elantra, and Nissan Sentra, among others. Previously, the Subaru WRX, the Volkswagen GTI, the Volkswagen Golf R, and the Ford Focus ST all went up against the now-discontinued Lancer Ralliart and Evolution.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, changes to the Lancer are mostly packaging: A rearview camera is newly standard, as is a touchscreen infotainment system. ES models are now available with two-tone 16-inch alloy wheels, while SE and SEL have standard 18s. A Sun and Sound Package for the SE and SEL adds a power moonroof and a Rockford Fosgate-branded audio system.</p>, <p>The Lancer is now decidedly outdated, and its cheap interior, lack of refinement, noisy ride, and low fuel economy work against it, while more modern and updated alternatives abound in a highly competitive and extensive market segment. Still, with optional all-wheel drive and a competitive price (not to mention hefty discounts), the Lancer isn't necessarily something to totally cross off of your shopping list. </p>, <p>Base versions of the Lancer sedan provide solid handling wrapped in a sporty shape, at an affordable price. Its all-wheel drive option sets it apart from every other compact sedan except the Subaru Impreza. The base Lancer is offered with a smaller engine and front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Mitsubishi Lancer name dates back to the 1970s in the brand's home Japan market, and had established a good performance reputation in other markets, but even as recently as through the 1990s—when Mitsubishi was taking center stage in WRC rally racing—the automaker sold a homely, more stripped-down version of the Lancer, called the Mirage in the U.S.</p>, <p>Beginning in 2002, Mitsubishi finally brought the last-generation version over with the name Lancer, and from the beginning it gave the model more of a performance emphasis—in look, if not specs—with a sporty O-Z Rally edition. These Lancer models rode and handled quite well and had a reasonably roomy interior compared to other cars their size, but their handicap was the boomy 120-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, which struggled with the automatic transmission and was only adequate with the 5-speed manual. The 162-hp, 2.4-liter inline-4 that was introduced in 2004 with the Ralliart edition gave the Lancer more satisfying performance, thanks to a specially tuned suspension and other upgrades. In 2004 only, a boxy Sportback wagon version was offered here.</p>, <p>For 2008, Mitsubishi rolled out the current Lancer, which from its shark-like front end to the more aggressive stance and powertrain upgrades looks and feels a lot more exciting than its predecessor. Base SE and ES models are powered by a 152-hp, 2.0-liter four, but the GTS gets a 168-hp, 2.4-liter version. The top-of-the-line GTS emulates the Ralliart and Evolution in all but actual performance; while it's perky, it doesn't accelerate like a sports car. Lancer models come with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT automatic; we'd recommend the manual as the CVT causes the base model especially to be more noisy and sluggish. GTS models with the CVT get steering-wheel paddle shifters and six simulated gears, which redeem it somewhat.</p>, <p>A Lancer Sportback model returned to the lineup from 2010 through 2015. Offering all the same features as the Lancer GTS sedan but instead in a convenient five-door hatchback body style, the Sportback has a slightly lower cargo floor than the sedan, and of course the seats fold flat to expand the space. Going into 2011, availability of the hatchback was expanded to ES trims, then in 2012 the Mitsubishi Lancer lineup gained a sporty GT model replacing the GTS. An SE model also introduced all-wheel drive for the 2.4-liter non-turbo engine. In 2012 <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1078421_2012-mitsubishi-lancer-se-awd-driven">we drove the all-wheel-drive Lancer SE</a> and found it a worthy, albeit uninspired, rival to the Subaru Impreza.</p>, <p>The Lancer has received some new trim levels and various feature updates for 2015, 2016, and 2017, aimed at boosting its value-for-money quotient. A rearview camera is standard equipment as of 2017, for instance. But few meaningful changes have come to the Lancer lineup in recent years, as the Mitsubishi brand has struggled to stay afloat in the U.S. market. Mitsubishi has mostly abandoned its sporty image to become an inexpensive brand selling tiny Mirages and low-content versions of the Lancer, while the small Outlander Sport crossover and larger Outlander keep some money coming in.</p>, <p>Both the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mitsubishi_lancer-evolution">Lancer Evolution and Lancer Ralliart</a> models are covered by a separate model review. While the Ralliart, which has a 237-hp, turbocharged engine, has a lot in common with the Lancer GTS, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is significantly different structurally, and uses its own engine as well as a more-advanced all-wheel-drive system. The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1093197_mitsubishi-lancer-evolution-bows-out-with-2015-model">2015 model year was the Evo performance variant's last</a>, with no word on what, if anything, will replace it. The last run of Evo X models will be sold in Japan as Final Edition models and the final American model will be auctioned off for charity. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mitsubishi_i-miev
[<p>The Mitsubishi i-MiEV is a small hatchback electric car. Offered on and off for sale since 2012, the i-MiEV can travel up to 62 miles on a full charge with its electric powertrain.</p>, <p>With the i-MiEV, Mitsubishi has a subcompact hatchback far smaller than a new Mini Cooper. In short, with the iMiEV, Mitsubishi has made has a lot of inherent design choices that limit its appeal. The i-MiEV is based on a Japanese-market "Kei" car designed for use on, for instance, Tokyo's ultra-narrow streets. That makes it a rather odd fit in the United States, where higher speeds and larger vehicles are the norm.</p>, <p>The i-MiEV competes with the handful of battery-electric vehicles now sold in the U.S., most notably the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S, both larger and pricier (considerably so in the case of the Tesla luxury sport sedan). That set doesn't include so-called <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1068832_electric-cars-some-are-real-most-are-only-compliance-cars--we-name-names" title="Electric Cars: Some Are Real, Most Are Only 'Compliance Cars'--We Name Names">compliance cars</a>—sold only in California and a few other locations to meet zero-emission vehicle sales requirements—such as the Chevrolet Spark EV, Fiat 500e, and Ford Focus Electric.</p>, <p>For 2017, the i-MiEV returns unchanged after some minor revisions last year. Slow sales prompted Mitsubishi to pull the i-MiEV entirely in 2015. </p>, <p>Just one option package is available on the i-MiEV, a combination of a navigation system, rearview camera, and Bluetooth connectivity. </p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mitsubishi_i-miev_2017" title="2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV - review">2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Mitsubishi's little i-MiEV was adapted from a Japanese minicar called the Mitsubishi i. Its rear-mounted gasoline engine has been replaced with a 49-kw (66-horsepower) electric motor that produces 147 pound-feet of torque, powered by a 16-kwh lithium-ion battery pack. The electric version of the "i" weighs almost 2,600 pounds. A full recharge takes seven hours with the Mitsubishi-approved Eaton 220V charger, installed by Best Buy, or up to up to 22.5 hours on a standard 110V household plug.</p>, <p>We've found the Mitsubishi i-MiEV to serve best as a low-speed city car. While it steps away from traffic lights quicker than some gasoline-powered small cars, it leaves its comfort zone on the highway, feeling sluggish at 55 mph and above. Those speeds also cut driving range significantly from the EPA estimate of 62 miles. </p>, <p>Back in the city, its personality is enhanced by excellent steering and great maneuverability—although a soft suspension calibration means that you'll never mistake the i for any kind of hot hatch. Gentle, lower-speed driving makes the 62-mile range realistic on a full charge—although by using the "Eco" or "B" settings on the shift lever, you can take better advantage of the regenerative brakes and recapture more of the energy otherwise lost in stop-and-go.</p>, <p>Where some EV makers have gone the complex and showy route when it comes to interfaces and controls, Mitsubishi went with simplicity. The vehicle is turned on by a traditional-looking key, there's a shifter that slots into gear, and only a basic trip meter in an LCD gauge to show the estimated remaining range.</p>, <p>Because of its rear-mounted motor and non-traditional profile, the i-MiEV offers a surprising amount of interior room. The Americanized version is also wider than the Japanese car it's based on, allowing four adults to fit pretty comfortably inside. The rear seatbacks are split down the middle and fold to allow more cargo room. It's pleasant, although the trim and upholstery show signs of cost-cutting. The i-MiEV's ride is pretty good and the interior is quiet thanks to the electric powertrain.</p>, <p>Features are quite basic, although remote setting of climate control and charging operation are provided via the keyfob. Options include a heated driver's seat; an eight-speaker, 360-watt sound system; and an in-dash navigation system.</p>, <p><strong>Mitsubishi i-MiEV history</strong></p>, <p>Mitsubishi skipped the 2013 model year for its electric car and brought the i-MiEV back for 2014 with a price cut. The new sum was just $22,995 before incentives, a $6,130 reduction which Mitsu hoped would make it more competitive with the larger Nissan Leaf (which starts at $28,800).</p>, <p>The i-MiEV took the 2015 model year off as well. It's likely that dealers had sufficient supply of the little EV so as to not warrant continued production. Mitsubishi only sold a couple hundred of the cars in 2014, compared to a little over a thousand in 2013. The i-MiEV returned in early 2015 as a 2016 model, with the same (pre-tax-credit) base price of $22,995 and a newly optional navigation package.</p>, <p>Like all battery-electric cars, the i-MiEV is eligible for a $7,500 federal income-tax credit, along with a variety of local and state incentives. In California, those include single-occupant access to the carpool lane and a $2,500 purchase rebate. If considering an EV, it's best to research any similar incentives when pricing out the vehicle.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mitsubishi_outlander-sport
[<p>The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is not only Mitsubishi's smallest crossover model, it is also the most popular offering in the automaker's small U.S. lineup. Despite a name similar to the larger Outlander crossover, it looks more like a tall five-door hatchback than a truck-like utility vehicle.</p>, <p>Its trim levels start with the base ES, move up to the mid-level SE, and top out with the SEL model.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 include some added active-safety equipment in a new option package offered only on the SEL version.</p>, <p>With the Outlander Sport, Mitsubishi has a rival for a wide range of vehicles including the Kia Sportage, Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, and Toyota RAV4. A group of newer small crossover models now arriving on the scene—include the Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, Jeep Renegade, Fiat 500X, and Chevy Trax—is likely to also give the littlest Outlander stiff competition.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our </strong><strong><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mitsubishi_outlander-sport_2018" title="2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport- review">2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Outlander Sport dates back to the 2011 model year, with a handful of changes each year following a more visible front redesign. It's gradually acquired more standard features and trimmed down the variety of models offered, though it is now outranked on multiple fronts by newer challengers. Its main attraction continues to lie in its low starting price of around $21,000.</p>, <p>Changes in 2017 included better seat fabric for the base ES model, standard automatic climate control in every version, a shark-fin antenna for the roof, and a few added features.</p>, <p>In 2016, the Outlander Sport gained a restyled nose that made it more resemble the bigger Outlander. The "Dynamic Shield" grille is the maker's latest styling idiom, though it's busier and more cluttered on the smaller model. A handful of trim and equipment upgrades in 2016 added to the optional 2.4-liter engine introduced for 2015 to give the car a wide range of models and trim levels ranging from $20,000 to $30,000.</p>, <p>The Sport is derived from the current Lancer sedan platform, with a 4-cylinder engine driving the front or all four wheels. Base models include a 5-speed manual transmission but can be optioned with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that is standard on all other trims.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi's smallest crossover was first offered in the U.S. for the 2011 model year. Since then, it has benefited from a series of minor updates. Known as the ASX or RVR in other markets, the Outlander Sport is the struggling Japanese automaker's entry into the crowded small-crossover segment. Its short length could almost qualify it as a subcompact, while clever packaging means it retains more interior space within its smaller footprint than some longer rivals.</p>, <p>The Sport's front end bears a resemblance to the larger Outlander. It's profile is more sporty hatchback than crossover or SUV, and the dimensions are tidy. The same carlike feel extends to the interior, with a practical layout and a high roof. Seats are supportive, three kids or two adults will fit comfortably in the back seat, and there's a low cargo floor for easy loading. The Outlander Sport's fault, like other Mitsubishis, is material feel that's below that of competitors and a lot of cabin noise, making the vehicle seem very much like it was built to a price.</p>, <p><strong>2.0-liter only, at first</strong></p>, <p>Originally, all Outlander Sport models came with a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. Buyers could choose a CVT or opt to shift for themselves with a 5-speed manual gearbox with this engine. The manual was our choice, without hesitation, because the CVT made the engine feel sluggish and sound boomy, especially on the highway. Fuel economy was unremarkable at 25 mpg city, 32 highway in the most efficient configuration.</p>, <p>For 2015, Mitsubishi added an optional 2.4-liter 4-cylinder on two upper trim levels—SE and the newly added GT. The 2.4 puts out 168 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque. The engine is available with either front- or all-wheel drive and comes paired exclusively with a version of the brand's continuously variable transmission. Front-drive models return fuel economy ratings of 23 mpg city, 28 highway with all-wheel drive lowering those numbers slightly.</p>, <p>The Outlander Sport stands out as a strong value for the money, especially considering that the base model starts at just over $20,000. Even at the base level, front knee airbags are a standard safety feature you won't find in many other models, and keyless entry, automatic climate control, and a 140-watt sound system are all included. Top-of-the-line SE models include a panoramic sunroof, premium audio, and heated seats.</p>, <p>Road noise has been an issue since the Outlander Sport was launched—although Mitsubishi reported a few improvements for 2012, including much needed additional sound insulation. Then for 2013, the model also received a modestly redesigned (and smoother) version of the shark-like front end, plus a new bumper design and revised lower-body trim. Mitsubishi further updated the feature list for 2013 as well, adding standard alloy wheels on all trim levels, with new seat fabrics—and even more noise insulation, possibly soothing some of the harsh, low-rent impression. For 2014, the Outlander Sport got a new touch-screen audio system on SE models, as well as a new seven-inch touch-panel navigation system with real-time traffic. It's bundled with black leather seating as part of an SE Touring Package.</p>, <p>In addition to the 2.4-liter engine and new GT trim level, the 2015 model year also brought another round of refinement improvements, adding a new version of the CVT with better off-the-line performance and slightly better highway fuel economy (a 1-mpg improvement), plus yet more noise insulation.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/mitsubishi_mirage
[<p>The Mitsubishi Mirage is among the lowest-priced new cars sold in the U.S., which puts it somewhat at odds with other subcompact vehicles—many of them trying to chase a more upscale image. One model also offers the highest fuel-economy rating of any non-hybrid sold in the U.S. this year. For 2018, the Mirage lineup includes a hatchback and a sedan called Mirage G4 that was launched in 2017. Its competitors includes the Chevy Spark, Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, and Toyota Yaris.</p>, <p>Changes for 2018 include a standard rearview camera and 7.0-inch touchscreen for all models. A driver's seat armrest is offered on the two top trim levels, and the USB port on those versions moves to the center console from its previous location at the end of a cable inside the glove box. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are now available, but aren't standard; they come as part of a Smartphone package.</p>, <p>The Mirage G4 is largely the same vehicle as the hatchback, except with a trunk that offers less volume and flexibility than the five-door's expansive cargo area. The G4 aims to look a little more upscale, but it suffers at the pump by delivering slightly lower fuel economy numbers. Mitsubishi builds all Mirages in a factory in Thailand.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/mitsubishi_mirage_2018" title="2018 Mitsubishi Mirage - review">2018 Mitsubishi Mirage review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Mitsubishi Mirage</strong></p>, <p>The new Mirage—even with all the upgrades—looks plain. The car sits upright on its little 14- or 15-inch wheels, with a version of Mitsubishi's newest front-end styling giving it a rounded look that helps the car cheat the wind but does little for it styling-wise. Mitsubishi claims a drag coefficient of 0.27 for the hatchback, which is a nice low number, so the designers can't be blamed too much for going the staid route up front.</p>, <p>The simple interior of the Mirage is equally plain, though with modern safety features under the rounded shapes formed from hard plastics. But the closer you get, the cheaper the Mirage looks inside. Folding down the 60/40-split rear seat back, for example, produces wrinkles in the thin carpet covering the seat back. Many interior panels are painted metal, a few with exposed seams; overall, the impression is more 1990s econobox than smart, stylish, high-quality product of the 2010s.</p>, <p>The front seats are comfortable enough, and with some dickering, four 6-footers can fit inside. But the Mirage is a light car at about 2,000 pounds even in U.S. trim with its full complement of safety equipment. That doesn't leave a lot of margin for noise suppression, and the Mirage's cabin can be quite noisy, though it's a little better in the later models. Seven airbags are fitted as standard, along with the usual suite of now-mandatory electronic safety systems. Brake assist and hill-start assist come standard on models fitted with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). A rear-view camera isn't fitted to the base ES model.</p>, <p>The Mirage's claim to fame isn't just a low price (one of the lowest on the U.S. market) but also fuel efficiency estimated at 37 mpg city, 43 highway, 39 combined for the hatchback with the CVT. At the opposite end of the spectrum sits the rather less impressive G4 with its standard 5-speed manual: 33/40/35 mpg. That rating is on par with some larger, far more refined compact cars. </p>, <p>The Mirage's dynamic behavior was truly disappointing when it launched. While Mitsubishi claims it made significant changes to the suspension for the 2017 model, it remains one of the more unpleasant highway cars we've driven. The ride is smooth around town on good roads, but at speed the ride is bouncy, the car wanders and wallows, and the steering is numb. Added to that, the Mirage is in no way quick and has virtually no reserve of acceleration for passing or emergencies. A 5-speed manual transmission is standard, and rated a few mpg lower than the optional CVT, although aggressive drivers will find the manual better able to extract the most from the small engine.</p>, <p>For its price, the Mirage comes pretty well equipped. The base ES trim level includes air conditioning, keyless entry, power windows, and a four-speaker audio system including USB input. The SE adds alloy wheels, a height adjustable driver's seat, fog lights, Bluetooth connectivity, automatic climate control, and a backup camera, among a few other items. Pop for the full-boat Mirage GT, which is only available as a hatchback, and you'll net surprising luxuries like xenon headlights and heated seats—but, despite its name, the GT isn't remotely sporty and doesn't even offer the manual gearbox.</p>, <p>There was no 2016 Mitsubishi Mirage; the automaker skipped that year entirely, but instead rolled out a 2017 Mirage with a series of significant improvements. The 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage gets a restyled front end; 4 more horsepower to take its rating to 78 hp; upgraded brakes; a retuned suspension for improved ride and handling; new upholstery fabrics and interior trims; and updated infotainment systems.</p>, <p><strong>Mitsubishi Mirage history<br/></strong></p>, <p>Prior to making a return on this subcompact for 2014, the Mirage nameplate was last used in the U.S. back in 2002.</p>, <p>The Mirage sold in the U.S. from 1997 through 2002 was actually the fifth generation of a model first launched in the late 1970s. That car was sold as the Dodge Colt before Mitsubishi began to offer its cars under its own banner in the U.S. The final generation of Mirage was a compact car in those days, offered as a two-door coupe and four-door sedan and powered by a 1.8-liter engine in its last years. While the Mirage coupe lasted through 2002, the sedan model was replaced by the Mitsubishi Lancer for 2002.</p>]

[<p>The Nissan Leaf is a five-door hatchback, and it's the first mass-market electric car to be sold in the United States. It received a major redesign for 2018, including new and more conventional styling inside and out, a more powerful motor, and a higher-capacity battery pack.</p>, <p>The projected range of 150 miles puts the latest Leaf into a white space in the market, with more range than any other battery-electric car at its price, although less than the pricier Chevrolet Bolt EV or any Tesla. Other competitors with lower ranges include the BMW i3, Ford Focus Electric, Hyundai Ioniq Electric, and Volkswagen e-Golf.</p>, <p>The 2018 Leaf now looks like a Nissan and a normal car, losing the rounded, bug-eyed shape that defined the first generation. While it shares some of the same underpinnings, drivers and passengers will likely never know. With a new interior, new sheet metal, and a suite of standard or optional active-safety features, the second-generation Leaf is about as comprehensive an update as you can imagine.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_leaf_2018" target="_blank" title="2018 Nissan Leaf - overview">2018 Nissan Leaf review</a><br title="2016 Nissan Leaf - overview"/></strong></em></p>, <p>For 2018, the battery capacity has risen from 30 to 40 kilowatt-hours, with range rising commensurately from 107 to 150 miles. The motor output is rated at 110 kilowatts (147 horsepower) and 236 pound-feet of torque, versus 80 kw (107 hp) and 187 lb-ft for the 2017 Leaf. The onboard charger remains at 6.6 kw, with CHAdeMO DC fast charging available. Nissan says a full recharge takes 8 hours using a 240-volt Level 2 charging station, or 16 hours from a conventional 120-volt household current. Fast charging to 80 percent takes about 40 minutes.</p>, <p>The latest Leaf models start under $31,000 including delivery, which means that for California buyers, the effective price after a $2,500 state purchase rebate and a $7,500 federal income-tax credit can be around $21,000. There are numerous state, local, and regional incentives as well. Those include the ability to travel with just a single occupant in the carpool lane on the crowded freeways of California.</p>, <p><strong>2011-2017 Nissan Leaf</strong></p>, <p>There have been essentially three versions of the Nissan Leaf since its launch as a 2011 model. The 2011 and 2012 models were built in Japan, with prices suffering from the expensive Japanese yen as a result. When Nissan moved Leaf production for North America to Tennessee, it made several important updates and cut the price considerably.</p>, <p>For 2013, the company added a new base-level Leaf S model and made dozens of smaller changes to features and equipment in response to feedback from vocal and enthusiastic early owners. The budget-conscious Leaf S skipped several items standard on 2011 and 2012 models, including LED headlights, alloy wheels, and navigation. Above that, there is the mid-grade Leaf SV and then the range-topping Leaf SL.</p>, <p>Significant changes to the Leaf for 2013 included downsizing and relocating the battery charger from the load bay into the engine compartment, which expanded cargo capacity. Equally important to everyday usage was an optional 6.6-kw charger (later made standard on all but the base Leaf S) that cut charging time for a fully depleted battery from seven hours to about four, using a 240-volt Level 2 charging station. (That power is the same kind used for electric stoves and clothes driers.) All Leafs come with a 120-volt charging cord for use with standard household current, but most do not rely solely on it because it takes up to 20 hours to charge a fully depleted pack.</p>, <p>For 2015, battery packs remained at the same capacity and range rating, but the cells inside switched to a new and more heat-resistant chemistry that Nissan said would resist very high ambient temperatures better. Some 2011 through 2014 Leafs in extremely hot locales like Phoenix, Arizona, had lost battery capacity far faster than predicted. The new battery chemistry thus far seems to be more durable, but not a lot of data has accumulated thus far.</p>, <p>Then, in 2016, the SV and SL models gained a larger 30-kwh lithium-ion battery pack in the same location under the cabin floor, which gave it them a boost from 84 to 107 miles of range. Late in the 2016 model year, Nissan extended the higher capacity to S models and dropped the old 24-kwh pack. For 2017, every Leaf boasted the bigger battery. All first-generation Leafs are powered by an 80-kw (107-horsepower) electric motor that drives the front wheels.</p>, <p>The compact Leaf offers enough interior room to deem it a mid-size car, and its weight of well over 3,000 pounds is clearly more in line with the larger category. Like all electric cars, which can develop peak torque from 0 rpm, it is brisk off the line. Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph is in the 10-second range, and top speed is limited to roughly 90 mph.</p>, <p>Electric range for the 24-kwh Leaf was rated by the EPA at 84 miles, but that number is not directly comparable to range ratings from previous years, as the states of battery charge—whether to 80 percent (for longer battery life) or 100 percent (for maximum range)—were not consistent among the years. Gentle driving can produce real-world range up to 15 percent higher. Owners quickly learn, however, that range can vary from 65 to 100 miles depending on speed, outside temperature, and how much use is made of the Leaf's heater in cold weather.</p>, <p>Most Leafs can also "quick-charge" up to 80 percent of their battery capacity within 30 minutes at special "DC quick charging" charging stations that work on the Japanese CHAdeMO standard. Those stations are still rare, but are being rolled out in regions—Oregon and Washington, parts of Texas—that are working aggressively to adopt electric cars.</p>, <p>All Leaf models except the base S include the ability to pre-heat or pre-cool the car while it’s still plugged in, to reduce battery energy use. They can be controlled for this purpose through a website or smartphone app. The Leaf's pale grey, coarse, velvety upholstery material is made from recycled plastic bottles and home appliances; a black interior and leather seats are options as well.</p>, <p>The Leaf remains more expensive to buy than a comparably sized gas-powered hatch. Its financial advantage lies in operation costs, which are significantly lower than burning fuel. Even with fluctuation of electricity prices from region to region, the Leaf wins; the national average price per kilowatt-hour is around 12 cents, meaning it costs on average 3 cents per mile. That's compared to 16 cents per mile in a gas-powered car running at 25 mpg on $4/gallon fuel.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_titan
[<p>The Nissan Titan went on sale as the company's first full-size truck in the 2004 model year. But it hasn't been the sales titan Nissan had hoped for. Fervent loyalty to the Ram 1500, Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra is very strong, as Toyota has also discovered with its full-size Tundra pickup.</p>, <p>The Titan is built in the company's Canton, Mississippi, plant, and it has historically shared running gear with Nissan's full-size Armada SUV as well as a few pieces with the mid-size Frontier pickup. A new Titan XD, a truck that fits between light-duty and heavy-duty offerings, was introduced for the 2016 model year, and a new light duty Titan arrived for 2017.</p>, <p>In 2018, the Titan stayed relatively the same beyond a new Midnight Edition that added black exterior accents.</p>, <p><strong>MORE: <em>Read <strong>our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_titan_2018">2018 Nissan Titan review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Titan</strong></p>, <p>The first of the new Titan models was shown at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The 2016 Nissan Titan XD was extensively engineered and completely redesigned, with the star of the lineup being the available 5.0-liter Cummins turbodiesel V-8 making 310 horsepower and 555 pound-feet of torque. With the right equipment and the diesel engine, the XD can tow up to 12,000 pounds, putting it somewhere between the capability of a half-ton and a three-quarter-ton truck.</p>, <p>A new 5.6-liter Endurance gasoline V-8 also is offered for the XD, putting out 390 hp. Thus far, the V-8 is the lone engine in the light duty Titan, which is new for the 2017 model year.</p>, <p>The light duty Titan builds upon the platform of the first-generation truck, but its ladder frame is strengthened with additional gussets and it gets hydraulic body mounts to reduce vibrations. These changes pay off as the Titan offers a controlled ride, without as much jiggle and bounce as most rivals.</p>, <p>Topping out at 9,790 pounds, the light-duty Titan can't tow as much as the competition, though.</p>, <p>The Titan's available rearview camera has guides that help with hitching a tow vehicle to the truck. Surround-view cameras, blind-spot monitors, rear cross traffic alerts, and front and rear parking sensors are available. Trailer sway control and an integrated trailer brake controller are offered to enhance safety while towing.</p>, <p>All Titans are offered in S, SV, Pro 4X, SL, and Platinum Reserve models. Thus far only Crew Cab and Single Cab body styles are offered; a King Cab with a smaller rear seat than the Crew Cab is due by the end of the 2017 model year. The Titan Crew Cab has a 5.5-foot bed, and the Titan XD Crew Cab a 6.5-foot bed. All Single Cab models have the standard 8-foot pickup bed. Newly offered features include in-bed lighting, a factory gooseneck setup, Titan Box lockable bedside storage, LED bedrail lighting, and the latest infotainment features in the completely redesigned and modern interior.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Titan history</strong></p>, <p>The Nissan Titan changed little since it was introduced as a 2004 model. It was sold in just a single powertrain configuration. Through its run, it remained a good-looking truck. The first Titan took a nod from Nissan's SUVs with its masculine blend of lines and curves, its flared fenders and its big, bright chrome grille. The cabin didn't age as well as the sheet metal.</p>, <p>While most rival large pickups—especially those from the U.S. automakers—targeted work use and company fleets, as well as personal use, Nissan focused only on personal and recreational use for the Titan. The Titan never came in a stripped-down base model, nor in a heavy-duty edition; focused models aimed instead at off-roading and towing.</p>, <p>The sole powertrain offered from 2004 to 2014 teamed a 5.6-liter V-8 engine with an automatic transmission. That V-8 originally made 305 hp and 379 lb-ft of torque—upgraded to 317 hp and 385 lb-ft in 2007. At the time of the Titan's 2004 introduction, that combo made it one of the fastest, most powerful standard-equipment trucks. However fuel economy was unimpressive, in the low teens on the city cycle.</p>, <p>With its responsive 6-speed automatic transmission and either rear- or four-wheel drive, this Titan powertrain was positively quick, and handling was good. Road noise was more accentuated than with other full-size trucks, though, and the rumbly, ever-present nature of the engine didn't suit everyone.</p>, <p>The Titan's biggest change came in 2007, when Nissan introduced long-wheelbase models for the first time. That allowed many more build variations, and at the same time, payload capacity was increased. Titan models could then tow up to 9,500 pounds. Most Titans receive a factory spray-in bedliner, and Nissan offered some unique storage options like the cleated tie-downs that slid up and down tracks to secure a small, heavy object like an engine block. Other truck manufacturers adopted forms of those features since.</p>, <p>The first Titan offered configuration choices similar to those of the other big trucks, though not quite as many. Beds came in 6.5- or 8-foot lengths. The King Cab was what most refer to as an extended cab, while the Crew Cab was a true four-door with plenty of room for adults in the rear. It proved comfortable inside, with convenience features being added over the years and including items such as a DVD entertainment system, satellite radio, and Bluetooth phone connectivity.</p>, <p>Safety wasn't the Titan's forte. It achieved less-than-optimal results from both major crash-test organizations, though electronic stability control was standard for many years and was optional when the Titan was first introduced.</p>, <p>The Titan changed very little as it neared the end of its run. <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_titan_2013">In the 2013 Titan</a> Nissan freshened the look of the off-road-themed Pro 4X. At the same time it gave all Titans a new tailgate design, with a few other minor appearance changes, and made the navigation system (with a USB port and satellite radio) more widely available.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_rogue
[<p>The Nissan Rogue is a compact crossover SUV. It can seat up to five passengers and offers some of the most advanced safety gear found in any new car.</p>, <p>The Rogue is one of Nissan's most popular models, along with the Altima and Sentra sedans.</p>, <p>In the Rogue, Nissan has a rival for mega-selling crossovers that include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4, as well as the Mazda CX-5 and Subaru Forester, among others.</p>, <p>This year, the Rogue is available with the automaker's ProPilot Assist system, which is the first of what's likely to be many steps toward self-driving cars. That's the kind of big tech previously reserved for much pricier cars.</p>, <p><strong><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_rogue_2018">2018 Nissan Rogue review</a></strong></em></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Rogue</strong></p>, <p>The new Rogue arrived for the 2014 model year, though, confusingly, the former version remained on sale for two model years badged as the Rogue Select.</p>, <p>The new model is styled handsomely and a bit more conservatively than the one it replaces, and the interior is better organized and finished in attractive, higher-quality materials. Interior space isn't up in a major way, so the Rogue remains at the smaller end of the compact-crossover class.</p>, <p>Today's Rogue uses the same 170-horsepower inline-4 and continuously variable transmission (CVT) as its predecessor, but improvements to the driveline and aerodynamics help boost fuel economy to 29 mpg in the EPA's combined rating. Steering has more weight to it than in the previous model, the ride has been improved, and the Rogue feels altogether more composed and substantial than it had in its first generation.</p>, <p>The best improvement made to the current-generation Rogue has to be the dense-foam seats that are very supportive on long drives. Nissan calls them "Zero Gravity" seats and plays up the fact that they were developed using knowledge from NASA.</p>, <p>Though it's not much bigger inside, the Rogue now offers an optional third-row seat that expands capacity to seven. The third-row bench isn't very big, but the second row can slide fore and aft to sacrifice a little room in the middle when the rearmost seat is being used. That said, it's probably best if only small kids ride in the third row, since it's not that easy to access the extra seat and space is at a premium.</p>, <p>For crash safety, the Rogue earns Top Safety Pick status from the insurance-funded IIHS, but the NHTSA initially gave it a low three-star rating for front-impact protection. That has since been upgraded to four stars, which is certainly better, but many rivals get five star front crash ratings. Safety options include a surround-view camera system, blind-spot monitoring, a lane-departure warning system, and a forward-collision alert system.</p>, <p>Other Rogue features include a standard USB port, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a rearview camera. Options include third-row seating, Bose audio, navigation, a power tailgate, a surround-view camera system, 18-inch wheels, heated front seats, and leather upholstery.</p>, <p>No major changes were made for the 2015 model year, though the Rogue's NHTSA crash-test score improved and an Eco mode was added to the powertrain. The testing improvement is likely due to improvements made under the skin. For 2016, the Rogue adds Siri Eyes Free to the SV Premium Package and SL model, and rear cross-traffic alerts and automatic emergency braking become available on various packages and models.</p>, <p>In the 2017 model year, Nissan added a Rogue Hybrid to the lineup, giving it a direct rival to the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. Nissan's gas-electric drivetrain pairs <span>a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with a 30-kilowatt (40-horsepower) electric motor and lithium-ion batteries.</span> The Rogue Hybrid can accelerate up to 25 mph on electric power alone, though it takes a very practiced foot to keep its gas engine silent. The EPA rated the Rogue Hybrid at up to 34 mpg combined.</p>, <p>Nissan added a smaller <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_rogue-sport">Rogue Sport</a> to the lineup, although that model isn't a quicker version of the crossover. Instead, it's based on a worldwide crossover sold as the Nissan Qashqai, and costs less than the Rogue, which has grown over the years.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Rogue lineup saw some minor trim shuffling, but the big news was that the automaker's ProPilot Assist technology is newly optional. ProPilot Assist uses various cameras and sensors to keep the Rogue within a lane and a set distance away from other vehicles with no driver intervention. Also, the tight third row of seats was dropped from the lineup.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Rogue history</strong></p>, <p>The first Nissan Rogue debuted for the 2008 model year. That original 2008 Rogue had a fairly unconventional appearance, completely without any unnecessary SUV cues. More a slab-sided and taller-than-usual wagon, the first-generation Rogue had echoes of Nissan's Murano, the larger and clearly more luxurious sibling placed above the Rogue in the model lineup.</p>, <p>This Rogue was based on the same underpinnings as the Sentra sedan but didn't take full advantage of the Sentra's chassis. Handling was on the soft side, and while other crossovers aimed for class-best performance or handling, the clear focus for the Rogue was affordable, economical, and comfortable transportation for small families, and for those looking for a low-cost sedan or minivan alternative.</p>, <p>The Rogue was fairly fuel-efficient, too, courtesy of a 170-hp 4-cylinder engine and CVT that could be teamed to either front- or all-wheel drive. The fuel economy ratings were as high as 23 mpg city, 28 highway.</p>, <p>This first Rogue could move quite quickly but wasn't particularly inspiring to drive, even when equipped with the available steering-wheel paddles, which might have improved the experience somewhat on hilly or curvy roads.</p>, <p>More than anything, the Rogue succeeded as a compact sedan replacement, with room for five inside, though three adults were a bit cramped in the back row. The back seats reclined, for either best comfort or to help fit cargo, and when needed the back seats folded flat.</p>, <p>Over the years, the first Rogue saw few changes. For 2010, a new 360 Value Package brought alloy wheels, a chrome grille, and other extras to the base S model, while a Krom appearance package gave it an aftermarket-accessorized look. It included showy wheels, sporty center exhaust, tinted glass, and more. A very mild makeover came in the 2011 model year. Otherwise, options were fine-tuned for 2013 to bring a new Premium Edition (replacing the Premium Package) with front fog lamps and Bose audio. A Bluetooth hands-free interface remained optional on base S models, but was included in the rest of the model line.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_kicks
[<p>The Nissan Kicks is a stylish subcompact crossover that anchors the brand's extensive lineup of high-riding passenger cars.</p>, <p>The Kicks is new to the American market for 2018, but its basic design has been on sale in South America and Asia for a few years. The Kicks is available in S, SV, and SR trim levels.</p>, <p>With the Kicks, Nissan has a rival for small compact SUVs such as the Chevy Trax, Hyundai Kona, Ford EcoSport, and Honda HR-V.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1113990_2018-nissan-kicks">2018 Nissan Kicks review</a><br/></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Kicks</strong></p>, <p>Though it lacks the polarizing visual flair of the Nissan Juke, the Kicks isn't short on stylistic personality. Its most distinctive feature is its side profile, with a rearmost roof pillar that kicks (see what we did there?) upward and is painted black to give the illusion of a floating roof. Unpainted lower bumpers hint at off-roady ruggedness, but the Kicks isn't available with all-wheel drive—it's front-wheel drive for now. Despite its relatively short stature, Nissan says that a 6-footer can easily load and unload the Kicks without ducking underneath the rear hatch.</p>, <p>Under its hood sits a 1.6-liter inline-4 rated at 125 horsepower and 115 pound-feet of torque that sends power to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission. The combo should net 33 mpg combined, according to the automaker. That's hardly thrilling power on paper, but the Kicks is intended more for around-town cruising with its 169-inch overall length than it is for corner carving. Its 2,600-pound curb weight and a touchy throttle mean it feels peppier around town than it is.</p>, <p>The Kicks sports a relatively large interior for its class, including more than 25 cubic feet of cargo room with the second row in place. Second-row passengers get more than 33 inches of leg room, which is better than some in its class.</p>, <p>The Kicks comes unusually well-equipped with safety gear for a subcompact crossover. Automatic emergency braking is standard across the line, while blind-spot monitors are included on SV and SR trim levels. Power windows and locks are standard. All trims come with a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, but only SV and SRs are fitted with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Bose speakers and heated seats are optional. The Kicks SR is mostly an appearance package with black-painted accents outside, although it does add a leather-wrapped steering wheel and heated exterior mirrors.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kicks went on sale in June 2018, meaning its initial model year was be a short one.</p>, <p>The North American version of the Nissan Kicks will be assembled at Nissan's factory in Mexico.</p>]

[<p>The Nissan Murano is a five-seat, high-style, mid-size crossover SUV companion to the Japanese automaker's bigger, seven-seat Pathfinder.</p>, <p>Available in a slew of models—S, SV, SL, and Platinum, the Murano ranges from affordable to downright luxurious.</p>, <p>With the Murano, Nissan has an all-weather family utility vehicle that hits a sweet spot for many shoppers: it has a relatively thrifty V-6 engine, a continuously variable automatic (CVT), and available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The latest iteration of the Murano arrived last year with a very design-focused shape and some additional innovative features. For 2018, Nissan added standard automatic emergency braking to all trim levels, a crucial and common add-on now for family vehicles. A Midnight Edition was also made available.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_murano_2018" title="2017 Nissan Murano - review">2018 Nissan Murano review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Murano</strong></p>, <p>With a major 2015 redesign, the Nissan Murano received striking new looks and a much-improved interior. A sweeping hood ties to a roofline that "floats" over a very small, third side window in the pillar. The tailgate is sharply raked and highly sculpted, with a long trailing roof spoiler at its top. Inside, it's all about comfort and luxury, with a long console that extends past the front seats to offer rear passengers their own charging options.</p>, <p>The Murano's powertrain is familiar. The SUV offers a 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine developing 240 pound-feet of torque, CVT, and either front- or all-wheel drive. Eventually, the Murano may get the hybrid technology from the Pathfinder and Infiniti QX60.</p>, <p>The Murano has the same "zero-gravity" seat design as the latest Altima and Maxima. It uses dense foam for comfort over long trips, which Nissan claims comes from NASA's fatigue-free neutral seating position. Nissan also says this Murano is supposed to be able to swallow four large suitcases with the rear seats in place.</p>, <p>The IIHS rated the Murano with its Top Safety Pick+ award before changing the criteria to include headlight efficiency and automatic emergency braking. Federal testers give the all-wheel-drive version five stars overall, four stars to the front-drive model.</p>, <p>Nissan also offers a full suite of standard and optional safety features, using data from as many as three separate radar systems and four cameras. Available safety systems include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, and a surround-view camera system.</p>, <p>The Murano also offers a long list of available features, including keyless ignition, leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, heated seats all around, and cooled front seats. Memory for the driver's seat, steering wheel, and mirror positions is also available. The NissanConnect infotainment and connectivity system is included, incorporating both navigation and mobile-connected apps. Premium Bose AM/FM/CD audio system with 11 speakers, HD Radio, and satellite radio are also on the options sheet.</p>, <p>For 2017, Nissan took the unusual step of offering a half-year model (officially a 2017.5) of the Murano that included broader Apple CarPlay compatibility and available automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Murano history</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation Murano model, sold from 2003 to 2007, had a pleasantly edgy, urban-friendly shape. Sized like its main competitors, the Ford Edge and the early Toyota Highlander, the Murano took the styling kudos. Mechanically, it also had an edge, with better steering and a more nimble feel, thanks to its family-plan architecture based on Nissan's well-received Altima four-door.</p>, <p>The first Murano's interior offered five-passenger seating and a decently roomy cargo area as well. Safety proved very good, with the crossover earning the federal government's top ratings for front and side-impact protection (under test criteria that have since changed).</p>, <p>Power in the first-generation Murano came from a 245-hp version of Nissan's corporate 3.5-liter V-6. The power flowed to front- or all-wheel drive via a CVT. While CVTs can improve fuel economy, they also generally add to powertrain noise and can be slow to respond to driver inputs. The Murano's CVT was easily the least attractive part of its package, though later versions have shown improvement.</p>, <p>After Nissan skipped the 2008 model year altogether, the 2009 Murano didn't differ too dramatically from the original underneath. The design changed nearly all for the better, though, save for a toothy grille slotted in up front. The running gear migrated to the fourth-generation Nissan Altima platform, and the powertrain was updated to 265 hp (it's now rated at 260 hp). The CVT was upgraded to include programmed "gears" that gave the transmission the feel of an automatic gearbox, with paddle shifters enabling driver choice of the ratios.</p>, <p>Nissan expanded the Murano family for 2012 with the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_murano-crosscabriolet">unusual CrossCabriolet convertible</a>. Nissan also spun off a new 2013 Pathfinder seven-seat crossover along with a similar Infiniti JX35 seven-seater—which got a new name, Infiniti QX60, for 2014—all from the same basic architecture. For 2013, Nissan added a few features and options, and made several active-safety systems available, including object detection, blind-spot monitoring, and lane-departure warning.</p>, <p>After very weak sales, the Murano CrossCabriolet was dropped at the end of the 2014 model year.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_370z
[<p>The Nissan 370Z is a rear-drive sports car tracing its origins back to the 1969 Datsun 240Z.</p>, <p>Currently available in both coupe and convertible forms, the Nissan 370Z provides sporty handling and styling at a relatively low price, a combination matched by few other cars on the market.</p>, <p>With the 370Z, Nissan has a rival for small lightweight coupes and convertibles such as the Subaru BRZ, Toyota 86, Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, and Audi A3.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_370z_2018">2018 Nissan 370Z review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan 370Z</strong></p>, <p>The 370Z, introduced in 2009, carried that rekindled Z-car enthusiasm forward. It brought a slightly larger, more powerful, 332-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine and a slightly shorter, lighter new body. While the exterior design of the 370Z is more futuristic and striking than the more classically proportioned yet modern 350 was, the cabin is where the bulk of the improvements over the previous Z-car came. Better materials, more modern and intricate design, and greater creature comfort helped transform the 370Z into the grand tourer the 350Z didn't quite manage to be.</p>, <p>Despite the improvement in accommodations, the 370Z didn't lose its performance edge, its slightly lighter weight helping to maintain agility, and the higher-output engine leading to impressive acceleration. An innovative automatic rev-matching solution for the 6-speed manual transmission bridged the gap between the convenience of a dual-clutch automatic and the purity and engagement of a traditional manual. Other manufacturers, including Porsche and Chevrolet, have followed suit with their own rev-matching manual transmissions. A 7-speed automatic transmission is also offered on today's Z, and it works surprisingly well for a conventional torque-converter unit.</p>, <p>The 370Z was offered only as a hatchback coupe at first, either with base performance or in the more track-oriented NISMO model. The latter features a 350-hp version of the 3.7-liter V-6, upgraded brakes, a stiffer suspension setup, and unique styling with a focus on aerodynamics. While it's definitely the quicker option, it loses some of the regular model's civility in the transformation to track attacker.</p>, <p>Nissan added a Z roadster back into the lineup for 2010. The convertible 370Z was intended from the start to look as good as its coupe sibling, unlike its odd-looking 350Z Roadster predecessor, which looked like the afterthought that it was. It uses a power-folding soft top, which can open or hide in 20 seconds. When the top is down, it sits below a hard tonneau cover that conceals it and its mechanism entirely.</p>, <p>A number of special editions and anniversary specials of the 370Z have been released as well, offering unique appearances and limited-edition status.</p>, <p>
The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_370z_2013">2013 Nissan 370Z</a> carried forward largely unchanged from the previous model year, including Coupe, Roadster, and NISMO variants. The 2014 model year saw no major updates, though the price was cut by about $3,000 for the base model.</p>, <p>For 2015, the NISMO model gained a new automatic transmission—a first for the high-performance model—as well as slightly revised exterior styling. Packages and features were reworked for the 2015 model year across non-NISMO Coupe and Roadster variants, while Coupe models also received standard Bluetooth connectivity on all trim levels, upgraded audio, and standard navigation on the Touring trim level. </p>, <p>Coupes and convertibles are now available in Touring, Sport, and Sport Tech trim levels, the later two of which were new for 2015.</p>, <p>Pricing now places the 370Z roughly in the $30,000 to $45,000 range, putting the upper end of the range in competition with some more luxurious—but slightly less sporty—alternatives, in addition to its typical sports-car set.</p>, <p>The 2016 370Z saw several minor changes. The most important was a noise-canceling system fitted to the coupes in all but base form; it reduces the annoying booming that is transmitted throughout the hatchback-coupe body by canceling out some of the engine and tire drone.</p>, <p>For 2017, the 370Z added a bright yellow, dubbed Chicane Yellow, to the roster. In 2018, Nissan added slightly darker headlights and taillights, slightly reshaped rear bumper, and a Heritage Yellow option for base coupes.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan 370Z history</strong></p>, <p>The Z car line has a lot of history behind it and has taken many forms over the years. Those first Z coupes were powered by inline-6 cylinder engines, but by the time Datsun had become Nissan and the Z had entered its third generation in 1984, the sports car had made the switch to V-6s. Those engines displaced either 2.0 or 3.0 liters, with the larger one later getting the twin-turbo treatment and making a very satisfying 300 hp in the 300ZX TT. That engine, as well as naturally aspirated versions, was used in the Z-car in North America right up until the line went out of production in 1996.</p>, <p>After seven years dormant, the Z returned in the form of the 350Z. Packing a 3.5-liter V-6 engine rated at 287 hp (eventually uprated to 306 hp by the end of the model run), the new 350Z was hailed as a bargain for the performance and handling it offered, bridging the gap between compact sports cars and more full-sized grand touring sports coupes, while starting at less than $30,000. During its six-year model run, the 350Z won awards and praise for bringing Nissan back to the performance-car fold.</p>]

[<p>The Nissan Juke is a five-passenger crossover SUV with an especially quirky style that helps it sound out from its more conventional rivals.</p>, <p>Hidden behind its polarizing styling is a very sophisticated powertrain that combines a high-zoot turbocharged engine with a terrific all-wheel-drive system and a balanced chassis. It's a standout for many reasons, although there are a number of compromises as well.</p>, <p>A manual transmission is harder to find in the Juke this year than it has been in the past. For 2017, a special paint scheme dubbed "Black Pearl" was the most notable change from the prior year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_juke_2017" title="2015 Nissan Juke - review">2017 Nissan Juke review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Juke is due to be replaced in the 2018 model year by the new <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_kicks"><strong>Nissan Kicks</strong></a>.</p>, <p>The Juke is available in S, SV, and SL trims, while the sportier NISMO variant is available in base and RS trims. All are offered in front- or all-wheel drive, but the only way to order one with a stick shift is to opt for a front-wheel drive NISMO or NISMO RS. </p>, <p>The Juke is a rival for vehicles such as the Kia Soul and Fiat 500L tall hatchbacks, the Mini Countryman, and probably the slightly larger Subaru XV Crosstrek hatchback. In the past year or so, however, the segment further expanded to include the Jeep Renegade, Fiat 500X, Chevy Trax, Mazda CX-3, and Honda HR-V. The Juke was one of the first to enter the segment, and its unique styling may help it against those more traditionally styled offerings, but competition is certainly increasing.</p>, <p>Despite a platform shared with the tall Cube and last-generation Sentra, the Juke is built to be a sporty car. The engine, a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 may not always produce all the power that its 188-horsepower rating suggests—drivers have to learn to rev it—and it's far from quiet, but the acceleration is strong once you get there. We prefer the 6-speed manual to the continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), even though the latter comes with simulated "gears" that you can click between. All-wheel drive is available, but comes only with the CVT.</p>, <p>For a relatively tall car, the Juke performs well, and all will agree that what it does provide is good handling, along with a sharp, athletic driving experience. On the road, we noticed that impact harshness can be an issue in the Juke over some surfaces, although our editorial team is mixed overall on how well the Juke rides.</p>, <p>Despite its underpinnings, the quirky, brash, bug-eyed Juke doesn't offer nearly the interior space of the Sentra or the bygone Cube. The Juke's size makes it a fun and interesting alternative to compact hatchbacks, but it doesn't have the packaging to back up its crossover-esque looks. Four adults can fit, but the cabin is somewhat narrow, rear leg room is tight, and there's limited head room in the rear because of the dipping roofline. The front seats could use some more support, and their placement up high blocks the view of rear-seat passengers. Those in back are at least treated to adjustable seat-back rake, which can alleviate some height issues, but it also eats into the Juke's modest 10.5 cubic feet of cargo room. That said, the Juke is more an urban fashion accessory than a utility vehicle.</p>, <p>For the 2011 and 2012 model years, the Juke was offered in three trim levels, with the base model including Bluetooth connectivity, an auxiliary audio jack, power accessories, keyless entry, and 17-inch wheels. Mid-range SV models added keyless ignition, satellite radio, a moonroof, and automatic climate control; while top-of-the-line Juke SL models got Rockford Fosgate audio, a USB port, and a small-screen navigation system.</p>, <p>A handful of minor changes arrived for the 2013 model year, but the hotter Juke Nismo took until 2014 before arriving. That <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079226_2013-nissan-juke-nismo-preview-2012-paris-auto-show">Nissan Juke Nismo</a> sports a 215-hp version of its turbocharged, direct-injected 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine, along with an even more firmly tuned suspension to go with its specially developed torque-vectoring system. Nissan also added the slightly more aggressive Juke Nismo RS to take the little crossover another step into performance land with even more power.</p>, <p>The Juke received its first major update for the 2015 model year. The front and rear styling was revised, with LED accent lighting at both ends as well as new projector headlamps. Inside, the interior received a modest redesign, and Nissan added more standard equipment than before. All Jukes now include a rearview camera, keyless ignition, and the NissanConnect infotainment system, which is operated through a 5.0-inch touchscreen and offers Bluetooth, USB, and iPod connectivity. Jukes can also be customized through the dealer with the Juke Color Studio, which offers 12 accessories in eight different colors, allowing customers to make the interesting looking little crossover truly unique, or perhaps weirder looking. It's all in the eye of the beholder.</p>, <p>Nissan has made only one change of note for 2016 by adding Siri Eyes Free iPhone control to all models.</p>, <p>For 2017, Nissan made standard in SV and SL models heated seats and outside mirrors, and offered a special edition version with an all-black exterior with white trim pieces. Nissan limited the manual transmission's availability further to front-drive NISMO models only.</p>, <p>One serious downside that we—along with most other reviewers—have noticed is the Juke's surprising thirst. While EPA ratings land at 28 mpg city, 32 highway, 30 combined with the front-wheel-drive CVT model and 24/34/30 mpg with the manual gearbox (or 26/31/28 mpg with AWD), we haven't seen higher than about 24 mpg across a wide range of conditions. Turbocharged engines often do not do as well in the real world as they do under EPA test conditions, and that appears to be the case here.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_pathfinder
[<p>The Nissan Pathfinder is a large crossover SUV that can seat up to seven passengers. </p>, <p>The Pathfinder has been part of Nissan's utility vehicle lineup since the 1980s and older and tougher Pathfinders competed against off-roaders. That's no longer the case, however, as today the Pathfinder squares off against crossovers with three rows like the Honda Pilot, the Toyota Highlander, the Ford Explorer, and the GMC Acadia.</p>, <p><em><strong><a>MORE: Read our</a> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_pathfinder_2018">2018 Nissan Pathfinder review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>After a slight refresh in 2017 that added more power, reshaped bumpers and a new infotainment system, Nissan made standard in 2018 safety features such as a rear seat reminder and forward automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The Infiniti QX60 is related to the Nissan Pathfinder under its skin. The Infiniti skews toward luxury, but the Pathfinder relishes in family duty. Both have recently discontinued a slow-selling hybrid powertrain option.</p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Pathfinder</strong></p>, <p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1071311_2013-nissan-pathfinder-preview-2012-detroit-auto-show">new Pathfinder</a> that arrived for the 2013 model year was <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1079904_2013-nissan-pathfinder-first-drive">a more car-like crossover vehicle</a> than it had been in the past. It is distantly related to the Nissan Murano, including the 3.5-liter V-6 engine and continuously variable transmission (CVT). It's offered with standard front-wheel drive or optional all-wheel drive. The latest Pathfinder handles and responds well on streets and highways, and trades the earlier models' towing and off-roading abilities for on-road ride and comfort, versatility, and seating space for seven.</p>, <p>Changes for 2017 improve several elements of the Pathfinder. The addition of direct injection and electronic variable valve timing, among other changes, improve horsepower from 260 to 284 and raise torque from 240 to 259 pound-feet. The suspension settings are stiffer, bringing a bit more control as well as a firmer ride. A new NissanConnect infotainment system comes with a larger 8.0-inch touchscreen, pinch and swipe controls, tile icons, and several connective services. Finally, new safety features are added, including adaptive cruise control, moving object detection for the surround-view camera system, and forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>A Pathfinder Hybrid crossover was added to Nissan's lineup for the 2014 model year, though it lasted only one year. The V-6 found in other versions was replaced in the Hybrid by a supercharged 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and an 15-kilowatt (22 hp) electric motor. The motor was located between a modified CVT and the engine, and the two power sources combined for a net of 250 hp. Unlike some other hybrids, the gas-electric Pathfinder couldn't run on electric power alone, but the motor assist helped to improve gas-mileage ratings by about 20 percent. That said, the Pathfinder Hybrid felt noticeably slower than the V-6 model, so the economy improvement was certainly a trade-off.</p>, <p>The current Pathfinder scores fairly well in crash testing, with a five-star overall rating (though four stars in front and rollover tests) from the NHTSA. It includes many safety features as standard or optional equipment, including blind-spot monitoring and lane-departure warning. The addition of the forward collision warning system helped it earn the IIHS honor.</p>, <p>For the 2015 model year, Nissan made only a few minor changes to the Pathfinder, dropping the Hybrid model, updating the CVT with stepped gear ratios, and shuffling equipment.</p>, <p>For 2016, it also received very minor changes, including a standard heated steering wheel on the SL model and a revised Almond interior color with black and beige contrasting materials.</p>, <p><strong>Pathfinder history</strong></p>, <p>When that first Pathfinder was launched back in the 1980s, it was a hardscrabble truck model with seating for five in a very basic interior, crude appointments, and a rough ride. It wasn't until 1996 that it began to take on trappings of passenger friendliness. The previous-generation Pathfinder had been closely related to Nissan's Hardbody compact pickup, but only up until the mid-1990s Pathfinder traded the truck-based body-on-frame design for a new unibody that helped provide better ride and handling—though it still shared a 168-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 with the pickups.</p>, <p>Things changed significantly in 2001 when the Pathfinder got a more modern engine. A 3.5-liter V-6 making 240 hp arrived to solve the power problem. While the Pathfinder was still capable off-road, the Xterra joined it in the Nissan lineup, offering a more rugged alternative to the more-civilized Pathfinder. The Pathfinder retained its ability to tow and its somewhat stiff suspension, however, as well as its tight rear seat.</p>, <p>Before the current model, the Pathfinder was last completely redesigned for 2005, returning to body-on-frame construction that was once again closely related to that of the Frontier pickup as well as the Xterra. A 270-hp, 4.0-liter V-6 was standard, providing plenty of power for most needs, but a 310-hp, 5.6-liter V-8 was optional beginning in 2008. Those tempted by the V-8 in used examples should be forewarned that fuel economy is acutely atrocious with that engine.</p>, <p>That newly optional V-8 was accompanied by a design overhaul for the 2008 model year. Nissan gave the Pathfinder's front end a slight visual adjustment and made upgrades to the interior that year. The crossover saw few big changes through the 2012 model year, though the lineup did include SE Off-Road models in 2008 and 2009 with features aimed at trail enthusiasts, including a skid-plate package, off-road tires, and longer-travel Bilstein dampers.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_quest
[<p>The Nissan Quest is the Japanese automaker's minivan. The nameplate was introduced for the 1993 model year, and since then, the Quest badge has been applied to three very different generations of people haulers—although all of them have been minivans.</p>, <p>With the Quest, Nissan offers a vehicle that is able to transport up to seven passengers with a more sprightly driving feel than some of its minivan rivals—vehicles such as the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey, Dodge Grand Caravan, and revamped Kia Sedona, and Chrysler Pacifica.</p>, <p>The Quest was last redesigned in 2011. The 2017 model is unchanged from 2016. It's a likable van, but its poor crash test scores put it at odds with its family-oriented positioning, which led to Nissan pulling the van after 2017.</p>, <p><strong><strong><em><em>MORE: Read</em> our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_quest_2017" title="2013 Nissan Quest - review">2017 Nissan Quest review</a></em></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Quest</strong></p>, <p>With its most recent redesign in 2011, the Quest moved to a platform shared with a Japanese-market van, a vehicle it is now built alongside. Nissan made some tweaks to try and Americanize the platform, but its home-market roots show through. It now has less interior space than competitors, no nifty seat tricks, and fewer of the high-visibility features that make other minivans so practical. The smaller size may be seen as a boon for some, but most minivan buyers are looking for maximum practicality and not necessarily a tidier package. It is at least one of the better looking vans, as far as that goes, with an attractive floating-roof look thanks to blacked out side profile. But minivans are rarely purchased on style concerns alone.</p>, <p>Carried over mostly unchanged since it was launched for 2011, the Quest simply doesn't have the flexibility or features to compete with Chrysler's minivans. Its seats no longer fold into the floor, and they cannot be removed, making it the least adaptable minivan on the market. Its interior volume has fallen, because it's based on a Japanese-market minivan called the Elgrand, and the openings of the sliding side doors are narrower—apparently not designed with us big Americans in mind.</p>, <p>The current Quest at least performs better than the model it replaces. Power comes from Nissan's corporate 3.5-liter V-6, here making 260 horsepower and linked to a continuously variable transmission. The van's smaller size and lower weight mean good acceleration with this combination. That's about the only place it beats the competition, though. The Quest lags behind in infotainment options, and it's one of very few minivans to not score a Top Safety Pick with the IIHS as a result of its "Acceptable" ranking in roof-crush safety and "Poor" grade in the small overlap front crash test.</p>, <p>The Quest was unchanged for 2017 and will be discontinued after this model year.</p>, <p><strong><strong>Nissan Quest history</strong></strong></p>, <p>Before the current Quest went on sale, two previous editions had managed the family-van duties for Nissan. They were quite different from each other in both specification and size.</p>, <p>The first Quest was launched in 1993 to replace the odd Axxess tall wagon. Aimed at the heart of the minivan market, it was powered by a 151-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 and 4-speed automatic. While that first Quest minivan had decent space, the seating configuration wasn't particularly versatile compared to the best competitors. The third-row seat slid on a track, but none of its rear seats could be stowed under the vehicle's load floor. It was co-developed with Ford, which sold a similar model under the Mercury Villager nameplate.</p>, <p>A refreshed version was sold from 1999 through 2002, which built on the existing van but upgraded to a 170-hp, 3.3-liter V-6. (A design refresh and the same upgrades came to the Villager, as well.) This version included three rows of seating, but yet again, its interior space and ease of reconfiguration suffered in comparison to the rest of the segment. Filled with sub-par hard plastics, the interior wasn't very welcoming, but the second-generation Quest drove quite well, with a smooth ride and reasonably responsive handling. That said, its 3.3-liter V-6 never felt as perky as its power figures might suggest.</p>, <p>Through 2002, when the second-generation Quest was discontinued, a slightly different version was sold as the Villager by Ford's now-discontinued Mercury brand. Compared to the Quest, the Villager had a slightly upmarket look, and in some cases the Villager could be bought with more equipment for less money than the Quest.</p>, <p>After a yearlong absence, Nissan returned in 2004 with a completely new Quest. Much larger than the previous model, this one set a style statement that was completely unlike its predecessor or any other van on the market. Aiming for fashionista families, the Quest employed a flowing, organic exterior with an even more dramatic interior. In addition, seating was completely redone, with all three rows given a more luxurious look in other minivans. A conventional instrument panel was eschewed for a plasticky setup that included an oval-shaped, podlike center stack, housing climate controls and audio, with the shifter mounted up on the dash. Gauges were up in the center of the instrument panel, along with a trip computer screen or navigation screen.</p>, <p>Although slightly less functional, this was clearly the most stylish minivan on the market. But the new Quest was never well received. Its interior was functionally better, as both the second and third rows were made to fold flat into the floor. Those seats weren't that comfortable or supportive, though, and the one-piece third-row seat proved cumbersome. Safety proved to be an issue, too; even in 2009, electronic stability control still wasn't standard. But strengths included strong acceleration from the 235-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and smooth shifts from the 5-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Nissan addressed some, but certainly not all, of the Quest's deficiencies in 2007, when it smoothed over the instrument panel, brought the gauges in front of the driver, upgraded interior materials, and introduced integrated headrests for the second and third rows that automatically tilted forward when folding, making stowing easier.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_armada
[<p>The Nissan Armada is the largest SUV in the Japanese automaker's lineup. Redesigned for the 2017 model year, it now rides on the platform from its Infiniti QX80 stablemate and uses the sheet metal from the global Patrol SUV. The first-generation Armada used the chassis from the first-generation Titan full-size pickup. The Armada can seat up to eight and tow up to 8,500 pounds. </p>, <p>With the Armada, Nissan competes with Toyota Sequoia, Ford Expedition, GMC Yukon/Yukon XL and the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban.</p>, <p>Redesigned last year, the Armada adds a new Platinum Reserve trim level for 2018. Additionally, the rearview mirror on high-spec trim levels now doubles as a display fed by a camera for a real-time view of what's going on behind the vehicle without roof pillar and passenger head obstructions.</p>, <p><strong><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_armada_2018">2018 Nissan Armada review</a></em></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Armada</strong></p>, <p>The Nissan Armada is basically a U.S. version of the global Nissan Patrol SUV with a frame adopted from the Infiniti QX80. It retains its body-on-frame design and its eight-passenger seating, but gets new styling and new engineering, plus additional safety features.</p>, <p>The new Armada rides a wheelbase that is 2.1 inches shorter than the outgoing model, yet it is 1.2 inches longer, 0.6 inch wider, and it sits 2.2 inches lower. Under the hood it features the new 5.6-liter Endurance V-8 making 390 horsepower (up from 385) and 394 pound-feet of torque (from 317). Compared to the outgoing 5.6-liter V-8, this new engine features direct injection and Nissan's Variable Valve Event and Lift, which has variable valve timing and variable valve lift for both the intake and exhaust sides. It is mated to a new 7-speed automatic transmission (instead of a 5-speed) with downshift rev-matching. The engine improvements and extra gears improve fuel economy, but this is still one thirsty SUV.</p>, <p>Rear- and four-wheel drive are offered. The four-wheel-drive system has low-range gearing and can send 50 percent of the torque to the front wheels when it detects slip. Properly outfitted, the Nissan Armada can tow up to 8,500 pounds.</p>, <p>The styling features a bold, chromed version of Nissan's "V Motion" grille. LED headlights and daytime running lights are standard, and fog lights are standard on higher line models. The taillights are also LEDs. Functional air intakes are located in the front fenders, and all four fenders have contrasting paint on the wheel flares. The overall look is macho, though it also adopts some of the soft, organic shapes of the Infiniti QX80.</p>, <p>Nissan moves the interior upmarket with materials that look good and feel substantial, even if the wood trim is really plastic. The acoustic glass windshield and front windows, and additional sound deadening material give the interior what Nissan calls "library levels" of interior noise, making normal conversation easy. Space is excellent in the first two rows, but the third-row seat is quite tight. Cargo space, however, is plentiful.</p>, <p>A stiffer frame gives the new Armada more controlled driving dynamics, but this big beast still leans in turns and suffers from slow steering. The ride is quite smooth, though, and the improved V-8 cuts the 0-to-60-mph time to the mid-6-second range while emitting great sounds.</p>, <p>New safety features include adaptive cruise control, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, and active lane control. That's a far cry from the previous generation Armada, which basically only had a rearview camera.</p>, <p>The 2018 Armada gains a new Platinum Reserve trim level and adds a rearview mirror that can also display a live feed from a camera mounted to the rear of the vehicle.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Armada History</strong></p>, <p>When it first hit the market in for the 2004 model year, this 'ute was called the Pathfinder Armada, referencing Nissan's mid-size SUV. In years since, it has become known simply as Armada, while the smaller Pathfinder has moved to a car-based platform.</p>, <p>Since launch, all Armadas have been powered by a 5.6-liter V-8 engine. The first generation made 317 horsepower and was paired with a 5-speed automatic and a choice of either rear- or four-wheel drive. The Armada has always aimed to be muscular. The V-8 didn't make it a straight-line rocket but did provide care-free hauling and was rated to tow a load of up to 9,000 pounds.</p>, <p>Fuel economy ratings were never terribly competitive, only looking worse as time passed and competitors improved. At the end of its run, the EPA rated the least-efficient setup at 12 mpg city, 18 highway, while we've seen lower in our own testing.</p>, <p>The Armada has always offered seating for up to eight, with plenty of space for adults to sprawl in the first and second rows. Nissan also offered more than enough storage spaces and cubbies throughout.</p>, <p>While the Armada's interior design was quite attractive and different than those of other trucks, its cabin materials were never that impressive. The plastics used in the instrument panel, doors, and console, in particular, felt a step behind its rivals. Refinement was lacking, too, with a bit more road and wind noise and a gruff, ever-present character to the engine.</p>, <p>Few changes came the Armada's way over the years. In 2008, the big SUV underwent a mild aesthetic refresh, adding some shiny trim outside, some wood inside, and configuring the third-row seats; the large Nissan also got more standard equipment, with the addition of newer navigation and infotainment systems and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>Until 2011 the Armada was closely related to the more luxurious Infiniti QX56, though that SUV was built on a different platform and was renamed QX80. For 2015, the Armada received restyled door panels, new 20-inch wheels, and some new paint colors. There was no 2016 model year.</p>]

[<p>The Nissan GT-R is a 2+2 sportscar that posts some of the fastest acceleration times of any production vehicle. Powered by a twin-turbocharged V-6 that issues power to all four wheels with the help of advanced electronics, the GT-R delivers performance on par with supercars costing twice its price or more.</p>, <p>The so-called R35 generation made its debut in 2007, but we received it in the United States for the 2009 model year.</p>, <p>With the GT-R, Nissan has a contender for the Chevrolet Corvette and Porsche 911—even some supercars including the Audi R8. Although its price has risen since its introduction, the GT-R is a relatively affordable supercar when its performance is considered.</p>, <p>For 2018, the GT-R added a <span id="docs-internal-guid-6df21dd4-6b8a-d0c5-a8a6-95ab6c187b0d">Pure trim level to keep the base price near $100,000. Apple CarPlay became standard and a black interior trim package was added.</span></p>, <p><span><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_gt-r_2018">2018 Nissan GT-R review</a></strong></em></span></p>, <p>The GT-R draws on a heritage of performance from a long line of <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079962_1972-nissan-gt-r-ride-in-the-first-generation-video">Japanese-market Nissan Skyline sport coupes</a>, not all of which were top-shelf sports cars. Today, just a quick look at the GT-R's spec sheet is enough to see that it qualifies as a supercar. It has a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6, now making 565 horsepower (up from 473 hp at its introduction) and 467 pound-feet of torque, and its unique design features the engine in front, the transmission in back, and all-wheel drive to put all that power to the road.</p>, <p>From behind the wheel, the GT-R delivers dizzying acceleration, including 0-60 times of under 3 seconds and a top speed upward of 193 mph. Shifting is handled by a dual-clutch, automated manual gearbox. In normal driving, it's hard to scratch the surface of the GT-R's performance potential, but once on a tight road or a racetrack the combination of the immense power and sophisticated all-wheel-drive components brings a video-game-like experience—the car manages things that seem impossible, creating a surreal feeling of detachment for the driver. That said, handling is excellent and the variable power-split all-wheel-drive system not only makes the car fast, but also safe and easy to operate.</p>, <p>The GT-R's shape is nowhere near as exotic as those of most of its competitors; Nissan's all-wheel-drive coupe can appear downright blocky and chunky from afar. Once you approach, however, you start to see the details, like its cantilevered roofline, big rear wing, and iconic circular taillights. Inside the GT-R, there's a very driver-focused feel, something different from all other Nissan products, with a center screen designed and programmed with help from video game makers.</p>, <p>After its release in the U.S., Nissan updated the GT-R nearly every year, especially in the performance department. The 2010 model year brought a brake upgrade that consisted of more rigid lines, and there was an update to the stability-control programming. A Cold Weather package, an iPod interface, and forged RAYS wheels with a smoked finish were added as well. There were two trim levels for 2012, base and Premium, with the more expensive one including upgraded Bose audio and heated seats.</p>, <p>Nissan discontinued the Launch Control feature early on due to excessive warranty claims. Since launch control had helped yield the GT-R's excellent acceleration times—with some testers saying the GT-R was a second or more slower to 60 mph without it—Nissan restored it in a limited way for the 2012 model year, while it also boosted total output to 530 hp. Those changes brought the supercar's 60-mph runs down to about three seconds, according to buff-book numbers. Other changes for the 2012 model year included a special Black Edition and revised interior trim.</p>, <p>Nissan brought a more <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080223_2014-nissan-gt-r-preview">extensive round of improvements for 2014</a>. In addition to some structural reinforcements, the new GT-R got revised suspension mounts that lowered its center of mass. A special <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082198_2014-nissan-gt-r-track-edition-photo-gallery">Track Edition</a> was also offered. Peak output for the engine remained at 545 hp and 463 lb-ft, though mid-range response was improved with high-output fuel injectors and revised turbochargers. Pricing <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081912_2014-nissan-gt-r-priced-from-99590">rose to a base of $99,590</a>.</p>, <p>The 2015 Nissan GT-R brought the Nismo edition to reality, turning the wick up to 600 hp and 480 lb-ft, and setting a new GT-R Nürburgring lap record along the way. A Premium model offered slightly tamer performance with more focus on refinement and luxury, with the base price rising to $101,770, and there was also a GT-R Black Edition. The standard models received some updates, including new LED headlights, a Bose noise-canceling system to reduce engine booming, additional sound insulation, retuned shocks and chassis elements, and a Premium Interior package for the Premium model.</p>, <p>For 2016, the GT-R Premium model got new 20-inch Rays wheels. Nissan also offered a limited run of 45th-anniversary GT-Rs in the U.S.; the model was previously announced for Japan only. Fewer than 30 of the 45th Anniversary Gold Edition cars were imported, at a price of $102,770, and they all came with <span>special gold paint, a gold-tone VIN plate in the engine compartment, and a commemorative plaque on the center console.</span></p>, <p>The 2017 Nissan GT-R went on sale in 2016 after extensive changes, including 20 more horsepower, an extensively revised suspension tuning, an updated interior, a new infotainment system, and styling tweaks front and rear. It's expected to be the last major update for the GT-R before the all-new R36 model arrives, currently <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1087858_nissan-design-chief-next-gen-gt-r-arriving-2018-at-the-earliest" title="Nissan Design Chief: Next-Gen GT-R Arriving 2018 At The Earliest">thought to be sometime around 2018</a>.</p>, <p>The most noticeable exterior changes were to the front end, which got a new mesh grille and a matte finish. The revised front lip spoiler and bumper design added downforce, and the hood had more pronounced character lines. Along the sides, the sills were pushed outward to improve airflow and the 20-inch wheels featured a new 15-spoke design. The rear end got new bodywork, with functional vents next to the quad exhaust tips. Nissan said these changes make the car more stable at high speeds while maintaining the same 0.26 coefficient of drag. A new Blaze Metallic orange color was added to the color palette.</p>, <p>The changes inside included a new dashboard, with an emphasis on a horizontal layout and an instrument panel wrapped in nappa leather. An 8.0-inch touchscreen replaced a 7.0-inch unit, and the number of knobs and switches fell from 27 to 11. A Display Command controller was added to the center console, and the car got the NissanConnect system with navigation and access to mobile apps. The seats became lighter thanks to a new construction technique. The shift paddles also moved from the steering column to the steering wheel.</p>, <p>In addition to the new interior look, the 2017 GT-R grew quieter inside thanks to more sound deadener and an acoustic glass windshield. The Premium Edition model also added Rakuda Tan to its list of color choices.</p>, <p>Nissan also borrowed the GT-R name for its oddball Le Mans racer, the GT-R LM Nismo. This unconventional machine used front-wheel drive with monstrous tires in front and also benefited from a hybrid flywheel that could send power to both the front and rear axles. Its 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine was a relative of the street GT-R's. Unfortunately, that car lasted only one rather unsuccessful race season.</p>]

[<p>The Nissan Frontier is a mid-size pickup truck, made by the Japanese automaker in Mississippi. A relative of the full-size Titan truck, the Frontier has offered good cargo hauling capability as well as off-road ability, but its aging design has lost ground, especially in the face of renewed competition from GM's trucks and the updated Toyota Tacoma.</p>, <p>With the Frontier, Nissan can compete in a growing segment of mid-size trucks that include the Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Colorado, and GMC Canyon—all of which are much newer. The Nissan appeals, in part, because of its low price. Not much has changed for 2018. We expect a replacement within a year or two, but we've been saying that for a year or four.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_frontier_2018">2018 Nissan Frontier review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Frontier</strong></p>, <p>Nissan introduced a new Frontier for 2005, and that same basic truck continues to be offered today, a decade later. The current Frontier is based on the company's F-Alpha architecture, which was first introduced for the larger Titan pickup. This Frontier is larger and slightly heavier than the one it replaced. Because of this, Nissan markets its smaller pickup as a mid-sizer.</p>, <p>With its 2005 redesign, the Frontier made some major advances in safety. For a few years, the Frontier was rated "Good" in many tests by the IIHS—unlike compact trucks like the Ranger and last-generation Colorado and Canyon. Since then, not much has been done in the way of crash testing, however.</p>, <p>For 2007, a longer-bed Crew Cab model was first offered, which gave the Frontier nearly full-size proportions. In 2009, Nissan gave the Frontier a mid-cycle refresh, with slightly different front-end styling as well as revised interior trim. A more focused PRO-4X off-road model was also released. More recently, the Frontier received a small fuel-economy boost, and a new Desert Runner package. Bluetooth became standard on most models, and Nissan expanded availability of dual-zone climate control, navigation, a rearview camera, and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>Today's Frontiers don't do nearly as well with the 152-hp, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, which feels overwhelmed even on the limited models in which it was available. But the 261-hp, 4.0-liter V-6 that's offered with this generation is strong and smooth, with plenty of torque and a relaxed character with the automatic transmission.</p>, <p>A choice of extended- and crew-cab body styles are offered, as is four-wheel drive. Many Frontiers get a standard spray-on bedliner, while the Utili-track channel and tie-down system is handy for securing smaller heavy items like an engine or a small ATV. Both were market standouts when introduced but have since been adopted by other truckmakers.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Frontier was largely unchanged aside from a new body-color rear bumper on the base S trim level and a new Work Truck package for that model that adds utility-minded features like a spray-in bedliner and rubber floor mats. The 2018 model gained a standard rearview camera and air conditioning.</p>, <p>In recent years, Nissan has moved production of the Frontier from Tennessee to its newer truck, SUV, and commercial-vehicle plant in Mississippi.</p>, <p>A new Frontier had been expected in the next model year or two, and Nissan has shown a concept Frontier pickup outfitted with a diesel engine. </p>, <p><strong>Nissan Frontier history</strong></p>, <p>The Nissan Frontier is the successor to what was once called the Nissan Hardbody. That pickup brought Nissan out of its Datsun years, and became a staple of the small-truck market.</p>, <p>Introduced for 1998 and lightly updated over the course of a decade, the Frontier started to establish its current style in 2001 when it gained a more rugged appearance that mainly involved clipped-on wheel well flares, plus a chunkier-looking grille and front air dam.</p>, <p>These models did quite well with the standard 148-horsepower, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine; the 168-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 engine was a decent choice for those who towed or hauled heavy loads. Most Frontiers of this vintage are regular or King Cab (extended) body styles, though a Crew Cab model was introduced for 2000.</p>]

[<p>The Nissan Altima is a four-door, mid-size family sedan in one of the most competitive new-car niches. Sold in base, S, SR, SV, SL, and Platinum trim levels, the Altima is a rival for vehicles such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, as well as the Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata, and many others.</p>, <p>The Altima nameplate has been on the market for two decades, but today's car bears little in common with its predecessors. Upsized and designed specifically to fulfill the demands of American consumers, the Altima is Nissan's most decidedly mainstream vehicle. Originally a compact sedan, and later reinvigorated with a healthy dose of performance including a coupe version, today's Altima shoots for the mainstream—it's affordable, comfortable, and fuel-thrifty. </p>, <p><strong>The new 2019 Nissan Altima</strong></p>, <p dir="ltr">The 2019 Nissan Altima takes on the latest Camry and Accord without its former V-6, but with available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Restyled for the new model year, the Altima has a deep new V-shaped grille, a steeply raked hood and windshield, and a more crisply stamped profile. Its dash lays lower, with a central touchscreen that rises from the middle and runs infotainment functions.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Under the hood, the Altima offers turbocharged and naturally aspirated inline-4 engines. The base 2.5-liter inline-4 has 188 horsepower, and couples to a CVT. Power goes to either the front or to all four wheels. The bigger news is the Altima's new 2.0-liter turbo-4; with a complex variable compression system, it generates 248 hp and couples to a CVT and front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Other engineering improvements give the Altima a refined strut-and-link suspension, electric dual-pinion power steering, and monotube rear shocks. Base 16-inch wheels grow to 19-inchers on the Altima SR.</p>, <p><strong><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_altima_2019">2019 Nissan Altima preview</a></em></strong></strong></p>, <p dir="ltr">The new 2019 Altima rides on a 111.2-inch wheelbase, up by almost two inches, and sits 192.9 inches long in all. Nissan promises more interior space, and the driver gets an eight-way power seat.</p>, <p>Nissan retains standard forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking on the new car. Blind-spot monitors, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control are options. The 2019 Altima can be fitted with Nissan’s Level 2 semi-autonomous driving hardware, which assists the driver with steering and braking input.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Other features include keyless ignition, a USB-C port, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The 2019 Altima goes on sale in the fall of 2018.</p>, <p><strong dir="ltr">The fifth-generation Nissan Altima, 2013-2018<br/></strong></p>, <p>Previewed at the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1075091_2013-nissan-altima-live-photos-2012-new-york-auto-show">2012 New York auto show</a>, the current Nissan Altima went on sale that same year as a 2013 model. Essentially carried over for the 2014 and 2015 model years, the Altima retained the inline-4 and V-6 engines of the previous generation, as well as its continuously variable transmission (CVT).</p>, <p>On 182-horsepower 4-cylinder cars, improvements to the CVT nudged the sedan to an <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1075099_2013-nissan-altima-promises-up-to-38-mpg-highway-fuel-economy">EPA-estimated 38 mpg highway</a>, among the best in its class. The thirstier 270-hp V-6 added paddle controls and programmed "shift" points to the CVT that simulate the feel of a conventional automatic gearbox. Excellent seats and a tightly assembled interior are among the highlights of the current generation of Altima sedans.</p>, <p>The Altima sedan was largely unchanged for the 2015 model year. A mid-cycle refresh came in the 2016 model year; with no major powertrain changes, the updates brought a new front end with a Maxima-like grille, some modified interior trim, and a revised suspension designed to improve ride quality. Some minor retuning to the car's transmission, combined with some aerodynamic tweaking, boosted highway fuel economy for all 4-cylinders other than the SR, which rides on sportier tires, to an impressive EPA-rated 39 mpg.</p>, <p>A new SR model with sporty transmission programming and a stiffer suspension setup has also been added. </p>, <p>The new <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1079773_2013-nissan-altima-video-road-test">Altima sedan also adopts more safety and technology</a>, with standard Bluetooth and streaming audio, and available wide-angle rearview camera, lane-departure warning systems, and satellite radio. The IIHS gives the Altima its Top Safety Pick accolade, and the NHTSA agrees with five stars overall (albeit four stars in the government's rollover test). </p>, <p>For 2018, all Altimas received standard forward-collision warnings and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Altima history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>Introduced in 1993, the Altima has grown from its original compact-class size to a mid-sizer, and from a mediocre offering to a very good one. The 1993-1997 and 1998-2001 Altimas were compact sedans powered by 4-cylinder engines, offering a 5-speed manual gearbox or 4-speed automatic. They were the successor to the Stanza sedan, and did well for Nissan against the Toyota Corolla.</p>, <p>When the third-generation Altima launched in 2002, it was the first of a new wave of dramatically styled Nissan models, drawing great acclaim for its distinctive lines. That 2002-2006 model offered a 2.5-liter inline-4 and a 3.5-liter V-6, with standard 5-speed manuals or automatics (a 4-speed for the four, a 5-speed for the V-6). The sportiest SE-R model included not only the 250-hp V-6, but also unique suspension tuning, 18-inch wheels and tires, and some styling flourishes to set the car apart from standard Altimas.</p>, <p>Restyled for 2007, the Altima continued as a more design-forward alternative to the average mid-size sedan, like the popular Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, as well as the up-and-coming Hyundai Sonata and domestic competitors like the Ford Fusion and Chevrolet Malibu. It was most notable in this generation for displacing the Maxima as Nissan's biggest sedan, though the vehicles actually shared much of their running gear. It also added a two-door model that gave the Honda Accord Coupe one of its few real rivals.</p>, <p>In 2010, the Altima received a mild refresh consisting of a new grille, improvements to interior materials, and added options. At the time, the engine choices were a 175-hp, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder in base models and an optional 275-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The standard transmission in both the sedan and coupe was a CVT, while coupe buyers could also select a 6-speed manual.</p>, <p>Nissan offered an Altima Hybrid from 2007 through the 2011 model year. It used a 162-hp, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder paired with a licensed version of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system found in the Prius and others. Fuel economy was rated by the EPA at 35 mpg city, 33 highway. The gas-electric Altima was offered only in a handful of states. Nissan removed the Altima Hybrid from the lineup to focus its green efforts on the then-new Leaf all-electric hatchback.</p>, <p>The two-door model survived through the end of the 2013 model year but has not been replaced alongside the latest Altima sedan. For its sign-off, it came only in a single configuration, with the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and the CVT.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_maxima
[<p>The Nissan Maxima is a four-door sedan with a sporty tilt. Today a relative of the Altima and built alongside it, the Maxima is extravagantly styled and comes in an aggressively tuned SR edition, though it shares its V-6 drivetrain and basic architecture with the Altima.</p>, <p>With the Maxima, Nissan has had a staple in the company's lineup since the Datsun days. Originally, it was a sporty rear-drive four-door, later taking up the "four-door sports car" title for the brand. It has now settled into a role as the larger, more luxurious alternative to Nissan's more conventionally styled family sedans.</p>, <p>Although the Maxima somewhat defies categorization, today's model is best suited to compete with entry-luxury cars such as the Acura TLX, Buick LaCrosse, and Lincoln MKZ.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Maxima adds automatic emergency braking and Android Auto (which joins Apple CarPlay) on every trim level and sees a few option packages shuffled around.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_maxima_2018">2018 Nissan Maxima review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Maxima</strong></p>, <p>A new Maxima arrived for 2016, and with it Nissan again touted the "Four-Door Sports Car" mantra. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_maxima_2016">2016 Nissan Maxima</a> has a sleeker design—it's fronted by a version of the new corporate grille, the A-pillar is blacked out, and the roof appears somewhat cantilevered as an homage to the GT-R supercar.</p>, <p>The Maxima uses a 3.5-liter V-6 engine and continuously variable transmission (CVT)—not necessarily the stuff of sports cars, but Nissan says the 300-horsepower engine benefits from 60 percent new parts. The suspension has been overhauled, however, and there is a stiffer SR setup available that also comes with a chassis damper to reduce vibration induced by the stiffer setup, along with an adaptive suspension to change the car's dynamics.</p>, <p>The SR is also not available with the panoramic sunroof offered on other models, so as to keep its center of gravity lower.</p>, <p>The car also offers "Active Ride Control," which uses brake applications, not any kind of fancy dampers, to keep the car settled on lumpy roads. There are many other technical advancements, including a new infotainment system and interface.</p>, <p>For 2017, little on the Maxima changed. Apple's CarPlay infotainment was made standard on all trims and two new appearance packages—Medallion and Value—were added to the Maxima, on top of the Midnight package made available in 2016.</p>, <p>The 2018 model year was marked by newly standard automatic emergency braking and Android Auto, plus a few minor changes across the lineup.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Maxima history</strong></p>, <p>The Maxima has been on the U.S. market for more than 30 years. Now in its eighth generation, it remains at the top of the Nissan sedan lineup, as it has been since the company switched its name from Datsun to Nissan. If you want a larger car from the company, you'll have to step up into the Infiniti brand.</p>, <p>From 1976 to 1980, the Datsun 810 preceded the Maxima in all but name in the U.S., with an inline-6 and rear-wheel drive. The second generation (1981-1984) maintained the same specs, but adopted the Maxima badge worldwide and midway through its life cycle switched to the Nissan nameplate.</p>, <p>The third-generation Maxima, which was on sale from 1985 through 1988, brought about big changes for the model. The layout switched to front-wheel drive, while the styling adopted a very square design theme. The Maxima was further differentiated from the smaller Stanza with high-tech gear such as a sonar-based adaptive suspension that could read the road and adjust the dampers accordingly. The third-generation Maxima came with a 3.0-liter V-6 and either a manual or automatic transmission. This was also the last generation to be available as a wagon.</p>, <p>The "four-door sports car" era of the Maxima began with the fourth-generation model, which was sold from 1989 through 1994. This version of the sedan regularly won multi-car comparison tests thanks to nimble handling from an independent suspension, and a V-6 shared with the 300ZX sports car. An SE edition tightened handling even more, and added touches such as white-faced gauges to distinguish it from base versions. The same fundamentals were reworked for the 1995-1999 Maxima, but the styling was softened and the rear suspension was simplified, revoking some of its sporty credentials—though it still was offered with a manual transmission. The latter fifth-generation Maxima was sold, with some trim changes, as the Infiniti I30. In the sixth generation, the body was redesigned again and in due course, it gained a new 3.5-liter V-6 with 255 hp, as well as a 6-speed manual option.</p>, <p>Dramatic change came to the Maxima in the two most recent generations. The seventh-generation car, sold from 2004 through 2008, kicked off production in the U.S. Styling was rebooted to match the performance of its 265-hp V-6 and manual transmission, but it did have some controversial graphic notes, mostly on its eggcrate grille. This Maxima shared its architecture with the Nissan Altima, which had grown to the size of the Maxima in most interior dimensions. A mid-cycle refresh in 2007 left the Maxima without its manual transmission option, while Nissan fitted a new CVT in place of a torque-converter automatic. Front-end styling grew more conventional, and the Maxima piled on luxury features such as keyless ignition and a distinct interior.</p>, <p>The eighth-generation Maxima was introduced as a 2009 model. Its muscular styling was more successful at distinguishing it from the Altima, and the interior design had its own cues, too—there was an unusual low cowl, with a band of trim outlining the base of the windshield. That Maxima's 290-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 offered extremely smooth acceleration, and while it was no manual replacement, the CVT provided a sport mode and good fuel economy of 19 mpg city, 26 highway. The Maxima still had one of the sportiest suspension calibrations for a front-wheel-drive sedan, and a firm yet supple ride, allowing good handling response without sacrificing comfort. It was roomy in front, but the back seat could feel tight, especially compared with the Altima.</p>, <p>The last Maxima's crash ratings fell as testing standards were made tougher while the model remained largely unchanged. The usual safety features were present, including front side and curtain airbags, active head restraints, anti-lock brakes, and stability control. Standard items also included steering-wheel audio controls, Bluetooth connectivity, dual-zone climate control, proximity key with keyless ignition, and a power moonroof.</p>, <p>This eighth-generation Maxima saw very few changes over the past several years. The 2010 model year brought a new Sport package with a sportier suspension tune, 19-inch wheels, paddle shifters for the transmission, unique front seats, and some other changes. A Special Edition package launched for 2012 included a rear spoiler, smoked lighting lenses, unique silver-painted wheels, and other aesthetic tweaks along with HID headlights.</p>, <p>Nissan extended the 2014 model year for the Maxima and skipped the 2015 model year.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_sentra
[<p>The Nissan Sentra is a compact four-door sedan rivaling vehicles such as the Ford Focus, Honda Civic, and Toyota Corolla. It has long been Nissan's compact standby and is consistently the brand's second-best-selling car behind the mid-size Altima.</p>, <p>After three decades on sale, the Sentra has grown in size while amassing a larger collection of safety gear and optional equipment. Sentras have been sourced from several places around the world, with current models sold in the U.S. now coming from Mexico. The little Nissan has also come in several different body styles over the years, and at one time it was one of Nissan's greatest performance bargains.</p>, <p>This time around, the Sentra is a commuter-special and roomy for four adults—a relatively uncommon feature for compact sedans.</p>, <p>With the Sentra, Nissan has a competitor for bestselling compact cars such as the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus, Volkswagen Jetta, and Hyundai Elantra, among others.</p>, <p><strong><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_sentra_2018">2018 Nissan Sentra review</a></em></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Sentra</strong></p>, <p>Today's Nissan Sentra was last <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1080091_2013-nissan-sentra-first-drive">redesigned for the 2013 model year</a>. Engineers used high-strength steel to cut out up to 150 pounds of weight while making a stiffer, safer structure. That meant the Sentra could be powered by a smaller, 130-horsepower, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine, driving the front wheels through the latest Nissan continuously variable transmission (CVT)—although a manual remains available on the base model.</p>, <p>With the Sentra having grown in every dimension except height, the interior grew to nearly mid-size classification and rear seat leg room was increased. The Sentra lineup offers some larger-sedan features like automatic climate control and Bose audio, although we note a Bluetooth hands-free interface still isn't included (or even offered) in the base Sentra S model. Nissan has maintained <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1079557_2013-nissan-sentra-priced-from-16770">an affordable price</a>, with fully loaded Sentra SL models topping out at about $23,000. Gas-mileage ratings can reach up to 40 mpg highway if the optional FE+ package is specified.</p>, <p>Nissan has made very few changes to the Sentra since its 2013 redesign. For 2015, most models saw an increase in standard equipment. The sedan was also redesigned to better perform on crash tests, including the IIHS' small overlap front crash.</p>, <p>A mid-cycle refresh for the 2016 model year gave the Sentra the bolder look of the Maxima and Murano. Highlighted by a wide V-shaped grille, the hood and fenders were refreshed along with the boomerang-shaped headlights and taillights. LED headlights became available on SR and SL models. The interior was revised with new designs for the steering wheel, audio display, center stack, and center console. A new TFT instrument panel included a 5.0-inch enhanced display, and the Sentra added Apple's Siri Eyes Free voice commands and NissanConnect, which includes remote access, services provided by SiriusXM, and access to smartphone apps. </p>, <p>The 1.8-liter engine continued unchanged, but the available CVT got the next generation of Nissan's "D-Step" shift program to provide more linear acceleration, according to the automaker.</p>, <p>The 2016 Nissan Sentra also added new active-safety features, including automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>Turbocharged power arrived for the 2017 model year in the form of the SR Turbo and Nismo models. In 2018, Nissan added standard automatic emergency braking to most Sentra trims.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Sentra history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The very first Sentra to be sold in the U.S.—from 1982 to 1986—replaced the old Datsun 210 and was actually the first car to carry the new Nissan nameplate. It also was the first Nissan to be built in the United States, in a vast assembly complex in Tennessee. Four-speed manual and 3-speed automatic transmissions were offered, with top versions rated at 35 mpg highway. The second generation arrived in the U.S. as a 1986 model and continued through 1990.</p>, <p>In 1991, a new third-generation Sentra adopted an upright shape that provided good interior space; that version ran through the 1995 model year. Its light weight and independent suspension gave it a more sporty feel than the competing Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic, and it won many enthusiast fans when it added a special SE-R edition. A regular on Top Ten lists in car magazines, the 140-hp SE-R came in a two-door body style and was specially tuned for sporty driving, adding four-wheel disc brakes and a limited-slip differential to the standard-features list. Basic equipment lists included an AM/FM radio and roll-up windows, and automatic seat belts were used through most of these model years to meet federal safety-belt requirements.</p>, <p>For the fourth generation, though, Nissan reversed course and tried to cut costs in the Sentra. A torsion-beam rear suspension replaced the independent suspension from the previous car, and while the SE-R returned, it was a watered-down car, both larger and less nimble than before. The SE-R was later renamed the "200SX."</p>, <p>The fifth-generation Sentra, sold from 2000 to 2006, grew larger again, bumping the one-size-up Altima firmly into the mid-size segment. This bigger new model, which saw production move to Mexico, also felt more substantial and was roomier inside. An SE-R model model returned to the lineup, powered by a 2.5-liter inline-4; a high-output Spec V variant made 175 hp and came with a 6-speed manual transmission. This generation saw a facelift for 2004, which featured a wider grille bisected by a round Nissan badge; the same styling motif moved to the new Maxima shortly after.</p>, <p>The next Nissan Sentra debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, entering the market as a 2007 model. That basic car ran through the 2012 model year before it was replaced with today's car. A smaller subcompact sibling, the hatchback Nissan Versa, joined the compact Sentra, now offered only as a four-door sedan. This Sentra came standard with a 140-hp, 2.5-liter inline-4 and a choice of manual gearboxes or a CVT. The SE-R returned as a sedan, with a high-output version of the same engine rated at 177 hp; the SE-R Spec V produced 200 hp and was teamed with a 6-speed manual transmission.</p>, <p>The 2010 model year brought a cosmetic refresh for the Sentra's somewhat stubby look and its angular interior. As a driver's machine, this Sentra lacked in comparison to the great Sentras of the early 1990s, but it proved to be a reasonably roomy package with excellent outward visibility. The CVT-equipped versions suffered from the noise and drone that accompanies most cars fitted with CVTs; by design the transmission keeps the engine revving at high rpm, where noise and vibration reside. The CVT was the only gearbox on the SE-R, which made the Spec V the sole choice for hardcore enthusiasts. Ride quality on all versions was a high point, and assembly quality was good.</p>, <p>The Sentra was slow to adopt certain features that are often taken for granted in other models. Electronic stability control was an option on less-expensive until 2010, while the base 2.0-liter model lacked standard ABS. For 2011, all of those items were made standard across the board. And in 2012, Nissan added an affordable touchscreen navigation option to the 2.0S, which included USB and iPod connectivity.</p>]

[<p>The Nissan Versa is the name applied to two different vehicles—a four-door sedan and a more practical five-door hatchback, the Versa Note. Neither offers much in the way of luxury, but their biggest selling points have always been their low prices.</p>, <p>Regardless of body style, both Versa variants are spacious for their subcompact size class, and both are among the most affordable vehicles in their niche.</p>, <p>With the Versa, Nissan has a rival for other small cars on sale in the U.S. including the Chevy Sonic, Mitsubishi Mirage, Toyota Yaris, and Honda Fit. At times, the Versa has been the lowest priced new car on sale in the U.S.</p>, <p>The Versa was relatively unchanged for 2018.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_versa_2018" title="2017 Nissan Versa - review">2018 Nissan Versa review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Nissan Versa</strong></p>, <p>The current Versa four-door made its debut as a redesigned model for 2012, trading its predecessor's slab-sided lines for more rounded—some might say bulbous—shapes, and an updated Nissan corporate grille.</p>, <p>A new <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081675_2014-nissan-versa-note-affordable-versatile-hatchback-bows-at-detroit" title="2014 Nissan Versa Note: Affordable, Versatile Hatchback Bows At Detroit">Versa Note five-door hatchback</a> with very different styling was added as a 2014 model early in 2013; the two share a common name and some underpinnings but not a single body panel. (You can read a first drive report on the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1084922_2014-nissan-versa-note-first-drive">Nissan Versa Note here</a>.)</p>, <p>All current Versa sedans are powered by a 109-horsepower, 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine. The 1.6 S gets notably worse fuel efficiency ratings (27 mpg city, 36 highway, 30 combined) than better-equipped models, because it is available only with a 5-speed manual gearbox or an optional 4-speed automatic. The higher-line models can be ordered with a more fuel-efficient version of Nissan's continuously variable transmission (CVT), which pushes the Versa sedan's ratings to 31/40/35 mpg.</p>, <p>The Versa emphasizes its value over any other attribute, helping the car appeal to folks who aren't necessarily looking for top performance or amazing fuel economy. It's a nice enough car to pilot in commuting, but the suspension is very soft, which hampers handling. </p>, <p>The Nissan Versa's lower price, however, comes with a tradeoff: a very basic interior and minimal driving feel. The latest Versa seems even more bargain-basement than ever in its features and appointments, with drum brakes across the lineup; short, flat seats; hard-and-hollow-feeling dash and door trim; and rear seatbacks that don't fold forward on the less expensive models. But for many buyers, roominess often trumps both of those qualities.</p>, <p>The Versa sedan and Note have very good interior room for their size class. Two normal-sized adults can even fit into the back seat in comfort, something not easily claimed by most competitors in the segment. The rear doors open wide to a back seat that's very spacious for the class, easily accommodating two adults or three kids. Those who want the most versatility should choose the Note hatchback, although it costs slightly more.</p>, <p>Features are meager at the entry level. Air conditioning is now standard, as is Bluetooth pairing and voice control, though power windows and locks are not. (Power mirrors were made standard for 2016.) The mid-range SV model adds the usual convenience items, including power windows and cruise control, while the top-of-the-range SL models can reach around $18,000 when fully optioned with navigation, XM NavTraffic, and USB/iPod controls.</p>, <p>The Versa Note was substantially revised in 2017 with a new face and headlights, updated wheels, and new paint colors. The sedan carried over unchanged from the prior year.</p>, <p><strong>Nissan Versa history</strong></p>, <p>When the first-generation Versa was introduced back in 2007, it was the only subcompact to have a standard 6-speed manual gearbox (something it no longer offers, sadly). Both the four-door sedan and the five-door hatchback were equipped with a 122-hp, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine. At first, a conventional 4-speed automatic transmission was optional, but it was soon replaced by Nissan's CVT.</p>, <p>Nissan added Base models of the Versa sedan in 2009, which were powered by a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder making 107 hp. A 5-speed manual was standard there, as were manual locks and windows, while air conditioning, a stereo, and the automatic transmission were options, all to keep the price down. This lack of features also kept weight down, making the 1.6-liter models a little more fun to drive, if not to be in for long periods of time. The 1.6 was only really adequate if you stuck with the manual transmission, however. Interestingly, the Versa 1.6 got slightly lower fuel economy than 1.8 models, with EPA ratings of 26 mpg city, 31 highway, likely due to gearing that was meant to compensate for the lower engine output.</p>, <p>Versa S models were better equipped, including most of the basics the Base models forewent, while range-topping SL models came with upgraded sound, height-adjustable seats, power windows and locks, keyless entry, and standard electronic stability control. Although the Versa earned reasonably good safety ratings, prior to 2010 the Base and S models didn't come with standard anti-lock brakes or electronic stability control.</p>, <p>For 2010, in addition to the new safety equipment, Nissan added a slightly different grille to the lineup and made large, 16-inch alloy wheels optional, as well as a navigation and a satellite radio. Intelligent Key and Rockford Fosgate sound remained major options.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_rogue-sport
[<p>The Nissan Rogue Sport is a compact crossover that slots below the automaker’s popular Rogue, but is smaller inside and out—as well as less expensive.</p>, <p>With the Rogue Sport, Nissan is introducing neither an all-new model nor a sportier variant of the current Rogue. Instead, it’s a version of the five-seat Nissan Qashqai ("KASH-kye") sold around the world, updated for North America (but sold in Canada as the Qashqai).</p>, <p>The Rogue Sport is surgical in its size and competitive set. It's bigger than a Chevy Trax but smaller than a Ford Escape, which leaves the small Nissan somewhat between subcompact and compact.</p>, <p>New for 2017, the Rogue Sport stayed the same for the 2018 model year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114933_2018-nissan-rogue-sport" title="2017 Nissan Rogue Sport - review">2018 Nissan Rogue Sport review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Especially at the front, the Rogue Sport shares some of the larger Rogue’s styling touches, including a V-shaped grille flanked by headlights with standard LED running lights. Base models come with 16-inch steel wheels and hubcaps, but larger alloy wheels are available. The Rogue Sport’s interior is lifted almost wholesale from the larger Rogue, but there’s less rear-seat room and the cargo area is decidedly more compact until the second row of seats is folded.</p>, <p>The Rogue Sport is only offered as a five-seater, which is to be expected from its small size. Its single powertrain pairs a 2.0-liter inline-4 rated at 141 horsepower and 147 pound-feet of torque with a continuously variable transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available as an option on each of the three trim levels. The handling is average for a small crossover, and acceleration is on the slow side, belying the "Sport" in the model's name.</p>, <p>It’s hardly an off-roader, either, so don’t view it as a replacement for the now-departed Nissan Xterra. Instead, with car-like suspension and a fairly low roof line—the bigger Rogue is fully 6 inches taller—the Rogue Sport is a city-slicker crossover for buyers who want a high seating position and the ability to haul boxier items than will fit into a sedan. All-wheel drive will appeal to those in wintry climates.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Rogue Sport is offered in S, SV, and SL trim levels. All come standard with power windows and locks plus an audio system with Bluetooth streaming and a rearview camera. Higher-spec models gain things like heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a power driver’s seat, a moonroof, and a premium audio system with a 7.0-inch infotainment touchscreen.</p>, <p>On the safety front, the Rogue Sport will be available with a surround-view camera system that displays a 360-degree overview of the vehicle. Additionally, various of the latest active-safety options are available. They include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, forward-collision alert, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-departure warning. The full suite of active-safety systems is only offered on the Rogue Sport SL, however, the very highest trim level. The mid-grade trim, known as SV, offers just a subset, and the few buyers who choose the spartan Rogue S are entirely out of luck.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_nv200
[<p>The Nissan NV200 is a city-oriented commercial van available in both cargo and taxi-oriented passenger-hauling configurations. </p>, <p>The NV200 is also sold as the Chevrolet City Express, but don't let that model's bowtie badge fool you; the design is 100 percent Nissan. The NV200 was introduced for the 2013 model year in the United States. A heavily modified version of the NV200 has been designed specifically for use as a taxicab in New York City. That taxi variant is now offered to buyers all across the country. </p>, <p>Not every Nissan dealer sells the van, however. With the NV200, Nissan offers it—and the larger NV—through a network of Nissan Commercial Vehicle dealers.</p>, <p>For 2017, the NV200 saw some previously optional equipment made standard but was otherwise unchanged. </p>, <p><strong style="font-style: italic;">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_nv200_2017">2017 Nissan NV200 review</a></strong></p>, <p><strong>The Nissan NV200</strong></p>, <p>Nissan calls its NV200 a "right-sized" commercial vehicle—that is, one that is aimed at urban use and for commercial drivers on a budget. It's not rated to tow or lug heavy loads in its cargo bay, but for fleet operators looking for something for, say, flower delivery or a taxi service, it may make a lot of sense.</p>, <p>Under its hood, the NV200 uses a 2.0-liter, naturally aspirated inline-4 engine rated at 131 horsepower and 139 pound-feet of torque. It sends power to the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission, and it runs on regular unleaded fuel. That's not much power for any vehicle, let alone one that weighs about 3,300 pounds unladen—but that's not really the point of a commercial vehicle.</p>, <p>The NV200 utilizes a unibody design, which helps keep curb weight down but doesn't make it as much of a hauler as, say the Mercedes-Benz Metris or the Ford Transit Connection. The NV200 features almost 130 cubic feet of cargo space; there is no passenger version aside from the purpose-built taxi variant. </p>, <p>Instead, the NV200 has been designed with city fleet drivers in mind. Its interior is conveniently laid out and every surface is designed to be both durable and washable. The cargo variant comes standard with steel panels in place of rear windows, although glass is available as an option. The taxi version, naturally, features a second-row bench seat. It's covered in a special antimicrobial vinyl. Additionally, the taxi model's rear partition features integrated USB and 12-volt outlets, which should make the chore of bouncing around a more pleasant experience. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/nissan_nv
[<p>The Nissan NV is a full-size rear-wheel-drive van, sold mostly in commercial cargo van format, but also available as a passenger van with windows and added seating rows. It is offered in two different wheelbases, two roof heights, and with two engine options, and is the first full-size van Nisan has sold in the U.S. and Canada.</p>, <p>With the NV, Nissan offers a flexible full-size van that can be configured for commercial or passenger duty, including a high roof for business buyers.</p>, <p>For 2017, the NV gained a more powerful V-8 engine and a far more advanced 7-speed automatic as options, that should make it both faster and more fuel efficient. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/nissan_nv_2017">2017 Nissan NV review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The NV should not be confused with the Nissan NV200, a smaller commercial van also sold in a passenger version, which uses a front-wheel-drive car platform.</p>, <p>The Nissan NV van was introduced in 2011 for the 2012 model year, and is derived from the same frame as the full-size Nissan Titan pickup truck. Both vehicles are built in an assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi. The van requirement for a flat load floor, however, required extensive modifications to the frame and the rest of the body structure, so while the NV and the Titan are related, they share relatively few parts outside their powertrains.</p>, <p>Depending on the model, the Nissan NV can be ordered with two engines: a standard 261-horsepower 4.0-liter V-6 that produces 281 lb-ft of torque, and an optional 5.6-liter V-8 that was first teamed to a 5-speed automatic but as of 2017 comes with a 7-speed automatic. Both engines power the rear wheels.</p>, <p>The Nissan NV 1500, with a load capacity of 2,590 pounds—known colloquially as a "half-ton" van—comes only with the V-6. With a payload of 3,142 pounds, the NV 2500 HD is known as a "three-quarter-ton" van, and can be ordered with either the V-6 or the V 8 engine, also in S or SV trim. Finally, the Nissan NV 3500 HD has a payload of 3,925 pounds, known as a "one-ton" van, and comes only with the V-8.</p>, <p>Two trim levels are offered on each of the three models: the base S, and the more upscale SV, which adds a chrome finish to the grille, bumpers, and door mirrors. The NV 2500 and 3500 models can be ordered in the standard version or a special high-roof body that permits a 6-foot person to stand upright in the load bay.</p>, <p>In its passenger van configuration (offered only on the NV 3500, though with V-6 or V-8 engines), Nissan claims no fewer than 234 different seating configurations. Passenger models also include standard or optional multiple reading lights, outlets for both 12-Volt and 120-volt power, and rear doors that open more than 180 degrees.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/porsche_911-carrera
[<p>The Porsche 911 is an iconic two-seat sports car. Its recognizable shape and growl is known all over the world—so is its performance.</p>, <p>With the 911, Porsche offers coupe, cabriolet or targa body styles. Its rivals include the Audi R8, Chevy Corvette, Jaguar F-Type and even the new Mercedes-AMG GT.</p>, <p>In 2018, Porsche added a world-beating GT2 RS to the lineup that has few rivals, if any. Perhaps our imaginations?</p>, <p>In base form, the current 911 can be had for about $80,000 but that number quickly climbs past $100,000 with the seemingly endless available options. Most 911 variants retain vestigial rear seating, although some feature seating for just two.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/porsche_911-carrera_2018">2018 Porsche 911 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Porsche 911<br/></strong></p>, <p>For the 2012 model year, <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1068461_2012-porsche-911-first-drive">Porsche introduced the 991 series</a>, though it continued sales of some 997 models as well. The new 991 boasts upgraded engines, a new 7-speed manual transmission, a revised Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual-clutch transmission, a wider front track and longer wheelbase. In addition, the 991 911 is about 100 pounds lighter than the 997. A heavily revised and improved interior makes it the most comfortable yet, and the improvements to the chassis and powertrain make the 991 generation the most high-performance production 911 to date as well.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078738_2013-porsche-911-carrera-4-all-wheel-drive-models-debut">Carrera 4 and 4S</a> joined the model lineup in the 2013 model year, in both coupe and cabriolet variants. With a wider rear track than the rear-drive Carreras, the all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 range adds improved traction in foul weather while maintaining the rest of the 911's excellent dynamic characteristics. Also new for 2013 was a standard adaptive cruise control system in PDK-equipped models, as well as forward collision avoidance and a panoramic glass sunroof option.</p>, <p>The 991-based <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082688_2014-porsche-911-gt3-unveiled-geneva-motor-show">GT3 joined the range</a> at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, bringing with it a 3.8-liter engine rated at 475 hp, a new GT3-specific setup for its PDK transmission, and rear steering. This track-focused version of the 911 confused some traditionalists with its lack of a manual transmission option, but for those focused on track performance, it made perfect sense.</p>, <p>The highest-power versions of the 911, the Turbo and Turbo S, arrived for the 2014 model year, bringing up to 560 hp and brutally quick acceleration, hitting 60 mph in as little as 2.9 seconds. Both coupe and Cabriolet versions of the 911 Turbo and Turbo S are available.</p>, <p>For 2015, Porsche has added Targa models of the 911 with standard all-wheel drive and either base (Targa 4) or S-level (Targa 4S) powertrains. The 911 GTS made its first appearance in the 991 generation, offering performance above the Carrera S; it will once again be available as a coupe or a convertible and with or without all-wheel drive. The GTS received a 430-hp version of the Carrera S's flat-6 engine and can reach 60 mph in as little as 3.8 seconds with the right equipment. And as if it needed more model variants, Porsche launched a Targa 4 GTS at the 2015 Detroit auto show, combining the Targa body, all-wheel drive, and the GTS's hopped-up engine. This puts the current 911 variant count at 20 and counting.</p>, <p>Porsche has also introduced a new Aerokit package for the 911 Turbo and Turbo S, which adds extra aerodynamic body parts to increase downforce. An adjustable rear spoiler is part of the package, with two settings that increase downforce in different amounts. The kit can be added to a new purchase or retrofitted to a Turbo post-factory.</p>, <p>The 2016 model year saw the addition of a new 911 GT3 RS. It builds on the GT3's specs, offering a lighter body, refined aerodynamics with a huge rear wing, a 500-hp flat-6 engine, and a standard PDK automatic transmission. It is visually differentiated by the aero differences as well as a new take on the front fender vent.</p>, <p>In 2017, Porsche made a major change to the 911's engine lineup. The standard Carrera adopted, for the first time, a turbocharged flat-6 engine. The twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter flat-6 makes 370 horsepower and 331 pound-feet of torque in Carrera models and 420 hp and 368 lb-ft in the Carrera S.</p>, <p>Despite the downsized engines, both models have significantly improved performance for 2017; the Carrera can now reach 60 mph in 4.0 seconds with the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (a 7-speed manual is standard)—or just 3.7 seconds with the PDK in the Carrera S. A new Sport Response button also aims for maximum performance and acceleration. Top speed for the 911 is 191 mph in Carrera S form or 183 mph for the Carrera.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the 911 Turbo and Turbo S models brings a similar bump in power over the last generation. The 911 Turbo is rated at 540 hp and the Turbo S makes 580 hp, albeit from different turbocharger setups this time around.</p>, <p>For 2018, the 911 has a new mountaintop: the 700-hp 911 GT2 RS. The fastest road-going Porsche 911 ever made, the 911 GT2 RS features carbon-fiber construction everywhere, specially made lightened wheels, and a PDK automatic to power just the rear wheels. It accelerates to 60 mph in less than three seconds, but the performance carries a huge cost at nearly $300,000 to start.</p>, <p><strong>Porsche 911 history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>Since 1963, the 911 has seen nearly endless permutations, yet there have been only five major generational changes. The original 911 ran from 1963 to 1989 in its core form with a variety of rear-mounted engines, including turbocharged variants. It established the fastback, sloping hood, and bulging fender look that has defined the car's exterior appearance ever since. The second-generation, 964-series 911 ran from 1989 to 1993. It added four-wheel drive as an option, an automatically deploying rear spoiler, anti-lock brakes, and power steering. These all served to improve handling, performance, and daily usability, but somewhat softened the 911's image. The third generation, or 993-series, 911 saw an all-new front- and rear-end treatment, though the spirit of the original still showed through. A new multi-link rear suspension improved handling, and the chassis was improved for further gains. This was the final generation that used an air-cooled engine.</p>, <p>The fourth-generation, 996-series 911 moved to a water-cooled engine, but kept the famous flat-six layout. It also was the first complete redesign of the 911's exterior—each body panel was different, yet added up to a look that still adhered to the classic 911 formula. All-wheel-drive, rear-wheel-drive, turbo, twin-turbo, GT3, and GT2 variants offered a wide variety of performance options that all relied on the same core underpinnings.</p>, <p>The 997 series of the 911 Carrera began its run in 2005. Initially offered with a 3.6-liter flat-6, the 997 911 upgraded to a 3.8-liter engine in the Carrera S. Available in both coupe and cabriolet forms, the 997 911 could be had in no fewer than 17 variants, including the Carrera, Cabriolet, Targa, and Turbo each offering all-wheel-drive and sportier "S" variants, plus the GT3, GT3 RS, and GT2 RS. This wide variety of models ranged in output from 345 hp in the base Carrera to 620 hp in the GT2 RS. Transmissions available included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch PDK. The name translates very simply—and logically—to Porsche dual-clutch gearbox.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/porsche_panamera
[<p>The Porsche Panamera is a five-door hatchback with a gently sloping roofline and alarming performance in some versions. It's one of the most practical vehicles made by Porsche and proved versatility may not require compromise.</p>, <p>The Panamera competes with cars such as the Aston Martin Rapide, Audi A7, Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class, and the BMW 6-Series Gran Coupe.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Panamera lineup grows considerably to a total of 15 different variants including two wheelbases and a choice of standard and shooting brake-like Sport Turismo body configurations. A new base model joins the lineup with rear-wheel drive, while a pair of hybrid models offer two different definitions of efficient performance.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/porsche_panamera_2018">2018 Porsche Panamera review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Porsche Panamera</strong></p>, <p>The latest edition of the Panamera has grown, and has adopted a striking new design that eliminates its hunchbacked look in favor of a much sleeker shape. Inside, the dash drops dozens of buttons and switches for a pair of 7.0-inch screen in the gauge slot, and a 12.3-inch tablet screen on the center console.</p>, <p>Two new engines are offered in the 4S and Turbo models. Both come with standard all-wheel drive. (Many more models, from a wagon to a plug-in hybrid, are expected.) The Panamera 4S is powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 with 440 horsepower, good for a 4.0-second 0-60 mph time and a top speed of 180 mph.</p>, <p>The Panamera Turbo comes with a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1090930_first-details-on-new-porsche-v-8-debuting-in-next-gen-panamera-turbo" title="First details on new Porsche V-8 debuting in next-gen Panamera Turbo">new twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8</a> spinning out a healthy 550 hp. According to Porsche, the Turbo accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds or 3.4 seconds with the Sport Chrono package, and tops out at 190 mph. An 8-speed dual-clutch automatic is the only transmission offered.</p>, <p>Available suspension and performance options will include electronically controlled dampers, rear-wheel steering, torque vectoring, active roll compensation, and a three-chamber air suspension. The air suspension will be standard on the Turbo. The 4S will come with 19-inch wheels, the Turbo will get 20s, and 21s will be optional.</p>, <p>The latest Porsche Panamera's body is made almost entirely of aluminum, though there are also some optimized steel alloys. It also grows for 2017. It is 1.3 inches longer for a total length of 198.8 inches, and the wheelbase grows 1.2 inches to 116.1 inches. Width and height both increase 0.2 inch to 76.3 and 56.0 inches, respectively, though the extra roof height can be found up front.</p>, <p>New safety technologies include InnoDrive, a system that blends adaptive cruise control with navigation data and signals from radar and video sensors to compute and activate the optimal acceleration and deceleration rates, gear selections, and coasting phases for the next 1.8 miles.</p>, <p>For 2018, Porsche grew the Panamera lineup considerably with a new Sport Turismo body style that offers a wagon-like look and a little more utility. Additionally, two E-Hybrid variants—one aimed at efficient performance and a Turbo S E-Hybrid flagship inspired by the 918 Spyder—also joined the lineup.</p>, <p><strong>Porsche Panamera history</strong></p>, <p>The Panamera was introduced for the 2010 model year. It has been steadily updated mechanically, but the styling has remained largely the same, with one mild visual refresh having arrived for 2014.</p>, <p>That styling has been controversial, to say the least. If you believe the rumor mill, the Panamera's somewhat bulbous materialized because a 6-foot-3 former Porsche chairman demanded the new car be roomy enough for his comfort in the rear seat.</p>, <p>Many Panamera models are offered, ranging from the base Panamera and Panamera S to the Panamera 4 and 4S, the Panamera GTS, and the Panamera Turbo and Turbo S, as well as the Panamera S E-Hybrid. </p>, <p>The Panamera's performance makes it a true companion to Porsche sports cars like the 911, Boxster, and Cayman. The base engine for the 2010 model year was a 400-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8 borrowed from the Cayenne. With twin turbos, the same engine cranked out 500 hp. Both engines split power to the rear or to all wheels through a 7-speed, dual-clutch transmission. Handling in any Panamera is spectacularly balanced, with steering that's lighter than in some Porsche models. Though it is a large car, it retains a nimble feeling aided in many models by extra electronic systems for the chassis, suspension, and powertrain.</p>, <p>The Panamera's spacious interior is unexpected. It delivers the usual Porsche performance despite a long body and a long wheelbase. Four adults will find plenty of room—more in the back seat than the front, in fact. Those rear seats also flip forward, opening a cargo space that delivers enough room to cart a couple of bicycles with their front wheels still in place.</p>, <p>Porsche fits plenty of standard safety and luxury features to the Panamera, from curtain airbags to Bluetooth. Owners can specify custom trim or choose from a range of wood or metallic finishes, as well as some finely stitched leather—and matching fitted luggage. The optional 1,000-watt Burmester audio system feels as powerful as the Turbo S's scalding thrust.</p>, <p>In the 2011 model year, the Panamera became a little more attainable, with the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1046534_first-drive-2011-porsche-panamera-v6">introduction of a new base model powered by a V-6</a>. With the 3.6-liter V-6 (which Porsche builds on the same line as its V-8), the Panamera can get to 60 mph in a respectable-enough 5.6 seconds. The engine works well with the same 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission as in other models.</p>, <p>For 2012, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1057581_2012-porsche-panamera-turbo-s-preview">new Turbo S model</a> pushed the power rating up to 550 hp and a GTS version added 30 hp to the S, while an all-new Panamera S Hybrid model was also introduced. All but Panamera base, S, and S Hybrid models come with all-wheel drive standard. </p>, <p>In the 2013 model year, Porsche offered a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079908_2013-porsche-panamera-platinum-edition-makes-debut">new Platinum Edition model</a>, which adds unique paint, trim, and equipment to yield a more custom look.</p>, <p>An update arrived for the 2014 model year, freshening the Panamera's looks and equipment, as well as adding a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083329_2014-porsche-panamera-plug-in-and-long-wheelbase-models-join-the-fold">new Panamera S E-Hybrid plug-in model</a> in place of the former hybrid and a long-wheelbase variant, dubbed Executive. The longer Executive package is available on 4S, Turbo, and Turbo S cars. The Panamera S and 4S models also received a new twin-turbocharged V-6 to replace the former naturally aspirated V-8 engine.</p>, <p>For 2015, Porsche added a Panamera Exclusive Series model, which dollops extra luxury and design pieces onto a Panamera Turbo S Executive, for an extraordinary base price of $260,000. That's a hefty 60 grand over the price of a Turbo S Executive, but with Porsche options it could easily be pushed past $300,000. And even this most luxurious of Panameras is capable of a 3.7-second sprint to 60 mph, just a tenth behind a short-wheelbase Turbo S.</p>, <p>The 2016 Panamera was available in an Edition trim. It packaged 19-inch Panamera Turbo wheels, black window trim, a two-tone interior, and several other options together for less than what they'd all cost separately. The Edition was available on the base V-6 Panamera and Panamera 4, costing $1,900 or $1,500 more than the respective car.</p>]

[<p>The Porsche Cayenne is a five-seat luxury SUV with a strong focus on performance, one which does a shockingly good job of instilling the typical Porsche driving feel into a tall-bodied wagon. It's easily the most versatile Porsche ever, with stunning capability on the track and road, as well as a strong measure of off-road talent.</p>, <p>The Porsche Cayenne lineup over time has included base, S, GTS, Turbo, and Turbo S models.</p>, <p>For the 2019 model year, the lineup now consists of Cayenne, Cayenne S, Cayenne Turbo, and Cayenne E-Hybrid versions.</p>, <p>The Cayenne is a rival for a broad cross-section of SUVs and crossovers, from the Audi Q7 to the Infiniti QX70, from the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class to the BMW X5, and even to the latest Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our</em> <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/porsche_cayenne_2019"><em>2019 Porsche Cayenne review</em></a></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Porsche Cayenne</strong></p>, <p dir="ltr">Porsche introduced the 2019 Cayenne as a careful evolution of the prior models. It's a formula that works, though it takes a careful spotter to pick out the latest generation.</p>, <p dir="ltr">The new 2019 Cayenne doesn't vary too much from prior versions, though its glassy cabin has better outward vision and its rear fenders a bit more sculpturing. It's the cockpit where big change takes place: Porsche's replaced dozens of buttons and switches with touch panels and voice commands, and it has the effect of calming the cabin and catapulting it forward into a more futuristic realm.</p>, <p dir="ltr">Porsche sells three powertrains with the Cayenne, each teamed with an 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. The base powerplant is a single-turbo 3.0-liter V-6; the Cayenne S sports a twin-turbo version of the same engine. A twin-turbo V-8 tops the lineup. A plug-in hybrid is expected soon. All versions reach 60 mph in less than 6.0 seconds, and top speeds rise above 180 mph. </p>, <p dir="ltr">Most versions of the Cayenne come with adaptive and electronic controls for every major vehicle system: steering, exhaust, suspension, even torque-vectoring across the rear axle. A full air suspension with air dampers can be fitted, as can a rear-wheel-steering system that helps the Cayenne navigate tighter turns at low speeds.</p>, <p dir="ltr">The Cayenne still seats five, but interior space is up, and Porsche's upped the ante with features such as automatic emergency braking and surround-view cameras. Base models price out from the mid-$60,000s and miss out on little; full-tilt Turbos press near $200,000 and offer panoramic glass roofs, truffle-brown leather with sweet-gum wood, cooled and massaging seats, and bang-on Burmester sound.</p>, <p><strong>The second-generation Porsche Cayenne</strong></p>, <p>The second-generation Cayenne arrived for 2011, wearing new sheet metal in a similar shape, although with more obvious influence from the Panamera hatchback sedan. The interior also took cues from that car, borrowing its spine of a center console, which housed buttons to control all of the vehicle's major functions, such as suspension and all-wheel drive. Trim quality and materials were also improved in this generation.</p>, <p>At the start of this generation, Porsche offered three Cayenne models. The base Cayenne came with an improved V-6 making 300 horsepower; the Cayenne S used a 400-hp, 4.8-liter V-8; and the Turbo model slapped two turbochargers on that engine, for a total of 500 hp. Porsche added the first Cayenne Hybrid to the U.S. lineup for 2011; it was fitted with a 333-hp, 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 sourced from Audi and backed by an 8-speed automatic fitted with a 47-hp electric motor.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/porsche_cayenne_2013">2013 Porsche Cayenne</a> added the brand's first diesel engine, in the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1074824_2013-porsche-cayenne-diesel-debuts-in-u-s-priced-from-55750">Cayenne Diesel</a>; it came with all-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic as standard equipment to go with its 240-hp, 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6. A new, <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075242_2013-porsche-cayenne-gts-revealed-ahead-of-beijing-auto-show">420-hp Cayenne GTS</a> also joined the lineup, slotting between Cayenne S and Turbo models, and an analog timepiece was added to the dash. The top <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079779_2013-porsche-cayenne-turbo-s-preview">Cayenne Turbo S</a> model, debuting as a 2014 model, was boosted to 550 hp, yielding a 4.3-second 0-60 time and a top speed of 175 mph.</p>, <p>The Cayenne received a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1093461_2015-porsche-cayenne-plug-in-hybrid-new-twin-turbo-v-6-more">significant refresh for the 2015 model year</a>, including some advanced new powertrains. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid shares much of its internals with the Panamera S E-Hybrid: A 10.8-kwh lithium-ion battery pack can be charged via plug-in power or from the 333-hp, 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 engine on the fly. A 95-hp electric motor provides all-electric drive mode and efficiency-boosting hybrid thrust, depending on the circumstances and charge level. Total combined system power for the Cayenne S E-Hybrid is rated at 416 hp. Top speed in all-electric mode is 78 mph, and total electric-only range is 14 miles.</p>, <p>The Cayenne S also received a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V-6 engine as a replacement for its previous 4.8-liter V-8. With 420 hp, the Cayenne S hits 60 mph in about 5.2 seconds.</p>, <p>In 2015, parent-company Volkswagen admitted that Porsche's engine for the Cayenne Diesel model didn't meet mandated emissions levels and <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1100781_new-audi-porsche-vw-stop-sale-includes-more-diesel-models-than-the-epa-red-flagged">issued a stop-sale for those cars</a>. The company has <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1107291_breaking-volkswagen-reaches-deal-to-fix-most-3-0-liter-audi-porsche-vw-diesels">worked out a fix</a> for most of those models and will buy back the others.</p>, <p>Porsche beefed up the lineup in 2016. The base model once again uses a naturally aspirated Porsche 3.6-liter V-6, while the GTS has an uprated version of the new twin-turbo V-6 instead of the naturally aspirated V-8. The GTS continues as a Turbo lookalike, aping the model it sits below more than ever inside and out.</p>, <p>Porsche unveiled an updated version of the Cayenne Turbo S for 2016. The engine makes 570 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque, thanks to turbos integrated into the exhaust manifold.</p>, <p>Styling changes were mild for 2016, making it look just a bit more like its Macan sibling. Inside, a new multi-function sport steering wheel became standard across the range, with design and features drawn from the 918 Spyder plug-in hybrid supercar. The rear seats were redesigned for improved comfort, and seat ventilation became available as an option.</p>, <p>For 2017, all Cayennes got the latest version of the Porsche Communication Management infotainment system. It featured a new 7.0-inch touchscreen, a standard navigation system, and voice activation. The navigation system offered real-time traffic info and integration of Google Earth and Google Streetview. The new PCM absorbed some of the controls previously handled with buttons, and had the ability to respond to handwritten inputs.</p>, <p><strong>Cayenne history</strong></p>, <p>Even though Porsche purists initially scoffed at the idea of an SUV wearing the brand's sacred crest, the Cayenne has changed hearts and minds. It's been warmly received and gets most of the credit for keeping the brand afloat during a disastrous flirtation for control of Volkswagen.</p>, <p>The Cayenne was first introduced in 2003, when its arrival raised eyebrows and elicited more than just a few protestations from longtime Porsche-philes. Sharing core components as well as its hybrid uni-body/frame construction with the Volkswagen Touareg, the Cayenne entered the market shaped like many of its rivals, but with a sleek Porsche front end and distinct Porsche wheels, taillights, and exhaust pipes. Initially, the 340-hp, 4.5-liter V-8 Cayenne S and 450-hp turbocharged Turbo S were introduced, but following them in 2005 was a Cayenne V-6, powered by a "specially tuned," 247-hp, 3.2-liter version of the long-running narrow-angle Volkswagen VR6 engine. Those worried about Porsche pedigree cried foul, as the engine had been installed on all sorts of products from the Volkswagen Golf to the Eurovan over the years—and the base Cayenne took about nine seconds to get to 60 mph.</p>, <p>After sitting out the 2007 model year, the 2008 Cayenne received a serious facelift and some significant improvements. The base V-6 model was given a higher-output version of the 3.6-liter VR6, making 290 hp, and the Cayenne could now dash to 60 in around eight seconds (still slower than many V-6 minivans, however). Cayenne S versions received a 4.8-liter V-8 making 385 hp; and the Turbo S got a 500-hp version of the same engine. The V-6 model came with a choice of 6-speed manual or 6-speed Tiptronic automatic transmissions, while the S and Turbo had only the automatic. But a new GTS model, introduced for 2009, slotted between the S and Turbo, and got a 405-hp version of the V-8 along with a 6-speed manual transmission, larger wheels, and a retuned suspension. The GTS also included a Sport setting that controlled its suspension calibration and exhaust note.</p>, <p>Many Porsche enthusiasts were quite surprised to learn that the Cayenne had actual off-road ability. Versions from these early years could ford up to 19 inches of water and handle most of the moderately difficult trail demands.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/porsche_macan
[<p>The Porsche Macan is the automaker's smallest crossover with surprising performance.</p>, <p>Like other luxury automakers, the Porsche Macan was an instant hit with shoppers. With the Macan, Porsche has a rival for vehicles such as the Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace, BMW X3 and X4, and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. All of those options offer high-performance variants to challenge the Macan.</p>, <p>The Macan hasn't changed much since it was new in 2015. In 2016, Porsche added a base Macan powered by a turbo-4. In 2017, Porsche added a value-loaded GTS package that slot between the Macan S and the Macan Turbo. For 2018, Porsche hardly changed the successful, entry-level SUV.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/porsche_macan_2018">2018 Porsche Macan review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Macan's shape doesn't stray too far from the Porsche usual. Its silhouette is more than just reminiscent of the Cayenne's, with a gently curved roofline, but a quicker slope at the tail that reads almost hatchback-like. Massive air intakes and four-element headlights up front recall the Panamera as well as the Cayenne. Simple styling continues across the rear end, with LED taillights framing a wraparound tailgate. Inside, Porsche has smothered the cabin in buttons, but it reads cleanly, with a massive center console intersecting the dash at the new car-cabin hub, the LCD touchscreen.</p>, <p>The Macan launched with two models: the S, powered by a 340-horsepower turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, and the Turbo, with a 400-hp turbocharged 3.6-liter V-6.</p>, <p>A turbocharged 4-cylinder base Macan was added in 2016. Its 2.0-liter engine puts out 252 hp.</p>, <p>Porsche says the base model can reach 60 mph in 6.1 seconds on its way to a top speed of 142 mph. The Macan S is capable of a 5.2-second 0-to-60-mph run and a top speed of 156 mph. With the Sport Chrono package and its included launch control activated, the 0-to-60 time drops to 5.0 seconds.</p>, <p>The Macan Turbo, meanwhile, can reach 60 mph in 4.6 seconds, or 4.4 seconds with Sport Chrono. Its speed is 164 mph. Turbo models also come with slightly more standard equipment.</p>, <p>All Macan engines are mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.</p>, <p>The Macan expanded its lineup for the 2017 model year with the GTS (read <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1104397_2017-porsche-macan-gts-first-drive-review"><em>Motor Authority's</em> first drive here</a>). The new GTS draws power from an engine that splits the power difference between the existing V-6 models, settling in at 360 hp, with a round of suspension refinements.</p>, <p>The GTS cuts the Macan's 0-60 mph time to 4.8 seconds and increases the top speed to 159 mph. The GTS comes with an air suspension, adjustable dampers, and a 10-mm lower ride height.</p>, <p>All Macans have an all-wheel-drive system that always sends power to the rear wheels, but has the ability to shift 100 percent of the torque (theoretically, before driveline loss) to the front wheels. An optional torque-vectoring system splits that torque again between the rear wheels via an electronically controlled locking differential. A Sport mode remaps throttle and all-wheel-drive response, while an off-road mode can operate at speeds of under 50 mph for more precise traction needs. Hill descent control is also available from 2 to 18 mph.</p>, <p>The Macan has 7.8 inches of ground clearance, which, with the optional adjustable air suspension, can be set to just over 9 inches or down to as little as 7 inches. That's the most advanced air-spring setup; base versions have a five-link independent suspension front and rear, with a set of adaptive dampers available as well.</p>, <p>Inside, the Macan acts like the family wagon. It can carry five passengers, but if they are adults, four will be more comfortable. Power front seats are standard, with optional heating and ventilation. The rear seat's a three-person bench, split-folding into three sections to open the cargo space from 17.7 cubic feet to 53 cubic feet in all.</p>, <p>There's no crash-test data yet for the Macan, but standard features include all-wheel drive, lane-departure warnings, and a rearview camera. On the options list are blind-spot monitors and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The Macan doesn't forget the luxury side of things, with a standard power tailgate and a 7.0-inch center touchscreen. The standard 11-speaker sound system can be replaced by a 545-watt, 14-speaker setup from Bose, and if that's not enough there's a 1,000-watt, 16-speaker Burmester system at the top of the range.</p>, <p>A navigation system with a music hard drive is an option on all but the Turbo, where it is standard. It's integrated with an infotainment system that accesses web feeds and internet radio stations. Finally, the Macan mates up with Porsche Car Connect, a mobile app that enables remote unlocking, vehicle location tracking, and other data.</p>, <p>All Macans have engine stop/start as well as electric power steering, both of which help to make it more efficient. The S and Turbo share the same fuel economy ratings: 17 mpg city, 23 highway, 19 combined, according to the EPA. The GTS should have the same ratings, and the base model is rated at 20/25/22 mpg.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/porsche_718
[<p>The Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman are a two-seat convertible or coupe, respectively, and move the engine forward toward the middle of the car compared to the 911.</p>, <p>The 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman were renamed in 2017 to more closely align with the mid-engine 718 from the 1950s and early 1960s. The 718 adopted a turbocharged flat-4 in 2017 that replaced a flat-6.</p>, <p>In 2018, Porsche added GTS variants to the 718 range. </p>, <p>Ranging in price from about $55,000 to more than $80,000 for a loaded model, the Porsche 718 sits at the upper end of its price category.</p>, <p>Rivals for the 718 Boxster and Cayman include the Alfa Romeo 4C, BMW Z4, Chevrolet Corvette, Jaguar F-Type, Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class, and Nissan 370Z.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1115053_2018-porsche-718">2018 Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman review</a><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>The Boxster has been offered since the 1997 model year and the Cayman arrived for 2006. The Boxster was redesigned for the 2013 model year. The new Cayman arrived a year later, and it was named <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/bestcartobuy"><em>Motor Authority's</em> Best Car To Buy 2014.</a></p>, <p>The 2017 models are updated versions of those cars. The main change for 2017 is the duo of new engines, though the model lineup is also simplified to base and S models. The GTS, GT4 (Cayman), and Spyder (Boxster) models won't return.</p>, <p>The new base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-4 that makes 300 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque. Porsche 718 S models get a 2.5-liter flat-4 with a turbocharger that uses variable turbine geometry to help put out 350 hp and 309 lb-ft of torque. Both engines have 35 more hp than the outgoing 6-cylinder engines, and the 2.0-liter has 74 more lb-ft of torque while the 2.5-liter churns out an extra 43 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>Porsche says the new engines improve performance. With the optional 7-speed dual-clutch PDK transmission (the other transmission choice is a 6-speed manual) and Sport Chrono Package, Porsche says the 718 Boxster accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, 0.7 seconds faster than the outgoing model. With these same features, the 718 Boxster S hits 60 in 4.0 seconds, which is a half-second quicker than the model it replaces. Top speeds are 170 and 177 mph, respectively.</p>, <p>Porsche has also tuned the suspension, improved the brakes, and made the electric power steering 10 percent more direct. The Sport Chrono Package adds an Individual mode that lets drivers adjust the various vehicle systems to taste. A new Sport Response button for models with the PDK sharpens the responsiveness of the engine and transmission.</p>, <p>Two versions of the Porsche's suspension management system are offered. The base version has a 10-millimeter lower ride height and the Porsche Active Suspension Management Sport Suspension for the S model has a 20-millimeter lower ride height.</p>, <p>Every body part of the 718 Boxster’s body, except for the front and rear luggage compartment lids, the windshield, and the convertible top, is massaged for the 2017 model. The front end has larger air intakes and redesigned bi-xenon headlights with LED daytime running lights. LED headlights are available. Along the sides, the air inlets are larger. The 718 Boxster S gets new 19-inch wheels, and 20-inch wheels are optional. At the back, the taillights have LEDs as well.</p>, <p>Inside, the dash has a new design, with clean lines and smooth surfaces broken up only by the center stack and its button-filled controls. Porsche's infotainment interface has been updated. When ordered with the navigation system, it features an array of online services.</p>, <p>In most other ways—key dimensions, packaging, etc.—the 718 cars carry over the basics of the Boxster and Cayman, unchanged.</p>, <p>Despite the changes, we expect the 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman to deliver the fun balanced handling that has been the hallmark of these cars. We've found that both cars excel at tackling curves, but they are also quiet and comfortable when the pace is less frenetic. The well-appointed interiors, comfortable seats, and the Boxster's convenient power soft-top combine to create a pleasant driving experience that should only be enhanced by more power in the new models.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ram_1500
[<p>The Ram 1500 is Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' light-duty pickup. The full-size truck has a related heavy-duty range in the Ram 2500 and 3500.</p>, <p>Like other pickups, the Ram 1500 is offered with myriad configurations: multiple powertrains, body styles, trims, and bed lengths are available.</p>, <p>This truck's main rivals include the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, and GMC Sierra. Outside the Detroit Three, the Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan are also vying for the same buyers.</p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114786_2019-ram-1500">2019 Ram 1500 review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Ram 1500</strong></p>, <p>Ram unveiled its newest full-size pickup in January 2018. The 2019 Ram 1500 incorporated a bevy of technology and structural improvements including a 48-volt mild-hybrid system available on most powertrains.</p>, <p>With the 1500, Ram brought a number of style changes to its best-selling truck. The crosshairs grille is gone, and the big-rig fenders have been tamed. The four-door crew cab models offer more interior space with an additional 4 inches of room added to the cab, mostly spent in rear seat leg room.</p>, <p>Power under the hood comes from a 3.6-liter V-6 or 5.7-liter V-8 paired to the battery and electric motor system, which Ram calls eTorque. The combined output from the 3.6-liter engine and hybrid system is 305 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque. All V-6 models get the eTorque system, while V-8 versions can have the mild-hybrid components added as an option. Ram says the combined output from the V-8 is 395 hp and 410 lb-ft. A turbodiesel engine likely will return sometime in 2019.</p>, <p>The truck is lighter than the outgoing model by 225 pounds thanks to lighter steel and aluminum components.</p>, <p>Ram offers more advanced safety features on the 2019 1500 that include forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitors, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control.</p>, <p>The configurations possible for the Ram are still dizzying: six trim levels are available, three cab sizes, two bed configurations, with rear- or four-wheel drive. Ram offers a 12-inch touchscreen for infotainment on top trim levels, which is the biggest in its class.</p>, <p><strong>Ram pickup history</strong></p>, <p>For most of its life, the Ram 1500 was sold under the Dodge brand. The modern Ram debuted in 1994, when Chrysler took its stodgy, under-performing pickup and completely redesigned it with the look of a big-rig up front. The Ram immediately called attention to itself with the fresh design, as well as new features like rear-hinged club-cab doors on the innovative Quad Cab models. This rebirth brought the Ram into a solid third place behind trucks from Ford and GM, whereas before it had almost been forgotten.</p>, <p>In 2002, Chrysler introduced a new <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/dodge_ram-1500">Dodge Ram</a> with Hemi V-8 engines and a somewhat diluted look, but much improved dynamics that gave it the best ride quality in the class and some of the best towing figures, too. However, the Ram's progress would nearly halt when Chrysler was first sold by its Daimler parent company to private equity, then plunged into bankruptcy in 2009 to be rescued by Italy's Fiat.</p>, <p>The Ram brand emerged as Chrysler and Fiat wedded themselves together in the auto industry's newest mega-alliance. Pairing up in late 2009, Fiat and Chrysler divorced the Ram line from Dodge in the 2011 model year, christening the former Dodge Ram 1500 as the new Ram 1500, and updating it lightly with a new 6-speed automatic in the 2012 model year and with new trim packages, including a lavish Laramie Longhorn edition with piles of standard equipment and a plush leather interior—a rival for the GMC Denali trucks and Ford's King Ranch pickup. Ram also added an R/T 1500 with a more sporty look, and the pickup gained more available features, like a rearview camera, a USB port, and a navigation system.</p>, <p>The Ram was redesigned in 2009 with a significant refresh in 2013. In this, its current form, it's almost a new truck underneath its lightly updated sheet metal, with a new ladder frame, new V-6 gas and turbodiesel engines, a new 8-speed automatic transmission, redone interiors, a newly optional air suspension, and additional connectivity and infotainment features.</p>, <p>It's slightly lighter, which helps the base 305-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 earn some of the best gas-mileage ratings in the class—up to 17 mpg city, 25 highway with the standard 8-speed automatic, and 1 mpg higher on the city cycle when outfitted with the optional stop-start system. Some models also come with active grille shutters, which boost fuel economy by lowering drag when extra cooling isn't needed.</p>, <p>The 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 is also available with the 8-speed automatic for an economy boost; lower-priced Hemi models still get the 6-speed auto but offer the 8-speed as an inexpensive option. A new air suspension is an option on almost all models, and it offers five ride positions for aerodynamics, off-road capability, or easier loading and unloading.</p>, <p>Four-wheel drive is available on most Ram 1500s, either in part- or full-time flavor. Tow ratings are comparable to 2012 models, only minus one model that sported an 11,500-pound rating. For now, the maximum capacity stands at 10,450 pounds, while Ford and GM trucks can hit at least 11,000 pounds. All Ram 1500s also offer the RamBox, a storage system built into the truck bed and fenders; beginning with the 2013 model, a central locking switch in the cabin or on a mobile app locks and unlocks all the bins at once remotely instead of having to insert a key each time.</p>, <p>The latest Ram also receives a rich-looking interior that incorporates a rotary-shift dial for the 8-speed automatic (other automatics keep a console or column shifter) and a big new spot for an LCD screen that displays a host of new connectivity features. The big screen shows off the optional navigation system, or information from Sirius TravelLink, including gas prices or weather reports, or output from the available rearview camera. The Ram can be connected to the cloud via a 3G data link to the Sprint network, and via a mobile app, owners can start it via a smartphone, lock it or unlock it, run diagnostics, or simply enable a wireless hotspot around the vehicle.</p>, <p>Among the more spendy options are a 7.0-inch configurable gauge cluster that replaces a conventional set of gauges with readouts for up to three functions at a time—towing info, radio station, or navigation directions, for example. The Ram comes with powered USB, SD card, and AUX-in ports, as well as full iPod control via USB, as well as expanded steering-wheel controls. Of course, the top of the lineup, the $48,000 Laramie Longhorn comes with all of this standard, as well as special walnut trim harvested from logs abraded by barbed wire, and prized for their distinctive burl.</p>, <p>Safety has been a sore point compared to some of the other large pickups, but it's getting better. The Ram 1500 has a strong set of features, including a trailer-sway system, hill-start assist, and an available rearview camera system. The NHTSA has in the past given the Ram 1500 some low, three-star scores for side-impact protection, but the current version gets four stars overall, including a five-star rating for side-impact protection.</p>, <p>Late in the 2014 model year, Ram's new 3.0-liter <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1082336_ram-1500-gets-3-0l-diesel">turbodiesel V-6 became available</a> in the Ram 1500. As in the 2014 Grand Cherokee, the engine is called EcoDiesel and makes 240 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy of 20 mpg city, 28 mpg highway makes this Ram the most fuel-efficient full-size truck currently on the market (we've even achieved more than 30 mpg highway), even beating the new aluminum-bodied F-150. The Ram accomplished the solid numbers on this and other models through the use of active grille shutters, which close off front openings when less cooling is needed for the sake of aerodynamic smoothness.</p>, <p>Changes for the 2015 model year were relatively minor, although Ram used the 2015 North American International Auto Show to unveil a couple new options packages. The Ram 1500 Rebel combines an in-your-face appearance—a unique grille and front fascia, body cladding, big-letter RAM tail gate, red interior trim—with some minor off-road-focused alterations, including a one-inch suspension lift and knobby tires. There's also a 2015 EcoDiesel HFE model, which is rated at 29 mpg highway thanks to a combination of the crew cab, rear-wheel drive, and a tonneau cover—this combo was available before, but didn't have the badges or separate fuel-economy rating, although it was just as efficient.</p>, <p>For 2016, the top Laramie Limited trim gets a brightwork-intensive treatment that includes its own unique X-style grille and tall chrome letters on the tailgate. Inside, the Laramie Limited is the fanciest of the current Ram trims, with leather everywhere and lots of standard equipment. Ram also continues to add what it calls "buzz models" to the 1500 lineup, including two monochrome-look Sport models, the aptly named Orange Sport and Black Sport. The packages include different grille trim, blacked-out logos, and some interior dress-up and are available with the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. </p>, <p>A "Night" edition was added for 2017, and included a blacked-out grille and rear badges. Most of the lineup stayed the same from prior years, including powertrain options. In 2018, the Ram lineup added a new range-topping Tungsten trim level with more luxuries. Additionally, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility was added and the truckmaker has made a rearview camera standard equipment.</p>]

[<p>The Ram 2500 is Fiat Chrysler Automobile's heavy-duty pickup truck. It's available as a 3/4-ton truck (2500) or 1-ton (3500).</p>, <p>The Ram 2500 is available with three different engine options: a 5.7-liter V-8, 6.4-liter V-8, and 6.7-liter turbodiesel inline-6. It's available in three cab configurations: regular, quad cab, and mega cab; with two bed lengths: 8-foot and 6-foot-4; and rear- or four-wheel drive.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ram_2500_2018">2018 Ram 2500 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The latest Ram 2500 was unveiled in 2010 as a fourth-generation model. This year, Ram's big bruiser is newly available with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a range-topping Limited Tungsten trim level has been added to the lineup. </p>, <p>The Ram 2500 goes head-to-head-to-head with the other "cowboy Cadillacs," including the Ford F-250 Super Duty, Chevy Silverado HD 2500, and the GMC Sierra 2500 HD.</p>, <p><strong>The new Ram 2500</strong></p>, <p>In 2010, the newest Ram truck arrived, and with it, dramatic new exterior styling. A wide range of cab, bed, and powertrain options were available, and while the Ram 1500 model saw a number of more car-like (or SUV-like) changes to its suspension and cab options, the Ram 2500 and heavier-duty Ram 3500 continued on with dedicated truck layouts under the skin.</p>, <p>
Along with the launch of the new Ram pickups came the spinoff of the Ram brand from Dodge. Rather than simply being a model name under the Dodge brand, Ram Trucks is now its own brand, so each fourth-generation model is properly called only by its Ram brand name and numeric model number, i.e., Ram 2500.</p>, <p>
The fourth-generation Ram 2500 continues to the present, with a new 6.7-liter Cummins I-6 diesel joining the range in 2013, and a 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 coming for 2014. The standard base engine in the Ram 2500 is the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, rated at 383 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. The 6.4-liter V-8 is rated at 410 hp and 429 lb-ft, and is the payload champ—up to 7,390 pounds in certain trims. The 6.7-liter turbodiesel inline-6 is the overall hauling champ with 370 hp and 900 lb-ft and rated to tow up to nearly 18,000 pounds.</p>, <p>Together with the Ram Heavy Duty chassis, including high-strength steel construction, hydroformed main rails, and fully boxed rear rails, the Ram 2500 is configured for heavy-duty detail. Despite its massive tow rating, as of 2014, the Ram 2500 has joined the Ram 1500 in using a five-link coil spring rear suspension instead of the previous leaf-spring setup. A rear air suspension system is also available, offering improved ride and load-leveling capability.</p>, <p>The Ram 2500 is available in a wide swath of trims, ranging from the work-ready Tradesman to the SLT, Big Horn, Power Wagon, Laramie, Laramie Power Wagon, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited models. A Limited Tungsten is new for 2018. Ram 2500 Limited models get their own unique fascia and tailgate, Power Wagons are outfitted to be off-road trucks.</p>, <p><strong>Ram 2500 history</strong></p>, <p>The Dodge Ram line of trucks is iconic these days, but before 1981 they didn't even exist—though both Dodge and the Ram emblem did, separately. In fact, the Ram emblem was first placed on the hood of a Dodge in 1933.</p>, <p>Dodge's Ram truck was born in 1981, however, running until 1993 in its first generation. These first-generation trucks were simple, utilitarian affairs that modern truck buyers would hardly recognize. Nevertheless, the Ram's reputation for tough, simple style and working ruggedness was earned in this period. Available as a D100 (later D150), D250, or D350 (the latter two models reflecting the equivalent of today's 2500 and 3500 lines), the original Ram used a wide variety of engines, and was available in many cab/bed combinations.</p>, <p>
The second-generation Ram trucks advanced the range considerably, bringing updates to styling, powertrains, and capability—as well as the arrival of the current naming scheme: the Dodge 1500, 2500, and 3500. The Ram 2500, as pickup nomenclature suggests, was a three-quarter ton truck, available in either rear- or four-wheel drive.</p>, <p>
In 1998, the Ram truck line launched the first extended pickup cab with rear access doors, dubbed the Quad Cab. Most 2500s were Quad Cab models paired with the 6-foot bed (or "box").  This made the 2500 a large, heavy-duty truck surpassed in the Dodge Ram range only by the one-ton 3500. Second-generation Rams were built from 1993-2002 in heavy-duty form. A wide range of V-8 and V-10 gasoline engines and inline-6 Cummins diesel engines were offered over the second-generation Ram 2500's model run, ranging up to 300 hp and more than 500 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>
The Ram 2500's third generation arrived in 2002, bringing with it a new range of Hemi V-8 engines, Cummins diesels, and large-displacement V-10s. These engines, coupled with heavy-duty transmissions, gave the Dodge Ram 2500 the powertrains necessary to haul immense loads either in the bed or on the trailer hitch. Upgraded axles and beefier chassis construction gave the Ram the structural load-bearing strength to match its powertrains.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ram_promaster
[<p>The Ram ProMaster is a commercial van or chassis van. It is designed for a range of uses, from delivery duty to cargo hauling and other special uses.</p>, <p>It's assembled in Saltillo, Mexico, and meant to be a lower-cost alternative to the previous Dodge Sprinter and other commercial vans on the market. Like other Ram vans, it's intended to run forever, with lower running costs for business owners than pickups or similar commercial vehicles.</p>, <p>The ProMaster competes both with traditional body-on-frame vans like the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana, as well as the new Ford Transit, the Nissan NV and the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.</p>, <p>Updates for 2018 are limited to a standard rearview mirror and a few minor trim changes.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/ram_promaster_2018">2018 Ram ProMaster review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>According to Ram, the ProMaster’s front-wheel-drive layout affords more flexibility in configurations, allowing a lower load floor and a best-in-class step-in height and standard ceiling height—and the potential to be "up-fitted" inside for the task, whether that might be contracting, plumbing, or special delivery purposes.</p>, <p>The 280-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 is the especially smooth, refined pick, and it’s mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Those who plan to haul the heaviest loads or want to watch over running costs like a hawk might prefer the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel turbocharged inline 4-cylinder engine, making 174 hp and 295 lb-ft and connected to an unusual but effective single-clutch automated manual gearbox that offers a special trailer-tow mode.</p>, <p>The Ram ProMaster has an exceptionally tall cargo area—up to 70 inches—with the door opening just as tall, for easy loading, and Ram says that the ProMaster’s step-in height, and the width between the wheel wells, is the best in this class. There are a dozen tie-downs on the floor as well as five on the floor, and the clamshell rear cargo door arrangement can open 260 degrees. Two different roof heights (91 or 101 inches) plus what Ram terms the most vertically oriented side walls among cargo vans—altogether add to that high level of configurability.</p>, <p>The ProMaster is offered in more than a dozen different configurations, with light-duty 1500 models and heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 modes. Across these, the set of safety features includes trailer sway control (with electronic stability control). There’s also an available rear backup camera and ParkSense rear park assist. Features are geared toward these vehicles’ commercial use, but a Bluetooth hands-free calling interface is included and both a navigation system is five-inch touch screen and dedicated data connection are available.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/ram_promaster-city
[<p>The Ram ProMaster City is a light-duty, city-oriented commercial van.</p>, <p>It arrives from overseas for domestic duty, geared primarily toward commercial users: delivery services, finish carpenters, transporters, etc.</p>, <p>The Ram ProMaster City is available for 2018 in a quartet of configurations: Tradesman, Tradesman SLT, Wagon, and SLT Wagon. They're mostly unchanged other than the addition of a rearview camera as standard equipment this year.</p>, <p>The ProMaster City joins a class of vans like the Chevrolet City Express, Nissan NV200, and Ford Transit Connect that combine some small-car underpinnings with the stouter chassis, cargo box, and hauling capacity that’s needed in a light-duty, city-oriented compact van.</p>, <p>The front-end appearance of the ProMaster City is more like that of a small crossover or minivan, while from the driver’s seat back it’s all business. The familial Ram crosshair grille and a collection of nice details that carry over to both Ram trucks and some Dodge cars help bridge the gap, stylistically, and the cabin appointments are quite carlike.</p>, <p>Driving manners for the ProMaster City should be quite carlike as well, and these models have a bi-link independent rear suspension that should have a much better ride than conventional full-size vans; a strut-type front suspension is carlike in layout. The 178-horsepower, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and 9-speed automatic transmission are essentially as used in models like the Chrysler 200 and Jeep Cherokee; with an empty load the ProMaster City can dash to 60 mph in just 9.8 seconds.</p>, <p>Cargo and payload are are two of the major reasons to choose a van, and the ProMaster City lineup aims at offering the largest, most versatile cargo box among the current crop of city vans. Ram says that the cargo width is a best-in-class 60.4 inches, while total cargo volume is almost 132 feet and the 48.4-inch width between wheel wells holds a full-size pallet aboard. In cargo models, there are six tie-down rings, with a combined 1,000-pound rating, and with the rear seats folded, there's almost six feet of cargo-floor length.</p>, <p>Four models of the ProMaster City are on offer, with two of them entirely cargo-oriented. Tradesman and SLT aim at cargo use, while Wagon and SLT Wagon models offer back seats and rear side windows (although in all models the rearmost area is covered). There’s only one rear door arrangement here; the ProMaster City's setup brings 60/40-split rear doors; the doors can open to 180 degrees, with the smaller one opening to the curb side.</p>, <p>The ProMaster City will offer a version of Ram’s Uconnect infotainment touch-screen system, as well as available satellite radio and on-board navigation. Various Mopar accessories will include roof-rack systems, graphics packages, and towing accessories, while safety features are more passenger-grade, not cargo-grade, with a rearview camera, a parking aid, and a full set of airbags, including a driver’s knee bag, all part of the standard safety kit.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/rolls-royce_phantom
[<p>Today's Rolls-Royce Phantom lineup counts among it a large sedan in two wheelbase lengths; a coupe; and a convertible model known as the Drophead Coupe. Each offers a classic luxury-car experience, effortless V-12 thrust, and quintessential British styling and charm.</p>, <p>With a base price exceeding $400,000, the Phantom has few competitors besides the equally luxurious, though more understated, Bentley Mulsanne. The Phantom is one of the largest, most expensive cars on the road today. </p>, <p>The uber-luxury Phantom is four inches shorter than a Honda Odyssey and six inches shorter than a Chevy Suburban. The Phantom can be had in four body styles: sedan, coupe, drophead coupe and an even larger extended wheelbase model. Changes have been few through the 2017 model year, as is customary with Rolls-Royce.</p>, <p><strong><em><em>MORE: Read <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/rolls-royce_phantom_2017">our 2017 Rolls-Royce Phantom review</a></em></em></strong></p>, <p>Perhaps proving that old is only eventually new again, the retro-styled Phantom was not immediately accepted as a design success when it first came on the scene in 2003. The brash, squared-off look began to take off once trendsetting stars and athletes took to BMW's first attempt at a proper British motoring car. The Phantom is now a favorite among the chauffeured set, especially in extended-wheelbase form, which was added in 2007 and provides an extra 10 inches of rear leg room. It's now often found in mega-buck hotel fleets and has sired a pair of two-door offspring.</p>, <p>With a 6.8-liter V-12 engine making 453 horsepower and 531 pound-feet of torque, a 6-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive, the nearly 5,800-pound Phantom can still dash to 60 mph in well under six seconds—in, it must be added, a sort of spooky silence, with only the slightest low-pitched whoosh. The unobtrusive powertrain feel is matched with a confident but strictly uninvolved driving experience all around. This isn't a car you really want to hustle down a curvy canyon road near its limit; for the weight of the vehicle, there isn't a whole lot of available grip, even though it's stable and brakes are confident. Entry and exit in the sedan are easy, thanks to the wide-opening door setup, with the rears hinged at the back</p>, <p>Buyers of the Phantom will also pay a $3,000 gas-guzzler tax on top of the price of any model. While that surely won't strain their budget much, it might make shoppers more aware of the Phantom's low EPA ratings: 11 mpg city, 19 highway.</p>, <p>The Phantom is not a car for the shy or timid; those who have a distaste for conspicuous consumption need not apply. If, however, you intend to employ a driver, appreciate a mobile drinks cabinet, and enjoy fineries such as teak trim, there's no better car in which to be seen. The Phantom exudes wealth and exclusivity, making a statement wherever it goes.</p>, <p>Rolls-Royce's Bespoke ordering system allows a customer to essentially order any build configuration among a list of thousands of features and combinations—or completely concoct their own new features for a hefty price. Possibilities include a starlight headliner, a cooling box, a wood-veneered instrument panel, seat piping, and the aforementioned drinks cabinet, among many others.</p>, <p>Aside from the extended-wheelbase models and a few feature changes, the Phantom sedan changed little over its first decade on sale. It was joined by both the Phantom Drophead Coupe (in 2008), and Phantom Coupe (in 2009). The Drophead Coupe, which starts at $448,000, and the Coupe, at $405,000, have about the same dimensions; instead of the suicide-door arrangement of the sedan, the two-doors use a set of rear-hinged openings. Both can fit four if needed and offer comparably deft performance and an equally plush ride. For those with a desire for even more exclusivity, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1078558_rolls-royce-phantom-coupe-aviator-collection-debuts-at-pebble-beach">number of special editions</a> have been offered, while pretty much every Rolls is made to order and therefore unique to its owner.</p>, <p>Rolls-Royce recently celebrated the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081412_rolls-royce-celebrates-10-years-of-its-latest-phantom">10th anniversary of the Phantom</a> lineup in 2013 with the launch of a Series II edition at the Geneva Motor Show. The full range—sedan, coupe, and drophead coupe models—received updates to styling, drivetrains, connectivity features, and other luxury accoutrements to keep things fresh until a successor arrives.</p>, <p>An unusual <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082465_2013-rolls-royce-phantom-recalled-due-to-missing-anti-misfueling-device">recall was issued</a> for 2013 models due to a missing anti-misfueling device. In 2014, the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1092050_rolls-royce-phantom-drophead-coupe-waterspeed-collection-revealed">Phantom Drophead Coupe Waterspeed Collection</a> was revealed, offering an intriguing set of styling and equipment details, including a unique Maggiore Blue exterior paint color. The Waterspeed Collection Phantom was built in a limited run of just 35 cars.</p>, <p>The latest Phantom offerings include a special Nighthawk package for the Drophead model. Nine will be sold in the U.S., each with black paint, a black interior with red accents, tons of carbon-fiber trim, and a $569,000 price tag.</p>, <p>An all-new version of the Phantom is expected to <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1028144_2018-rolls-royce-phantom-spy-shots">make its debut for the 2018 model year</a>, bringing with it updates to the powertrain—including a possible plug-in hybrid option—styling, luxury equipment, and more. Power should meet, if not beat, that offered by the smaller Ghost and Wraith models, which currently put out up to 616 horsepower from a 6.6-liter BMW-derived V-12. It's possible that the aging 6.8-liter V-12 will be replaced by a more modern V-12 design, and the transmission is likely to be upgraded to an 8-speed unit.</p>, <p>Rolls is also aiming at the sport-utility market with a new model. It has shown a test mule that uses a shortened Phantom body on an off-road-friendly suspension.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/rolls-royce_ghost
[<p>The Rolls-Royce Ghost is the brand's "entry-level" four-door sedan. With a base price well over $250,000, the Ghost's rivals include Aston Martin Rapide, the Bentley Flying Spur and the new Mercedes-Maybach S-Class. </p>, <p>Though based on a BMW 7-Series platform, the Rolls-Royce Ghost is in a very rarefied automotive segment indeed, where sticker prices start at a quarter-million dollars and escalate quickly. Very quickly.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/rolls-royce_ghost_2017">2017 Rolls-Royce Ghost review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Ghost was presaged by Rolls-Royce's 200EX concept car, which made its debut at the Geneva Motor Show back in 2009. The series-production version was shown shortly after and was offered for sale in 2010 as a 2011 model. In contrast to the larger Phantom sedan, which makes a statement by its mere presence, the Ghost is a somewhat more subtle Rolls. The Ghost is considerably less expensive, yet still sits above big luxury sedans like the Audi A8 in price and amenities. And while not as shouty as the Phantom, the Ghost pulls from the same well of updated classic styling and looks very smart for it.</p>, <p>Inside, the Ghost has rich leather, fine wood veneers, and real metal trim, along with plenty of high-tech luxury items to coddle and impress. Rolls-Royce has again reached into BMW's stash of advanced-tech and active-safety features, giving the Ghost items like night vision, lane-departure warning, active high-beam headlights, and a surround-view camera system. The interior looks stately, much less whiz-bang than current BMW cabins, and allows the driver to hide the central display screen out of the way for a truly uncluttered appearance.</p>, <p>Like with all other Rolls-Royce models, customers have a nearly unlimited range of options when it comes to specifying their Ghost. Each car is essentially bespoke, with only time and money as the limiting factors of customization. If you were spending this kind of money on a car, you'd probably want it just so, too.</p>, <p>Although most of the Ghost's mechanicals are BMW-derived—the Ghost is related to the BMW 7-Series sedan, although it is longer than even the long-wheelbase 7er—it lives up to the Rolls-Royce expectation of torquey, smooth, and strong, with its 6.6-liter twin-turbo V-12 engine making 563 horsepower and 575 pound-feet of torque. A ZF 8-speed automatic transmission grabs the right gear, almost seamlessly, sending power to the rear wheels. A full air suspension with variable damping control and active anti-roll features—and an aluminum, multi-link layout—gives the Ghost decent handling for such a heavy (nearly 5,500 pounds), large car yet the refined, isolated ride that you'd expect in a Rolls. Performance is quite impressive, with 0–60 mph acceleration in just 4.8 seconds and a top speed limited to 155 mph. Its EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 mpg city, 20 highway—certainly nothing to brag about but in line with others of its size and power.</p>, <p>For 2012, Rolls-Royce released a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1058588_2012-rolls-royce-ghost-extended-wheelbase-2011-shanghai-auto-show">Ghost EWB model</a>, stretched 6.7 inches versus the already long standard Ghost, with most of that extra length going to back-seat passengers. In 2013, the Ghost's <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080215_2013-rolls-royce-ghost-starting-price-rises-to-260750">starting price rose</a> to just over $260,000.</p>, <p>At the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082692_2014-rolls-royce-wraith-unveiled-2013-geneva-motor-show">coupe counterpart to the Ghost</a> arrived, resurrecting the Wraith nameplate. The suicide-door, fastback coupe is Rolls-Royce's most powerful car ever, at 616 horsepower. The 2013 Shanghai Auto Show saw the arrival of a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083629_rolls-royce-ghost-alpine-trial-centenary-collection-shanghai-auto-show">new special-edition Ghost</a>, patterned after the Silver Ghost of the 1913 Alpine Trials. It is the first Bespoke-created car to be based on a Rolls-Royce heritage car.</p>, <p>Rolls-Royce also now sells a coupe based on the Ghost platform, the fastback Wraith. It may also add a convertible version of the Wraith at some point soon to fill out the lineup.</p>, <p>At the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, a revised and updated version of the Ghost, called the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1090678_rolls-royce-ghost-series-ii-unveiled-at-geneva-motor-show">Ghost Series II</a>, was revealed. Upgrades and updates include the Satellite Aided Transmission from the Wraith—it anticipates the road and chooses what it thinks is the right gear for the terrain—a mildly redesigned front end, and updated forward lighting. The 6.0-liter V-12's 563-horsepower and 575-pound-feet ratings remain unchanged, leaving the Wraith as the most powerful Roller. Fuel economy is up slightly, to 13/21 mpg for both the Ghost and Ghost EWB.</p>, <p>A Dynamic Driving Package is available for this, the more driver-focused of Rolls's sedan offerings, and includes different chassis tuning. All Series II Ghosts have retuned suspension, as well as an updated infotainment package with a touch-sensitive controller borrowed from the latest BMW iDrive system. The Ghost Series II emerged as a 2015 model-year offering for Rolls-Royce in the U.S.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/rolls-royce_wraith
[<p>The Rolls-Royce Wraith is a two-door coupe that shares its heritage with Rolls' smaller Ghost sedan. It was launched for the 2014 model, and the Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible—<span>or "drophead" in Rolls-Royce lingo—</span>was added for 2016 on the same basic structure.</p>, <p>The Wraith is the most powerful car Rolls-Royce has ever built. The Dawn isn't quite as powerful, but it is the newest model from the esteemed British luxury marque. With its fastback design, the Wraith is much sleeker than the larger Phantom coupe but draws on many of the same design flourishes. The Dawn features a more traditional convertible coupe shape.</p>, <p>The shape and size of the Wraith and Dawn suggest they are competitors for the Bentley Continental GT, the car that really defined the ultra-luxury coupe and convertible market more than a decade ago. But suiting the Rolls-Royce marque, the Wraith and especially the Dawn are far more expensive, more powerful, and come with a host of features unavailable on the Bentley. More than the Dawn, the Wraith also carries a much more extroverted design than the Bentley, which may or may not be a plus for prospective buyers.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/rolls-royce_wraith_2017">2017 Rolls-Royce Wraith preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Rolls-Royce has moved away from its time-honored practice of specifying the power of its engines simply as "adequate," so we know that the Wraith's twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V-12 engine produces a substantial 624 horsepower. The car—despite its 5,200-pound avoirdupois—is said to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in no more than 4.4 seconds, a decent figure for such a large sports coupe, let alone a car with the degree of luxury and features provided by Britain's preeminent luxury brand. The Dawn makes "just" 563 horsepower, and the 0 to 60 mph run takes 4.9 seconds.</p>, <p>The mechanical bits for both cars include electronically controlled air suspension and an 8-speed automatic transmission that uses satellite data to choose the correct gear for the road ahead. Not that buyers are likely to mind, but fuel efficiency is rated at just 15 mpg combined for the Wraith and 14 mpg for the Dawn, and both prefer premium gasoline, thank you very much.</p>, <p>But it's the design—a traditional upright front combined with elegant fastback coupe and convertible coupe bodies—and the interior luxury that really set the Wraith and Dawn apart from any other road car not bearing a Spirit of Ecstasy up front. Cabin materials include the finest of soft, supple, rich leathers, carefully selected woods of various exotic species, and precisely machined metal details that add a modern edge to the traditional fixtures and fittings—including chrome knobs and switches of a heft and feel simply not found in any other car. The Wraith's <em>piece de resistance</em> may be the available Starlight Headliner, which uses fiber optics to mimic the night sky with more than 1,000 individual stars in a recognizable pattern. This feature appeared first on the larger Phantom line and has now become a Rolls-Royce signature offering. If you want to see stars in the Dawn, just open the roof at night.</p>, <p>Pricing for the Rolls-Royce Wraith starts in excess of $300,000 and the Dawn tops $330,000, though the lavish list of optional equipment ensures that most examples will exit the factory with considerably higher price tags. More importantly, if there's a feature or fitting you want that's not offered on the standard list, Rolls-Royce is happy to craft, design, and install it for you—at a price. And if you have to ask what that price may be, the Wraith is not the car for you.</p>, <p><span>For 2015, the Wraith received a long list of small tweaks to its standard and optional equipment list, as well as a few new customization options. Our favorite was the available leather boot lining, which would provide the perfect place to rest your equally supple (and assuredly expensive) leather luggage.</span></p>, <p><span>Changes to the Wraith for 2016 were inconsequential, and both cars carry over unchanged for 2017.<br/></span></p>]

[<p>The tiny Smart Fortwo two-seat hatchback is meaningful to two kinds of buyers in the U.S. It's sought out by drivers who have only small parking spaces available to them, almost always in cities, and it's used in car-sharing programs.</p>, <p>For everyone else, it may be hard to overlook the many penalties that this tiny model's minimal length imposes. It was redesigned for 2016 year and a convertible version rejoined the lineup for 2017.</p>, <p>For 2018, parent-company Mercedes-Benz looked for a new approach as it axed the gasoline-powered Smart models in favor of a battery-only lineup. It makes Smart the only other manufacturer besides Tesla to offer a battery-only offering, although the two companies are very different.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/smart_fortwo_2018" title="2018 Smart Fortwo - review">2018 Smart Fortwo review</a><a><br/></a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Fortwo, which has been offered in coupe, cabriolet, and electric models, has the distinction of being the smallest highway-legal car ever sold in the U.S. Though the little Smart has now been on sale in the U.S. for 10 years, it hasn't sold particularly well and its chief rival in the U.S., the Scion iQ, is no longer available.</p>, <p><strong>The new Smart Fortwo</strong></p>, <p>The Smart Fortwo was redesigned for 2016, the first complete redesign the model has received since the brand was launched in 1998. It continues to be a two-door coupe with a small rear hatch, plus a new Cabriolet model that arrived for 2017. </p>, <p>That soft-top Smart features a special “Tritop” roof that can be configured three ways: fully open, fully closed, and partially open, like a large sunroof. The power roof takes just 12 seconds to retract, and it can be operated with the keyfob, although the side bars must still be removed by hand.</p>, <p>The new generation of Smart Fortwo holds fast to a length of slightly less than 9 feet long, but it's roughly four inches wider. The tiny proportions give the Fortwo the best turning radius, at 22.8 feet curb to curb, of any car on the market. The short length means it will continue to slot into the smallest of parallel spaces, while the increased  width will be welcomed by full-size Americans who found themselves cheek by jowl inside the older model.</p>, <p>The profile hasn't changed much either. The latest Fortwo has the same snub nose, perky styling, and clearly defined passenger compartment, with wheels pushed out to the corners and side styling accented by the contrasting color. Design features carried over from the previous Smart include the prominent shoulder line, frameless door windows, and a split tailgate whose upper portion opens for access while the lower half flips down to provide a temporary surface.</p>, <p>The front end is definitely more defined and bulbous than before—partly a result of tougher pedestrian-safety requirements. The interior is a bit more visually interesting than in the previous models, but still fairly simple. Two eyeball vents sit on top of the dash, and a small instrument cluster behind the wheel contains the usual gauges. A touchscreen display sits slightly proud of the central console, and overall, the interior has a far more substantial feel.</p>, <p>The Smart Fortwo had an 89-horsepower turbocharged 0.9-liter 3-cylinder good for 100 pound-feet of torque. There's a choice of a 5-speed manual or a new dual-clutch automatic.</p>, <p>The basics haven’t changed much: The Fortwo family (except for the Electric Drive) has its little engine mounted on its side between the rear wheels, under the load bay, with power delivered through the rear wheels. Fuel economy for the coupe wasn't remarkable: the little car managed 34 mpg city, 39 highway, 36 combined, according to the EPA. The automaker says 0-to-60-mph acceleration is 10.1 seconds for the manual, and 10.5 seconds for the DCT. Fortwo cabriolet models add some extra weight and thus are more than a second (11.6 sec.) slower to 60.</p>, <p>The base Pure model (offered only in coupe guise) includes power windows, central locking, LED daytime running lights, cruise control, power steering, and audio and other controls on the steering wheel. The audio system includes a CD player, Bluetooth streaming for playing music and hands-free commands. The instrument cluster includes a 3.5-inch color display, and a trip computer and an exterior temperature display are also standard. Beyond that, the Passion, Prime, and Proxy trim levels provide a mix of different features, using interior trim and fittings to give the different models distinct characters.</p>, <p>Infotainment options in the Fortwo lineup include smartphone integration and a navigation system with real-time traffic and weather data. The Smart Cross Connect app allows owners to access their car and other useful functions while away from the vehicle. A top-end JBL sound system with eight speakers and a 240-watt amplifier should provide substantial sound for the small cabin.</p>, <p>A new Smart Fortwo Electric Drive arrived in the 2018 model year, as a hardtop and as a cabriolet. A 17.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack provides a claimed 99 miles of range for the hardtop ForTwo Electric Drive, and 96 miles for the Cabrio. The electric motor in both ForTwo Electric Drive body styles sends 59 kilowatts (80 horsepower) and 118 pound-feet of torque to the rear wheels.</p>, <p>The ForTwo Electric Drive will do 0 to 60 mph in 11.4 seconds, while the Cabrio takes 11.7 seconds, according to Smart. Top speed for both models is limited to 81 mph.</p>, <p><strong>The previous Smart Fortwo</strong></p>, <p>After years of hesitation and false starts, Smart launched the Fortwo in the U.S. in 2008, right into the teeth of a gas crisis. It sold like gangbusters in its first two years, but the numbers fell drastically in the years after that, averaging about 10,000 units a year.</p>, <p>The versions of the Fortwo that are being phased out in 2016 were powered by a 70-hp, 1.0-liter Mitsubishi 3-cylinder gasoline engine that was mated exclusively to a 5-speed automated manual. Dimensions were slightly different, along with various changes in materials, trims, and switchgear, but U.S. Smarts kept the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive configuration. When gently driving and not zipping, the transmission could be obstinate, lurching between gears in indecision. Performance wasn't that impressive if you went by the specs: 0-to-60-mph times were a leisurely 13 seconds or so.</p>, <p>The attributes that made the first Fortwo so appealing in the city conspired to make it less so—and in some cases even a little scary—on the highway. Engine and road noise were excessive at freeway speeds, and while the Smart could cruise at 70 mph or even 80 mph, no one wanted to stay at those speeds for long. The short wheelbase and rather tight suspension calibration that helped it feel so responsive, albeit a little jittery, in the city made it bouncy and busy at higher speeds—it was especially sensitive to crosswinds, while grooved pavement caused noticeable tramlining.</p>, <p>Packaging in the Smart could take some getting used to at first, but it was a brilliantly space-efficient car. Overall, it felt like sitting in a small, exceptionally narrow pickup cab, though a quick look ahead and behind could evoke a sense of vulnerability. This Fortwo performed quite well in crash tests—for its size—and came with stability control, side airbags, and ABS.</p>, <p>A comprehensive interior freshening came in 2011, with a few new features added to the stark cabin decor—at the request, Smart said, of buyers. For 2013, the mildest of upgrades included updated front and rear styling, and moving the Smart badge from the hood to the center of the grille.</p>, <p><strong>Smart Fortwo Electric Drive</strong></p>, <p>Smart offered a handful of Electric Drive cars for lease in 2011. These versions used a low-power electric motor and lithium-ion battery packs from the then-startup Tesla Motors, of which Daimler used to be a shareholder. The Smart ED carried a hefty lease bill and had only 63 miles of range to a charge according to the EPA. Many of the original Electric Drive cars have migrated to Car2Go fleets that are stationed in large cities.</p>, <p>In 2013, the <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1079596_2013-smart-electric-drive-test-lowest-priced-electric-car-in-u-s" title="2013 Smart Electric Drive Test: Lowest-Priced Electric Car In U.S.">Smart Electric Drive</a> arrived with a new all-electric powertrain. At roughly double the price of the cheapest gasoline Smart Fortwo, it's the least expensive plug-in electric car sold in the U.S. It's also much nicer to drive than the gasoline version, because its single-speed transmission dispenses with the lurching, thudding automatic shifts that make the gasoline car such an amusement-park ride.</p>, <p>The electric Smart performs as well as the gasoline version—its acceleration is actually slightly quicker—and qualifies for a $7,500 federal income-tax credit and a $2,500 California purchase rebate, meaning an effective price after incentives of only about $15,000. In some ways, it's the car that the Smart Fortwo should have been all along, as the small car is best suited to short trips in the city anyway. The Electric Drive carried on with the old body style in 2016, but an all-new model using the new Fortwo is to be introduced in late 2016 and will likely arrive in the U.S. as a 2018 model.</p>]

[<p>The Subaru WRX and WRX STI are four-door sedan spin-offs of the mild-mannered Impreza sedan. The WRX twins are the bad boys of the lineup. With turbocharged engines and stiffly sprung suspensions and performance-oriented all-wheel drive, they're essentially road-going versions of Subaru rally cars.</p>, <p>The models offer two very different levels of performance. While the WRX is an exciting daily driver, the more extreme WRX STI is closer to a real race car straight out of the factory.</p>, <p>Only a handful of other rivals are offered in North America, including the original hot hatch, the Volkswagen Golf GTI, and the Ford Focus ST, both lack all-wheel drive. Some also consider the Mercedes-Benz CLA45 as a worthy competitor, but it is in a price category one or two notches above these cars. The GTI-based Golf R has all-wheel drive and it is a worthy competitor for the WRX STI. Same goes for the rally-ready Ford Focus RS.</p>, <p>For 2018, Subaru mildly updated the exterior of the WRX and STI with a new front bumper and painted brake calipers. The performance is largely unchanged aside from a special edition STI RA due later in the year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114280_2018-subaru-wrx">2018 Subaru WRX and WRX STI review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Subaru WRX and STI</strong></p>, <p>New versions of the WRX and WRX STI arrived for the 2015 model year. Both are based on the Impreza sedan, adding the right reinforcements and upgrades to transform the feeling and meld well with the all-wheel-drive system and turbocharged flat-4 engines. Though they may not be beautiful, both models are plenty of fun behind the wheel. Unfortunately, a hatchback body style did not return with this generation.</p>, <p>The WRX stuffs Impreza shell with a lovely 2.0-liter turbo-4, with twin-scroll turbocharging and an intercooler, for a net 268 horsepower. It's coupled to either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and with different flavors of all-wheel drive, depending on the transmission. The CVT has programming to let it behave like an automatic transmission or a quick-shifting dual-clutch gearbox. The WRX also gets electric power steering and a sport-tuned suspension, all riding on 17-inch, 45-series tires. Subaru makes 18-inch wheels available as well.</p>, <p>WRX STI models get their own engine, a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-4 that puts out 305 hp; the powertrain is mostly carryover from the last generation. The STI also has some additional chassis upgrades, with beefier brakes, a unique suspension tune, and a more intelligent and complex all-wheel-drive system. As in past versions, the STI has a driver controlled differential, which lets you fine-tune the torque split between the helical front and Torsen rear limited-slip differentials.</p>, <p>The wheelbase of the latest WRX and STI is about an inch longer than their predecessors, so interior space is better. The interior, especially the dash, is more nicely finished than before. This generation also gains almost 2 inches of rear-seat leg room, plus a bit more trunk space. There's no mistaking it for an Audi S4—either inside, or in sticker price—as its economy-car roots still shine through somewhat.</p>, <p>Among standard features, the WRX has automatic climate control, Bluetooth, a flat-bottomed steering wheel that tilts and telescopes, and steering-wheel audio and phone controls. The WRX STI adds suede-insert seats and LED-equipped headlamps.</p>, <p>Though compact cars, neither the WRX nor the STI are fuel sippers. The STI is only rated by the EPA at 17 mpg city, 23 highway, 19 combined. Fuel efficiency has always been the job of the base Impreza, while the WRX and STI offer performance.</p>, <p>The current generation WRX and STI get high marks for roominess, acceleration, and roadholding. Ride is firm but tolerable and almost smooth in the base WRX. Downsides are a high level of cabin noise and an occasionally balky shift linkage on the manual.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, Subaru's WRX and STI added the company's exceptional EyeSight forward-collision prevention system. Blind-spot monitors became a new option, and Subaru's Starlink infotainment interface with a 6.2-inch touchscreen became standard on all WRX models. Several other options were added as well, including a small spoiler that can replace the shelf-like wing on STI models.</p>, <p>Changes for 2017 are minor. The headliner is improved and the WRX Limited model adds reverse automatic braking when ordered with EyeSight.</p>, <p><strong>Subaru WRX and STI history</strong></p>, <p>The WRX first arrived in 2002, and the STI followed two years later as a 2004 model. They were originally offered as two- or four-door sedans, and the five-door hatchback version arrived with the 2008 model year. Many running changes were made over the first few model years, including fender flares for 2005 and new front-end styling in 2006. In the last year of the former generation, a WRX STI Limited model was also launched to add a bit of luxury to the severe standard model. Its amenities included leather upholstery, an optional moonroof, a trunk spoiler, and fog lights.</p>, <p>The second-generation WRX, which arrived in 2008, wasn't well received by its fans in the first model year. They viewed it as underpowered and too softly sprung. Subaru listened to its buyers, and for 2009, the WRX's 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-4 engine got a boost of 41 horsepower, to 265 hp—and the STI was boosted to 305 hp. A 5-speed manual gearbox remained standard, with an optional (and somewhat outdated) 4-speed automatic offered as well. Maximum performance required revving the engines, as both models exhibited a fair degree of turbo lag.</p>, <p>For 2011, Subaru <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1049466_driven-2011-subaru-impreza-wrx-sedan">gave the WRX a new look</a>, with flared fenders and a widened track to match the STI, which complemented the overall design. Sound systems were also all-new that year, adding standard USB and iPod connectors plus available satellite radio. While the rest of the Impreza lineup was thoroughly updated for 2012, the WRX and STI continued essentially unchanged into 2013.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/subaru_crosstrek
[<p>The Subaru Crosstrek is a five-seat crossover SUV spun off from the Impreza family of compact cars. Subaru introduced the Crosstrek in 2013 and initially called it the XV Crosstrek, but dropped the "XV" for 2016.</p>, <p>With the Crosstrek, Subaru aims at buyers looking for something with a little more of an off-road bent. Competitors of the tall-riding Subaru are the Jeep Patriot and Renegade, Fiat 500X, Chevy Trax, Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, and the Mini Countryman. The Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3 are also rivals.</p>, <p>The Crosstrek was completely redesigned for 2018, although one might be hard-pressed to spot the differences. Its interior was updated, and it included the automaker's newest infotainment system.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/subaru_crosstrek_2018">2018 Subaru Crosstrek review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new</strong> <strong>Subaru Crosstrek</strong></p>, <p>Subaru redesigned the Crosstrek for 2018, basing the car on a universal platform it's using for nearly all of its vehicles. While the Crosstrek is still based primarily on the Impreza, the tall-riding wagon adds a few enhancements to separate it from the five-door wagon.</p>, <p>A 2.0-liter flat-4 still powers the new Crosstrek, although output is increased slightly to 152 horsepower. Two transmissions are available in the Crosstrek, a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable automatic with seven simulated gears. All-wheel drive is standard on all models, and Subaru added its "X-Mode" system to the Crosstrek from the Forester to aid in particularly tricky off-road situations.</p>, <p>Inside, the Crosstrek is fitted with updated materials and a new 8.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment. The interior of the Crosstrek borrows liberally from the Impreza, which was made more upscale for 2017 compared to others in the class. Despite the nicer amenities, the Crosstrek's gray fabric still retains that "wash and ready" feel that appealed to many first-generation buyers.</p>, <p>Subaru has increased the Crosstrek's rigidity and improved its suspension, and it's quieter than the outgoing model.</p>, <p>The new 2018 Crosstrek went on sale in the summer of 2017 starting at $22,710 for base models.</p>, <p><strong>Crosstrek history</strong></p>, <p>The first generation Crosstrek rode almost four inches higher than the Impreza hatchback from which it was based. It received entirely different front and rear fascia styling, unique lower body cladding, and a roof rack that can carry up to 150 pounds of gear. Mechanical changes included a beefed-up suspension, larger wheels and tires, structural reinforcements, bigger brakes, and a larger fuel tank. The Crosstrek was also one of very few vehicles in the compact crossover class that's rated for towing—up to 1,500 pounds.</p>, <p>The Crosstrek's interior was largely carried over from the Impreza hatchback, though it had more rugged upholstery, along with a removable, rubberized cargo tray that can be easily hosed off. Just as in the Impreza, seating is well-placed to make the most of the interior, with room for four adults and a backseat that's a bit tight in leg room, but not lacking in head room. While there are soft-touch materials on the dash, some of the interior trims and details look no better than what you'd expect for the Crosstrek's $22,500 base price.</p>, <p>On the road—and off it too—the Crosstrek is essentially a compact hatchback on steroids, giving it more wide-ranging abilities. Its 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter flat-4 engine meant it's far from the most powerful model in the class. The 5-speed manual gearbox was best for wringing out the most from the engine, but the Crosstrek accelerates well enough with the continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). When a quick burst of power is needed, the CVT can be slow to respond.</p>, <p>With the same all-wheel-drive systems used in all Subaru's cars—they're actually different for CVT and manual models—the Crosstrek scrambles ably along particularly challenging muddy or rocky trails as well as through deep snow. It's aided by a whopping 8.7 inches of ground clearance, and that combined with its small size lets it get through trails and situations like many truck-based utility vehicles. It rides well, and its compact dimensions and precise steering make tight maneuvers easy whether on-road or off.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1083011_2014-subaru-xv-crosstrek-hybrid-new-york-auto-show-preview" title="2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid: New York Auto Show Preview">2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid</a> was the first-ever hybrid from the brand, and while it didn't produce soaring fuel-efficiency ratings, it found an eager audience among the brand's often-eco-aware buyers. The hybrid powertrain inserted a small 10-kw (13.4-hp) electric motor between the engine and CVT, though it's there largely to assist the engine and can propel the vehicle from a stop on electricity alone only if you're willing to accelerate very, very gently—and there's no one behind you.</p>, <p>In the real world, the hybrid pack had a pretty minimal impact on fuel economy—it's a mild-hybrid system that only kicks in at 40 mph or less. <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1106508_su-bie-or-not-su-bie-subaru-crosstrek-hybrid-axed-for-2017">It was discontinued after the 2016 model year</a>.</p>, <p>Gas mileage is a strong selling point for the Crosstrek—and a real reason to choose it over one of the taller or larger crossovers. The hybrid improves a little, although we failed to see any real-world improvement over the CVT-equipped Crosstrek in a road test of almost 500 miles.</p>, <p>The Crosstrek is a strong value for the money, with keyless ignition, air conditioning, cruise control, and Bluetooth connectivity all included on the Premium, which may be the best pick for buyers who'll use the car off road to haul sporting gear and athletic people. The Limited model adds automatic climate control, leather upholstery, and a fold-down rear armrest. An available combination navigation and audio system brings voice commands, test-massaging ability, and XM NavTraffic.</p>, <p>The IIHS called the Crosstrek a Top Safety Pick+; the NHTSA has given the Crosstrek four stars for frontal crash and rollover safety, on the other hand, but it earns five stars (the highest rating) for side impact, and in the overall rating.</p>, <p>For 2015, Subaru made changes to available technology. The infotainment setups were completely updated, with touchscreens standard on all models; the entry-level system uses a 6.2-inch display, while the pricier trim levels get a 7.0-inch touchscreen with support for multi-touch gestures. Subaru's camera-based EyeSight safety tech also became available on higher trims, bringing features like lane-departure warning and collision warning to the little crossover hatch.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/subaru_outback
[<p>The Subaru Outback is hard to define. It's a crossover, SUV, and wagon all rolled into one. For two decades, it's been a go-to for mountain-staters who've used it to traverse the trails and roads around higher elevations.</p>, <p>The distinction between crossovers and wagons is usually relatively clear, but the Outback sits right on the dividing line. That may be one of the reasons for its enduring popularity. Because it's derived from the Legacy sedan—and the placement of its boxer engines give it a low center of gravity even with more than eight inches of ground clearance—it handles more like a car than a crossover.</p>, <p>Competitors span a wide swath of the automotive universe, from the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee to pricier entries like Mercedes-Benz's E-Class wagon. Crossover-wagon alternatives include the Volvo XC90 and V60 Cross Country as well as the Audi Allroad.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/subaru_outback_2018">2018 Subaru Outback review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Subaru Outback</strong></p>, <p>The new Outback, which launched as a 2015 model, has grown compared to the last model. It has lost some of its body cladding for a more road-oriented aesthetic, somewhat closer to the Legacy wagons of old. Like its Legacy sedan sibling, the latest Outback has evolved instead of undergoing any big changes, which turns out to be a good thing. Inside, the dash sits straighter and the seats are nicer than before.</p>, <p>The mechanicals are familiar. The engines essentially carried over, while all versions now sport a continuously variable transmission. Steering goes electric-assist across the model line, and the ratio is quicker than that used in its predecessor; the brakes were upgraded too with ventilated four-wheel discs now standard on all models. A new "X-Mode" system helps the Outback's standard all-wheel drive control active torque distribution where traction needs arise. There's also hill-descent control and special logic for the stability control and all-wheel-drive systems.</p>, <p>Ride and handling are better than ever, too. The Outback no longer requires even a small sacrifice in on-road comfort for its moderate trail-blazing ability. The Outback maintains 8.7 inches of ground clearance—more than some taller crossovers with more rugged profiles. It still feels as if it's a mid-size car, jacked up a few more inches—which makes the Outback's cargo space a little easier to load than most crossovers, too.</p>, <p>The federal government gives the new Outback five stars overall, with five stars in every category except for rollover, where it scores four. The Outback gets top "Good" crash-test results from the IIHS and earned the Top Safety Pick+ award as a result. The EyeSight active-safety system, which uses a multiple-camera system to incorporate adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane-departure warning, is available. A new blind-spot monitor can warn of approaching vehicles in adjacent lanes, and detect vehicle cross traffic when backing out of a driveway or parking-lot space.</p>, <p>Minor changes for the 2016 model year included the addition of lane-keeping assist to the EyeSight forward-collision prevention system, and revised steering and suspension tuning for better performance.</p>, <p>For 2017, Subaru added a top-of-the-line Touring trim to the Outback and rear automatic emergency braking to avoid objects behind the car.</p>, <p>The 2018 Outback is modestly updated with a new infotainment system that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard, a handful of additional luxury features, and more sound deadening.</p>, <p><strong>Subaru Outback history</strong></p>, <p>The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/outback">Outback</a> started as a trim level on what was then the wagon version of the Subaru Legacy sedan. It came at a time when Subaru's sales were suffering, and sales of sport-utility vehicles were booming. Initially, the Outback received standard all-wheel drive (not every Subaru had it back then), more rugged trim, two-tone paint, and fog lamps.</p>, <p>In 1996, the model followed through on the promise a bit more, gaining slightly more ground clearance than the Legacy wagon, along with taller tires, full-skirt body cladding, tougher seat upholstery, and big fog lamps in the bumper. In the years that followed, The first Outback had a 135-horsepower, 2.2-liter flat-4, but in 1996 that was increased to a 155-hp, 2.5-liter flat-4. Subaru also began offering an Outback sedan in this generation.</p>, <p>The Outback was refreshed for 2000, when it gained completely new front- and back-end styling, along with a redone interior. A 165-hp, 2.5-liter flat-4 was under the hood, with 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmissions. During this period, even more luxurious L.L. Bean Edition and VDC models were introduced—the latter with a 212-hp, 3.0-liter flat-6—which in this iteration never felt much faster than the four. At this time, the Outback had a little over an inch of extra ground clearance than the Legacy Wagon, along with more shielding, chip-resistant body cladding, and a standard roof rack, plus larger, 16-inch wheels, and Subaru confirmed the Outback was good for light off-roading.</p>, <p>In 2005 came a redesign and a considerably raised ride height—which turned the car from a wagon to a "light truck" in the eyes of the feds, although Subaru rarely discussed it—as well as other modifications. These included revised powertrains: the base engine now made 170 hp, the flat-6 made 245 hp, and there was a new XT model featuring a 243-hp, turbocharged 2.5-liter flat-4. Most of the 4-cylinder models had 5-speed manual or 4-speed auto transmissions again, but the flat-6 was paired with a 5-speed automatic. The Outback sedan, which had been offered in the second and third generations, was discontinued when the fourth-generation car received a facelift in 2008.</p>, <p>A new generation was launched in 2010, at which point all sedan models became Legacys and all of the wagons used the Outback nameplate. For 2012, the Outback received a new 2.5-liter flat-4, replacing an older engine that produced 170 hp. The flat-6 carried into the new model. Although this Outback had a more settled, refined ride, like a larger car, it didn't handle with quite the same bite as did the previous generation. Utility was even better than on earlier models, though, with increased cargo space.</p>, <p>In the 2013 Outback, Subaru finally added a USB charging port, plus iPod controls, as well as Bluetooth hands-free calling and audio streaming. A host of active-safety features—an EyeSight driver-assistance system, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, and automatic emergency braking—were also made available.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/subaru_forester
[<p>The Subaru Forester crossover SUV is a tall wagon with standard all-wheel drive. The middle child in the Subaru lineup, it's also the automaker's most practical vehicle, with lots of room and a long-lived reputation for durability overshadowing things like styling and luxury touches.</p>, <p>Slotted between the smaller XV Crosstrek hatchback and the bigger Outback wagon, the Forester sits in the compact class along with vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4, among others.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/subaru_forester_2019" title="2015 Subaru Forester - review">2019 Subaru Forester preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Subaru Forester</strong></p>, <p>Though it doesn't look much different from its predecessor, the 2019 Subaru Forester is a clean-sheet redesign that shares little in common with the outgoing model. Its boxy shape grows slightly, with about an extra inch of overall length dedicate primarily to improving rear-seat room. Under its hood, a 182-horsepower flat-4 roots power to all four wheels via a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The turbo option, long a Forester standby, was dropped.</p>, <p>Inside, the Forester's upgraded interior boasts even better visibility than before and a big upgrade in materials. Standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are welcome additions. All models feature Subaru's EyeSight safety tech—automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control. Touring models debuted a new infrared camera system that monitors drivers and sounds an alert if they begin to nod off or are not watching the road closely.</p>, <p>The Forester launches with five trim levels: base, Premium, a new Sport grade, Limited, and Touring. The Sport's suspension and steering settings are unchanged, but it has its own styling and a special "Sport Sharp" mode for its driveline that provides snappier throttle response.</p>, <p><strong>Subaru Forester history<br/></strong></p>, <p>Since its launch in 1998, all Forester models have been tall wagons built on the underpinnings of the compact Impreza sedan and hatchback. As the Forester gained in volume and reputation over its first decade, it entirely replaced the five-door Impreza wagon once that compact-car line was redesigned for 2008.</p>, <p>The first-generation Forester ran from 1998 through 2003, followed by a second generation that spanned model years 2004 to 2008. That second Forester was significantly restyled halfway through its life, with a new front end, tailgate, and rear lights added for the 2006 model year. The third generation was launched in 2009 and ran through 2013.</p>, <p>Although it launched just as the recession arrived, the 2009 Forester shattered sales records by hitting just the right spot in the highly competitive compact crossover market. New buyers were lured to the brand by a sticker price that started just around $20,000, along with high perceived value, and Subaru's standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>For the third generation, the Forester 2.5X model produced 170 hp from its 2.5-liter engine, with either a 5-speed manual gearbox or an old 4-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5XT turbo version, a significant upgrade, boosted power output to 224 hp.</p>, <p>Base models were practical but spartan, though a lengthy list of trim levels and options was offered that easily pushed the price past the $30,000 mark. Those features included a navigation system, along with leather upholstery, a 10-way powered and heated driver's seat, and a moonroof.</p>, <p>The Forester was most recently redesigned for the 2014 model year, when it was named <em>The Car Connection</em>'s Best Car To Buy. There were few changes for 2015, but the next year, the Forester adopted Subaru's new infotainment system, with a bigger, cleaner touchscreen.</p>, <p>There were more changes for 2017. On the outside, the front fascia and headlights and taillights are tweaked. Inside, Subaru offers a new Saddle Brown leather upholstery, as well as several measures to reduce interior noise. The base engine gets slightly better fuel economy CVT, and the all-wheel-drive system adds available torque vectoring. Most importantly, Subaru adds and improves several safety features. The EyeSight system gets color cameras with wider and longer range, and newly available are automatic high-beam assist, steering-linked headlights that point into turns, and reverse automatic braking.</p>, <p>Upgrades continued in 2018, with automatic high-beam headlights and reverse automatic braking added to all Foresters fitted with the EyeSight system. EyeSight is now standard on the Touring trim level, while the 2.0XT Touring gets active torque vectoring as standard. Finally, for what is likely to be the last model year before a redesign, Subaru has added a new 2.5i Forester Black Edition trim package as an upgrade to the Premium trim, with black paint, wheels, and trim accents.</p>, <p>Subaru took the fourth-generation Forester mainstream to some degree in the current generation, though it has kept the overall package about the same size as the 2013 model. Still, it manages to offer more rear-seat and cargo space, improved infotainment, and a sportier exterior.</p>, <p>In <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081916_2014-subaru-forester-first-drive">our initial drive of the current generation Subaru Forester</a>—as well as subsequent experiences including a <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1090333_2014-subaru-forester-xt-six-month-road-test">six-month road test of the 2014 Forester</a>—we found it to be roomier and more refined than ever, yet still surprisingly rugged.</p>, <p>The Forester offers a choice of two powertrains: a 170-hp, 2.5-liter flat-4 for the 2.5i, and a turbocharged 2.0-liter direct-injected flat-4 making 250 hp in the 2.0XT. Subaru's CVT offers a special Sport manual mode on the XT model that simulates six or eight "gears," depending on the setting. The less expensive trim levels with the naturally aspirated engine are still available with a 6-speed manual transmission.</p>, <p>EPA fuel economy ratings are as high as 28 mpg combined, which is up 1 mpg this year, and that's quite respectable for a tall crossover vehicle with standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The current Forester made safety news when it was the first "Small SUV" to earn the highest rating rating in the IIHS's small overlap frontal crash test. It also receives the Top Safety Pick+ stamp of approval from the IIHS. The NHTSA gives the Forester five stars overall, with four stars in the rollover and frontal crash categories. The Forester has also inherited Subaru's camera-based EyeSight active-safety tech package, which enables adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and other features.</p>, <p>At long last, for the 2013 model year, Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity and audio streaming became standard, along with a USB port and iPod capability. Steering-wheel audio controls were made standard as well, and a new Value Package bundled the popular All-Weather Package (heated seats and mirrors, plus wiper de-icer) with a display audio system and fog lights.</p>]

[<p>The Subaru Ascent is the automaker's three-row family crossover SUV and the largest vehicle Subaru has ever produced.</p>, <p>It is new for the 2019 model year and will go on sale in summer 2018.</p>, <p>Among its rivals are some of the most popular vehicles sold today. With the Ascent, Subaru now competes for family buyers with the Toyota Highlander, Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot, and Dodge Durango.</p>, <p>The Ascent is offered in base, Premium, Limited, and Touring trim levels.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/subaru_ascent_2019">2019 Subaru Ascent review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>The Subaru Ascent is powered by a new 2.4-liter, turbocharged flat-4 that makes 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque and is rated to tow up to 5,000 pounds in certain configurations. It's teamed exclusively to a continuously variable transmission and all-wheel drive, a Subaru hallmark. The Ascent boasts 8.7 inches of ground clearance—the same as the famously rugged Outback—and rides atop Subaru's new global platform that will eventually underpin most of its cars and crossovers.</p>, <p>In the Ascent, the new platform's wheelbase is stretched to its limit. With 113.8 inches from wheel to wheel, the Ascent slots in a third row that should appeal to families who may feel that they've outgrown an Outback. The third row isn't as spacious as some of its competitors—Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave—but it should comfortably fit children and small adults.</p>, <p>Despite being the largest vehicle Subaru has offered, the Ascent is instantly recognizable as part of the family. It borrows much of its styling from the Outback—especially along the sides—but it's nose is distinctly unique. The Ascent boasts a larger trapezoidal grille and pronounced shoulders that add to the vehicle's visual mass.</p>, <p>In addition to confines for up to eight passengers (the second-row bench can be swapped for captain's chairs in top trims at no cost), the Ascent boasts Subaru's suite of advanced safety tech that's near commonplace for three-row crossovers. The EyeSight system bundles forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control on all trim levels. Blind-spot monitors and a camera-based rearview mirror are optional.</p>, <p>The Ascent boasts several family-friendly features to entice buyers. Up to eight USB ports are available within the Ascent's cabin, and many, many, many cupholders are scattered throughout. The rear doors swing wide for easier access to the third row seating, and a touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility is standard.</p>]

[<p>The Subaru Impreza is a compact sedan or hatchback with standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>While it doesn't sell in the volumes of its rivals, it has steadily gained popularity over recent years as Subaru has fitted it with the most popular features among budget-minded compact buyers.</p>, <p>With the Impreza, Subaru has a rival for popular models such as the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Ford Focus, and Toyota Corolla. The Impreza is alone in offering standard all-wheel drive and that helps it appeal to different buyers than those best-sellers.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/subaru_impreza-sedan_2018">2018 Subaru Impreza review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Subaru Impreza</strong></p>, <p>The current Subaru Impreza was completely redesigned and production of the compact car was finally moved to the U.S.</p>, <p>The car sports the underpinnings from Subaru's new global architecture that'll eventually become the skeleton for the entire Subaru range—short of the BRZ. It's the same basic formula that has endured since the beginning: small flat-4 that makes 152 horsepower under the hood, all-wheel drive, sedan or hatch, continuously variable transmission (CVT) or 6-speed manual. Subaru updated the range to include a more-distinct Impreza Sport model, which features active torque vectoring.</p>, <p>The rest of the lineup ranges from base to premium for a small compact. Although it doesn't have the space that others in its class does, the Impreza's superlative safety rating and cold-weather capabilities should be enough to be competitive.</p>, <p>Subaru updated its infotainment system in the new Impreza, offering an 8.0-inch touchscreen in top trims.</p>, <p><strong>Subaru Impreza history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The Impreza name itself, which succeeded the DL/GL/Loyale line, is now over 20 years old. The first-generation Impreza, which bowed in 1993, was conventionally styled, and meant to compete head-to-head with the high-volume compacts. The base engine was a modest 110-horsepower, 1.8-liter flat-4, with an optional 135-hp, 2.2-liter engine. In 1995, a two-door coupe model was added to the four-door sedan and five-door wagon lineup, as well as a new Outback Sport model.</p>, <p>Subaru first started teasing its success in international rally with the sporty new 2.5 RS coupe, introduced for 1997, and the 2.5 RS sedan, which followed in 2000. With the stronger 165-hp engine, larger wheels, and a sport suspension, along with a big hood scoop and other cosmetic upgrades, the RS models found a strong following from small-car enthusiasts in winter-weather states.  </p>, <p>The year of most dramatic change for the Impreza was 2002. That's the model year when Subaru brought the turbocharged Impreza WRX and STI model to the lineup, but it's also when the automaker rolled out a thoroughly redesigned Impreza. At first Subaru introduced just a few models: the 2.5 RS sedan and comparable 2.5 TS wagon, and the Outback Sport wagon.</p>, <p>Throughout that generation of Imprezas, the car was known for sturdy construction, all-weather capability, and a responsive driving character unlike that of most other small cars. The 4-cylinder engine is torquey and responsive, and steering and handling is excellent, with the engine's low center of mass combined with all-wheel drive providing impressive stability and poise. Downsides, however, include a cramped rear seat and high levels of engine and road noise compared to most other small cars.</p>, <p>For 2008, the Subaru Impreza family was completely redesigned, with a significantly larger sedan model and new five-door hatchback replacing the former wagon. With an evolution of the base 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter flat-4 and Subaru's all-wheel drive systems along with 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmissions, the Impreza's powertrains were proven.</p>, <p>The 2008-2011 Impreza boasted better standards of refinement, more interior space (its back seat was truly usable by adults for the first time), and doors with window frames reduced noise. Through 2011, fuel economy from Subaru's flat-4 engines remained unimpressive, with base versions of the Impreza returning just 20 mpg city. That changed with the all-new engine in the 2012 models.</p>, <p>After a short, 4-year run for its predecessor (2008-2011), the Impreza was entirely redesigned for the 2012 model year. The goal was to create a sleeker look with an all-new exterior style, and to stretch it over a slightly longer wheelbase. This allowed for a reconfigured interior with increased rear-seat space and more cargo room.</p>, <p>The engine was all-new at the time, a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter flat-4 engine that initially delivered EPA highway ratings as high as 36 mpg when combined with Subaru's CVT. The manual gearbox models, while rated better than before, are not quite as economical, largely due to gearing. Subaru also put a lot of effort into refining the interior and upgrading its materials—although wind and road noise initially remained issues.</p>, <p>The Impreza's more rugged nature and excellent reputation for durability appeal to diverse buyers, but the ruboff from the WRX models sets it against sportier compacts as well, including the Volkswagen Golf and Jetta lines, and the Mazda 3. The WRX and its even higher-performance variant, the WRX STI, compete with yet another entry, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo—the only one to match the Impreza's all-wheel-drive, rally-bred heritage.</p>, <p>The related <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/subaru_xv-crosstrek" title="Subaru XV Crosstrek">XV Crosstrek</a> and XV Crosstrek Hybrid models were launched in 2013 and 2014 respectively. They're effectively Impreza five-doors with taller ride height, beefier wheels and tires, and a handful of hardware upgrades. They promise greater capability on muddy mountain trails, rough gravel roads, and the like—though we find those abilities come at the expense of handling and interior sound levels.</p>, <p>Subaru gave the Impreza a host of updates for the 2015 model year. This mid-cycle refresh included new headlights and some other small tweaks that together bring the look more in line with the larger Legacy sedan and Outback wagon. Subaru's camera-based, EyeSight system was made available, and changes were made to better insulate the cabin from road noise. Small powertrain changes also resulted in improved fuel economy.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/subaru_legacy
[<p>The Subaru Legacy is a mid-size, four-door sedan. Over six generations, it's established a following as a reliable entry in a crowded segment filled with best-selling nameplates. The Legacy ultimately is more popular when it's given a wagon body and more ride height when it becomes the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/subaru_outback">Subaru Outback</a>.</p>, <p>Although available as a wagon in the past, the Legacy is strictly a sedan now. It offers a 4- or 6-cylinder engine. In its latest iteration, the Legacy is both more fuel-efficient and refined than its forebears and builds on the solid reputation with standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Subaru Legacy is increasingly seen as a strong competitor to better-known and more mainstream models—the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Nissan Altima—especially in snowier climates where its all-wheel drive gives it excellent ability to cope with extreme weather.</p>, <p>For 2018, Subaru slightly revised the interior and exterior. A new grille, headlights, and stitched dashboard were added; a new infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto made its debut.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114931_2018-subaru-legacy">2018 Subaru Legacy review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Subaru Legacy</strong></p>, <p>The latest Legacy sedan makes a serious effort to establish itself in the family-sedan mainstream—and it succeeds. It's more conventionally handsome than a Toyota Camry, and more spacious than a Chevy Malibu or a Chrysler 200; in fact, the Legacy now is more spacious than the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, and Ford Fusion. Add good gas mileage and a recent run of great crash-test scores, and the Legacy now throws a few elbows of its own in the mid-size segment.</p>, <p>Two powertrains are available. Legacy 2.5i sedans get a 175-horsepower, 2.5-liter flat-4 with acceptable power and fuel economy of up to 30 mpg combined. Legacy 3.6R sedans come with a 256-hp, 3.6-liter flat-6 engine, which doesn't feel quite as strong as it might suggest.</p>, <p>Helping it appeal to families, the latest Legacy offers more room than its predecessor. Like some other cars in the mid-size class, the interior volume is just under the limit for categorization as a "Large Car" by the EPA. The trunk is similarly roomy.</p>, <p>The latest Legacy is rated by federal officials at five stars overall and in every crash-test category, a perfect score from the government. It also receives top "Good" results in every category from the IIHS, earning it a Top Safety Pick+ award. The Legacy offers an automatic emergency braking system dubbed EyeSight, which uses cameras to help safety systems intercede before accidents happen and also provides adaptive cruise control functionality.</p>, <p>The new Legacy marks the debut of a new Subaru infotainment system with a 6.2-inch touchscreen, one that's controlled via big tiles and icons, with swipe and tap gesture control. The Legacy also comes with standard Bluetooth and USB connectivity.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the Legacy received a tuned steering and suspension feel, and a lane-keeping system is added to the excellent optional safety equipment. Only a year later, for 2017, the automaker added rear automatic emergency braking and a Sport trim that added bigger wheels, two-tone cloth with accent stitching, and exterior chrome accents.</p>, <p>All Legacy and Outback models sold in the U.S. are built in Lafayette, Indiana.</p>, <p><strong>Subaru Legacy history</strong></p>, <p>Going back a few generations, the 1995 model was a refresh of the original 1989; the Legacy generations introduced in 2000 and 2005 rode on a newer platform.</p>, <p>Initially, the Legacy was powered by a 2.2-liter flat-4 engine. For 2000, the engine grew in size to 2.5 liters. Over the years, Subaru has offered turbocharged versions of its flat-4 engine in Legacy sedans and wagons, including the sporty Legacy GT model. For 2008, a 3.0-liter flat-6 finally migrated from the Outback wagon and into the Legacy sedan. That engine also grew eventually, with a 3.6-liter version coming online for 2010.</p>, <p>Legacy GT models—including rare Legacy GT wagons through 2009—used an intercooled and turbocharged performance version of the flat-4 engine. In 2008, a limited-edition "Spec B" model was offered. It was the first Subaru to offer SI-Drive, which allows the driver to select among three software profiles for throttle response and shift points: Normal, Sport, and Sport Sharp. The system would later be found on the STI.</p>, <p>The fifth-generation Legacy sedan launched in 2010 with the carryover 2.5-liter engine from previous sedans. Also in 2010, the wagon was finally dropped from the Legacy line. Since then, all sedans on the platform have worn Legacy badges, while all wagons carry the renowned Outback nameplate.</p>, <p>For 2013, Subaru installed an all-new 2.5-liter flat-4, which produced 173 hp across a broader, flatter torque curve and offered better fuel efficiency. With the company's own continuously variable transmission, it was rated at 27 mpg combined—quite respectable for a car that came with standard all-wheel drive, Subaru's hallmark since 1997. If you ordered the 6-speed manual transmission (a rarity itself among mid-size sedans), the combined rating fell to 24 mpg. High-end Legacy models continued unchanged with the 3.6-liter engine, delivering an unimpressive 20 mpg combined.</p>]

[<p>The Subaru BRZ is a small, nimble two-door sports car.</p>, <p>The BRZ is a competitor for the Nissan 370Z and the Mazda MX-5 Miata, but even Porsche's Cayman follows the same lightweight, razor-sharp formula. It is one of the best economical sports cars on the market, and it's the only Subaru to be sold in the U.S. without all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The Subaru BRZ is mechanically identical to the Toyota 86 (nee Scion FR-S). In 2018, Subaru slightly differentiated the two cars with a BRZ tS variant tuned by its in-house performance division, STI. Although Subaru stops short of calling it a "BRZ STI," the new version is focused on track performance, with some compromises in road comfort.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114337_2018-subaru-brz">2018 Subaru BRZ review<br/></a></em></strong></p>, <p>Without question, the Subaru BRZ has proved to be a fun and capable car, even <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1076781_lapping-the-isle-of-man-tt-course-in-the-2013-subaru-brz">on the world's toughest circuits</a>, earning itself a spot on the <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080941_2013-subaru-brz-best-car-to-buy-2013-nominee">2013 Best Car To Buy nominee list</a> from our colleagues at <em>Motor Authority</em>.</p>, <p>The BRZ was introduced for 2013 and originally sold in two different models, both of which remain available. Both the Limited and Premium trim levels offer a choice of a 6-speed manual transmission or an automatic with the same gear count. Power comes from a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-4 that benefits from a combination of direct and port fuel injection. The manual offers good weighting, while the auto gearbox features steering-wheel paddles and can rev-match downshifts by blipping the throttle. The engine is set very low in the chassis, especially when compared to Subaru's other offerings, which have to clear front-mounted all-wheel-drive gear.</p>, <p>While the BRZ was intended to be as light as possible, it also has what Subaru says is one of the lowest centers of gravity of any current production model. The engineers targeted the Porsche Boxster for that measurement as well as the overall handling. With its sport-oriented suspension tuning, quick steering, summer-performance tires, and Torsen limited-slip differential, it manages to deliver on its focused promises.</p>, <p>At just 50.6 inches high and about 166 inches long, the Subaru BRZ is a compact model—a point enforced by its short overhangs and flared fenders. The BRZ's 2+2 seating, with the tight cabin offering very tight rear perches, is barely usable for adults, if at all. Its trunk is quite spacious however, and the rear seat back folds forward.</p>, <p>The BRZ has earned some of the best safety ratings among sports cars, with "Good" ratings in most test categories from the IIHS, except the difficult small overlap front crash, where it earned an "Acceptable" rating. It includes a four-channel ABS system, brake assist, and a five-mode driver-selectable stability control system. Side-curtain airbags and front pelvis and torso bags are also included. The structure itself builds on the automaker's Ring-Shaped Reinforcement Frame system that has established a strong reputation for safety in its other models.</p>, <p>Premium models include voice-activated navigation, satellite radio and HD radio tuners, Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity, HID headlights, and a Torsen limited-slip differential. The Limited models get leather-and-faux suede upholstery and heated seats plus dual-zone climate control, keyless ignition, fog lamps, and a rear spoiler. There are no option packages for either model, though standalone choices include dealer-installed accessories such as additional trim or an auto-dimming mirror with garage-door opener.</p>, <p>The BRZ has been essentially unchanged since it was launched and no turbocharged STI edition has materialized—much to the agony of enthusiasts. There have also been rumors of a BRZ-based sedan or convertible that could come from either Subaru or its Toyota/Scion partners, but it seems the reality is that these models sells in such small volumes that extra variants may not be worth the added cost.</p>, <p>All 2015 BRZs received wider exhaust outlets and a new shark-fin antenna design. Subaru also offered a limited-edition Series.Blue package for the 2015 model. It brought together an STI aero package, black-painted STI wheels, special World Rally blue paint (white is also available), and some unique interior finishes with a healthy smattering of blue trim, but no extra power or performance changes.</p>, <p>The BRZ added a new infotainment system and a standard rearview camera for 2016. The BRZ added a Performance Package on manual-equipped, Limited-trim cars for 2017, including a revamped suspension tune, new wheels, and other updates. All manual-equipped cars received a slight power bump, to 205 hp, while automatic BRZs were unchanged in output. A slight styling revamp accompanied those changes, with a slightly lower front end and a new spoiler among the changes.</p>, <p>For the 2017 model year, the BRZ's twin is getting a name change. The Scion FR-S became the Toyota 86, as Toyota shut down its Scion brand.</p>]

[<p>The Tesla Model 3 is a mid-size sedan from the all-electric automaker and its fourth vehicle following the Model S and Model X and a limited-production Roadster that launched the company.</p>, <p>The Model 3 went on sale in July 2017 to a handful of buyers—brand devotees and employees only—and Tesla admitted that delays in production had hampered its initial release. More cars have been made available, although quality concerns have surfaced with the early cars.</p>, <p>With the Model 3, Tesla has a relatively affordable electric sedan to compete against the Chevrolet Bolt EV, Nissan Leaf, and BMW i3. The high-end Model 3 has longer range than those competitors (310 miles), but a slow rollout made spotting the small Tesla sedan nearly impossible in its initial months on sale. A base version of the sedan with 220 miles of range will be priced from $35,000, before applicable federal and state incentives for electric vehicles.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/tesla_model-3_2018" title="2018 Tesla Model 3 - review">2018 Tesla Model 3 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>All early Model 3s are the high-end version, which tops $50,000 with a full suite of options. Tesla said that an all-wheel-drive version of the Model 3 and a shorter-range version (220 miles) will become available later in 2018.</p>, <p>All Model 3s are assembled at the automaker's assembly plant in Fremont, California. Its batteries are manufactured at Tesla's Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada.</p>, <p>The small sedan largely follows the design direction that the Model S set before it. The Model 3 features the updated nose from its larger brother, and the automaker's flush-mounted door handles, but at nearly a foot shorter than the Model S, the Model 3 lacks the longer overhangs from the Model S.</p>, <p>Inside, the Model 3 eschews conventional gauges and dials for a 15.0-inch digital display placed in the center of the sedan to handle all tasks, including driver information. The Model 3 seats up to five adults and offers 15 cubic feet in the trunk for cargo.</p>, <p>According to Tesla, the Model 3 accelerates up to 60 mph in 5.1 or 5.6 seconds and skips the "Ludicrous" speed offered on the bigger Model S for now. It's likely that subsequent generations of the Model 3 offer increasing acceleration, bigger batteries, or all of the above.</p>, <p>Unlike the Model S, the Model 3 won't offer owners the chance to charge for free at Tesla's "Superchargers" scattered across the U.S. Instead, Model 3 owners will have to pay for charging at those stations. Tesla has said that charging the batteries up to 80 percent may take 40-50 minutes. On a 240-volt home charger, Tesla says that the Model 3 will charge at 30 miles per hour of charging.</p>, <p>Tesla offers a handful of options on the Model 3, including up to SAE Level 4 self-driving software (the hardware is installed on every car, regardless if it's selected), power-adjustable heated front seats, panoramic moonroof, and wood trim.</p>, <p>The Model 3 is built on a separate platform from the Model S and Model X, one that is expected to spawn a Model Y crossover utility vehicle.</p>]

[<p>The Tesla Model S electric car has already become a part of automotive history. While it wasn't the first battery-electric car to go on sale, it's one of the most recognizable, and has been since volume production began in mid-2012. Its upgrades and new features don't correspond to model years, however; Tesla simply unveils them in production when they're ready to launch. That means there can be significant differences within a single model year of Model S.</p>, <p>Still, the big Tesla sedan has been a transformative vehicle in the global auto industry—as a start-up brand, as an object of desire by car enthusiasts, and as a wedge to popularize electric vehicles in a way vehicles like the Nissan Leaf have been unable to effect. As of late 2017, Tesla has sold more than 150,000 of them in North America, Europe, and China, far outstripping other auto startups like DeLorean and Tucker.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our review of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/tesla_model-s_2018" title="2018 Tesla Model S - Review">2018 Tesla Model S</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Model S is not just a good-looking, long-range, all-electric car. It's a competitive luxury sport sedan that was designed, engineered, tested, and built by a carmaker that's been in business only 10 years—a fleeting heartbeat in the 140-year-old industry. Beyond that, the lightning-quick Model S has received a near-relentless level of attention from an enthralled public and fostered a new breed of premium EV enthusiasts.</p>, <p>With regular "over-the-air" updates to improve the car's control software, and occasional updates and lineup changes whenever they're ready, Tesla Motors plays by different rules than other carmakers. So far, it seems to be working. The Tesla Model S offers more range than every other plug-in car: from 259 to 335 miles for the all-wheel-drive versions with 75- and 100-kilowatt-hour battery packs, respectively, at the start of 2018. As always, effective real-world range—on a Tesla or any other plug-in electric car—will vary greatly, depending on driving speed, style, accessory use, and outside temperature.</p>, <p>The large, sleek Model S is actually a five-door hatchback that seats five adults and has the option for rear-facing jump seats that can fit two children in what would normally be the car's cargo area. The S has roughly the same form as the Audi A7, though its rounded lines resemble a Jaguar XJ more than the crisp, linear Audi. The in-floor battery pack, electric motor, and power electronics were all developed by Tesla Motors itself, and, unlike the Roadster, the all-aluminum Model S is not based on the underpinnings of any other vehicle. Tesla launched a Model X crossover utility vehicle on the same platform, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/tesla_model-x">which we cover separately</a>.</p>, <p>Because the battery pack is contained entirely within a floorpan that is just a few inches tall, the designers had unusual freedom to allocate space inside the car. Inside, the most striking feature of the electric Model S is its 17-inch color display—the largest ever fitted to an automobile—in the center stack, which shows output from apps specifically written for it. The sheer size of the display allows large, easily visible type sizes, and it also offers direct Internet connectivity via the car's built-in cellular modem.</p>, <p>The Model S has surprising on-road performance. It offers smooth, quiet, and remarkably quick acceleration, with a slight high-pitched whine from the electronics only under maximum power. With the weight of the battery mounted in the floorpan, as low as it can go, the Model S corners flat and predictably. Though heavy, the Model S has one of the lowest center-of-gravity measurements in the industry.</p>, <p>The first Model S sedans built offered relatively few of the electronic systems and gadgetry found in large German luxury sedans. Tesla spent the bulk of its development effort on the battery management system — as well as designing the complete car. So early examples did not offer adaptive cruise control, for instance, nor collision avoidance, lane-departure warning or correction, automatic parking, or any of the other complex electronic systems offered as pricey options among its competitors. That changed with a late-2014 update, however.</p>, <p>One important option for buyers is the choice of multiple battery-pack capacities, which have included sizes of 60, 70, 75, 85, 90, and 100 kwh at various points. As of January 2018, only three basic versions of the Model S are offered, all with all-wheel drive. The 75D and 100D have the smaller and larger battery packs, and the P100D adds a much more powerful rear electric motor to produce a hot rod with acceleration that stuns even performance-car fanatics.</p>, <p>Competitors for the Model S include both mid-size and large sport sedans from German makers as well as various other plug-in electric cars like the Chevrolet Bolt EV, Nissan Leaf, and BMW i3. The German sedans would include the Audi A6, A7, and A8; the BMW 5-Series and 7-Series; and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, S-Class, and much sleeker CLS. But direct competition won't arrive until the 2019 model year or later, when high-end German makers launch fast, luxurious, all-electric sedans (and crossover utility vehicles) with sleek looks and 200 to 300 miles of range. For the record, that will be more than six years after the first Tesla Model S was delivered to its buyer in June 2012.</p>, <p>Tesla has chosen not to use the industry-standard J-1772 charging socket used in every other plug-in car. Instead, it fits a single plug of its own design that will handle the car's built-in 10-kilowatt charging—some models come with a pair of 10-kw chargers, for a total of 20 kw—as well as fast charging delivered by the quickly-growing network of Tesla-only "Supercharger" stations located along major travel routes. The lowest-range Model S cannot be equipped with the second 10-kw charger, but the company provides a J-1772 adapter cord for all models so Model S owners can recharge at conventional public or private charging stations.</p>, <p>That means the Model S offers not only the smooth, quiet power of electric drive but the simplicity and zero-emissions status of a battery electric car. For the P100D hot rod with the largest battery pack, Tesla quotes acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in less than three seconds, and a top speed of 150 mph.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/tesla_model-x
[<p>The Tesla Model X is the California-based automaker's long-awaited follow-up to the Model S sedan. More of a crossover than an SUV, the Model X is an egg-shaped wagon with a tall roof, top-hinged rear doors, and none of the off-road capability that would let buyers see it as an SUV.</p>, <p>It's also the only pure electric car in that class, at least until offerings from Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche hit the streets in 2019 and later.</p>, <p>In late 2016 it was offered with 75-, 90-, and 100-kwh hour battery packs that increased its range up to 289 miles. For 2018, it was simplified to three models: 75D, 100D, and the hot-rod, high-performance P100D, all of them fitted with all-wheel drive as standard, with EPA-rated ranges from 238 to 295 miles.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/tesla_model-x_2018" title="2018 Tesla Model X - review">2018 Tesla Model X review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The all-electric utility vehicle doesn’t stand out in profile quite the way it did when the form was essentially locked in, back in 2012. Its front-end design uses a flat panel rather than a simulated grille, and its tall proportions don’t have the inherent voluptuousness of the Model S. But watch from the front or rear as the owner opens the rear passenger doors, and you’ll see why the Model X is guaranteed to turn heads in the parking lot: its gullwing-style "falcon" doors arch outward and upward, to allow a surprisingly open area through which to access the back seats.</p>, <p>Tesla insists that the doors are actually practical. A double-jointed mechanism requires only about a foot on either side of the vehicle to open the doors, and they’re actually easier in tight parking spots than sliding minivan doors. More to the point, sensors prevent the doors from hitting low garage ceilings and recalculate their opening arc depending on constraints. They prevent roof racks and any kind of cargo mounted above the roof, but Tesla offers a special bike and gear rack that attaches to the trailer hitch. Towing capacity is rated at 5,000 pounds, though both towing and running at high speeds will eat quickly into range.</p>, <p>From inside, the Model X feels and drives like a Model S with a higher seating position. It's more open and airy, due to a steeply sloped panoramic windshield that's one of the largest in any production vehicle, extending up over the front-seat area. While the third-row seats fold flat when not in use, the second row only slides forward to rest against the backs of the front seats. They do give better adult-size contouring than most utility-vehicle seats. Six- and seven-passenger layouts are available, with the former eliminating the middle second-row seat, giving more pass-through space and better rearward vision.</p>, <p>From either a practical or performance angle, the Model X is impressive. All-wheel drive is standard, and it can reach 60 mph in as little as 2.9 seconds, when the high-performance P100D model is optioned with the appropriately named Ludicrous Mode. Three battery capacities have been offered, 75, 90 and 100 kilowatt-hours, with the 90-kwh option withdrawn during 2017. The performance option is offered only with the largest battery. Supercharger fast-charging capability provides up to 80 percent of total charge in 30 to 40 minutes. All models have separate electric motors for the front and rear wheels.</p>, <p>As in the Model S sedan, the Model X has its battery mounted low and flush with the floor, keeping its center of mass extremely low. That give its stability and general handling prowess that’s superior to just about any other SUV. There’s a multi-mode air suspension, and ground clearance is higher for the Model X, which should make it a better pick for those in climates with occasionally deep snowfall.</p>, <p>While the IIHS has not issued safety ratings for the Model X, the NHTSA gives it uniform five-star ratings both overall and for every individual test. An optional HEPA filter includes activated carbon filtration, removing pollen, bacteria, viruses, and pollution in general from the air. Collision avoidance systems in the Model X use a multitude of sensors, with camera, radar, and sonar hardware all providing input to automatic crash braking, blind-spot alert, and lane-departure warning systems.</p>, <p>As in the Model S, the Model X has a 17-inch vertically oriented touchscreen setup at the center of the dash. It’s one of the best such systems in the business—relatively lag-free and updated with over-the-air updates. Key vehicle features can also be updated over the air, without a trip to a service bay, and new features can actually be introduced this way.</p>, <p>The Tesla Model X went on sale in late September 2015, though some owners of early production models noted quality issues over misaligned and balky doors. Production increased during the first part of 2016. Model X variants sell for about $5,000 more than an equivalent Model S. Price start at about $80,000 and can exceed $150,000 for the most heavily optioned P100D variants.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_camry
[<p>The mid-size Toyota Camry four-door sedan has become known for reliability, a comfortable ride, a roomy interior, and decent gas mileage. The available Camry Hybrid model holds all of those attributes while boosting fuel economy. With characteristics like that, the Camry has become a legend with U.S. car buyers.</p>, <p>With the Camry, Toyota has inspired lots of automakers to build better sedans in the segment. The set of rivals for the Camry is vast, and includes excellent cars such as the Honda Accord, Ford Fusion, Subaru Legacy, and Nissan Altima, as well as the Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, Mazda 6, and Chevy Malibu. There's not a bad choice in that group. </p>, <p>For 2018, the Toyota Camry is new with a revised engine lineup and a new body. It's sold in SE, LE, XSE, or XLE trims, with the Hybrid version now offered in LE, SE, and XSE versions.</p>, <p><strong><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_camry_2018" target="_blank" title="2018 Toyota Camry - full review">2018 Toyota Camry review</a></em></strong></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Camry</strong></p>, <p>The eighth-generation Toyota Camry was unveiled in 2017 went on sale as a 2018 model. The new Camry's look is its boldest yet, with its previous slab-sided mid-sized appliance vehicles fading from view. The 2018 Toyota Camry is lower and wider than the model it replaces, and riders sit an inch or more lower front and rear. The lines are crisp, not overly stylized (as in some other recent Toyotas) and overall we think the car looks stylish without being strange. Perhaps the front end is a mite exaggerated, but the shape of the slightly longer and wider Camry is a big win.</p>, <p>For 2018, Toyota has split its Camry into two more distinct flavors: LE and XLE models are a little more conservative, while SE and XSE variants feature sportier accoutrements, reaching their zenith with the XSE's optional bold black roof and unique two-tone rear roof pillar design. The SE and XSE also have their own suspension and steering settings in an effort to appeal to consumers looking for a sports sedan, but this is no Mazda or BMW. The entire range handles more crisply and confidently, a direct result of Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda's engineering prowess and enthusiasm for racing, but while the Camry is now enjoyable to drive—as opposed to tapioca on the road—it won't be mistaken for any kind of rival to the more dynamic Accord or the Mazda 6 sport sedan.</p>, <p>Under the hood, the Camry sticks with a classic choice: the high-volume inline-4 or pricier and more powerful V-6 engines. Other competitors have moved to a lineup of solely turbo-4s to meet fuel economy standards, but not Toyota. Both engines are paired to an 8-speed automatic. No manual transmission is available, but that's hardly a surprise.</p>, <p>The new Camry benefits from Toyota's switch to a uniform, global architecture underneath, including a much more sophisticated rear suspension setup that really does translate to improved roadholding and ride quality.</p>, <p>Inside, the Camry's dash features a striking zig-zag line from its instrument panel into its center console. There's a little more room for five, though we questioned the ease of access through a tight rear-door opening, and it's available in everything from sedate gray to a shockingly bright red with red-trimmed upholstery.</p>, <p>The Camry also receives Toyota's latest complement of advanced safety features including forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and blind-spot monitors.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Camry history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>The Toyota Camry was introduced to the U.S. market as a front-wheel-drive replacement for the rear-drive Corona. Quite boxy and basic, that first Camry won over masses of U.S. buyers who were reaching a critical point of frustration over the reliability and quality of domestic-brand cars.</p>, <p>Subsequent Camry models became a little larger, more refined, and more comfortable and luxurious with each generation. When the second-generation Camry made its debut for 1987, the Camry's 115-hp, 2.0-liter inline-4 was quite technically advanced, as it was one of the first engines in an affordable four-door sedan with four valves per cylinder. Wagon variants of the Camry were reasonably popular through this period, and a five-door hatchback version of the model was sold through 1986.</p>, <p>Toward the late ’80s, Toyota added a V-6 option for the first time, and it also began offering all-wheel drive on some versions, which signaled the automaker's intention to move the Camry upmarket.</p>, <p>For 1991, Toyota broke the U.S. Camry line away from the version made for its home market, recognizing that American families wanted a larger product. The Camry was aimed solidly at the shoppers who were considering the Ford Taurus. Toyota had, in 1988, begun assembling Camrys for the U.S. in Georgetown, Kentucky, where the car is still produced today—and if there's any doubt about how American it is, don't forget that <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1076416_2013-toyota-camry-nascar-sprint-cup-race-car-debuts">it races in NASCAR</a>.</p>, <p>Two different U.S. Camry generations spanned the 1990s. The first (distinguished by rounded sheet metal and soft features) offered a tremendous leap in luxury over the previous model. The latter, fourth-generation Camry was panned at launch for its especially bland styling, but it was an even stronger seller. The wagon was  discontinued in that generation. Through these two generations the Camry didn't make any tremendous advances, but its 4-cylinder and V-6 engines grew in size and produced more power.</p>, <p><a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/inventory?make=toyota">Used Toyota Camry</a> models are a staple of the used car market, though you'll likely find fewer from before 2000 these days. They continue to be comfortable and spacious sedans, though they're far from sporty. Toyota has continuously updated the safety equipment and added popular features to keep the Camry competitive, including navigation systems, smart-key entry, and heated leather seats—all items hard to find on mid-size volume sedans not so many years ago.</p>, <p>Two generations of the Camry have emerged in the last decade. The previous generation, introduced for 2002, introduced a rounder look once again—this time making major advances inside with significantly upgraded materials—with a stronger 162-hp, 2.4-liter base inline-4. A 192-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 remained a popular option, and safety features were bolstered during this generation with the phasing-in of side airbags and stability control on some models.</p>, <p>The Camry was redesigned again for 2007, bringing a smoother, less slab-sided look, much-improved safety, and a new powertrain at the top of the range—a 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and 6-speed automatic transmission. In this latest generation, a tighter suspension and upgraded wheels in the SE V-6 model brings a more sophisticated VDIM stability control system and a surprising level of responsiveness and performance satisfaction, if you could get past the bland appearance.</p>, <p>Along with the 2007 refresh, Toyota introduced its first first Camry Hybrid. It used a version of the company's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, which was originally designed for use in the Prius, pairing an Atkinson-cycle version of the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with electric motors. The total system output was 192 hp, matching the old 3.0-liter V-6, but beating it handily in EPA fuel-economy testing—the Camry Hybrid came out of the gate with ratings of 33 mpg in the city and 34 highway.</p>, <p>For 2010, the base Toyota Camry received an even larger inline-4—a 2.5-liter, making 169 or 179 hp, while fuel economy was actually made better thanks to a new 6-speed automatic. A 6-speed manual remained available on a limited basis with the 4-cylinder engine.</p>, <p>A 2012 redesign didn't recast the Camry, but instead brought substantial improvements to comfort, refinement, and handling. From the outside the changes were so evolutionary that some might only see it as a mild refresh. Gas mileage was also improved across the lineup (up to 25 mpg city, 35 highway for the 4-cylinder), and a completely reworked Camry Hybrid—with an EPA city rating of up to 43 mpg—was the star of the lineup. Safety features were also significantly upgraded, with 10 standard airbags, newly standard side rear thorax bags, and an improved structure, while Bluetooth hands-free connectivity was made standard on all models. </p>, <p>The 2013 Toyota Camry earned a few more trim and feature changes—like expanded availability for blind-spot monitoring, which was packaged with rear cross-traffic alert. Even base Camry L models for 2013 received an updated infotainment system, as they tightened their game against the all-new <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/honda_accord-sdn_2013">2013 Honda Accord</a>. The only blemish to the Camry's longstanding rivalry <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1074026_toyota-camry-vs-honda-accord-compare-cars">versus the Honda Accord</a>? In a round of crash-test results for the new IIHS <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081256_new-frontal-crash-tests-honda-accord-aces-toyota-camry-flubs">small-overlap frontal test</a>, Honda managed the top nod, while the Camry was rated "Poor." Those ratings inched up in subsequent updates.</p>, <p>For 2015, Toyota gave the Camry a full makeover. All of the body panels were replaced with reshaped parts, and the interior was upgraded with new technology and nicer materials. Toyota also modified the chassis to make the Camry more involving to drive, while the powertrains have been left alone.</p>, <p>The Camry offered a range of powertrain options, including the base model's 178-hp inline-4, the fuel-sipping Hybrid model, and the range-topping V-6 that made 268 hp. The Camry was offered only in a sedan body, as it has been for years, although past generations offered both coupe and convertible versions.</p>, <p>Improvements made to the Camry's design for 2015 made it an IIHS's Top Safety Pick+, with top "Good" ratings in all categories, including the new small-overlap crash test. Toyota also added active-safety items to the standard and optional features list for 2015. A suite of advanced safety features including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, and active lane control were all standard for 2017 .</p>]

[<p>The Toyota RAV4 is a compact crossover SUV that can seat up to five passengers. One of the most popular vehicles in the segment, it's a rival for vehicles such as the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Subaru Forester, and Mazda CX-5. </p>, <p>With the RAV4, Toyota has the right crossover for the right craze. Initially offered as a tall-riding, four-wheel-drive vehicle with more storage space, the RAV4 has evolved into a family-friendly shape with good fuel-efficiency. A redesign for 2019 gives the popular Toyota crossover new, buffer looks, a roomier interior, and the promise of better driving dynamics.</p>, <p>The RAV4 is sold in standard and hybrid models.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_rav4_2019">2019 Toyota RAV4 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota RAV4</strong></p>, <p>A redesigned RAV4 bowed at the 2018 New York auto show. Beneath its blockier, more SUV-like styling, the latest RAV4 is still a crossover aimed primarily at road, rather than dirt, use. Under its hood sits a 2.5-liter inline-4, while a hybrid version with a nickel-metal hydride battery tucked under its rear seat is available. The RAV4 Hybrid promises enhanced performance with better fuel economy, representing a major shift in the way Toyota offers its hybrids.</p>, <p>Gas models use a 6-speed automatic, while a CVT is standard fare on the hybrid. All-wheel drive is optional.</p>, <p>The RAV4's interior is far nicer than before, with soft-touch materials, convenient storage bins, and standard Apple CarPlay. On the safety front, the RAV4 includes automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and active lane control on every trim level.</p>, <p>Overall, the RAV4 is about the same size as its predecessor, but the automaker carved out a little more rear-seat legroom and headroom—even with the newly available panoramic moonroof option.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota RAV4 history</strong></p>, <p>The first generation of the RAV4 was introduced in 1996, borrowing a host of Corolla and Camry components. It came with a 120-hp, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with either a front- or all-wheel-drive configuration. In 1998, the RAV4 received slightly restyled front and rear fascias, and a soft-top two-door was made available in some markets.</p>, <p>The second generation of the RAV4 arrived in time for the 2001 model year and came packing a more potent, 148-hp, 2.0-liter engine. A facelift was implemented for the 2004 model year, consisting primarily of new bumper designs, while the 2.0-liter engine was replaced by a 161-hp, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine.</p>, <p>For the 2006 model year, the RAV4 received its first major overhaul, which included an all-new platform. Engine options expanded to a choice of a 4-cylinder or V-6 powertrain. During that generation, the RAV4 saw occasional styling updates, while a switch to a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine was the only major mechanical change from the previous generation. One notable functional option came by way of an available sport package, which swapped the side-hinged rear hatch door for a top-hinged unit without the rear-mounted spare tire. This would return later as standard equipment.</p>, <p>For this period, the Toyota RAV4 was offered with either the base 179-hp, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine or the top-spec 269-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. A manual transmission option was not offered on the RAV4, so instead the 4-cylinder model made do with a 4-speed automatic while the V-6 model was mated to a 5-speed auto. Fuel economy came in at 21 mpg city, 27 highway for the 4-cylinder model and 22 mpg city, 28 highway for the V-6.</p>, <p>The RAV4 was redesigned for 2012 and was roughly the same size as the previous model, but was thoroughly updated. For starters, Toyota dropped the third-row seat option from the lineup, leaving the three-row duties to the larger Highlander. While the wheelbase of the RAV4 stayed the same as the prior generation's, it lost about two inches of overall length. The interior volume slightly increased, and the rear seats fold down flat to expand cargo space. The rear opening became a top-hinged tailgate, and the spare tire, which used to be mounted outside the vehicle on a side-hinged rear tailgate, was tucked under the cargo floor. This improved both aerodynamics and styling.</p>, <p>The base drivetrain was 2.5-liter 4-cylinder with 179 horsepower teamed with a 6-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive was standard, and all-wheel drive with new electronic controls to improve handling was an option.</p>, <p>For 2016, Toyota added two models to the RAV4 range with the intention of better filling out the lineup. The RAV4 received its first hybrid variant, using a version of the powertrain offered in the Camry Hybrid as well as other Toyota and Lexus models, with fuel economy of up to 34/31/33 mpg. And at the fun end, the RAV4 received an sporty-looking and sport-tuned SE model. It looks a bit more aggressive than the rest of the models and offers improved handling, although no more power. All 2016 models received upgraded interiors, more sound deadening, new gauges, and an available surround-view camera system.</p>, <p>For 2017, a new range-topping Platinum model delivered the highest level of luxury yet in a RAV4—for a price, at least. But the biggest change is that all RAV4s came standard with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning as standard equipment. For 2018, a new Adventure trim level pairs a slightly higher ride height with a few cosmetic bits to take on buff rivals.</p>, <p>The RAV4 re-emerged as a safety star. In IIHS testing, the RAV4 earned "Good" scores across the board; with automatic emergency braking and optional LED headlights, earned a Top Safety Pick award. The RAV4 retained a five-star score from the NHTSA.</p>, <p>The Toyota RAV4 was joined by a distant cousin: the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/cars/lexus_nx">Lexus NX</a> was based on some of the same running gear, though with its own styling and features, as well a turbo-4 that wasn't offered on the RAV4.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_c-hr
[<p>The Toyota C-HR is a small crossover SUV with funky looks and a tall ride height, but no all-wheel drive. It's meant to compete against offerings from Honda and Subaru, which both offer available all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>The C-HR joins three other small hatchbacks in the Toyota lineup: the smaller Yaris, the fuel-efficient Prius C, and the compact Corolla iM that was also once a Scion.</p>, <p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_ch-r_2018" title="2018 Toyota C-HR - review">2018 Toyota C-HR review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The C-HR has an adventurous design, one that goes head-to-head with the conceptually similar Nissan Juke in its audacious looks. Its shape isn't one that is digested on one glance: its curves, crests, slits, and upkicks take a while to process. Animal-like jowls and cat-eye lamps flow into fenders that wrap themselves tightly around its wheel wells. The sills and side stampings impress a deep skeletal shape into the sideview. The roofline slopes and the rear pillar turns up—and they meet at the rear door handles, which work fine despite their unusual location. The taillights bracket a tall rear end, where the busy sheet metal in the three-quarter view doesn't quite hide its thickness and height, making its 18-inch wheels look small in their wheel wells.</p>, <p>The C-HR's cockpit may be a standout among its competitors, which Toyota says include the Juke, the Honda HR-V, and the Mazda CX-3. (We might also add the Jeep Renegade or the Kia Niro.) The center stack is particularly interesting; Toyota calls the surround that groups the touchscreen and other controls a MeZONE. Minus the cloying marketing-speak, it's an interesting approach that isolates secondary controls in one area.</p>, <p>The C-HR's crossover vibe stops with its tall ride height. The 2.0-liter inline-4 is just slow, even in the Sport driving mode that gives the continuously variable transmission seven simulated gear ratios and tightens the steering. The weight of 3,300 pounds is just too much for 144 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque to move expeditiously. Note that the C-HR sends its power to the front wheels only, with no all-wheel-drive option in the U.S., though it's offered in Europe and Japan.</p>, <p>As a member of the Toyota TNGA global-car family (think: Prius), the C-HR has markedly better handling than previous Toyota small cars. The front strut suspension gets Sachs dampers and a relatively thick stabilizer bar for responsive road manners. At the rear, the C-HR employs double wishbones and Sachs dampers. The combination delivers a smooth ride and good responsiveness in city driving, and holds the road confidently in higher-speed corners.</p>, <p>The C-HR would be the smallest Toyota crossover, but among its hatchbacks, it's not so petite. Interior space is augmented by well-bolstered sport seats in front, surrounded by lots of storage bins and cupholders. In back, riders sit high, and Toyota has scalloped out the backs of the front seats and trimmed the headliner back to create valuable head room, which is ample front and rear. For more flexibility, the rear seats flip and fold flat along a 60/40 split, giving a fully flat load floor, although the car's height means that cargo deck is at mid-thigh level.</p>, <p>All C-HR hatchbacks come with 10 airbags, a rearview camera, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. Blind-spot monitors are optional.</p>, <p>Two versions of the C-HR are available. The XLE gets power features, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control, touchscreen audio, and a rearview camera. The XLE Premium adds blind-spot monitors, a power driver seat, heated front seats, and keyless ignition. The audio system on both includes AM/FM/HD radio, a USB port, and Bluetooth with audio streaming and voice controls—but omits Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which will likely be missed by the target audience of young buyers.</p>]

Inside, Toyota managed to carve out more interior space and installed more features; one of our favorites was lost in the transition, however, as the hide-away center seat on the middle row was deleted in favor of a plain bench seat or two captain's chairs.</p>, <p>Safety is often a concern of families buying crossovers like the Highlander, and Toyota doesn't disappoint. Eight airbags are included on all models, as is a rearview camera. More advanced options include a lane-departure warning system, parking sensors, and blind-spot monitoring. For 2017, it also adds with pedestrian detection and a surround view camera system. The IIHS has named the Highlander a Top Safety Pick, while the NHTSA gave the model a five-star overall score, with four stars in frontal crash and rollover protection.</p>, <p>The Highlander carried over unchanged for the 2015 model year, and only received minor changes for 2016.</p>, <p>For 2017, it gets a somewhat more aggressive look, more power and improved fuel economy for the V-6, the aforementioned safety features, and a new sportier SE model. Toyota is also expanding the Hybrid lineup. The V-6 adds direct injection and stop/start, and it can now switch between the more powerful Otto and more efficient Atkinson cycles, improving both power and efficiency. The EPA fuel economy ratings increase from 19 mpg city, 25 highway with front-wheel drive to 21/27 mpg, while the all-wheel-drive version improves from 19/25 mpg to 20/27 mpg. The Hybrid also adds direct injection, and its fuel economy improves to 30/29 mpg.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Highlander history</strong></p>, <p>The Highlander first went on sale in the U.S. as a 2001 model. That original Highlander wore very plain styling inside and out. Though it was mostly a Camry underneath, the first Highlander bore more of a resemblance to the Subaru Forester, with its boxy, upright stance. The compact 2001-2007 Highlander had many advantages, including a usefully tall interior space and plenty of glass for great visibility. Relatively lightweight and equipped with a choice of either a 160-hp 4-cylinder engine or a 220-hp V-6, the 2001-2003 Highlander also came with a choice of a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic on 4-cylinder models; the V-6 version came only with the 4-speed automatic. All-wheel drive was a popular option in this generation.</p>, <p>The Highlander received a new 3.3-liter V-6 for the 2004 model year; the engine made 230 hp and was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Highlander's 4-cylinder engine carried over from before. An optional third-row seat also was made available in 2004, providing more seating options than in competitors like the Honda Pilot and Ford Edge. The 2004 model also received slight aesthetic tweaks. For 2006, the big news was the addition of a mild-hybrid version of the V-6 all-wheel-drive Highlander; the system and its batteries and motors were shared with the Lexus RX 400h, which was also introduced that year. Both models offered only small improvements in fuel economy over their standard V-6 counterparts.</p>, <p>A new Toyota Highlander arrived for the 2008 model year, with changes that can be considered somewhat of a mixed blessing. Fans of the pragmatic original found the new generation much larger, but also much softer in driving feel, though also more impressively finished inside. The 4-cylinder version made 187 hp and was paired with a 6-speed automatic, but it wasn't as refined as Toyota's small fours used to be. There was a big, automatic-only, 270-hp V-6 option, which was better suited to the hefty second-generation Highlander. Dynamically, neither version felt very connected or responsive—a problem aggravated by that generation's optional Hybrid powertrain and its feeling-free electric power steering.</p>, <p>Toyota had initially planned to shift assembly for this generation of Highlander from Japan to a new facility underway in Blue Springs, Mississippi. The recession and lagging car sales put that plan on hold; the plant was repurposed for Corolla assembly after some delayed and changed plans. For 2008, Toyota imported Japanese-built Highlanders; as of the 2010 model year, Toyota is now sourcing U.S. editions from its Indiana assembly plant.</p>, <p>Toyota extensively updated the Highlander for the 2011 model year with a standard third-row seat on non-Hybrid models, and a new front-end look that mimics the one on the Venza crossover. The <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1077009_2012-toyota-highlander-hybrid-quick-drive-highest-mpg-with-third-row">2011 Hybrid edition</a> saw its gas-engine displacement increased from 3.3 liters to 3.5 liters, improving fuel economy while netting 10 additional horsepower, for a total of 280 hp.</p>]

[<p>The Toyota Avalon is the Japanese carmaker's largest four-door sedan. It's longer, with more rear-seat room, than the Camry—though the two cars share an architecture and some running gear.</p>, <p>With the Avalon, Toyota has a flagship sedan to take on vehicles such as the Chevy Impala, Chrysler 300, Hyundai Azera, and Kia Cadenza.</p>, <p>Toyota introduced a new version of the Avalon at the 2018 North American International Auto Show. It will be sold as a 2019 model.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_avalon_2019">2019 Toyota Avalon review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Avalon</strong></p>, <p>A new Toyota Avalon made its debut in 2018 to go on sale for the 2019 model year. It takes some of its styling cues from the Camry and others in the Toyota lineup, but the new Avalon strikes out on its own with a more subdued approach.</p>, <p>The new Avalon is incrementally longer than the outgoing model and visually lower for a sleeker shape. The Avalon's wheelbase is two inches longer than the last-generation version, which opens up the interior space more. A 9.0-inch touchscreen is standard, top trim levels get premium audio and wireless cellphone charging.</p>, <p>Like the outgoing model, the Avalon is powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 or 2.5-liter inline-4 hybrid powertrains. An 8-speed transmission is standard on all versions, and shuttles power to the front wheels only. Top trims get an adaptive suspension to smother pockmarked roads.</p>, <p>The Avalon comes equipped with a long list of standard active safety features including forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, blind-spot monitors, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Avalon history</strong></p>, <p>The first Avalon arrived for 1995 and replaced Toyota's Cressida sedan. It was based on the Camry and was assembled at a Toyota plant in Kentucky. Although it shares a lot underneath with the brand's mainstream family sedan, the Avalon has always offered more in the way of luxury and space, with a lot of features trickling down from Lexus to the Toyota brand and arriving in the Avalon first.</p>, <p>Early versions of the Avalon received the same engine as the Camry and looked quite similar to the Camry—if you squinted. A redesigned version, introduced for 2000, changed that. The new version was genuinely roomier and featured options not offered on the Camry, including a navigation system and electronic stability control plus brake assist. At that time, the 3.0-liter V-6 made 210 hp. These Avalon models were extremely smooth and comfortable, but not particularly rewarding to drive.</p>, <p>The Avalon was completely redesigned for 2005, with a sleek, very aerodynamic new shape and new 280-hp (later 268 hp) 3.5-liter V-6. Toyota tried to satisfy those who wanted more performance, with a slightly sportier Touring model that included a firmer suspension calibration along with larger wheels and spruced-up trim. In these models, the V-6 and 5-speed automatic shifted almost imperceptibly, in Lexus-like fashion. Their ride was just as composed as in the previous generation, but handling was better—but nothing close to a truly sporty feel. A huge trunk and space to sprawl in the backseat were the Avalon's hallmarks, and layers of sound insulation and acoustic windshield kept it whisper-quiet inside.</p>, <p>Offered in a range of models from XL and XLS up to Touring and Limited models, this generation of Toyota Avalon offered more technological features than any Toyota model up until the 2010 Toyota Prius. Rain-sensing wipers, xenon HID headights, remote engine start, and the Dynamic Laser Cruise Control System were all available. Top-of-the-line Limited models received heated and ventilated seats, a smart-key system, power rear sunshade, and high-end JBL sound.</p>, <p>This generation of Avalon was recognized for its smooth ride and high build quality. Toward the end of its run, in 2012, it went in for a slight redesign. Changes included the addition of Bluetooth audio streaming as well as a reworked interior with more comfort for rear-seat passengers thanks in part to reclining seats.</p>, <p>For 2013, the Toyota Avalon was fully modernized, with a redesign and re-engineering that yielded a sheen of sophistication in everything from its control interface to the way it drives. The sleek, curvy new exterior and bolder interior design—with capacitive controls for climate and audio—are meant to appeal to a relatively younger crowd (of 40- to 60-year-olds) than any previous Avalon.</p>, <p>For 2014, all models received a rearview camera, while blind-spot monitors became<span> optional on the Avalon XLE Touring and Avalon Hybrid XLE Touring models.</span></p>, <p>Toyota updated the Avalon in 2016. Styling changes were subtle and include a lightly reworked front end with a widened lower grille, a tighter upper grille, and turn signals moved to the edges of the fascia in place of fog lights, as well as chrome trim for the rear and revised taillights. There are two suspension setups on the revised model: a more dynamic calibration for the V-6 Touring model and a comfort-oriented tune for the rest of the V-6 models and the hybrid versions. Standard equipment sees a boost in most models, and trim levels are being rearranged slightly, with the Hybrid no longer available in the Touring grade.</p>, <p>Slimmer and sleeker now than in the past, the third-generation Avalon was more interesting to drive. Standout advanced-tech features included rear cross traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and automatic braking, while the new Avalon gets Toyota's Entune system for running smartphone-based apps, as well as a magnificent 785-watt JBL sound system. The 2013 Toyota Avalon was also the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1081253_2013-toyota-avalon-first-to-offer-wireless-charging-for-phones">first car to offer wireless charging for mobile phones</a>.</p>, <p>The latest Avalon is available in a new Hybrid model for the first time, and based on early drives we found it the most compelling package. With a combined output of 200 hp (from a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system), the Avalon Hybrid accelerates quietly and confidently, while returning an EPA rating of 40 mpg city, 39 highway, 40 combined. We saw roughly <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1084010_2013-toyota-avalon-hybrid-gas-mileage-drive-report" title="2013 Toyota Avalon Hybrid: Gas Mileage Drive Report">40 mpg in a real-world test drive</a>.</p>, <p>The Avalon has an excellent reputation for safety reliability and has held its resale value well. But in recent years, the model's price has increased. A new Avalon Limited can reach beyond $40,000, well into luxury territory, where the related Lexus ES anchors that franchise.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_prius
[<p>The Toyota Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid version of the fourth-generation Toyota Prius, the world’s best known and most popular hybrid-electric car. It was launched for the 2017 model year and succeeds the discontinued Prius Plug-In Hybrid model, sold from 2012 through 2015, but it’s a different and much-improved vehicle in many ways.</p>, <p>The Prime is a derivative of the newest Prius, which arrived for the 2016 model year. With the Prius Prime, Toyota has attempted to tone down some of the shapes that may have been awkward on the Prius. While the Prime retains the basic shape of the conventional Prius, it has new front and rear styling that slightly moderate the design and, to many eyes, look better than its non-plug-in sibling. That includes more horizontal rear lights, a subtly twin-domed rear liftgate window, and a slightly more conventional front end with four small rectangular projector headlights on either side.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_prius-prime_2018" title="2017 Toyota Prius Prime: first drive of new plug-in hybrid">2018 Toyota Prius Prime review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Prius Prime is EPA-rated at 25 miles of electric range, and 54 mpg combined when operating as a conventional hybrid once its battery range is depleted. Moreover, its energy efficiency is rated at a remarkable 124 MPGe. (MPGe, or Miles Per Gallon Equivalent, is a measure of how far a car can travel electrically on the same amount of energy as is contained in 1 gallon of gasoline.)</p>, <p>Like the regular Prius, the Prime pairs a high-efficiency 1.8-liter inline-4 with a pair of electric motors to power the car. The combined powertrain output is rated at 121 horsepower, Toyota says, which means it's hardly a speed demon. But one key decision makes the Prime decisively different from the Prius: Its designers defaulted the car into electric-only mode if its battery has any charge remaining above that needed to operate as a conventional hybrid, which it does after the battery is depleted.</p>, <p>That turns the Prius Prime into an electric car over its first 20 or 25 miles, not the combined electric-and-gasoline vehicle that its predecessor was. That decision sets the Prime apart from all other plug-in hybrids except the Chevrolet Volt, which similarly runs solely in electric mode until its battery capacity is depleted. All other mass-priced plug-in hybrid competitors—including the Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata, and soon the Kia Optima—switch on their engines if the driver demands maximum power. Granted, they offer an EV-only mode, but Prius Prime drivers must take a specific action if they don’t want electric-only operation.</p>, <p>On the road, while the Prime isn’t as strong ­­in electric mode as the more powerful Volt, it keeps up with most traffic. On various test-drive loops, our test cars delivered at least 25 miles. In gentle use at lower speeds, they appeared to offer higher range yet, potentially as much as 30 miles.</p>, <p>That hardly compares to the current Volt’s 53 miles, but it’s a far cry from Prime’s predecessor. The 2012-2015 Prius Plug-In Hybrid’s 11-mile electric range was so low, and its 60-kw (80-hp) electric motor so weak, that it even heavy breathing could kick on the engine, or so it felt to hapless drivers attempting to stay in electric mode.</p>, <p>Once the gasoline engine kicks on, the Prius Prime essentially turns into a heavier version of its hybrid sibling. That is, its engine and electric motors combine seamlessly under most circumstances, but when maximum power is required, the engine spins up to high speeds and moans noticeably from up front under the hood. Otherwise, the Prime shares the improved roadholding, handling, and comfortable ride of the conventional Prius.</p>, <p>Inside, the Prime is comfortable for four people, but unlike the regular Prius, it does not seat three in the rear, with the center position occupied by a hard plastic cupholder. All but the base version of the Prius Prime share the 11.6-inch vertical touchscreen that differentiates it from a regular Prius. It’s similar in design to the Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell sedan, underscoring its maker’s two approaches to zero-emission vehicles—although it's clear that Toyota will sell far more Primes than Mirais over the next five years.</p>, <p>Toyota includes a comprehensive suite of electronic active-safety features in every Prius Prime. Those include forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warnings, and automatic high beams. In addition, Toyota adds blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert to the Prime Advanced, the highest of three trim levels.</p>, <p>The Prius Prime is offered in three trim levels, with the Prius Prime Plus as the base and the mid-level Prius Prime Premium as the likely volume seller. The base car comes with cloth-covered heated front seats, heated mirrors, steering-wheel audio controls, and navigation. The Premium trim adds the 11.6-inch vertical touchscreen display, an eight-way power adjustable driver's seat with power lumbar adjustment, and a Qi wireless charging pad, among other features.</p>, <p>The top Prime Advanced trim adds a heated steering wheel, rain-sensing wipers, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, LED fog lights, remote activation of climate control via mobile-phone app, and a color head-up display for speed, vehicle information, and navigation instructions.</p>, <p>Unlike its predecessor, the Toyota Prius Prime will be sold in all 50 states. Sales started in late 2016. It qualifies for a $4,500 federal income tax credit, and in California, it qualifies for both a $1,500 purchase rebate and the coveted single-occupant access to carpool lanes on freeways.</p>]

[<p>You'd never mistake the Toyota 4Runner for a family vehicle. Its rugged off-road gear and brutish SUV look make no pretense about being car-like. They telegraph its intended purpose: to leave the pavement behind, and do it often.</p>, <p>With the 4Runner, Toyota has a rugged off-roader for throwback fans pining for a ladder frame and locking differentials. Its trade-off is in efficiency and comfort, although the 4Runner is available in some tony trims.</p>, <p>For 2018, the 4Runner largely stands pat.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_4runner_2018">2018 Toyota 4Runner review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The 4Runner doesn't have much competition left; the Nissan Xterra is extinct, and Toyota's own FJ Cruiser has been discontinued. That leaves the Jeep Grand Cherokee as its closest rival—or, perhaps, a Jeep Wrangler with a hardtop. </p>, <p>Lexus' GX 460 shares its frame with the 4Runner, but not its engine. The 4Runner is now only offered with a V-6 engine, while the Lexus is V-8 only. The Lexus is essentially a dressed-up version of the global market Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, which is smaller than the Toyota Land Cruiser sold here. </p>, <p>With Toyota's car-based Highlander crossover serving the mid-size family utility category, the 4Runner is more of a niche vehicle—it's a tougher and truckier option that stresses the "utility" side at the expense of some comfort and family amenities.</p>, <p>Confused? Think of the 4Runner as the Land Cruiser's little brother (for less than half the price).</p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota 4Runner</strong></p>, <p>The current 4Runner has strong visual ties to the models that came before it, with its long, squared-off body, but it avoids seeming outdated with just the right amount of updates. When this generation was introduced for 2010, it brought the focus back to the 4Runner's off-road and hauling capabilities. Frankly, pundits were generally surprised that Toyota was willing to invest again in its 4Runner nameplate after lukewarm reception to the outgoing model. Yet despite a low-key introduction at the State Fair of Texas auto show in the midst of a global recession and high gas prices, the 4Runner was an immediate success. </p>, <p>A 2.7-liter 4-cylinder was added as the base engine for rear-drive versions (and later discontinued), while the bulk of 2010 models came with a 270-hp 4.0-liter V-6. The V-8 was dropped altogether for that generation and is now available only on the Lexus GX. Four-cylinder 4Runners made do with an old 4-speed automatic, whereas the V-6 was mated to a slightly more modern 5-speed auto.</p>, <p>Underscoring its ruggedness, the 4Runner gained a new Trail Edition to appeal directly to off-roaders; it features the company's Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, off-road tires, a locking rear differential, and other upgrades. Then there was the Limited model, which carried over the X-REAS system and was loaded with comfort and convenience features. Although the 4Runner is still less fuel-efficient than more modern crossover 'utes, it has been rated highly for safety, and its reliability and longevity are legendary. Like its predecessors, the current model offers a roll-down glass rear window—something of a novelty nowadays.</p>, <p>Changes were very few for the 2013 model year, though it received redesigned audio systems, plus Toyota's Entune services and HD Radio with iTunes tagging, in the 2012 model.</p>, <p>For 2015, Toyota has introduced a new, off-road-focused <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1093382_looking-for-the-2015-toyota-fj-cruiser-meet-the-trd-pro-4runner">2015 TRD Pro 4Runner</a> that attempted to make up for the hole created in the lineup due to the discontinuation of the FJ Cruiser. It included unique suspension tuning, different wheels and tires, aesthetic changes, and a new exhaust.</p>, <p>For 2016, the 4Runner lineup gained upgraded Entune multimedia systems, which in SR5 and Trail models included a navigation system that uses a connected smartphone. The 4Runner also added Siri Eyes Free with all versions of the Entune system. In 2017, Toyota renamed the Trail trim level to TRD Off Road. Only some minor new options packages marked 2018 for the Toyota 4Runner.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota 4Runner history</strong></p>, <p>The 4Runner has, for the most part, been closely linked to small Toyota pickup trucks, including today's Tacoma. The first 4Runner wasn't much more than a truck with a cap covering some rear seats in what would have been the bed. The version that was introduced for 1996 changed the script, offering a more cohesive design, but retaining much of the underpinnings of the pickup, including the 4-cylinder and V-6 engines.</p>, <p>That particular 4Runner remains in popular today among off-roading enthusiasts. The high-demand models are 1996-2000 versions with the optional pushbutton electronic-locking rear differential and either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. The 4Runner was given a light refresh for the 1999 model year and then in 2001 automatic four-wheel drive was made standard (except on the rear-wheel drive models), as was traction and stability control. The differential lock was put on hiatus, while the manual gearbox was dropped entirely. </p>, <p>The 4Runner was redesigned again for 2003, this time becoming significantly larger, more refined, and more lavishly equipped—even though it retained the body-on-frame design. A small, barely usable third-row seat was made optional, and for the first time Toyota offered a V-8 on the 4Runner. The 4.7-liter V-8 actually produced less power than the standard V-6 early on, but its 320 lb-ft torque rating was considerably higher.</p>, <p>While these 4Runners had nice interior appointments, the ride tended to still be rather bouncy and harsh. Several more sophisticated chassis systems offered on the 4Runner included an off-road-oriented hydraulic system and an air suspension on the Limited model, good for towing and improved ride quality. This 4Runner also offered an increased range of convenience options, including a navigation system, a backup camera, and upgraded JBL audio.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_corolla
[<p>The Toyota Corolla is a compact four-door sedan. Over its 12 generations on sale, in markets around the world, it's become one of the most widely known and most successful car names ever. It has been the best-selling compact car in the U.S. for much of the last 20 years. The sedan was most recently redesigned for 2014, while the hatchback is new for 2019.</p>, <p>With the Corolla, Toyota has a rival for compact cars such as the Chevy Cruze, Honda Civic, Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra, and a host of second-tier entries as well, including the Mazda 3, Nissan Sentra, Subaru Impreza, and Volkswagen Jetta.</p>, <p>The Corolla sedan was unchanged for 2018, but a new hatchback was unveiled for 2019.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_corolla_2019" title="2019 Toyota Corolla - review">2019 Toyota Corolla review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>For most of its life the Corolla has been aimed at those seeking reliability over styling flair, sporty handling, or luxury features. In its latest generation, the Corolla has at least been given a bolder design, although it is still one of the more traditional vehicles in its niche.</p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Corolla</strong></p>, <p>In its current form, the Corolla continues its role as highly dependable, not-very-exciting, carefully packaged transportation for sensible buyers.</p>, <p>While Toyota hoped to field a more exciting compact with the launch of the 2014 Corolla—previewed by the sporty <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081621_sporty-furia-concept-previews-next-toyota-corolla-2013-detroit-auto-show">Furia Concept</a>—the new car is evolutionary in most of its strong points. That said, the styling is more distinctive and the connectivity options and interior appointments are greatly improved. The look is the most aggressive of any Corolla, with large trapezoidal lower grille openings in different arrangements depending on model and a very tight upper grille.</p>, <p>The current Corolla keeps an updated version of the classic 1.8-liter inline-4 as its only engine, but now the Corolla has largely switched from a traditional automatic to a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for improved fuel economy. It works relatively well—although it is not quite up to the standard of Subaru's excellent CVTs—and brings the Corolla's EPA ratings up to 29 mpg city, 38 highway, 32 combined. A 6-speed manual is available; those two powertrains carry 31-mpg combined ratings. Finally, there's a new and specially tuned Corolla Eco model, which boosts the combined rating up to 30/42/35 mpg. Eco models receive low-rolling-resistance tires, underbody aero pieces, and a separate Eco button that changes throttle sensitivity and can also reduce climate system output.</p>, <p>Safety ratings are good for the Corolla, but not stellar for the new model. While the outgoing 2013 Corolla was an IIHS Top Safety Pick, 2014-2016 models didn't win that title, due partly to its "Marginal" rating (one step above the lowest grade) on small-overlap front crash safety test. The NHTSA awarded the latest model five stars overall, however, a better result than its predecessors.</p>, <p>In 2012, following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan, Toyota announced <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1075982_toyota-bringing-much-of-its-production-home---to-america">plans to phase out Japanese production for the U.S. Corolla</a>. By the time the 2014 model arrived, the automaker had moved most of its Corolla production to Tupelo, Mississippi.</p>, <p>Toyota made few changes to the Corolla for 2015, although it added a new top-level Platinum trim, which makes standard many of the lower trims' optional equipment. Package content within the other trim levels was also boosted with additional features for this year.</p>, <p>Toyota will offered Corolla Special Edition for 2016. The package is based on the SE model and adds a unique red exterior color, special interior trim and badging, black upholstery with red contrast stitching, and gloss-black wheels. It builds on the newly aggressive look to create something that at least looks sporty, even if it's basically a normal Corolla underneath. </p>, <p>For 2017 to commemorate the nameplate's 50th anniversary, Toyota offered a special edition 50th Anniversary model that largely follows the 2016's special edition trim. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/scion_im_2016">Corolla iM</a> joined the mix as a Corolla hatchback, after the Scion brand folded for 2016. The Corolla returned to the IIHS' good graces with a Top Safety Pick nod thanks in part to newly standard automatic emergency braking and automatic high beam headlights.</p>, <p>A new Corolla hatchback joined the lineup for 2019. It rides on a new platform and features a 2.0-liter inline-4 paired to either a 6-speed manual or a CVT.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Corolla history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The start of Toyota's long history of Corolla sales in the U.S. can really be credited with changing the American perception of small cars, picking up the pieces where Volkswagen left off in making smaller vehicles a practical and popular choice. Including the 2014 model, there have now been 11 generations of Corollas over 40 years. Each has reinforced Toyota's reputation as the purveyor of reliable, sensible cars that can last hundreds of thousands of miles. They may not have always been stylish or exciting, but they almost never let down their owners—and the market has rewarded that characteristic handsomely.</p>, <p>Over its lifetime, the Corolla has gone from rear-wheel drive to front-wheel drive, and the lineup has encompassed sedans, coupes, hatchbacks, wagons, even fastbacks—but throughout its life, it's kept its reputation intact. Five years after Toyota's unintended acceleration fiasco of 2010, the company's reputation has largely recovered and consumers are continuing to buy the Corolla despite what are now clear deficiencies against a new and much tougher set of competitors.</p>, <p>Toyota continued to offer rear-drive Corolla sport coupes until 1987, but by then the sedans had all gone to the familiar front-drive layout in use today. The car's 1.6-liter 4-cylinder has grown to 1.8 liters, and its optional 3-speed automatic gained an extra gear, although the car itself hasn't become much larger in the interim.</p>, <p>The previous Corolla generation, which ran from 2009 through 2013, had gotten tired and long in the tooth by the time it was retired—and it was only a modest upgrade on the generation before that anyhow. It provided trouble-free transportation for a low price, but its powertrain was behind the curve, and its fuel efficiency especially was nothing to call home about. Yet it continued to sell in huge numbers to buyers who wanted trouble-free, if unadventurous, transportation.</p>, <p>That version of the Corolla made no leaps in design or refinement, putting it behind the generation of compact-sedan competitors launched from 2010 through 2012. In 2010, its safety was stepped up with ABS, stability control, front- and side-curtain airbags, and active head restraints all made standard—finally. Buyers could even get a navigation system, among modern conveniences, as an option on the highest Corolla trim levels. Base versions remained without power windows and power locks through 2011.</p>, <p>For 2009 and 2010, the Corolla was sold in luxurious XLE trim, which included better interior appointments—albeit at a higher price. Also for those years, an XRS version of the Corolla offered the Camry's engine, a 2.4-liter, under the hood for much quicker performance. In more recent years the "S" trim has offered some of that model's appearance, but at a more affordable price. For 2013, the outgoing Corolla saw only the most minor of feature changes. Toyota introduced a slightly different grille with added chrome, and all models but the base L received a new 6.1-inch touchscreen audio system with Bluetooth hands-free calling, Bluetooth audio streaming, and USB connectivity.</p>, <p>Either formally or informally, there have been several other members of the Corolla family sold over the years, including Toyota's own Tercel and Matrix. General Motors sold versions of the Corolla through its own dealerships for a time, including the Chevrolet Nova, Chevrolet Prizm, and Geo Prizm. More recently, GM and Toyota built the Corolla-based Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe hatchbacks together.</p>]

[<p>The Toyota Tacoma is a compact pickup truck that has endured decades while others have come and gone. Its name has evolved from Hilux to the aptly named Pickup, the Tacoma now spans a wide range of trim levels for shoppers.</p>, <p>With the Tacoma, Toyota has had a long-running mid-size truck that has appealed to buyers unwilling to shell out mega-bucks for full-size pickups. The Tacoma has been joined by rivals from General Motors, Nissan, and it will soon be joined by Ford in offering a smaller, more affordable option for a pickup.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_tacoma_2018">2018 Toyota Tacoma review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>For 2017, Toyota's mid-size truck added a new TRD Pro trim level aimed at off-roaders. With advanced Fox shocks, a small suspension lift, and beefier skid plates, it delivers many of the features truck owners typically add themselves.</p>, <p>For 2018, Toyota added automatic emergency braking to the Tacoma lineup, part of a larger push to equip all of its cars with the advanced safety feature.</p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Tacoma</strong></p>, <p>Toyota introduced a heavily updated Tacoma for the 2016 model year. Along with the usual styling and feature updates, the 2016 truck received a new Atkinson-cycle 3.5-liter V-6 with direct and port injection, which improves fuel economy. The V-6 is available with either a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission, while the base 4-cylinder carries over and goes autobox-only.</p>, <p>Toyota also made changes to the Tacoma's frame, adding strength and rigidity while also upping the amount of high-strength steel used. Finally, a newly styled interior offers more luxury features, more connectivity, and an updated Entune infotainment interface.</p>, <p>The Tacoma is offered extended and crew cab body styles and a choice of short and long composite beds. Both 4-cylinder and V-6 engines are available and most models offer a choice between automatic and manual transmissions.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Tacoma history</strong></p>, <p>Ever since the introduction of the original Tacoma for 1995, the model has maintained a loyal set of owners by offering different body styles, powertrains, and, especially, a few special editions targeted at off-roaders.</p>, <p>In its first generation, which ran from 1995 to 2004, the Tacoma got power from 2.4-liter and 2.7-liter 4-cylinders as well as a 3.4-liter V-6; output ranged from 142 hp to 190 hp. It always offered a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive, in either regular or extended cabs, with two different bed lengths. In the 10 years it was on sale, the first Tacoma received some aesthetic updates as well as several special edition packages.</p>, <p>The current Tacoma arrived in the 2005 model year, and it was carried through to 2015 with remarkably few major changes. It came a wide variety of configurations: Regular Cab, Access Cab, Double Cab and X-Runner models. All three were available with either short or long beds, and two- or four-wheel drive, in a range of trims and equipment levels. The two engines are a 159-hp 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine, and a 236-hp 4.0-liter V-6. Since its launch, towing capacity has risen from 5,000 pounds to today 6,500 pounds in the suitably equipped V-6 model. </p>, <p>The base regular cab truck came with minimal features, but offered a choice of 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmissions. The popular, work-ready 4x2 "low boy" model was discontinued after 2015. Models equipped with the V-6 were available with either a 6-speed manual or 5-speed auto. Above the standard trim was the PreRunner specification, which adds several off-road-friendly features, including overfenders, skid plates, mudguards, and upgraded wheels and tires. Inside, the trucks see upgrades correlated to cab sizes, with the larger models adding more luxurious seating, more folding-seat arrangements, and more power accessories. The range-topping Double Cab models add rear-seat amenities including cupholders, heating ducts, and a 60/40 split-folding rear bench seat. </p>, <p>The X-Runner is a special high-performance version of the Tacoma, offering stiffer suspension, larger alloy wheels and summer tires for better on-road performance, as well as a body treatment to match.</p>, <p>In recent model years, Toyota has added more off-road-oriented options with T|X and T|X Pro packages in addition to the PreRunner, X-Runner, and TRD Off-Road Package. Also, for the 2012 model year, Toyota expanded the number of 4-cylinder Tacoma models and gave these trucks a light refresh, with a somewhat different grille, and less brightwork inside. The orange interior lighting was replaced with blue, and a new standard sound system included six speakers, Bluetooth hands-free capability, and a USB/iPod port.</p>, <p>Also added for 2012 were an available navigation system with real-time traffic and weather, accompanied by a new premium system with HD Radio and Bluetooth audio streaming.</p>, <p>No changes were made to the Tacoma for the 2013 model year; Toyota discontinued Tacoma Regular Cab models after 2014.</p>, <p>For 2015, Toyota offered a TRD Pro package for the Tacoma, as well as the 4Runner and Tundra. On the smaller truck, it includes an off-road-ready wheel-and-tire package, a new exhaust, upgraded suspension components, and a unique front end, with a different grille and a hood with a scoop. The TRD Pro is aimed at more serious off-roading and trail running.</p>]

[<p>The Toyota Sienna is a minivan with a distinction: it's the only to offer all-wheel drive. The rest of the bits are all there too including sliding doors, plenty of seats and space, and enough distractions for a long road trip.</p>, <p>Along with other minivans, the Toyota Sienna offers stellar safety and plenty of interior space for passengers and cargo.</p>, <p>Last year, Toyota added a new 8-speed automatic and a more powerful V-6 to the Sienna. For 2018, the company's van gets a new look to match its improved performance. Upgraded infotainment inside is also part of the Sienna's package for 2018. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_sienna_2018">2018 Toyota Sienna review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Sienna</strong></p>, <p>The Sienna offered today first went on sale in the spring of 2010 for the 2011 model year. About the same size (and a little heavier) than the version that preceded it, the new Sienna has a more premium look and feel. The powertrains that year included a 266-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, with a 6-speed automatic transmission and either front- or all-wheel drive; Toyota also offered a 187-hp, 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine in 2011 and 2012, but discontinued it in 2013.</p>, <p>Like most of its rivals, the current Sienna can carry up to eight passengers with the right seating combination, and it offers a pair of sliding doors, with power doors as an option. It also has a third-row seat that can stow under the floor when not needed, although it doesn't offer a similar feature for the second row like the Chrysler van does. It offers special reclining airplane-style seats for the second row, which have since been copied in the Kia Sedona. The Sienna remains unique among minivans as the only one that still offers optional all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>All versions of the Sienna now sport a USB port; Bluetooth with audio streaming; automatic climate control; power front seats; a power tailgate; and power sliding side doors. Seating includes those available plush second-row captain's chairs with footrests, and the infotainment offerings have been spiced up with a new split-screen setup that's perfect for gaming.</p>, <p>Toyota gave the Sienna a mild update for 2015. Changes include reworked grilles and lighting elements on some models, as well as tweaks for the interior. The powertrain menu remains the same, with a standard V-6 and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. Toyota has made some chassis improvements, including stiffening the structure, and massaged the body to improve aerodynamics slightly but the changes didn't affect the EPA ratings of 18 mpg city, 25 highway for front-wheel-drive models. The 2015 model also earned the IIHS' "Good" scores in all but the new small front offset test, where it scored an "Acceptable" rating. Its five-star overall rating from the NHTSA carries over.</p>, <p>For 2017, Toyota improved the Sienna's powertrain and efficiency with an uprated direct-injection version of its 3.5-liter V-6 (that now makes 296 hp) and an 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p><strong>Sienna history</strong></p>, <p>Toyota introduced the Sienna as a more conventional minivan offering in the late '90s. It replaced the egg-shaped Previa, which had a mid-engine, rear-drive design that resulted in strange packaging. The Sienna came on the scene in 1998 with front-wheel drive and an interior layout that more closely aped that of the segment's leaders. That model shared underpinnings with the Camry sedan, as does the model to this day that in combination with production located in the U.S., brought costs down.</p>, <p>Initially, the Sienna used the same powertrain as the Camry V-6—a 194-hp 3.0-liter, replaced after several years by an even smoother, more flexible 210-hp version. These first-generation Siennas have proven reliable, but Toyota hadn't yet found its way to the front of the pack; seating was definitely a step behind the Chrysler minivans of the time, and the third row had to be lifted away rather than folding flat, and the interiors were quite drab. A lot of shoppers who are intimidated with the immense size and weight of newer minivans might find these Siennas just right. Side airbags and stability control became available in 2001, so with the stronger engine, too, the 2001-2003 models are the pick of this bunch.</p>, <p>For 2004, Toyota introduced a redesigned and considerably larger Sienna. With a 230-hp (or 215-hp), 3.3-liter V-6 and 5-speed automatic transmission, this Sienna delivered performance that was about the same as the model before it, though the 266-hp, 3.5-liter engine introduced for 2007 gave the van more confidence for passing and highway hauling. But this Sienna didn't have a lot of charisma or style, and near the end of its life it was looking quite outdated next to some rival models. Interior materials were also panned for being a bit drab and plasticky, once again, on all but the top XLE and Limited models.</p>, <p>These vans came well-equipped, though buyers had to move up to the higher trims to get items like power sliding doors, the power-folding third-row seat, and the power tailgate. While LE models came with a bench in the second row, XLE and XLE Limited models came with twin captain's chairs. Options included front and rear parking sensors, a JBL audio system, and laser-guided cruise control. Toyota made side airbags standard for 2006.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_land-cruiser
[<p>The Toyota Land Cruiser is the most luxurious SUV available from the Japanese automaker, and one of the company's most rugged. </p>, <p>It's also one of the longest-running nameplates, a model that dates back to the 1950s and has evolved into a plush, but still highly-capable, SUV with three rows of seats. </p>, <p>With the Land Cruiser, Toyota has evolved the little truck (lovingly called the "Land Bruiser") into a luxury SUV without leaving behind its off-road capability. The larger Sequoia helped it along; space, comfort, and towing all fall better under its purview to leave the Land Cruiser to do what it does best.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read</strong> <strong>our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_land-cruiser_2018">2018 Toyota Land Cruiser review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Still offered globally with myriad powertrains, the Land Cruiser has spawned a smaller Land Cruiser Prado model in many markets, versions of which are sold in the U.S. as the Toyota 4Runner and Lexus GX 460.</p>, <p>The Land Cruiser was updated for 2016 with a new look, more technology, and an 8-speed automatic. For 2018, the rear-seat entertainment system that was standard is optional. </p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Land Cruiser</strong></p>, <p>The current Land Cruiser, introduced for 2008, is slightly larger than the previous version. Compared to the last generation, it also received a big power upgrade, with a brawny 5.7-liter V-8 making 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of torque, and tied to a 6-speed automatic transmission. This powertrain felt strong in highway passing, or even when towing, and the 8-speed automatic added for 2016 made it more responsive. Fuel economy remains 13 mpg city, 18 highway, 15 combined, even with the 8-speed.</p>, <p>The four-wheel-drive system includes a low range, of course, as well as a locking center differential, a host of electronics to keep everything in line, and lots of ground clearance. A Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System stiffens the anti-roll bars when on the road, but can loosen the setup for more wheel articulation when off-roading.</p>, <p>Inside, this Land Cruiser doesn't feel downright lavish, but it has plenty of space to sprawl out and Toyota did a great job keeping wind and road noise at bay. Fit, finish, and materials were initially a little questionable in places, especially considering the $70,000 price tag, and the third row doesn't fold flat into the floor; instead, each seat swivels to the side, where they take up what would otherwise be usable cargo space. They do come out of the truck with a little more effort, however. </p>, <p>In 2010, Toyota upgraded the audio and infotainment systems and added a suite of safety systems. Then a refreshed Land Cruiser, with cosmetic changes inside and out, <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1071380_2013-toyota-land-cruiser-gets-new-styling-more-features">arrived for the 2013 model year</a>. It was largely the same as the model that was introduced in 2008, though some upgrades brought modern connectivity to its infotainment system. A revised front end incorporated LED daytime running lights, and new panels beneath the bumpers offered better underbody protection.</p>, <p>Toyota added previously optional equipment like a center-console cooler to the standard-features list while also adding heated second-row seats, a new information display, voice activation, Bluetooth connectivity, and a rear DVD system.</p>, <p>Toyota made some significant changes to the Land Cruiser for 2016. In addition to the new 8-speed automatic transmission, the Land Cruiser adds a suite of active safety features, including an automatic braking system with pedestrian protection, lane-departure warnings, automatic high-beam headlights, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts.</p>, <p>This current Land Cruiser also features a version of the Entune system paired with hard-drive-based navigation; Entune links to a cellphone, using its connection to access apps like Pandora and Facebook on the built-in touchscreen.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Land Cruiser history</strong></p>, <p>Proven for decades in tough environments from desert to mountains and tundra, the Toyota Land Cruiser has forged a well-deserved reputation for hardiness, reliability, and longevity. Toyota markets the Land Cruiser as being engineered for 500,000 miles, none of which are traveled on-road and it's easy to believe. Modern models add luxury to the inherent capability that has been a fixture.</p>, <p>Although Land Cruisers tend to last a while, the third-generation models that were sold through much of the 1990s are the oldest ones you're still likely to see at a standard car lot. Earlier versions had a 155-hp, 4.0-liter inline-6 that struggled at highway speeds, whereas the 212-hp, 4.5-liter inline-6 that followed it was a marked improvement. During this time, Toyota also phased out the old manual-locking 4WD system, which required the driver to get out of the vehicle and lock the hubs one by one, and phased in a full-time system. All of these models are a little more stark inside than you might expect, with a very simple layout and interior noise levels that are much higher than those of today.</p>, <p>Cashing in on the SUV boom of the late 1990s, Toyota rebadged its flagship as the Lexus LX, a model that continues today.</p>, <p>A 1998 redesign of the Land Cruiser included the fitment of a new V-8 engine. Displacing 4.7 liters, the engine was initially rated at 230 hp and it sent power to all four wheels via a 4-speed automatic. A refresh for the 2003 model year brought a revised look inside and out plus a 5-speed automatic. Subsequent updates boosted the 4.7-liter's output to 265 hp.</p>, <p>The Land Cruiser has long remained Toyota's flagship, and its luxury content has increased exponentially. But its mission has stayed consistent: providing excellent off-road capability with unparalleled reliability and durability. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_yaris
[<p>The Toyota Yaris subcompact sedan and hatchback is likely to show up on consumers' shopping lists next to the Ford Fiesta, Chevy Sonic, Nissan Versa Note, Kia Rio, Mitsubishi Mirage, and Hyundai Accent.</p>, <p>The current Yaris can be had in either three or five doors, but the four-door Yaris sedan is now a different model built under contract by Mazda.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Yaris gained some important collision avoidance tech as standard: it can automatically apply the brakes if it detects an impending accident and it can alert the driver if it begins to stray into a separate lane. For 2019, the Yaris sedan became available in a trio of trim levels.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_yaris_2019">2019 Toyota Yaris preview</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Yaris</strong></p>, <p>The Yaris remains one of the lightest vehicles in this class, at around 2,300 pounds, making it seem like a good choice for those who want a light, tossable subcompact. Yet, in an extended drive <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1071413_2012-toyota-yaris-se-first-drive">we found its 106-horsepower 4-cylinder engine to be underwhelming</a>. That said, sporty SE models get a stiffer suspension for a more responsive feel (plus four-wheel disc brakes). Engine noise remains an issue at highway cruising speeds, and we've found the current Yaris to be fuel efficient in the city, but no standout for mileage on the highway. The EPA has rated the Yaris at only 30 mpg city, 36 highway, 32 combined when paired to an automatic transmission. The new Yaris is strong on safety, with nine standard airbags, but lacking options such as heated seats and touchscreen navigation. Bluetooth hands-free features are delightfully simple, though, and USB ports and aux plugs are standard for all.</p>, <p>With new styling, the current <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_yaris_2013">Toyota Yaris Liftback</a> goes in a somewhat sporty, but also somewhat more ubiquitous direction, losing some of the Euro-chic charm of the previous hatchback. It does gain a few inches of length, for better cargo capacity especially. Engines and transmissions essentially carry over unchanged from the previous generation, but interior design and ergonomics are quite different, with gauges moved back directly in front of the driver and seats getting more generous bolstering.</p>, <p>For 2013, Toyota made the former Tech Audio Package (Bluetooth, USB, iPod connectivity, HD Radio, satellite radio compatibility, and six speakers) standard on all models.</p>, <p>The Yaris was refreshed for the 2015 model year, which brings even more aggressive styling to go along with the new faces being grafted on most other Toyota products. Changes included more soft-touch materials inside, a retuned suspension, and some added feature content. Toyota made further tweaks to the infotainment offerings as well, including a dealer-installable navigation system that somewhat makes up for the lack of a factory solution.</p>, <p>The 2017 Yaris was joined by the Yaris iA for 2017 after Toyota's nascent Scion brand folded. The Yaris hatchback also added a suite of significant safety updates including lane departure warnings, forward collision warnings, and automatic high beams.</p>, <p>For 2018, Toyota slightly resculpted the front and rear bumpers of the Yaris hatchback, but largely left the two models alone.</p>, <p>A new Yaris is expected in a few years. It will be built in Mexico and will share its architecture with the next Mazda 2 subcompact and a new sedan model, both of which will be products of the same factory. The next Yaris will be based on the Mazda 2's platform and will share that car's 1.5-liter engine and transmissions, as well as some interior and exterior styling.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Yaris History</strong></p>, <p>The first-generation Yaris, sold in the U.S. from 2006 through 2011, supplanted the homely Echo in Toyota's lineup and was lauded—especially in hatchback form—for its more stylish, urban-chic appearance. Initially, the Yaris was offered either as a three-door hatchback or a four-door sedan, each with its own set of interior and exterior design details. While the hatchback had a more radically styled instrument panel, with a thin center stack and central speedometer, the sedan came with a more conventional look. Likewise, the Yaris hatchback received different front-end details that made it look cuter in the opinion of many, whereas the sedan's front end and proportions were closely related to the contemporary Camry's and Corolla's.</p>, <p>Both models came with the same engine—a 106-hp, 1.5-liter 4-cylinder paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. In either version, this worked out to be plenty to move the lightweight Yaris quickly—though the automatic cars were a little sluggish with a full load. The first Yaris was sprightly and maneuverable around town—and capable of fitting into some of the tightest parking spaces—with light, responsive steering and compact dimensions, but its soft suspension calibration meant that it didn't feel sporty on a country road. Ride quality was soft and absorbent, with a bounciness that came out on some road surfaces.</p>, <p>While the interior of the 2006-2011 Yaris was stylish, it made clear concessions to cost in the materials and trims that were used. There were hard, scratch-prone plastics throughout, and the upholstery felt bargain-basement. Sedans were more than a foot longer than hatchbacks; they didn't have that much more leg room, but getting in was a lot easier, and they did have a surprisingly roomy trunk. For 2009, Toyota introduced a five-door hatchback body style, which some might find the best compromise between the hatchback's stylish appearance and the sedan's practicality.</p>, <p>Equipment on that original base-model Yaris hatchback was basic. Air conditioning and keyless entry were included in all models, but nearly all other common features—such as power windows—were optional, while cruise control was only offered on top models. Safety wasn't a strong point for this Yaris, with crash-test scores unimpressive and many cars leaving the factory without anti-lock brakes. ABS became standard along with electronic stability control for 2010.</p>, <p>The Yaris was closely related to the Scion xA and somewhat related to the Scion xD; the xD in particular has more appealing interior materials, as well as a stronger 1.8-liter engine from the Corolla, but it burns more fuel as a result. The Yaris has proven to be one of the most reliable vehicles on Consumer Reports' annual survey, has good resale value, and has been rated as being among the cheapest to own, considering aspects like insurance, maintenance, and depreciation.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_tundra
[<p>The Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck that's struggled to find a foothold in a booming market. It relies on its legacy of reliability more than its powertrains, which resonates with buyers looking outside the Detroit Three.</p>, <p>With the Tundra, Toyota offers a full-size pickup to take on Ford, Chevy, Ram, and GMC, but unseating those truckmakers is no easy task; the Toyota is far behind the others in sales.</p>, <p>Today, the Tundra is at least the equal in size of the F-150, Ram 1500, Silverado and Sierra. It's sold in lots of trim levels, too, from the Tundra SR and SR5, to the Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition, TRD Sport, and TRD Pro models. For 2018, Toyota has made a raft of safety tech—adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, automatic high beam headlights, and lane departure warning—standard across the lineup. A mildly revised front fascia keeps the Tundra's look somewhat fresh, while the regular cab model has been dropped from the lineup. Toyota also added a new trim level to the lineup: TRD Sport, with Bilstein shocks and beefier sway bars, in addition to a few styling upgrades.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_tundra_2018">2018 Toyota Tundra review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Toyota Tundra</strong></p>, <p>Toyota gave the Tundra a mild refresh for the 2014 model year. The revised trucks debuted at the 2013 North American International Auto Show in Detroit sporting new front-end styling, added content, and a slightly nicer interior. Standard items include a rearview camera and Entune audio systems, while blind-spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert are available on upper trim levels. The same three engines were included, keeping the Tundra behind the revised Ram, new GM trucks, and well-fitted Ford models. The new technology inside was a nice touch, but the Tundra's main problem remained its less powerful and less fuel-efficient motivation. In some versions with the 4.6-liter V-8, the Tundra's fuel economy actually dropped slightly, likely due to aerodynamic or tire-choice changes.</p>, <p>Today, the Tundra retains its four-star government rating and received top "Good" scores in the four categories for which it is rated by the IIHS.</p>, <p>For the 2015 model year, Toyota dropped the 270-horsepower V-6 engine option in the Tundra, leaving it only with its choice of V-8s. Only minor trim and feature changes were made for the 2016 and 2017 model years.</p>, <p><strong>Toyota Tundra history</strong></p>, <p>While critics have often found the Toyota Tundra to be the wrong size or aimed at the wrong audience, it has met praise for its non-standard approach to the pickup scene. First sold in 1999 as a 2000-model truck, the Tundra has evolved, growing larger and more powerful over its three generations.</p>, <p>From initial launch, the Tundra was offered with a choice of two engines: a 3.4-liter V-6 making 190 hp and a 4.7-liter V-8 good for 245 hp; Toyota also offered TRD supercharged versions of both engines for some extra power. The first round of engine upgrades came for 2005, when the V-6 was replaced with a 4.0-liter unit and the V-8 received variable valve timing, which both resulted in power bumps. The first-gen Tundra's styling was certainly conservative. It was offered in Regular, Access (with rear-hinged doors), and Double Cab configurations. Toyota's first attempt at a full-size truck was somewhat hamstrung compared to the domestics as it was only able to tow around 7,000 pounds.</p>, <p>The second-generation Tundra arrived in 2006, adding a new 5.7-liter V-8 engine option and bumping the tow rating up to 10,100 pounds, a much more competitive figure in the half-ton class. A number of high-performance TRD packages were also available, including a street-focused Sport package and a special off-road Rock Warrior package.</p>, <p>The updated Tundra offered a choice of three engines: the 4.0-liter V-6, a 4.6-liter V-8 rated at 310 hp, and a 5.7-liter V-8 rated at 381 hp. The largest V-8 also was available with flex-fuel capability. The Regular Cab model was the work truck of the range, offering a minimalist feature set, though it could be upgraded to include more advanced features. The Double Cab model offered a higher base specification, including more available upgrades. The CrewMax model, with its four-door layout, offered luxury items like an available power moonroof and a standard power vertical sliding rear window, as well as optional unique exterior accents including a chrome grille surround, chrome-trimmed power-folding side mirrors, and more. Bed configurations for this Tundra included standard and long beds, though the long bed was only available on the Regular and Double Cab models. The V-6 model was only available in 4x2 drive layout, while the V-8s were available in either 4x2 or 4x4.</p>, <p>Safety ratings for this Tundra were good, with the truck earning the IIHS' Top Safety Pick at the time, plus four-star overall ratings from the NHTSA.</p>, <p>Interior features followed similar paths to upgrade as the exterior features, with the larger-cab models offering more in the way of available upgrades and base equipment. The base Regular Cab truck included an MP3-capable six-speaker CD stereo, dual-zone climate control, split-folding bench seat (bucket upgrade available), and rubberized flooring, with carpeting available as part of a package upgrade. DVD-based navigation was available across the range. Stepping up to the Double Cab version added standard cruise control, power windows and door locks, and a fold-up rear seat, plus the ability to upgrade to an enhanced JBL audio system with integrated DVD navigation, bucket seats, and an overhead console bin. The CrewMax was available in an upgraded Limited trim, which added the JBL system as standard, upgraded gauges with information display, a tilt-telescoping steering wheel, front and rear sonar for parking, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, leather-trimmed upholstery with power front seats, and more standard interior storage compartments.</p>, <p>For 2013, a new Display Navigation with Entune system was added as an option. Centered around a new 6.1-inch high-resolution touchscreen with split-screen capability, the system included an integrated rearview camera, a USB port with iPod control, hands-free calling, SiriusXM satellite radio capability, HD Radio with iTunes Tagging, voice controls, and Bluetooth music streaming.</p>]

[<p>The Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV that's big in size and scope. It hauls up to eight people and tows thousands of pounds.</p>, <p>Although it is the oldest design in its segment, the Sequoia benefits from its strong (if thirsty) V-8 engine and Toyota's reputation for quality. It's available in SR5, Limited, and Platinum trim levels, with a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive. </p>, <p>With the Sequoia, Toyota has had since 2001 a rival for vehicles such as the Ford Expedition, the GMC Yukon, and the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban.</p>, <p>For 2018, Toyota added a TRD Sport edition with tougher off-road shocks and sway bars and a mildly updated front grille.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1111016_2018-toyota-sequoia">2018 Toyota Sequoia review</a></strong></em></p>, <p> <strong>The new Sequoia</strong></p>, <p>The current Sequoia was new in the 2008 model year, coinciding with a new version of the Tundra pickup truck on which it's based. Powertrains were accordingly borrowed from the Tundra. The Sequoia launched with an available 381-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 and 6-speed automatic that made it a viable, even superior, choice <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1063701_family-car-advice-the-best-suvs-for-towing">for towing duty</a> compared to the contemporary light-duty trucks from Detroit. Base models got a 276-hp, 4.7-liter V-8 and 5-speed automatic. Fuel economy wasn't that much different between the two engines though—it ranged from an EPA-rated 13 mpg city, 16 highway to 13/18 mpg.</p>, <p>All Sequoias come with three rows of seats, with the middle row offering a choice of a bench or two captain's chairs. The Sequoia's highway ride in particular has been much improved and the cabin is quieter, with interior appointments now close to rivaling those of the more expensive Land Cruiser. Base, Limited, and Platinum models are available, with the Platinum getting a lot of extras, including heated and ventilated seats, heated mirrors, DVD entertainment, a navigation system with XM NavTraffic, JBL sound, and wood trim.</p>, <p>Little has changed on the Sequoia since 2008. While the Tundra on which it's based has seen exterior and interior improvements, the SUV has been left out, and both have had their powertrain options shrink instead of grow or mature. The Sequoia has sizable cargo room thanks to its independent suspension design in back, but its massive size means it's not fun to drive, and poor visibility makes things difficult when it comes time to park. It's still a solid choice for those who want to tow, but it's not an efficient vehicle when there's no load to carry.</p>, <p>Toyota has mostly added features in recent years in the absence of more meaningful changes. On 2010 models, Bluetooth, satellite radio, a USB port, and an auxiliary port were added to the standard-equipment list. The 2012 Sequoia received standard trailer-sway control and blind-spot monitors. Toyota has also been pushing its Entune infotainment systems through most of the lineup, and a new Blu-ray rear-entertainment system was added to top trims.</p>, <p>In 2013, Toyota dropped the smaller V-8, leaving only the 5.7-liter engine. There were no changes to the Sequoia for the 2015 model year, and only minor changes for 2016, including smartphone-based navigation and more widely available safety technology. The 2017 model year is a complete carryover from 2016. </p>, <p><strong>Toyota Sequoia history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The Sequoia first reached showrooms in the 2001 model year, shortly after the full-size Toyota Tundra pickup was introduced. From day one, the Sequoia has offered V-8 engines with a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive. At launch, the base engine was a 240-hp, 4.7-liter V-8 backed by a 4-speed automatic transmission, but 2005-2007 models received a stronger, 282-hp (or 273-hp) version, paired with a 5-speed automatic, which was also a bit smoother and not any less efficient.</p>, <p>Those first-generation Sequoia models weren't exactly the pinnacle of refinement—they had more road, engine, and wind noise than some might expect in a full-size truck—and they weren't as spacious inside as rival Ford and Chevy models, but they proved themselves to be sturdy, reliable trucks. SR5 and Limited models added more luxury features, and a series of improvements phased in with the stronger engine in 2005 made the Sequoia much more appealing overall. Toyota was also a safety trendsetter in offering standard electronic stability control on all of those vehicles.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_86
[<p>The Toyota 86 (pronounced "eight-six") is a 2+2 coupe built on a rear-drive platform that makes for an entertaining, affordable choice for driving enthusiasts.</p>, <p>With the 86, Toyota started a partnership with Subaru building sports cars that may be a blueprint for those small-volume cars' futures. The 86 began life as a Scion FR-S (in the States, at least) but changed names after that brand was shuttered. The Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ are very similar and share a 2.0-liter boxer 4-cylinder spinning out 205 horsepower. That's just enough to make the 86 a fun little sports car that can compete with the Hyundai Genesis Coupe, Mazda Miata, and perhaps even the Ford Mustang.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota 86 has changed little after a small update for the prior year.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114364_2018-toyota-86">2018 Toyota 86 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Toyota 86 started as the Scion FR-S for the 2013 model year. It proved itself to be one of the best new cars on the market, and accordingly, it made it to the final cut of <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080869_2013-scion-fr-s-best-car-to-buy-2013-nominee"><em>Motor Authority</em>'s Best Car To Buy 2013</a> awards.</p>, <p>With the changeover to the Toyota brand for the 2017 model year, the car also received some other updates.</p>, <p>Peak output from the car’s 2.0-liter engine is increased by 5 hp and 5 pound-feet of torque to 205 and 156, respectively. The standard 6-speed manual (a 6-speed automatic is also offered) gets some new gear ratios for better performance. Toyota has also revised the shock and spring rates to make the car bite into corners better up front and hold the road better in the rear.</p>, <p>On the outside, the car sports new bumpers that give it a wider, more aggressive stance. LED lighting is used front and rear, and there are new wheel patterns. Inside, you’ll find some new soft materials and accent stitching.</p>, <p>While the flat-4's 205 hp is not a whole lot in the sports-coupe realm, the 86 tips the scales between 2,700 and 2,800 pounds, depending on trim, and the combination makes for an <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1075616_2013-scion-fr-s-first-drive">entertaining, if not quite thrilling, driving experience</a>. Fairly skinny, low-rolling-resistance tires allow the driver to easily overpower the grip with the engine's modest torque output and steer the car with the rear wheels.</p>, <p>Fuel economy ratings for the 86 are quite respectable, though not as high as you might expect for a small 4-cylinder paired with a manual transmission. The EPA estimates 21 mpg city, 28 highway. With the automatic transmission, things get noticeably better, rising to 24/32 mpg. To balance power and efficiency, the Subaru-based engine uses Toyota's combination port- and direct-injection fuel delivery.</p>, <p>
Inside, the 86 is sporty, with a youthful, modern design and a minimalist ethos that puts the emphasis on driving, rather than coddling occupants with rich materials and intricate features. It suits the sports car nature of the 86 well, and considering the affordable price point (starting around $26,000), it's well within expectations. The driver gets a large and readable tachometer front and center, with other gauges off to the side and a digital speedometer inset in the middle. There are few other distractions in the interior, which is as it should be.</p>, <p>
The Toyota 86 has not been fully crash tested, but the Scion FR-S, which is the same car with different badges, has. It earned top "Good" results in all categories but the small front overlap test from the IIHS. It also nearly aced testing by the NHTSA, with a five-star overall rating and a full five stars in all but the frontal crash category, where it earned four stars.</p>, <p>Toyota offers several accessories for the 86 that come with a warranty. They include items like spoilers, wheels, shift knobs, trim pieces, and even suspension and brake upgrades. Aftermarket tuners also offer a variety of parts.</p>, <p>Rumors of higher-performance versions, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080390_scion-fr-s-subaru-brz-could-get-kers-hybrid-tetsuya-tada">hybrid</a>, or at the least, a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080227_trd-looking-at-supercharger-kit-for-the-scion-fr-s">factory-backed set of upgrades</a>, persist for the 86. A convertible version of the car is also possible; a <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1082629_toyota-ft-86-open-concept-leaked-gallery">concept droptop version of the car</a> was shown at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. Given the coupe's limited sales to date, however, chances for other variants and offshoots are looking less and less likely. Subaru and Toyota have both said they are working together on a second generation of the architecture.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_prius-v
[<p>The Toyota Prius V is a larger hybrid wagon derived from the Prius liftback—the most successful hybrid vehicle ever. It was shelved in 2018 without a successor.</p>, <p>Along with the smaller Prius C hatch, the V was part of an expanded Prius lineup that also includes the standard liftback, Prius C, and the Prius Prime, a plug-in hybrid with 22 miles of all-electric range.</p>, <p>The Prius V shared a badge and an economical powertrain with the Prius liftback, but packaged everything in a wider, longer, taller, wagon-like body. It offered improved space for small families and their stuff while still returning respectable economy figures.</p>, <p>Few direct rivals exist for the Prius V, but the closest competitor from another maker was the Ford C-Max Hybrid, a similarly sized, hybrid-only model that also resembles a tall wagon. It was also shelved in 2018.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_prius-v_2017" target="_blank" title="2017 Toyota Prius V - review">2017 Toyota Prius V review</a></em></strong></p>, <p>Toyota's own RAV4 Hybrid, however, may be the successor to the Prius V. The hybrid crossover utility vehicle has outsold the Prius V since it was launched for the 2016 model year. It offers all-wheel drive, but returns lower gas mileage than the Prius wagon—although its EPA ratings are better than those of even the most fuel-efficient crossovers in the Ford Escape and Mazda CX-5 lineups.</p>, <p>Almost all of them are more fun to drive than the miserly Toyota, although those who like their Prius liftback but want a little more room will be pleased with the wagon. The Prius V was essentially unchanged for the 2017 model year, aside from some minor infotainment upgrades. </p>, <p>The Prius V was the largest Prius offered, providing the most space for people and gear inside. It's aimed at small families who have outgrown their Prius liftback, but who still wanted stellar fuel economy. The V is basically a wagon version of that model, although it is wider in addition to being taller and longer.</p>, <p>The Prius V delivered its biggest payoff in fuel efficiency. Even though it's heavier and less aerodynamic than the 50-mpg Prius liftback, it still managed 44 mpg city, 40 highway, 42 combined, according to the EPA.</p>, <p>The Prius V used the basic formula of its siblings—a dedicated body style and the company's signature Hybrid Synergy Drive system. Just like the standard Prius, the V comes with a 98-horsepower, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine and a pair of electric motor-generators, managed through a planetary gearset and sophisticated electronic controls. Ride quality is quite good, and previously Prius-driving parents will appreciate that the futuristic, but impractical "flying console" dash layout from the main Prius lineup has been replaced with a more straightforward one that offers a variety of bins, cubbies, and trays.</p>, <p>When compared side by side with a classic Prius liftback, the Prius V has a more classic wagon shape. The higher, squarer back end distinguished it from the long-sloping "kammback" design used for the Toyota Prius liftback since 2004. While the shape of the latter is aerodynamically superior, its low roofline at the back interfered with cargo capability. The more spacious Toyota Prius V shared no body panels at all with its five-door sibling, even though the two looked very similar. The V provided a higher (more minivan-like) seating position, along with more cargo space—67.3 cubic feet, with the rear seats folded. The rear seats also slide back and forth, and can be reclined to optimize the balance between passenger legroom and cargo space.</p>, <p>As with all but the smallest Prius C model, the driving experience is very low-involvement. The steering is light but precise, and powertrain response will rev or slow the engine note independent of road speed, as the hybrid system continuously re-balances the mix of gasoline and electric power for maximum efficiency. It will all feel familiar to Prius owners, but wagon buyers new to the Prius line may find it a little off-putting at first.</p>, <p>Overall, the Prius V drove much like the Prius liftback, but it's more burdened by 300 pounds of additional weight. Prius drivers will feel the extra heft during acceleration from a standstill, and new drivers will note the Prius V straining mightily to labor up hills while heavily loaded with people and their goods.</p>, <p>The Prius V, much like the Prius liftback, comes with a series of trim levels that can seem confusing. For starters, the "V" is pronounced phonetically, as in Prius "Vee." Toyota Prius V Two, Prius V Three, and Prius V Five models were offered initially, with a Prius V Four added for 2015—no, there isn't a "One." The Two is the base model, while the Three adds Bluetooth, voice-activated navigation, and steering-wheel controls, plus navigation and a touchscreen system with Toyota's Entune infotainment interface.</p>, <p>With the Five you get the full spectrum of goodies: upgraded alloy wheels, heated front seats, synthetic leather upholstery, foglights, and LED headlights.</p>, <p>The Prius V received its first refresh for the 2015 model year, with new, more aggressive styling bringing the look closer to that of the most recently updated Toyota products. Some equipment was shuffled around, and the base price dropped slightly, while Toyota added the Four trim level between the Three and Five to provide an extra build and options combination. The 2017 model is mechanically identical and keeps up the original model's high fuel-economy marks.</p>, <p>Toyota ended the Prius V's production with the 2017 model year. A new vehicle in its size class should emerge for the 2019 model year, still Prius-based, but styled to more closely fit in with the crossover class.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_prius-c
[<p>The Toyota Prius C is a five-seat, five-door hatchback sold exclusively with a hybrid powertrain, as a part of Toyota's Prius family of hybrids.</p>, <p>The most affordable and smallest Prius offering, the Prius C's 47-mpg combined fuel economy rating puts it among the most efficient of all new vehicles without a plug. Following changes to the calculations for 2017, it is now rated at 46 mpg combined on the EPA cycle, below the 52 mpg achieved by the new Prius Liftback, but better than the larger wagon-bodied Prius V.</p>, <p>The Prius C has only one hybrid competitor: the new Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, which is nicer inside and outdoes it on fuel economy as well, at 54 mpg combined. Among gas-powered cars, the Prius C competes with the most fuel-efficient versions of mainstream subcompacts such as the Ford Fiesta, Chevrolet Sonic, Toyota Yaris, Nissan Versa, and Hyundai Accent.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_prius-c_2018" target="_blank" title="2018 Toyota Prius C - review">2018 Toyota Prius C review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>While the lines of the Prius C are far less distinctive than those of the traditional Prius—to us, it looks like a mass-market model and very similar in shape to Toyota's non-hybrid Yaris—it's actually a unique, hybrid-only body style. The rather ordinary five-door hatchback layout offers as much space up front as the standard Prius, though less space in back, thanks to more upright seats and the shorter wheelbase. Cargo space with the rear seats in place is enough for a load of groceries, while the seatbacks can fold forward to expand the available room for stuff—it makes an excellent car for two people, with tolerable space for three or four in a pinch. Toyota managed to locate both the gas tank and the battery pack under the rear seat, meaning that unlike the Insight, the Prius C has a full-depth load deck.</p>, <p>From the driver's seat, the instrument-panel layout borrows some minor controls from the Yaris, but shares the central gauges and readouts of the rest of the Prius lineup. There's a fair amount of interior noise, and the trims and materials are clearly a step down in quality compared to the Prius, but that's to be expected given the bargain price.</p>, <p>Because the C is smaller than its Prius kin, it can make do with a similarly downsized powertrain. The 1.5-liter 4-cylinder makes just 73 horsepower. It's paired to a small electric motor in the same arrangement as the other Prius models, and uses a 0.9-kwh battery pack. The layout and function of the system are the same as in Toyota's other hybrids, although the Prius C uses a more traditional gear selector in place of the blue nub found in its brethren.</p>, <p>While it ends up at the 50-mpg EPA combined mileage rating that's close to the larger Prius liftback, the details follow a different path. We've seen a bit lower in real-world drives, but found that it's considerably more nimble and maneuverable than any other Prius—although hardly sporty. We've found the best way to keep up with traffic is to work the little Prius hard, which didn't seem to negatively affect gas mileage very much.</p>, <p>For less than $20,000, you'll make some trade-offs to get the sophisticated hybrid powertrain. Just four trim levels are offered (Prius C One, Prius C Two, Prius C Three, and Prius C Four), though even the least pricey Prius One model includes automatic climate control, power accessories, keyless entry, and USB/iPod connectivity. A navigation system and Toyota's infotainment system come in the Prius C Three, while Prius C Four models get heated seats, alloy wheels, and fog lamps.</p>, <p>The Prius C doesn't fare as well as some other models in safety testing. It receives four out of five stars in the NHTSA's evaluation, with some warnings that aren't taken into account in the ratings. In the IIHS's testing, it receives top "Good" scores in all but the new small front overlap test where it scored an "Acceptable" rating.</p>, <p>Styling was refreshed front and rear in 2015, with a new, more aggressive look echoing that of Toyota's other redesigned offerings. Equipment was shuffled somewhat, and a new set of bold colors was added in addition to the tamer options.For 2016, Toyota's suite of active safety systems was added to some models, and a Prius C Persona Series limited-edition model was added, but Toyota left the chart-topping fuel economy unchanged.</p>, <p>Toyota expanded the active safety suite to all models in 2017 and revised the front and rear bumpers, as well as the side rocker panels, for a new look to the Prius C. In 2018, its seventh year in production, it received some minor styling tweaks and a rearview camera as standard in every model.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/toyota_mirai
[<p>The Toyota Mirai is a four-seat sedan powered by one of the first fuel-cell drivetrains offered for sale or lease in the U.S. New for the 2016 model year, the Mirai is the first fuel-cell car planned for mass-market production anywhere in the world. Changes in its second and third years have been minimal, most notably a lower monthly lease payment.</p>, <p>The Mirai is a low-volume car for Toyota, which sells as many Camrys in three days as it does Mirais over a whole year. But Toyota firmly believes that fuel cells, not batteries, are what will power the zero-emission vehicles of the future. In Japanese, "mirai" means "future." Just as it did with the hybrid powertrain in the very first Prius two decades ago, Toyota has placed a very large bet on commercializing fuel-cell technology.</p>, <p>Only the Honda Clarity Fuel Cell and Mirai offer a hydrogen powertrain in any significant capacity. Hyundai is expected to unveil a future fuel-cell powered crossover utility vehicle sometime during 2018.</p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our</em> <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/toyota_mirai_2018" title="2018 Toyota Miari - review"><em>2018 Toyota Mirai review</em></a></strong></p>, <p>Visually, the Mirai is something of a shock, with styling that might best be described as polarizing. It's a fastback sedan with a vestigial trunk, sharp accent lines and creases, a floating hood, and enormous gaping openings at the front to cool the various components of the powertrain. Frankly, its dissonant lines and shapes may make it the ugliest car sold in the U.S. today.</p>, <p>The Mirai's interior design looks rather like an updated Prius, with three display screens that say "Futuristic!", but work well once you learn the car's quirks. Front and rear seats are comfortable enough, but it has only four seating positions—to keep the weight of a fifth passenger from reducing its range. That rating, by the way, is 312 miles, which is only topped by the newly extended range of the Tesla Model S as the second-highest range for a zero emissions vehicle.</p>, <p>The biggest selling point of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles is that they can be refueled to provide 300 miles of range in less than 10 minutes. Even a Tesla Supercharger DC fast-charging station takes 20 to 30 minutes to provide an 80-percent recharge, for perhaps 200 miles; DC fast-charging sites for lower-range electric cars provide fewer miles in the same time.</p>, <p>That sounds appealing, but it's important to remember that today's lack of hydrogen fueling stations means that Mirais will effectively be limited to a 150-mile radius from those stations. California is spending $100 million over five years to build 100 hydrogen stations by 2020; meanwhile, the Mirai will only be offered to certain Northern and Southern California residents in specific areas near the operating sites. Toyota provides three years' worth of unlimited hydrogen for free as part of the car's price of $57,500. Toyota says nine of 10 Mirai buyers are expected to lease rather than buy, at a monthly rate of $499 (with a $3,649 down payment).</p>, <p>The Mirai's groundbreaking powertrain consists of a 114-kilowatt (153-horsepower) fuel-cell stack located under the front seats. Its output of electricity is sent to an electric motor of similar power that drives its front wheels. Additional boost under acceleration is also provided by the 1.6-kwh lithium-ion battery pack, which essentially buffers the power demand to keep the fuel cell operating at a more steady output level.</p>, <p>Hydrogen is supplied from two high-pressure tanks mounted crosswise between the rear wheels, under the load deck and the rear seat. They hold about 5 kg of hydrogen compressed to 10,000 psi. Toyota suggests refueling a Mirai can take as little as three minutes, but that requires optimal conditions at the very latest fueling station.</p>, <p>The Mirai's efficiency is rated at 67 MPGe, or Miles Per Gallon Equivalent, meaning the distance a Mirai can travel on the amount of hydrogen fuel with the same energy content as one gallon of gasoline. For reference, that's about half the efficiency of the BMW i3, the most energy-efficient electric car sold in the U.S.</p>, <p>On the road, the Mirai behaves just like an electric car up to about 30 mph, with strong, smooth acceleration and only a few subtle extra mechanical noises in the background. Its handling is acceptable, but numb—much like the current generation of Prius. The fuel-cell vehicle is far from a car that invites you to throw it around twisty mountain roads, but it serves as perfectly viable transportation if you're within range of a fueling station. </p>, <p>And that's the car's biggest challenge: The Toyota Mirai will be invisible to the vast majority of U.S. drivers, unless they see it in Toyota marketing. The Honda Clarity Fuel Cell is essentially the same, though we view it as a more convincing and better example of hydrogen fuel-cell technology. But all of those will be restricted to certain areas of California until the fueling infrastructure arrives to support longer trips. As of January 2018, that state has about three dozen hydrogen fueling stations. Meanwhile, the U.S. will likely pass 1 million plug-in electric cars on the road during 2018.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volkswagen_atlas
[<p>The Volkswagen Atlas is the German automaker's long-awaited three-row crossover SUV.</p>, <p>It went on sale in spring 2017 and was VW's second model designed for and built in the United States. It's a much-needed model for VW's showrooms, which, with the exception of the short-lived and ill-conceived Routan (which was merely a Dodge Grand Caravan with different badges) have not had a three-row vehicle since the classic Vanagon. </p>, <p>With the Atlas, Volkswagen has a long-awaited offering to compete against the likes of the Dodge Durango, Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and others. It's without its original ace in the hole: it's clear that the SUV was developed with a diesel powertrain in mind.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018">2018 Volkswagen Atlas review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The Atlas is assembled in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alongside the company's Passat four-door sedan lineup. Like the Passat, the U.S. is its main market; the Atlas is not expected to be sold in VW's home market of Europe, although a slightly revised version called the Teramont will be built in China for that market. </p>, <p>VW isn't shy about the fact that the American Atlas was intended to be offered with a turbodiesel engine. However, the company's diesel emissions scandal killed that powertrain, leaving a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder and a 3.6-liter V-6, both of which run on gasoline—not diesel. Curiously, the 4-cylinder will be offered only with front-wheel drive and <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/1110167_2018-vw-atlas-wont-be-easy-to-find-as-a-4-cylinder">will be available in limited trims at dealerships</a>. The V-6 will be available with either front- or all-wheel drive. </p>, <p>However, VW appears to have gotten the rest of the recipe just right. The Atlas is among the larger vehicles in its class, which means it's sized about like the Ford Explorer and is a little bigger than the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander. At just shy of 200 inches from head to toe, it comes in less than 6 inches shorter than a Chevrolet Tahoe. However, the Atlas' unibody construction reaps numerous benefits in terms of interior space compared to the Tahoe and its truck-based ilk.  </p>, <p>The Atlas comes standard with three rows of seats and room for eight passengers. Crucially, its second row can slide forward for access to the third row with a child seat in place—something only a few rivals can say.</p>, <p>Despite its butch looks, which have more than a little in common with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Atlas isn't really designed for off-road use. It's the largest vehicle on VW's new modular architecture, which underpins much of its lineup from the compact Golf hatchback all the way up to the company's second-generation Tiguan.</p>, <p>It's the Tiguan that will vie for showroom traffic with the Atlas. While the first Tiguan was a five-seater with dimensions closer to the Honda CR-V, its follow-up will be sold here with an available third row of seats. It'll definitely be smaller than the Atlas, and VW hopes that two-prong three-row approach will help make up for the fact that it has largely been closed for business to families who want more than five seatbelts. </p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volkswagen_tiguan
[<p>The Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact crossover SUV that has been redesigned for the 2018 model year. </p>, <p>Unlike its decidedly small predecessor, the 2018 Tiguan straddles the line between traditional compact crossovers like the Honda CR-V and Hyundai Tucson and those on the larger end like the Chevrolet Equinox and Nissan Rogue. The Tiguan, like the Rogue, offers a third row of seats—although these are best considered "occasional use" for anyone other than very small children. </p>, <p>With the Tiguan, Volkswagen has a crossover that should appeal to more U.S. buyers than its last offering.</p>, <p><strong style="font-style: italic;">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_tiguan_2018" title="2017 Volkswagen Tiguan - review">2018 Volkswagen Tiguan review</a></strong></p>, <p>With the introduction of the larger Volkswagen Atlas, the German automaker now has a much better grip on crossover wants and desires in the United States. By contrast, the outgoing Tiguan was designed primarily for European buyers who placed a larger emphasis on small dimensions and a sporty ride. </p>, <p>The new Tiguan is nearly 11 inches longer than its predecessor, with much of that space going toward cargo. Front-wheel-drive models come standard with a third row of seats for 2018, while all-wheel-drive variants make that extra capacity optional. All models make use of a 2.0-liter turbo-4 engine rated at 184 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque. An 8-speed automatic is the only gearbox on offer. All-wheel-drive variants include on- and off-road driving modes for their traction control system.</p>, <p>Inside, the larger Tiguan has a premium tone thanks to upscale trim panels, a shapely dashboard design, and high-tech options. Its optional infotainment system sits high on its dashboard, which almost looks as if it was plucked from the company's Golf line of hatchbacks. That infotainment screen boasts Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and even MirrorLink compatibility. </p>, <p>The automaker's innovative post-collision braking system is standard; it holds the crossover's brakes after it detects an impact to prevent it from rolling into another vehicle. Full automatic emergency braking is optional. </p>, <p><strong>Volkswagen Tiguan history</strong></p>, <p>The Tiguan put a tall-wagon body on Golf-based mechanicals for a compact crossover slotted below the larger Touareg in VW's U.S. lineup. It could be had with all-wheel drive, which makes it an all-purpose 'ute delivering moderate off-road ability and all-weather traction. It drove well, but VW's lack of investment in the Tiguan over the first generation's abnormally long run made it feel quite outdated by the mid-2010s. </p>, <p>Inside, the Tiguan took a people-first approach to packaging, making it a comfortable around-town car that fits right into urban environments while also providing highway comfort. The design was relatively staid, but both rows of seats were very comfortable, with enough room in the rear for kids three wide or a pair of adults. The front seats especially were supportive, offering good visibility form the driver's seat, while the materials felt solid and expensive with a well-built feeling running throughout. There was decent cargo space in the rear, with folding rear seats that allow for hauling of larger items when no one's in the back. Several additional stash spots included twin glove boxes and a storage compartment that's hidden under the cargo load floor.</p>, <p>Though its smoothed-over yet upright sheet metal took after Volkswagen's Touareg SUV, the two were decidedly different in real-world performance. With suspension and steering tuned for the road rather than the rocky trail, and much lower weight, the Tiguan felt a bit like a soft-riding small car on stilts. Overall length was about the same as a subcompact sedan's, making the Tiguan the right size for the city and allowing it to fit easily in compact-only spots. The 200-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine provided enough pep to scoot energetically into gaps in traffic yet cruise in a relaxed manner on the highway. In front-wheel-drive versions you had a choice of a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on model year, but with the available 4Motion all-wheel-drive system they were all automatics. Fuel economy ratings were as good as 21 mpg city, 26 highway, 23 combined.</p>, <p>The standard equipment list was lengthy, but safety fell behind the competition as the Tiguan received mediocre marks from both the NHTSA and the IIHS toward the end of its model run, the Tiguan also lacked many of the active safety features that filtered down to the compact crossover class.</p>, <p>For 2010, Volkswagen offered a value-oriented Wolfsburg edition of the Tiguan. In the 2012 model year, the crossover's styling was updated with a slimmer front end and new taillights, and improved drivetrain efficiency helped boost gas mileage as high as 22 mpg city, 27 highway. The <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_tiguan_2013">2013 VW Tiguan</a> had a few other minor feature changes, most notably, the premium Dynaudio sound system and high-end navigation system were removed from the options list.</p>, <p>A <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081605_2014-volkswagen-tiguan-r-line-detroit-auto-show-preview">Tiguan R-Line version</a> was introduced for 2014, offering a long list of appearance upgrades, including unique trim and a flat-bottom steering wheel, plus a sport tuned suspension, bi-xenon headlights, and LED daytime running lights. For 2015, all Tiguan models were given roof-rack rails as standard equipment.</p>, <p>The 2016 Tiguan added equipment to most models, and the model lineup was shuffled to make the sportier R-Line model more attainable. It was shuffled again in 2017, and for the little crossover's final year, the model lineup consisted of S, Sport, Wolfsburg Edition, and SEL models, all with front- or all-wheel drive. All models also have upgraded infotainment systems with larger touchscreen displays and, finally, a USB port.</p>, <p>For 2017, the Tiguan saw a hefty shakeup of its trim levels, but was functionally identical to the previous model.</p>]

[<p>For buyers comfortable with an all-electric car that utterly blends into the background, the Volkswagen e-Golf is the perfect choice—if their local VW dealer carries and services it. Volkswagen has limited the rollout of the VW e-Golf by starting on the West Coast and in Northeast states, meaning it is not available at every dealership.</p>, <p>With the e-Golf, Volkswagen has a fully electric car on sale in the U.S. to compete with others in the growing class. From the outside, bystanders would be challenged to identify Volkswagen's e-Golf as an electric car on looks alone.</p>, <p>An update to the e-Golf is expected for the 2018 model year, when the battery capacity is likely to increase to provide a range of 100 miles or more, keeping Volkswagen's only electric car competitive with the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3, among others.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_e-golf_2017">2017 Volkswagen e-Golf review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>Otherwise, the Volkswagen e-Golf is largely indistinguishable from its gasoline brethren. Aside from slight trim and styling differences, unique wheels and tires, and some badges, there's very little to distinguish it as an electric car to onlookers. Except, of course, the utter lack of noise from a combustion engine.</p>, <p>From the outside, the VW e-Golf is—well, it's a Golf. In its seventh generation, the Golf a conservatively styled, crisp-edged five-door hatchback clearly descended from the first Golf/Rabbit to hit U.S. shores more than four decades ago. The e-Golf interior is virtually identical to that of any other current Golf. Exterior differentiation includes different taillight detailing, more-aerodynamic wheel designs, and different grille inserts with smaller actual openings for air to pass through.</p>, <p>The powertrain and technical specs of the Volkswagen e-Golf almost echo those of the market-leading Nissan Leaf. Both use air-cooled lithium-ion battery packs of about 24 kwh to power electric motors that drive the front wheels. The e-Golf's 85-kw (114-horsepower) electric motor is just fractionally more powerful than the Leaf's 80-kw (110-hp) motor. The e-Golf can charge at up to 7.2 kw, meaning it finishes recharging a little quicker than the Leaf, which has a 6.6-kw charger.</p>, <p>The e-Golf and Leaf are also both five-seat, five-door hatchbacks with similar interior volumes—91 cubic feet for the e-Golf against 92 for the Leaf. Only in cargo volume does the e-Golf fall short; its 17 cubic feet are adequate but less than the Leaf's, possibly a result of compromises made to accommodate other powertrains (and perhaps fuel tanks) in the conventional versions of the Golf. </p>, <p>On the road, the e-Golf is clearly heavier than the other Golfs, but it retains the somewhat sporty feel and predictable roadholding of its siblings. Volkswagen estimates that the 2017 e-Golf's range is 124 miles (up from 84 miles when it was first launched), and it returns 116 MPGe in the EPA's testing—among the top tier of electric vehicles. (Miles per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, is a measure of how far a car can travel on the same amount of electrical energy as contained in one gallon of gasoline.)</p>, <p>While the first model year of e-Golfs were all the top trim, there are now two trim levels: the SE is the base model starts right around $30,000, while the more luxurious SEL Premium model adds almost $6,000 to that.</p>, <p>Other all-electric five-door compact hatchbacks that compete with the VW e-Golf—besides the Nissan Leaf, that is—include the BMW i3, the Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive, Chevrolet Bolt EV, and the low-volume Ford Focus Electric, which also has limited availability. </p>, <p>A second, and less expensive, trim level was added for 2016, and it continued unchanged for 2017.</p>]

[<p>The Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan that has been sold in the U.S. market since the 1980s. In other parts of the world, it's been dubbed the Bora.</p>, <p>A redesigned Jetta is on the way for 2019, and while its styling isn't dramatic, its underpinnings are a big step forward.</p>, <p>In the past, the Jetta lineup has also included a two-door and a wagon. After a hiatus in 2015, the wagon, dubbed "SportWagen," was brought under the Golf nameplate for the 2016 model year.</p>, <p>With the Jetta, VW has a rival for vehicles such as the Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze, Toyota Corolla, and Subaru Impreza. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_jetta_2019">2019 Volkswagen Jetta review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Volkswagen Jetta</strong></p>, <p>With the same underpinnings as the VW Golf, the redesigned 2019 VW Jetta promises better handling, a quieter ride, and far more available safety features. It's not dramatically different in the looks department, but the new Jetta has some upscale touches inside and out. Its roofline is longer and slopes gently into  a shorter decklid, while more chrome touches dress it up a bit.</p>, <p>Inside, the Jetta's dash is edgy and less symmetrical than before. All models get touchscreen infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, while higher-specification trim levels will be available with a "digital cockpit" that replaces the conventional gauge cluster with a wide, configurable LCD screen. That's a compact car-segment first, and it's paired with other premium features not offered in the outgoing Jetta like leather upholstery and cooled front seats.</p>, <p>That equipment speaks to the automaker's upmarket aspirations for the latest generation of VW's compact four-door. Underneath, it uses VW's so-called MQB architecture, a scalable platform that underpins small cars sold elsewhere all the way up to the full-size VW Atlas SUV. In the Jetta, the setup is paired at least initially to a 1.4-liter turbo-4 rated at 147 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. A 6-speed manual is standard, but an 8-speed automatic will undoubtedly be more popular with consumers. The Jetta is front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Additional versions with more power—and maybe even an electrified gas engine—are likely to follow. Don't look for a turbodiesel or a fully electric version, however. After VW's diesel debacle, the automaker is sticking to gas engines. And its own MEB platform will soon spawn a lineup of fully electric cars.</p>, <p>The MQB platform with its longer wheelbase opens up more interior room, while a dashboard pushed forward gives the illusion of additional space.</p>, <p><strong>Volkswagen Jetta history</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>, <p>For nearly 40 years now, the Volkswagen Jetta has offered a classic sedan design and sporty German road manners and driving feel. These days, about the oldest models on used-car lots will be the third-generation cars that were launched in 1993. Smaller than today's Jetta sedan, they performed well and were a step up in refinement from earlier generations. The base engine (which amazingly is still in use today) was a 115-hp, 2.0-liter inline-4, but engines ranged all the way up to a 174-hp, 2.8-liter narrow-angle V-6 in the special VR6 models, which provided 0-60 mph times of less than seven seconds and authentic sport-sedan credentials.</p>, <p>The fourth-generation Jetta, which appeared in 1999, shared underpinnings with both the Golf and the newly-launched New Beetle. A new 1.8T engine, the 1.8-liter turbo-4—originally rated at 150 hp, later upgraded to 180 hp—was more fun to drive than the base 2.0-liter inline-4 and got better real-world gas mileage to boot. The VR6 engine remained on the books, with power increased to 200 hp, but the 1.8T was a better bet, cheaper, less complex, and more popular. The 1999 car and its descendants were the first ones that really cemented the Jetta's reputation for first-class interior materials that outshone any other compact car. Some models of the fourth-generation Jetta suffer from reliability problems, though, so do your research carefully.</p>, <p>The fifth-generation Jetta arrived for 2006, a larger car overall with staid styling that was a German hallmark at the time. The cabin was again a home for high-quality craftsmanship and materials, and the size increase also allowed for a real adult-sized rear seat. A 150-hp, 2.5-liter 5-cylinder became the base engine, providing more output but making little impact on performance or fuel economy, partly because it weighed more than the 2.0-liter. The inline-5 was helped by the 6-speed auto, with a comfortable freeway cruising attitude. Other changes to this generation also improved ride quality and overall refinement.</p>, <p>Jetta wagons were offered in the fourth generation—from 2001 through 2005—and then re-introduced for 2009 onward. The wagon was a big seller when fitted with the TDI turbodiesel, which delivered a combined EPA fuel-efficiency rating above 30 mpg—owners often found that <a href="//www.greencarreports.com/news/1019256_volkswagen-jetta-tdi-much-more-mileage-than-epa-admits" title="Volkswagen Jetta TDI: Much More Mileage Than EPA Admits?">real-world mileage was considerably higher</a>.</p>, <p>The TDI was also available on the Jetta sedan as one of several engine options. Through 2006, the TDI was a 1.9-liter unit, and then it went on hiatus until 2009, when a new, 140-hp 2.0-liter TDI diesel returned to the lineup in both body styles. Its transmissions included a 6-speed manual and VW's superb 6-speed automated manual transmission.</p>, <p>For 2011, Volkswagen replaced the Jetta sedan it had sold since 2006 with a new sixth-generation design—but carried over the smaller German-built SportWagen through the 2014 model year. The new Jetta sedan was lengthened for U.S. customers who demanded greater rear-seat space, and the underpowered base 2.0-liter inline-4 made a return. So did the torsion-beam rear axle from the 1980s and 1990s, letting VW offer a significantly cheaper base price on the simplest Jetta model—a car that very, very few buyers took home.</p>, <p>The current generation of Jetta initially drew criticism for its hard-plastic interior and the painfully slow performance delivered by the base engine, though the GLI model that returned to the fold in 2012 solved both of those problems with its punchy 200-hp turbo-4 and a soft-plastic dash cap (for considerably more money). The nicer plastics and an independent suspension returned to most Jettas by the 2013 model year.</p>, <p>For 2013, VW added a new model, the Jetta Hybrid, which brought a fifth engine (a 1.4-liter inline-4), a fourth transmission, and a new high-end model into the range. Its buyer research indicated that diesel buyers and hybrid shoppers were entirely different sets of people, who proved remarkably resistant to the idea of cross-shopping the other car. The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1071433_2013-volkswagen-jetta-hybrid-promises-45-mpg-combined">Jetta Hybrid sedan</a> returned an EPA combined gas-mileage rating around 45 mpg, just 10 percent shy of the Toyota Prius—and it's considerably more fun to drive.</p>, <p>The sporty Jetta GLI model is fitted with a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that puts out 210 hp, along with the DSG plus a sportier suspension and upgrades to the tires, wheels, and interior trim. No Jetta has been offered with all-wheel drive—it's strictly a front-drive compact sedan.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Jetta received another round of updates, including a new TDI turbodiesel engine with even higher fuel economy and a slight power boost. The car's revised front end is cleaner, and LED daytime running lights were available. Inside, the Jetta got a new steering wheel design, plus reorganized climate and audio controls. Most of the "two-point-slow" models were dropped and a 1.8-liter turbo-4 took its place.</p>, <p>The last turbodiesel engine had an EPA estimated highway rating of 45 mpg, which nearly closes the gap between diesel- and hybrid-powertrain Jetta models. It’s also 3 miles per gallon better than the prior TDI version on the EPA's highway cycle.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>Safety was a big focus of the mid-cycle refresh. Because of ever-evolving crash-test procedures, cars like the Jetta are receiving structural reinforcements to improve their standing. Those updates have already earned the 2015 Jetta the coveted Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS as well as five stars overall from the NHTSA. The 2015 model also receives some new safety options, such as blind-spot monitoring, a forward-collision warning system, and adaptive headlights that aim where you're steering.</p>, <p>For the 2016 model year, the Jetta finally lost its base 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, in favor of a stronger and completely modern 1.4-liter turbo-4. Power is up from 115 to 150 horsepower, and the new engine was used for most models. The 1.4T engine comes with six trim levels spanning S. SE, and SEL. There's also a 1.8T Sport model, a Jetta GLI 2.0T high-end performance version, and the Jetta Hybrid as well.</p>, <p>In 2017, the slow-selling hybrid was dumped and the model line streamlined. For 2018, the Jetta lineup gained new wheel and grille designs on most trim levels, a Wolfsburg Edition package joined the lineup, and the Jetta GLI lost its manual transmission.</p>]

[<p>The Volkswagen Golf is the automaker's compact car. It's the brand's global bestseller, and has been for 40 years. While the Jetta has become more specialized for American tastes, the Golf retains a more European flair.</p>, <p>With the Golf, Volkswagen offers three- or five-door hatchbacks, or a wagon body style. The range is powered mostly by a turbo-4, however an electric version is available in the e-Golf guise.</p>, <p>Competition for the Golf comes from several sporty hatches such as the Mazda 3, Kia Forte, Hyundai Elantra GT and the all-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza. </p>, <p>The big news for 2018 is a new suite of tech features including a digital gauge and infotainment system. The electric e-Golf is <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_e-golf_2017">covered separately</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_golf_2018" target="_blank" title="2015 Volkswagen Golf - review">2018 Volkswagen Golf review</a></em></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new VW Golf</strong></p>, <p>For the 2015 model year, Volkswagen launched a new seventh generation of the Golf in the U.S., trailing the start of European sales by about a year. Golfs sold in North America are now built at a factory in Mexico, just as the Jetta has been for a decade or more. The latest Golf is lighter, more spacious inside, and sports a new range of powertrains as well as many more electronic safety features.</p>, <p>The newest Golf is offered with a 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.8-liter inline-4 and a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 210 hp (or 220 hp when optionally equipped). The old inline-5 is now long gone, replaced by that efficient new 1.8-liter in the base model. A new Golf R makes 292 hp from a 2.0-liter inline-4 hitched to all-wheel drive, similar to the setup in Audi's S3; the Golf R arrived mid-way through the 2015 model year. VW offers an all-electric e-Golf in select markets here and in limited numbers, as well.</p>, <p>The 2015 Golf included more electronic safety systems, a wider array of standard and optional equipment, and better soundproofing and noise suppression, while retaining most of the sporty driving characteristics that peg it as German. And its lines instantly identify it as a Golf, marching to the same drumbeat as its six earlier generations.</p>, <p>The Golf line now also absorbs the wagon formerly known as Jetta SportWagen, rechristened the Golf SportWagen and based on the latest underpinnings. It went on sale here for 2015, bringing with it the well-liked TDI diesel version as well as the new 1.8T gas engine. VW expects the wagon to outsell the Golf hatchback, in part due to the longer version's ability to go up against Subaru with four driven wheels. Now that the new wagon models have come online, VW has the most fleshed-out Golf lineup it has ever sold here, including electric, and gasoline powertrains as well as three different body styles—the new wagon in addition to the three-door and five-door hatchbacks.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>For 2017, Volkswagen added an all-wheel-drive version of its SportWagen, dubbed Alltrack. It couples the 1.8-liter turbo-4 with a Haldex all-wheel-drive system that can send up to 50 percent of torque to its rear wheels.</p>, <p><strong>Volkswagen Golf history</strong></p>, <p>Launched in 1974, the model we now call Golf was sold in the U.S. as the Rabbit in its first (and again in its fifth) generation and has spawned a variety of models, including a low-volume three-door hatchback, two generations of Cabrio convertibles, the quintessential hot-hatch GTI variant, and even limited-edition and very powerful all-wheel-drive Golf R models.</p>, <p>When the Golf was introduced back in the mid-'70s, it was seen as groundbreaking, especially for Volkswagen, as it offered an efficient water-cooled engine driving the front wheels. U.S. models were originally called Rabbit, and some were built here. The Rabbit was intended to replace the aging rear-engine Beetle, although that car lived on for several more years before leaving this market.</p>, <p>Fast-forwarding through Golf history, the third-generation Volkswagen Golf, which ran from 1993 until 1999 is likely the oldest you'll currently find on used-car lots. They're known for being a little more smooth, safe, and refined than Golf models from the 1980s, but at the same time a little less nimble and tossable. Most of these Golfs came with a 115-hp, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that was quite perky with the manual transmission, but not so happy with the optional automatic. The Golf GTI performance model was a genuine hot-hatch, packing VW's 2.8-liter narrow-angle 6-cylinder VR6 engine under the hood; it put out 172 hp and made the Golf faster than almost any other affordable small car of the time.</p>, <p>For 1999, new fourth-generation Golf models began reaching U.S. dealerships. This model was completely new, with a more solid, grown-up feel than its predecessor, though the powertrains carried through largely unchanged at first. The same 115-hp inline-4 felt a little overwhelmed with a full load and didn't return great fuel economy, but models with the two other engines—either the 150-hp, 1.8-liter 1.8T or the 90-hp (or 100-hp) 1.9-liter turbodiesel inline-4—were both faster and more fuel-efficient. Those upgrading from other small-car models would notice that the Golf felt like a more expensive vehicle from the inside, with a firm but supple ride and a nice, fashionable interior. Despite the upscale trappings, these Golfs earned a reputation for reliability issues and especially electrical problems.</p>, <p>In 2006, the Golf was redesigned, with it this time getting a standard 2.5-liter inline-5 engine that, while stronger and torquier, was not very impressive in the fuel-economy department. This Golf continued the model's trajectory toward solidity and safety but had improved handling over the previous model, and a new sporty GTI model stood alone in offering a 200-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbo-4. For 2006, Volkswagen renamed its hatchback the Rabbit for the U.S. market, but that change only lasted through 2009. For 2008, VW brought the Golf-based R32 extra-hot-hatch to the U.S., powered by a 3.2-liter V-6 engine backed by all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Volkswagen again redesigned the Golf for 2010. While certainly not a radical redesign visually, that sixth-generation model included a host of improvements, especially to the interior, overall refinement, and ride comfort—as well as improved feel from the electric power steering. Engines included a base 2.5-liter 5-cylinder and the 2.0-liter turbodiesel, which was our pick in the model line. VW's small diesel accelerated nearly as quickly as the base engine but was rated at 30 mpg city, 42 highway for fuel efficiency. Both the TDI as well as the sporty new GTI (again powered by the 2.0T engine, and covered separately) used VW's excellent DSG automated manual gearbox.</p>, <p>In 2012, an uber-powerful Golf R model, with all-wheel drive, appealed again to serious enthusiasts. An optional navigation system appeared on the Golf for the first time, with hard-drive music storage, USB connectivity, and an SD memory slot.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volkswagen_passat
[<p>The VW Passat is one of the larger entries in a segment including the Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, and Toyota Camry. Though a Passat wagon has been available in the past, VW does not currently offer one in the States.</p>, <p>The U.S.-spec, mid-size Volkswagen Passat sedan is built in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and is a completely different vehicle than the European version, which is built in Germany.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Passat swaps in a new, but not much more powerful, turbo-4 base engine and adds a sporty Passat GT variant.</p>, <p><em style="font-weight: bold;">MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_passat_2018">2018 VW Passat review</a></em></p>, <p><strong>The new VW Passat</strong></p>, <p>In mid-2011, a new 2012 Volkswagen Passat was unveiled, designed specifically for our market and unique from the model offered in Europe. With a somewhat larger body, the Americanized made-in-the-U.S. Passat gets a massive rear seat, while some cost cutting has led to a slight downgrade in refinement. But with a lower base price of around $25,000, we've found the new Passat to be particularly attractive. The Passat also has impressive handling and a very comfortable ride.</p>, <p>At launch, the base Passat came with an inline-5 that was dull and not as responsive as base engines in rivals like the Ford Fusion or Hyundai Sonata. A new 170-hp, 1.8-liter turbo-4 was introduced in 2014, and for 2015 it became the Passat's base engine when the inline-5 finally was dropped.</p>, <p>Other launch powertrains included the turbodiesel version, which had good power and exceptional fuel economy, as well as a V-6 that is geared to the few buyers who really want more luxury features in a family sedan. We had a 2012 Volkswagen Passat TDI for an extended <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/2012-volkswagen-passat-six-month-road-test">Six-Month Road Test</a> and found it to be an excellent long-distance cruiser—one with real-world highway mileage well into the 40s.</p>, <p>Aside from some powertrain and options shuffling, the Passat has changed very little over the past several model years. In the current Passat, those coming from former versions of this sedan (or even Honda Accords) may not like the swaths of grainy plastic, and there's more wind and road noise than one might expect. Another change is the very limited number of build combinations. For instance, you couldn't get a cloth interior with the TDI engine or VR6, and most models have synthetic leather rather than real leather trim. A USB port was also lacking until 2016. VW made a rearview camera system available beginning in 2013, and on the 2014 Passat, a Technology Package became more widely available and permits adding the backup camera and touchscreen audio at an affordable price. </p>, <p>In the 2015 model year, VW swapped out the former turbodiesel for a new design that was slightly more efficient in the EPA's highway cycle. The gas 2.5-liter inline-5 is now completely gone from the lineup, replaced in all entry-level cars with the much more modern 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>In 2016, Volkswagen updated the Passat's exterior with new front and rear bumpers and a new grille. Its latest infotainment system was plugged into the dashboard, and supports smartphones with Apple's CarPlay and Android Auto. Active safety features such as forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind spot monitors were added to many trims. In 2017, Volkswagen carried over the Passat largely unchanged. For 2018, the 1.8-liter engine was scrapped in favor of a 2.0-liter turbo-4. Although not much more powerful than the 1.8, the 2.0 delivers better fuel economy. Also, more trim levels gained active safety tech for 2018.</p>, <p>A new Passat has been unveiled for Europe, but our version is mostly unrelated and likely will live on for another year or two before another Americanized Passat appears.</p>, <p><strong>Volkswagen Passat history</strong></p>, <p>In the U.S., the Passat's lineage goes all the way back to the Dasher sedans and hatchbacks of the 1970s and the Quantum models of the 1980s—the latter of which were, notably, offered with VW's Syncro all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>While the Passat name had been used elsewhere on those models, it wasn't until the third generation that the U.S.-market version also adopted the same badge. That model's unique front-end styling did without a conventional grille opening, and the rest of the design was characterized by lots of glass and a low hood; the interior made good use of space for passengers, thanks to the tallish proportions. Though the interior quality didn't surpass that of the less-expensive Jetta, the Passat had a comfortable ride, in part thanks to its longer wheelbase. At the beginning of this generation, only low-power 2.0-liter 4-cylinders were available, but VW added its narrow-angle VR6 and diesel options later in the cycle.</p>, <p>The next complete redesign the Passat got, in 1998, was revolutionary. VW switched its mid-size sedan to the same platform as the Audi A4, and everything from its ride to its driving manners felt much more upscale and sophisticated—either compared to the previous Passat or to U.S. rivals like the Camry, Accord, and Taurus. Most Passat models from this era included either a 170-hp, 1.8-liter (1.8T) turbo 4-cylinder or a 190-hp Audi-derived V-6. Between these two engines, there's surprisingly little difference in acceleration, though the smoother V-6 makes it feel more like a luxury car. A short-lived Passat W8 model (2003-2004) featured a special 270-hp, narrow-angle eight-cylinder engine, but its $40,000 price tag, heft, and thirst just didn't add up to much appeal. Throughout this generation, all-wheel drive was available on most of the model line.</p>, <p>For 2006, the Passat changed for the better for Americans, becoming a little roomier and more comfortable, though they bypassed some of the sportier driving feel of their predecessors for refinement and more features for the money. Most of these Passats, which weren't significantly changed through 2010, came with an excellent 200-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission (though a 6-speed manual was also on offer). A 280-hp, 3.6-liter VR6 engine was offered from 2006-2008, and was required for all-wheel drive, but it was never a popular choice because it was so much more expensive.</p>, <p>Across the board, this generation of Passat came with a long list of standard features, including standard side-curtain bags, with rear thorax bags an unusual option. We found this Passat to be one of the quietest cars in this class, with a roomy backseat and nice interior materials. But a requirement for premium fuel might make these models less appealing as used cars.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volkswagen_touareg
[<p>Volkswagen's Touareg crossover SUV fills an unusual spot in its segment: it's priced and outfitted almost like a luxury brand, but its Volkswagen badge doesn't have the cachet of, say, Mercedes-Benz. </p>, <p>With a nameplate that debuted more than a decade ago, the Touareg was redesigned for the 2011 model year and then updated again in 2015. It carries on into 2017 with only a few minor changes, most notably a new Wolfsburg Edition trim level and expanded availability of some essential safety tech.</p>, <p>Just where the Touareg goes from here is a question. VW has said that it will continue to develop the model for global markets—like Europe, where it sells relatively well—but that the American market will receive a new three-row utility vehicle built in Tennessee—the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018">Volkswagen Atlas</a>. Whether the Touareg fits in here long-term remains up for debate. </p>, <p>Volkswagen only sells gasoline-powered versions of the Touareg. A hybrid model was briefly available, and the automaker's diesel engine has been pulled after VW admitted that it illegally cheated emissions tests. Volkswagen says it is working toward a fix for affected cars.</p>, <p>The Touareg sits atop VW's crossover lineup, competing with the likes of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, and BMW X5. </p>, <p><strong><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_touareg_2017">2017 Volkswagen Touareg review</a></strong></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The latest VW Touareg</strong></p>, <p>A completely redesigned Touareg, along with a new Touareg Hybrid model, arrived for the 2011 model year. It offered a choice of three powertrains, with only one remaining today. The base engine is a 280-horsepower V-6 and buyers could opt for a high mpg turbodiesel V-6 or hybrid V-6. The diesel was dropped after the automaker's emissions scandal, while the hybrid was phased out in response to limited consumer demand.</p>, <p>Towing capacity with the Touareg is quite impressive, and VW thoroughly improved the basic design over the first generation with better proportions and styling details. The Touareg remains a five-seat SUV, though, while the related Audi Q7 is a three-row crossover. Cargo space is good, too, and though the ride quality is a little firm, the Touareg gives many high-end shoppers a reason to look down in price without moving down in performance.</p>, <p>Features changed very little into 2012 and 2013, with only a few cosmetic differences. The 2013 model year brought new LED taillights for Hybrid models, most notably.</p>, <p>A special <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079640_volkswagen-touareg-edition-x-marks-a-decade-of-production">Touareg X edition</a> was introduced at the 2012 Paris Auto Show. With 19-inch Moab alloy wheels, plus a panoramic sunroof, silver-anodized roof rails, bi-xenon headlamps, darkened taillights, and special logos, this 2013 special edition celebrated the model's tenth anniversary. Then the 2014 Volkswagen Touareg got <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1081599_2014-volkswagen-touareg-v-6-models-get-sporty-r-line-trim">a sportier R-Line variant</a> offering 20-inch alloy wheels, a unique front bumper, side skirts, LED taillights, and oval-shaped dual exhaust tips. Inside, it added aluminum trim, stainless-steel scuff plates, aluminum sport pedals and an R-Line steering wheel.</p>, <p>An updated Touareg arrived for 2015. Exterior changes were subtle, with the most obvious being a more aggressive front fascia and revised lighting elements. Bi-xenon headlights and LED taillights became standard. Cabin materials were upgraded, including the trim and switchgear.</p>, <p>After a 2015 refresh, the 2016 Volkswagen Touareg dropped its Hybrid model and added the automaker's Automatic Post-Collision Braking system that automatically applies the brakes after a crash to help prevent further damage. Regular-grade fuel became acceptable for the gasoline V-6 thanks to a mild retune.</p>, <p>The aim of this most recent update was to move the Touareg upmarket some to make room for the upcoming three-row crossover that's due by the end of 2017. </p>, <p><strong>Volkswagen Touareg history<br/></strong></p>, <p>The first-generation Touareg was introduced in the U.S. for the 2004 model year. This version looked far more like a tall wagon than a truck, but it actually had more trucklike ability than most modern utility vehicles, with rugged off-roading chops and impressive trailer-towing ability. Early models were powered by either a 220-hp, 3.2-liter V-6 (actually VW's narrow-angle VR6 engine) or a 310-hp, 4.2-liter V-8. Later that year—and also for the 2006 model year, but not for 2005—VW made what is still regarded by some to be the king of the Touareg models: a Touareg TDI model, powered by a turbocharged, direct-injection diesel V-10, making 310 hp and a massive 553 pound-feet of torque. It gave the Touareg the ability to tow heavy trailer loads without breaking a sweat.</p>, <p>The V-6 Touareg models were a different story entirely. With just 220 hp to move more than 5,000 pounds—and not a lot of low-range torque—the engine felt overwhelmed and performance was sluggish even though the 6-speed automatic transmission offered Tiptronic manual control and did its best. A new, 276-hp, 3.6-liter version of the VR6, introduced for 2007, was the first V-6 model to prove adequate. The V-8 model wasn't downright fast either, but it accelerated briskly enough and cruised comfortably; that engine was upgraded to 350 hp in 2007.</p>, <p>Overall, first-gen Touareg models had impressive interior appointments, room for five adults, and one of the quietest, more refined rides of any utility vehicle. However, unlike some other vehicles its size, the Touareg didn't (and still doesn't) have a third row of seating. There was also not much cargo space with the back seats up. Sturdy off-road hardware, with help from modern electronics, was part of the package. With an available air suspension, the Touareg offered three different ride heights and was a more-than-able off-road device. It could handle modest rock-scrambling, along with slick, muddy slopes or loose sand. And for all Touareg models, safety was top-notch.</p>, <p>For 2008, Volkswagen renamed the Touareg the Touareg 2, signifying a mild refresh and a revised list of features, including an improved off-road anti-lock braking mode plus new options such as adaptive cruise control and a blind-spot warning system. Truthfully, the Touareg hadn't changed much. In 2009, the Touareg got a more modern, economical V-6 TDI, replacing the big V-10 diesel. While this engine no longer had the semi-like torque output, at 221 hp and 407 pound-feet it was still the best choice for trailer-towing. The V-8 model was dropped for 2010, shortly before the Touareg was fully redesigned.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volkswagen_beetle
[<p>The Volkswagen Beetle is an automotive icon. In older versions, it's one of the biggest selling cars of all time. In newer models, it's a fun two-door that shares similarities with other small cars from VW. The future for the car is anyone's guess.</p>, <p>The Beetle falls into two distinct eras—the Bugs of the pre-1998 era and the completely new Beetles inspired by the original, but based on Golf running gear. The current Volkswagen Beetle carries the 75-year-old iconic nameplate, but little else from its earliest ancestors.</p>, <p>Based on the Volkswagen Golf, the Beetle can be had in coupe or convertible form. Engine options have been pared down in recent years to just a turbo-4 for 2018. </p>, <p>In 2017, Volkswagen offered a #PinkBeetle (yes, hashtag included) and ditched the manual transmission option. For 2018, Volkswagen ditched #PinkBeetle and replaced it with a beach-themed "Coast" trim level and just offered one engine and one transmission option.</p>, <p><strong><em><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_beetle_2018">2018 Volkswagen Beetle review</a></em></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>The new VW Beetle</strong></p>, <p>The current generation VW Beetle carries its engine in the front, powering the front wheels—unlike the original, which used a clattering, but reliable air-cooled flat-4 engine at the rear, driving the rear wheels. Like the New Beetle before it, the underpinnings come from the VW Golf and Jetta models, despite the very different bodywork. Compared to the long-lived New Beetle, the completely revamped 2012-present Beetle adopts a new look that's flatter, a bit more aggressive, and a bit larger than before. Its more muscular stance comes from an additional 3 inches of width.</p>, <p>The VW Beetle today is aimed at specific buyers. It's also more complicated and pricier than the original, meaning it's less about cheap and cheerful transportation than a "lifestyle car" whose owners prize attitude, style, and perhaps even whimsy. It doesn't compete any longer with higher-volume, boxier, more practical, lower-cost alternatives that can be found everywhere. The Beetle competes with a variety of such cars, from the legendary Ford Mustang coupe all the way down to high-design minicompact like the Mini Cooper and Fiat 500. All those competitors, it should be noted, offer both a coupe and a cloth-roofed convertible in their lineups.</p>, <p>The <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1080742_2013-volkswagen-beetle-convertible-live-images-2012-los-angeles-auto-show">Beetle convertible</a> and coupe share the same powertrain options. Its soft top is power-operated and can be opened or closed in less than 10 seconds at speeds up to 31 mph. Upon its release, the full range of engines included a 170-hp 5-cylinder engine, with either a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission powering the front wheels, and a turbocharged 200-hp, 2.0-liter inline-4 with a choice of manual or dual-clutch automatic transmissions available. The 140-hp, 2.0-liter diesel joined the family a few months later, making it the highest efficiency Beetle, rated at up to 41 mpg highway.</p>, <p>Compared to that of the New Beetle it replaced, the current car's interior is decidedly less quirky, if no less well designed. The dash-mounted bud vase is gone, making the car a bit more gender-neutral, and VW has brought back the double-decker glovebox of the original car. All of the controls are well laid out within a pleasing and mildly retro design, and the current car is plenty of fun to bop through traffic in or let loose on a two-lane. The exterior design means it's hard for some to find the ends of the car, but it's a tidy size that's easy to judge all the same, and forward visibility has been improved in this generation. </p>, <p>Today's Beetle continues the tradition of special-edition models, though. Coinciding with the convertible's launch in 2013, Volkswagen announced a range of decades-inspired design and styling packages, with <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1080842_2013-volkswagen-beetle_styling_2">themes from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s</a>. They were offered only for a limited time. The Beetle also offers heritage-design wheels, which look like steel wheels with shiny hubcaps, but are in fact alloys with domed centers.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Beetle received two new engines. The diesel engine was replaced with a new turbodiesel of the same size making 10 more horsepower and adding a bit more efficiency. The EPA highway figure now reaches 41 mpg for both manual and automatic models, and city numbers have increased by a few mpg. The new engine continues to offer effortless torque and makes a good companion for those using their Beetle for long-range cruising. The 2.5-liter inline-5 gave way to a 1.8-liter turbo-4 making the same horsepower, but with better fuel economy.</p>, <p>Also for 2015, Volkswagen added an entry Beetle Classic model, with a price $1,500 lower than that of the least expensive 1.8T automatic model. It featured 17-inch Heritage wheels, the 170-hp 1.8T, a 6-speed automatic transmission, navigation, two-tone leatherette/cloth front seats, and several other items. Classic coupes started around $21,000.</p>, <p>In 2015, Volkswagen admitted diesel engines in this model illegally cheated federal tests and polluted beyond allowable limits. As part of unprecedented settlements with federal and state governments, Volkswagen agreed to buyback from owners diesel-equipped models of this vehicle. To determine eligibility for all affected Volkswagen, Porsche, and Audi models, Volkswagen set up <a href="http://www.vwdieselinfo.com">VWDieselInfo.com</a> for owners. (<em>Owners of affected vehicles can enter their VIN numbers to see if their cars are eligible for buyback.</em>)</p>, <p>VW is offering for 2016 a new MIB II infotainment system with 5.0- or 6.3-inch touchscreens and, finally, a USB port. VW also added automatic emergency braking that applies the brakes when a collision is detected to reduce the possibility of a second impact and more damage. A slightly more butch version of the Beetle, called the Beetle Dune was made available in 2016.</p>, <p><strong>The revived VW New Beetle</strong></p>, <p>When it was first reintroduced in 1998, the so-called New Beetle launched with a choice of a 115-hp, 2.0-liter inline-4 or VW's turbocharged 1.9-liter inline-4 making either 90 or 100 hp. With either engine, the Beetle provided reasonable pep, but it was not fast. The TDI engine was the pick of the two for frugal buyers, with highway mileage figures well into the 40s. For buyers who wanted more power, VW introduced a 1.8T model in 1999. Its 150-hp gasoline turbo-4 gave the New Beetle much more enthusiastic performance without using much more fuel than the base engine. A Turbo S model, offered only from 2002 to 2004, brought even stronger acceleration and more involvement, thanks to a 180-hp version of the 1.8T engine and a 6-speed manual.</p>, <p>While the New Beetle was an obvious update to the beloved original, it differed in several very important ways. The New Beetle used a water-cooled engine up front, powering the front wheels, while the classic Bug had an air-cooled engine in back driving the rear axle. The New Beetle also shared many parts with the Audi A4 and VW Passat of the time. Its shape and details like the dash-mounted bud vase provided the character of the old car, easily setting it apart from its low-cost contemporaries.</p>, <p>For 2006, Volkswagen phased out the 4-cylinder engines and introduced a 170-hp, 2.5-liter inline-5, mated to either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. This engine was reasonably strong and worked well with the automatic transmission, though it didn't feel as sporty and eager as the turbo-4 that preceded it. In any of these New Beetle models, ride quality was quite smooth. Turbo S models were among the sportiest, but otherwise handling wasn't particularly inspiring.</p>, <p>In coupes, back seat space was too cramped for adults but good enough for a couple of smaller kids. Convertible models, introduced for 2003, have slightly less backseat space but a well-configured, triple-layer electric soft top. In its later years, New Beetle convertibles made sense long after the coupes seemed dated, as the open-top versions made great cruisers and were an affordable upgrade to the Sebrings and Solaras that were so common in rental fleets.</p>, <p>The design of the New Beetle changed very little over the years and many feel it didn't age well. To make matters worse, VW squeezed out a little more of the feature content each year, meaning that many of the features once offered on the Beetle—including leather upholstery, fog lamps, and rain-sensing wipers—simply vanished. Special-edition models followed special trim and color schemes, as well as flashy wheels, though these models didn't offer many additional features. Over the years, the Beetle's crash-test scores were lackluster. For 2010, the Final Edition New Beetle offered special paintwork and unique-to-the-model 17-inch wheels, as well as standard electronic stability control and fog lamps.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volkswagen_cc
[<p>The Volkswagen CC is a four-door sedan that joined the VW lineup in the 2009 model year. It's what VW calls a "coupe-like" sedan that slots between the Jetta and Passat sedans in its current U.S. lineup.</p>, <p>Now in its ninth model year, the CC shares underpinnings with the previous-generation Passat sedan, which was replaced in the 2012 model year with a newer, larger model built in Tennessee. The four-door coupe, in fact, was initially known as the Passat CC—although the two never shared any body panels.</p>, <p>It competes against fashion-forward four-doors in the near-luxury class, including the Audi A4, Acura TLX, Lincoln MKZ, Nissan Maxima, and Volvo S60.</p>, <p>The CC is likely to be discontinued after the 2017 model year, when a new model expected to be <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1105525_2018-volkswagen-arteon-cc-successor-spy-shots">called the Arteon arrives</a>. For 2017, meanwhile, the CC sees its trim lineup halved and its 6-cylinder engine has bitten the dust. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read <a dir="ltr" href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_cc_2017" id="tinymce" title="2017 Volkswagen CC - review">our 2017 Volkswagen CC review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The CC, with frameless windows in its four doors, has a sleek roofline that mimics the styling of the much more expensive Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class. Its swept-back front end, sculpted body, and smoothly flowing roofline still set it apart from the more square-cut and upright Passat, giving mid-size VW sedan buyers two polar opposites from which to choose.</p>, <p>As is the case with most of the so-called four-door-coupe set, the CC's pretty roofline has an associated cost. Rear-seat head room suffers, which can cause problems for tall adults on long trips—it's okay for short jaunts or short people, who are the most likely rear-seat inhabitants anyway. The swoopy CC also has a low driving position, which can be off-putting to some, especially vertically challenged drivers. Even with those trade-offs, the CC makes up somewhat with its rich materials, the cabin feeling a good step up in quality compared to the larger Passat sedan.</p>, <p>Power for most versions of the CC comes from an engine that should be familiar to anyone fond of recent VW or Audi vehicles. The turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 known as the 2.0T makes 200 horsepower. Rare among mid-size sedans, the CC offered a 6-speed manual transmission as standard equipment, while a 6-speed automatic was an option. Through 2009, the CC used a conventional 6-speed automatic, although from 2010 the self-shifting option has been the sportier automated dual-clutch. Fuel economy is good for a sedan this size, at 21 mpg city, 32 highway.</p>, <p>Through 2016, VW also offered a 280-hp VR6, a V-6 engine designed with a very narrow angle between its cylinder banks for compact size. It came only with the automatic option. In reality, though, the VR6 didn't feel notably faster or more powerful than the turbo four. But to get VW's all-wheel drive—dubbed 4Motion—you had to opt for the VR6, and that cost buyers substantially more up front and at the gas pump.</p>, <p>Safety ratings for the CC haven't been perfect on all counts. It has received all "Good" scores from the IIHS except for a "Marginal" in the new small front overlap test. It has never been rated by the NHTSA except for a four-star rollover score. Active-safety features like adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, and automatic crash braking are available in later years, only on the top-of-the-range version for a particular model year.</p>, <p>Overall, the CC is a capable, nice-handling sedan, with great ride quality—firm yet compliant. To some, the steering is a bit light on feel, but overall, the CC typifies Volkswagen's firm, "German engineered" handling and rides and drives well.</p>, <p>The first big upgrade after the 2007 launch came in 2010, when the 6-speed automatic was replaced across the board by VW's automated manual. Bluetooth and an enhanced audio interface were made standard that year as well.</p>, <p><a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1073492_volkswagen-announces-pricing-on-the-2013-cc">Then in 2013</a>, the Volkswagen CC got a more significant update. It gained a new grille and front air dam, LED running lamps, and standard bi-xenon adaptive headlamps on the outside. Inside, VW refreshed the trim and cabin decor, and replaced the old two-position back seat with a three-position bench containing a fold-down armrest. Prices also rose appreciably.</p>, <p>For 2014, Volkswagen at last began to allow buyers to pair the more fuel-efficient engine with the Executive trim, bringing with it some of the top features like premium sound, massage seats, and leather upholstery. Sirius XM Traffic, a motion-activated trunk opener, and keyless ignition were added to that, while a standard rearview camera system was added for most of the model line.</p>, <p>For 2016, minor updated included a new Trend trim level, and an upgraded infotainment system with a USB port. In 2017, VW simplified the CC's trim levels from six to three, eliminated the "VR6" 6-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive, and moved its active-safety features to the top-of-the-line 4-cylinder model from the discontinued V-6 version.</p>, <p>Of all the different CC variations, we recommend the base CC Sport, which comes well equipped with automatic climate control, heated seats, and an eight-speaker sound system.</p>]

[<p>The Volvo XC40 is the Swedish automaker's smallest crossover SUV and the first Volvo sold under the car company's "subscription" plan.</p>, <p>With the XC40, Volvo launched a new architecture that will spin off a range of compact vehicles, including battery-electric vehicles to join its lineup at a later date.</p>, <p>It's a rival for vehicles such as the Mercedes-Benz GLA Class, Audi Q3, BMW X1, and Infiniti QX30.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our review of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/review/1114224_2019-volvo-xc40">2019 Volvo XC40</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The angular look of the XC40 bears more in common with some Jeeps than it does with the more conservatively styled XC90 and XC60 SUVs that outrank it in the Volvo lineup. Details such as a color-contrast roof, a wide grille and prominent logo, and pronounced wheel arches are meant to lend the impression that the XC40 has legitimate off-road ability.</p>, <p>That visual claim is backed up by 8.3 inches of ground clearance, backed by a BorgWarner all-wheel-drive system.</p>, <p>Inside, the XC40 sports a 9.0-inch touchscreen with Volvo's Sensus infotainment interface. It's standard; the XC40 will also offer Bluetooth with audio streaming and Qi-compatible wireless smartphone charging. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integrate into the infotainment system, which also supports apps such as Yelp and Pandora, as well as location-sharing and emergency services.</p>, <p>Volvo offers lots of in-car storage in the form of a flexible cargo space, big door pockets, bag hooks, and a dedicated smartphone storage nacelle.</p>, <p>The XC40 is powered by a turbocharged inline-4 with all-wheel drive that makes 248 horsepower. A less powerful turbo-4 will follow later. Some markets will also see variants with inline-3 engines and turbodiesels, but those are less likely for sale in the U.S. What we are likely to get are hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery-electric models.</p>, <p>On the safety front, the 2019 XC40 includes forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking. A surround-view camera system is available, as will Volvo's semi-autonomous drive assistants.</p>, <p>The most startling feature of the new XC40 may be its price—or, rather, its subscription model. Volvo will sell the XC40 with a base price starting at $36,195 for the turbocharged, all-wheel-drive Momentum model. A $34,195 front-drive turbo-4 model arrives in the summer of 2018.</p>, <p>It also will offer Care by Volvo, a subscription service that bundles the vehicle with service, maintenance, and insurance, all for a flat, non-negotiable price. Under the plan, users can upgrade or change their car each year, if they like, in the same way they now change smartphones.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volvo_xc60
[<p>The Volvo XC60 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV that has been redesigned for the 2018 model year. </p>, <p>In the Volvo lineup, the XC60 sits below the XC90 utility vehicle that has helped to refocus the Swedish automaker as a high-end brand. Because of the XC60's size and luxury, it is a rival for vehicles like the Land Rover Discovery Sport, Lincoln MKC, and Audi Q5.</p>, <p>With the XC60, Volvo has a stylish luxury crossover that's an alternative for the usual German competitors.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volvo_xc60_2018">2018 Volvo XC60 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Volvo XC60</strong></p>, <p>The latest XC60 shares nothing with its predecessor, instead riding on a shrunken version of the brand's platform that also underpins the XC90 and S90. The latest XC60 looks for all the world like a slightly simplified, smaller version of the XC90, although there's some added flair to its taillights and a bit more playfulness to its detailing. Inside, the XC60 is a dead-ringer for the pricier models except, once again, its design is a bit cleaner and less adorned—which fits its lower price point. </p>, <p>Volvo offers the XC60 in three powertrains, similar to its XC90. All three are based on 2.0-liter turbo-4s, with increasing output all the way to the top plug-in hybrid T8. Starting with the turbocharged T5 that makes 254 horsepower, the XC60 T6 will make 320 hp thanks to an added supercharger. The T8's engine-battery combo produces 407 hp and a thrilling 5.3-second dash up to 60 mph.</p>, <p><em>The Car Connection</em> named the new XC60 our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/news/best-car-to-buy">Best Crossover To Buy 2018</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Volvo XC60 history</strong></p>, <p>At the time of its launch back in the 2010 model year, the XC60 combined a 3.2-liter inline-6 engine with front-wheel drive in its most fuel-efficient form. It returned a reasonable 19 mpg city, 25 highway and was rated at 240 hp and 236 pound-feet of torque.</p>, <p>That engine has since been replaced; in fact, Volvo has offered a plethora of powertrains in the XC60, changing them frequently as it ushered in a new era of powertrains across its lineup. The variants have included a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 making 300 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque in all-wheel-drive T6 models, or 325 hp and 354 lb-ft in the R-Design model. The latter also benefits from aggressive body kit pieces and unique chassis tuning that firms up the suspension. There have also been Polestar-tuned versions available in the past, based on the R-Design.</p>, <p>The 2013 model year brought realigned features between the T6 and R-Design models, as well as a few more standard features, including rain-sensing wipers, headlight washers, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Volvo lightly refreshed all of its models for 2014, including mild front-end styling updates and various changes to the infotainment system inside.</p>, <p>For 2015, the Volvo XC60 received new 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder engines for front-wheel-drive models. The base XC60, known as the T5, uses a 240-hp turbocharged version, while the more powerful T6 gets a 302-hp that's supercharged (to boost power at low engine speeds) and turbocharged (for increased output at higher engine speeds). Fuel economy is much improved in these models, with EPA combined ratings now up to 27 mpg for the T5. The all-wheel-drive models continued with their 6-cylinder engines.</p>, <p>Despite its height, the XC60 drives nicely on the road, with a very car-like feel. It has a planted, secure attitude that's absent on many crossovers, and behaves as well on tight turns as it does on long highway straights. The well-weighted steering system and smooth 6-speed automatic transmission certainly add to its demeanor.</p>, <p>When it comes to safety, the XC60 ticks all the right boxes and scores top marks in independent crash testing. There’s also an array of advanced safety features like forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking; adaptive cruise control; lane-departure warnings; and blind-spot monitors.</p>, <p>Halfway through the 2015 model year, the XC60 adopted a completely new Volvo Sensus infotainment system, with new 3-D map views, integrated concierge services, and new apps for streaming audio.</p>, <p>For 2017, Volvo again changed up the powertrain menu—this time paring it down for the crossover's last year before a full redesign. The company moved to a unified engine strategy: all 4-cylinders, all the time. Base T5 models are powered by the same turbo-4s, all-wheel-drive T6 models have a twin-charged inline-4.</p>]

[<p>The Volvo XC90 is a luxury crossover SUV with seating for up to seven passengers. In 2016 it became Volvo's first new large SUV in more than a decade. Now, the Swedish automaker has three new SUVs including the smaller XC60 and XC40.</p>, <p>First launched in 2003 as Volvo's largest SUV, the XC90 is now an entirely redesigned crossover that arrived for the 2016 model year. The new XC90 features three rows of seats and all-wheel drive (standard on most models), and a choice between turbocharged and supercharged 4-cylinder engines, with a plug-in hybrid model at the top of the lineup.</p>, <p>With the XC90, Volvo has a rival for high-buck luxury SUVs that include the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, and Land Rover's Discovery. The 2016 Volvo XC90 was named the North American Truck/Utility of the Year.<em><br/></em></p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volvo_xc90_2018" title="2017 Volvo XC90 - review">2018 Volvo XC90 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Volvo XC90</strong></p>, <p>A completely new, second-generation XC90 arrived for the 2016 model year. With a new plug-in hybrid option, new 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder Drive-E engines (including a 316-horsepower, turbocharged and supercharged version), an 8-speed automatic, a radical new interior design, a tablet-like Sensus touchscreen system, and new active safety features, the 2016 Volvo XC90 offered a new take on a family luxury crossover with a distinctively Swedish style.</p>, <p><span>The base model added for 2017 is the T5, with a 250-horsepower turbocharged (but not supercharged) version of the 2.0-liter engine, and all-wheel drive as optional rather than standard equipment. </span>The most common powertrain will be the T6 version, which uses a 2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged 4<span>-cylinder engine good for 316 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. It's packaged with an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive.<br/></span></p>, <p>The plug-in hybrid version of the XC90 is dubbed T8 "Twin Engine," as it provides the output expected from a V-8 engine. It does so, however, with the combination of a turbo- and supercharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and an 8-speed automatic driving the front wheels, while the rear axle is powered by an 82-hp electric motor for a through-the-road hybrid setup that replaces the mechanical AWD of the other two versions. Total system output is 400 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p><span>The trim levels got a redo for this generation as well. Base models are called Momentum, the sporty R-Design returns at the middle of the lineup, more luxurious models bear the Inscription badge, and the top-of-the-line T8 Excellence comes with every luxury feature and no options (and a price tag of more than $100,000).</span></p>, <p>For 2017, Volvo added a less powerful base T5 model with front-wheel drive and fewer luxury features, at a slightly lower price. It also added a new top-end model, the T8 Excellence. The 2018 model year was unchanged.</p>, <p><strong>Volvo XC90 history</strong></p>, <p>The XC90 was the oldest vehicle in the Volvo lineup before the 2016 replacement arrived. Through the long first generation, it retained its historic pricing position, slightly less expensive than its German counterparts. Perhaps more so than the latest, swoopier Volvo styles, the XC90 continued the tradition of safe and sensible Swedish design. It was voted the North American Truck of the Year in its debut year, and its sedan-like handling made the original model an easy-to-use and practical family hauler for the upscale suburbs where it's normally seen.</p>, <p>The basic shape of the original XC90 wore well over its more than a decade of life. A mild facelift was introduced for 2007, and another one for 2013. The latter included new body-color bumpers and trim, more brightwork on those bumpers, and LED running lamps and taillights. All of these changes contributed to its carlike personality, though the interior quickly grew dated—and showed its age particularly in the lack of the thin "floating" central console and more minimalist look now found in all other Volvos.</p>, <p>Handling was one of the first XC90’s key strengths, in fact. It made the XC90 an ideal alternative to larger, more ponderous sport-utility vehicles and boring, uber-practical minivans. The second-row seats were adjustable, varying the mix of passenger room and cargo volume, and a third-row seat was made standard in 2010. That one, unfortunately, was so cramped that it's strictly for children—and probably agile ones at that.</p>, <p>Toward the end of the first generation, the XC90 offered just one engine in U.S. versions, a 235-hp, 3.2-liter inline-6 mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The pair returned EPA estimated fuel economy of 16 mpg city, 23 highway. Front-wheel drive was standard, while all-wheel drive was an option. In prior years, Volvo had offered a 311-hp, 4.4-liter V-8 in the XC90, but it returned poor gas mileage and was discontinued after the 2011 model year.</p>, <p>Previously, for 2009, Volvo had added the R-Design option on the XC90, which gave the SUV some sportier touches such as 19-inch alloy wheels, a new grille and split dual exhaust pipes. For 2010, however, the R-Design trim was limited to the V-6 model.</p>, <p>For 2012, the Volvo XC90 received new Premier Plus and Platinum trims that added a few new features, and tech options were repackaged. The XC90's sound system gained both Bluetooth audio streaming and Pandora playlists the same year. Those updates followed a 2011 instrument panel revision that upped the XC90's standard equipment, adding Bluetooth, satellite radio, and new watch-dial instrumentation.</p>, <p>Over time Volvo sweetened the deal with more standard features and new options. For 2014, the XC90 got a folding front passenger seat, a 19-inch "Galateia" wheel design, and the option for upgraded Sovereign leather. The sportier R-Design model also received a Homelink garage door opener. And the company moved all-wheel drive, the blind-spot monitoring, and the dual-screen rear entertainment system to the list of standalone options.</p>]

[<p>The Volvo S90 is a full-size luxury sedan that, along with the XC90 crossover, ushered in a rebirth for the venerable Swedish brand. Introduced for the 2017 model year, it squares off against the Audi A6, BMW 5-Series, and Mercedes-Benz E-Class, among others—a tough set of competitors.</p>, <p>With the S90, Volvo offers impressive materials, technology, and self-driving systems at a reasonable price.</p>, <p>For 2018, it grows by 4 inches, with every bit of that space devoted to pampering rear seat passengers. </p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volvo_s90_2018">2018 Volvo S90 review</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The S90 is part of a new era for Volvo and it's designed with better proportions than its predecessor—including wheels placed closer to the corners. The S90’s athletic stance, upright grille, and “Thor’s hammer” headlight design make it distinctive from a distance, and sporty, while both the headlights and the rear lighting frame boxier details within curvaceous, organic sheet metal. Interior design in the new S90 is distinctive, elegant, and clean, with a prominent real-metal frame that bisects the dash, holding a large piece of wood, and acting as a nice complement to the relatively bright, plush interior.</p>, <p>The S90 is offered in T5, T6, and T8 models. There’s a 240-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbo-4 engine in the T5, while T6 models upgrade to a 316-hp version that’s turbocharged and supercharged. T8 models have a plug-in hybrid system that produces 400 hp and all-wheel drive. All S90 models have an 8-speed automatic transmission and are built with a weight-saving new structure that extensively uses hot-formed boron steel. An air suspension will be available on top-trim Inscription models, and is expected to bring a more settled ride as well as improved handling.</p>, <p>The S90 rides on a 120-inch wheelbase and is about the same size as the Acura RX, but slightly larger than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Standard features include a power sunroof, LED headlamps with corner illumination, leather upholstery, birch wood inlays, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless entry, rear park assist, a rearview camera, power-folding rear headrests, the Sensus Connect touchscreen, 10-speaker 330-watt audio, and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Active-safety features are aplenty in this model. One highlight—a standard feature—is Volvo’s Pilot Assist, a semi-autonomous feature, arrives in second-generation form in the S90 and now functions up to 81 mph. The S90 also has a segment-leading animal detection system to help identify deer and other animals that may be in the roadway—helping to reduce or avoid a collision.</p>, <p>The S90 nameplate was previously used for the Volvo 900-Series (940 and 960), which were rebadged the S90 for the 1997 and 1998 model year. Those are rear-wheel-drive models that carry a strong reputation for longevity.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volvo_v90
[<p>The Volvo V90 wagon is a full-size luxury wagon and the spiritual successor to the conservative and contemporary wagons that helped put the Swedish automaker on the map. It's offered as a tall-riding wagon too, called the V90 Cross Country, that very nearly treads into crossover country—although we'd stop short of taking anywhere other than a muddy field.</p>, <p>Volvo expects the Cross Country to be more popular that the regular wagon in the U.S., however. They may be on to something; other automakers such as Buick and Mercedes have expressed sincere interest in tall-riding wagons in the U.S., largely riding on the coattails of the successful Subaru Outback.</p>, <p>With the V90, Volvo offers two powertrains: an inline-4 with turbocharging only, or turbocharging and supercharging. The V90 Cross Country is available with only the latter.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE: Read our full review of the <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volvo_v90_2018">2018 Volvo V90</a></strong></em></p>, <p>The V90 is related to the S90 sedan and XC90 crossover SUV, with more space than the former but not a third row like the latter. Like most of Volvo's cars and crossovers, the V90 offer a turbocharged inline-4 paired to front-wheel drive in its T5 version (V90 only), or a turbocharged and superchaged inline-4 paired to all-wheel drive in T6 versions. Both powertrains are mated to an 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p>The V90 and V90 Cross Country prioritize comfort ahead of capability and even set to its sharpest, sportiest mode for driving dynamics, it's been especially compliant. Volvo's priority for passenger comfort comes through: the multi-adjustable seats are all-day comfortable with plenty of room for people and gear.</p>, <p>But many wagons and crossovers can do that, if we're honest. What helps set the Volvo apart is its conservative and organic exterior shape that helps disguise the car's mass-produced beginnings. Despite riding atop a platform that will eventually underpin all Volvo cars and crossovers, the V90's shape is wholly unique. It's lines arch from front to rear, and even though the V90 is a front-driver by nature, its long hood proportions hint otherwise.</p>, <p>Like Volvos before it, the V90 has a relatively large number of features devoted wholly to safety. Its Pilot Assist program, which made its debut on the XC90, is upgraded in the V90 and features a pedestrian detection system that can automatically brake to avoid hitting people or large animals.</p>, <p>A tablet-esque infotainment system is standard on all models with a vertical screen orientation that's a departure from the norm. It helps the interior look elegant without being too flashy, and helps the V90 and V90 Cross Country separate in what may become a growing segment for buyers.</p>]
--------------http://www.thecarconnection.com/cars/volvo_s60
[<p>The Volvo S60 is a mid-size sporty luxury sedan that directly competes with a trio of German models—the Audi A4, BMW 3-Series, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class—and arguably with the Cadillac ATS, although we're not sure how many buyers actually cross-shop the brash American luxury brand and the sensible Swedish one.</p>, <p>You could also call the Buick Regal and Acura TLX potential alternatives. With the addition of the extended-wheelbase Inscription model, the S60 may be aiming a bit higher at larger entry-luxury cars like the Lincoln MKS and perhaps the Lexus GS. </p>, <p>Like others in the same class as the S60, Volvo packs the sedan with features but they skew toward safety. The advanced features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, adjustable dampers, and brake-based torque vectoring.</p>, <p><span style="line-height: 115%;">For 2018, the S60 now comes standard with heated seats—as a car from Sweden should.</span> <strong><span style="line-height: 115%;"><br/></span></strong></p>, <p><strong><em>MORE: Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volvo_s60_2018" target="_blank">2018 Volvo S60 review</a></em></strong></p>, <p><strong><span style="line-height: 115%;">The new Volvo S60</span></strong></p>, <p>The S60 was redesigned in 2011. This latest generation is significantly more attractive and stylish than the boxy, square, and indestructible Volvos of yore. It’s a luxurious mid-size sedan and the most affordable four-door in the brand's current lineup.</p>, <p>When the current S60 arrived in the U.S., it was offered only in one model, the high-performance T6. At this level, the S60 used a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6, a 6-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive. It was certainly quick, but couldn't quite compare to the other Europeans in the segment when it came to handling.</p>, <p>The S60's more aggressive, fashion-forward design still manages to keep the visual identity of a Volvo. Inside, the new S60 is lavish in terms of its driver-oriented details—especially the ultra-cool floating center stack. Four adults can sit comfortably, with a fifth passenger in the back if everyone's friendly. The rear seat splits 40/60 and the trunk opening is much larger than that of the first-generation S60. A new infotainment system keeps driver informed and passengers entertained, with information from the audio unit, navigation system, mobile phone, and other functions presented on a 5.0- or 7.0-inch color screen at the top of the center console.</p>, <p>The 2012 model year brought two more models to the S60 lineup, the entry-level T5 and performance-oriented T6 R-Design. The T5 came with a 250-hp, 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 and front-wheel drive. The T6 R-Design used a hotter version of the T6's inline-6, with 25 horsepower more for a total of 325 hp. R-Design models come with standard all-wheel drive to help put all of the power and torque down.</p>, <p>In 2013, Volvo added an all-wheel-drive option to the T5 model while also boosting that engine's performance. The company also rearranged S60 trim levels somewhat, into Premier, Premier Plus, and Platinum trims, and added more technology features like rain-sensing wipers as standard equipment. The 2014 model added a slightly redesigned front end and various minor updates to the instruments, dashboard, and interior.</p>, <p>After receiving a number of minor styling, cabin, and technology improvements, as part of a light refresh it received for the 2014 model year, front-wheel-drive versions of the S60 received new Drive-E powertrains for 2015, with a new 240-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine powering the T5, and T6 models getting a 302-hp version that's turbocharged and supercharged. A completely new version of Volvo's Sensus infotainment system (with new premium audio) followed, as part of a "2015.5" model year.</p>, <p>In 2015, the S60's wagon cousin, the V60, finally made its first appearance in the U.S. The V60 falls somewhere between hatch and wagon status, offering slightly more cargo capacity than the S60 sedan. A V60 Cross Country is also available.</p>, <p>Volvo added two new versions of the S60 in 2016, with one aimed at the luxury crowd and the other for the adventurous sedan buyer, if such a thing exists. The S60 Inscription is basically a long-wheelbase version of the standard car, offering what Volvo claims is the largest rear seat in the segment. It was no doubt developed for the Chinese home market of Volvo's owner, Geely, where long-wheelbase versions of luxury standard sedans far outnumber the kinds of cars Americans buy.</p>, <p>The other new model is called the S60 Cross Country; it's basically an S60 on stilts, done up in the style of Volvo's XC models and recalling the AMC Eagle sedan in its jacked-up stance.</p>, <p>Volvo launched an S60L Twin Engine hybrid in China, which uses a gas engine to drive the front wheels and an electric motor to turn the rears. This setup is often referred to as a through-the-road hybrid, as the gas and electric portions don't share a direct connection. A model like this could make its way to the U.S. at a later date, although no plans have been confirmed.</p>, <p>For 2017, Volvo moved the S60 to all 4-cylinder engines, ditching the 5- and 6-cylinder versions from prior years. The base turbo-4 can be paired to all-wheel drive, a first for Volvo sedans.</p>, <p>The S60 is due for replacement in the next couple of years, and will be the first vehicle built at a new Volvo assembly plant under construction near Charleston, South Carolina.</p>, <p><strong>Volvo S60 history<em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p>Volvo launched the first-generation S60 for the 2001 model year. It was positioned as a smaller counterpart to the range-topping S80 luxury sedan, sized to compete with mid-size luxury and sport sedans. These cars carried standard front-wheel drive, with sportier models offering all-wheel drive. Unlike the long-lived XC90 crossover—which is just now being replaced for the first time—this S60 didn't weather the years very well; the same basic model was offered for a decade and was unable to hold its place in the market toward the end.</p>, <p><span style="line-height: 115%;">Despite starting prices of $30,000 or more, S60 sales were strong following its release and remained high until the 2005 model year, when consumer interest started to wane. But even the introduction of the 300-hp S60 R in 2004, an extensive facelift program in 2005, and updates in 2006 couldn't keep the car from fading away into obscurity. By the time the new S60 was shown at auto shows in 2010, it was long overdue.</span></p>]

[<p>The Volvo V60 is the gateway to Volvo's wagon lineup.</p>, <p>With the V60, Volvo offers a wagon as it always had in the U.S., but it's far from the boxy wagons of the '70s and '80s. It's a low, sleek, sporty wagon version of Volvo's current mid-size sedan, the S60.</p>, <p>A new wagon appeared in 2018 with a new look and new powertrains.</p>, <p><em><strong>MORE</strong>: <strong>Read our <a href="//www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volvo_v60_2018">2018 Volvo V60 review</a><br/></strong></em></p>, <p><strong>The new Volvo V60</strong></p>, <p>A new small wagon appeared in 2018 for the 2019 model year.</p>, <p>The 2019 Volvo V60 looks almost indistinguishable from the bigger V90 wagon—hardly a coincidence. The V60 is powered by the company's 2.0-liter turbo-4, with or without batteries. The V60 will be Volvo's second car in the U.S. available by "subscription," called Care By Volvo. For interested shoppers, the V60 will come well-equipped for a flat monthly fee as part of a two-year commitment, and owners can trade up or trade down after one year.</p>, <p>The V60 shares much of its interior with the similarly sized XC60, including a large vertically oriented touchscreen for infotainment in all trim levels. The V60 is equipped with Volvo's suite of semi-autonomous driving aids, including active lane control and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The V60 is assembled at the automaker's facility in Torslanda. The related S60 sedan will be assembled at the automaker's new facility near Charleston, South Carolina.</p>, <p><strong>Volvo V60 history</strong></p>, <p>The V60 is akin to other small European wagons, which can be considered biggish hatchbacks to some extent.</p>, <p>Although the V60 offers plenty more room inside than an S60 sedan, it is by no means the cargo-hauling king in the manufacturer's lineup. The brand's three crossover vehicles beat the V60 in that measure, as the low, sleek roofline of this wagon keeps the cargo hold to a moderate size. With the rear seats folded, the V60 can swallow 43 cubic feet of stuff. As in the S60 sedan, the V60's rear seat can be tight for adults; it offers a ski pass-through and can also fold in a versatile 40/20/40 arrangement.</p>, <p>The base V60 T5 used Volvo's new direct-injected and turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. It generated 240 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, driving the front wheels only through a new 8-speed automatic transmission. In the V60 its front-drive only, but in the V60 Cross Country, which adds 2 inches of additional ground clearance, it can be mated to all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>A step up the ladder brings the V60 T6, which used a supercharged and 2.0-liter turbo-4 that produced 302 hp. It's mated to all-wheel drive and the same 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p>The new engines include a start-stop system as standard—it's very quick on the restart, which we applaud. All V60 models offer three drive modes: Normal, Sport, and Eco+, the latter of which cuts off the air conditioning when unneeded and remaps the throttle and transmission for more efficient performance.</p>, <p>Volvo introduced models with the new Sensus Connect infotainment system as "2015.5" models, so as to differentiate them on dealer lots. The new system in the 2015.5 Volvo S60 includes Volvo On-call concierge and roadside-assistance services, cloud-based services, 3-D maps for the navigation system, and new Harman Kardon premium sound. </p>, <p>The V60 lineup also includes Cross Country model that takes it slightly toward the crossover end of the wagon spectrum. A modest ground-clearance hike of 2.6 inches combines with some extra cladding and fender flares to produce a more rugged version of the small five-door. The related S60 sedan also receives a Cross Country version soon.</p>]
