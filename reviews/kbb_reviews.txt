[<p>Sporty, luxurious and packed with technology, the new 2018 Acura ILX is the luxury brand’s smallest and most affordable sedan. With prices starting well under $30,000, the Acura also undercuts the prices of the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA. And its standard 201-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine is strong for the class, offering more standard horsepower than the turbocharged Audi. Acura offers the ILX in seven trim levels, including the sporty A-Spec, the luxurious Premium and the top-of-the-line ILX Tech. Prices top out around $36,000. All models use an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Although the new Acura ILX is based on the previous-generation Honda Civic, you’d never know it, as the ILX feels like a premium automobile and drives with the vigor we expect from an Acura.</p>, <p>Acura’s unique combination of performance, luxury, technology and affordability is well represented in the ILX sedan. This is an aspirational sedan that offers a sporty driving experience and premium features. It has also been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and its reputation for reliability is solid.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for the all-weather traction of all-wheel drive in your small-luxury sedan, you won’t find it on the Acura ILX, but you will find it on its competitors. Audi offers all-wheel drive on the A3, along with a more powerful 220-horsepower engine, and it’s available on the Mercedes CLA 250.</p>, <p>For 2018, the AcuraWatch suite of active safety and driver aids is available on all ILX models. There’s also a new Special Edition trim, with a long list of standard equipment including LED headlights, an 8-way-power driver's seat, multi-view rearview camera, sunroof, Bluetooth, keyless entry, push-button start and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. It also includes the 18-inch wheels, side sills and a rear spoiler from the A-Spec package.</p>, <p>Around town the 2018 Acura ILX strikes an appreciated balance between sport and luxury. It’s comfortable, with well-shaped seats and a proper seating position worthy of a sports sedan. The interior is also quieter than you might expect, especially if you've driven or ridden in the earlier versions of the ILX. It’s also fun to drive with good steering feel and an athletic well-tuned suspension, although some may find the ride overly firm. The sedan’s handling certainly is up to Acura’s reputation for performance, especially with the optional 18-inch wheels and tires, and the 201-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine provides plenty of go. Acura's 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is one of the best. Leave it in Drive and go to the grocery store, and you'll never notice a thing. Shift it into Sport and use the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, and you'll find a sport transmission that's quick and crisp, but never jarring.</p>, <p>ACTIVE SOUND CONTROL<br>
 Previous iterations of the Acura ILX were criticized for having noisy interiors, which just didn’t suit the vehicle’s premium image or the expectations of its buyers. That’s ancient history. The 2018 Acura ILX has an active noise-cancelation system that listens to ambient engine and wind noise, and produces an equal but reverse sound through the audio system. The two sounds cancel each other out for a much quieter ride.<br>
<br>
COLLISION-MITIGATION BRAKING SYSTEM<br>
This smart safety system is part of a suite of advanced driver aids available on every ILX trim level. This system detects objects in the sedan’s path and monitors the vehicle’s speed. If it determines an impact is possible, it will warn the driver. If you don’t react, it will then begin braking for you.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The new Acura ILX seats four adults comfortably and five in pinch. Interior materials are high-quality, with only a few hard plastic touches as reminders that you bought on a budget. Seating is comfortable, and the driving position is perfect. Most controls are easy to use, but the Acura’s dual-screen infotainment and navigation system takes a little getting used to. Don’t let it scare you; its functions are actually quite intuitive. Thanks to an active noise-cancelation system, the Acura’s interior is also much quieter than it was before. Trunk space is about average for the class at 12.3 cubic feet, and the ILX’s rear seat folds flat to expand the space.</p>, <p>With a strong resemblance to Acura’s larger sedans, the TLX and the RLX, the design of 2018 ILX is simple, youthful and understated. Its most distinctive features are LED headlights with multiple lenses. Acura calls the treatment "Jewel Eye" and it gives the ILX just enough visual candy along with a separate bar of LED running lights. The character line that runs the length of the car kicks up dramatically around the rear door handles, and the brightwork around the Acura’s greenhouse is a premium touch. A-Spec models dial up the cool factor with larger uniquely styled 18-inch wheels, fog lights, side sill moldings and a small rear spoiler.</p>, <p>All 2018 Acura ILX models come standard with the 2.4-liter engine and 8-speed automatic transmission. They also come fairly well loaded with other features, including a rearview camera with multiple views, automatic headlights, dual-zone GPS-linked climate control, passive entry with push-button start, and an 8-way-power driver's seat. Even base models get heated front seats, and part of the ILX's quiet is thanks to noise-abating wheels and active noise cancelation. The new Acura ILX also comes standard with Siri Eyes Free, which allows access to the iPhone's digital assistant with the push of a button on the steering wheel.</p>, <p>AcuraWatch is a suite of safety systems that includes adaptive cruise control, collision-mitigation braking, lane-keeping assist, and other high-tech features. Elsewhere, ILX Premium models add leather seats, blind-spot warning with a cross-traffic monitor, the iPhone navigation connectivity mentioned earlier, and an audio upgrade. The top-line Technology Plus models get AcuraWatch standard, as well as an even better audio system and built-in navigation. The A-Spec package adds 18-inch wheels, fog lights, a rear spoiler, perforated suede upholstery with contrasting stitching, a black headliner, red-lighted gauges and aluminum pedals.</p>, <p>The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine in the new 2018 Acura ILX is ubiquitous across the board, and its 201 horsepower is more than adequate for a car this size. The 8-speed automatic is one of our favorite things about the car; smooth shifting in Drive and quick when using the paddle shifters. The 8-speed is a dual-clutch setup, meaning it's designed like a computer-operated manual transmission, but Acura also added a torque converter in the system for better power delivery and a more familiar feel. The high-tech engine uses advanced fuel injection that enhances power and fuel economy, but it also requires premium fuel. Luckily, you won't use a lot of it, thanks to 25-mpg city and 35-mpg highway EPA estimates. Every ILX is front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is not offered.<br>
<br>
 2.4-liter inline-4<br>
 201 horsepower @ 6,800 rpm<br>
 180 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/35 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>A base 2018 Acura ILX has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $29,000 when you include the $950 destination charge. Savvy buyers will move up to the ILX Special Edition for only $800 more. And for another $500 you can add the AcuraWatch Plus package. Do it. Premium Package models start around $31,000, and the Technology Plus model comes in around $34,000. The A-Spec package adds $2,000 to the price of a Premium or Technology Plus model. The ILX is priced higher than a Buick Verano, but it's also better equipped. It's also thousands less than the base-model Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz CLA 250, especially when you start adding options to those other cars. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new ILX. Projected resale value for the ILX is better than the Buick, but lags behind the Mercedes-Benz and Audi competition.</p>]

[<p>A fun-to-drive luxury SUV, the extremely popular 2018 Acura MDX offers families seating for seven and the highest safety ratings. Prices for Acura’s largest and most expensive SUV start around $45,000 for a front-wheel-drive (FWD) model with a 290-horsepower V6 engine. All-wheel drive (AWD) is a $2,000 option. The new MDX, which is built in East Liberty, Ohio, competes with the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE, Infiniti QX60, Lexus RX, Volvo XC90 and Audi A7. Acura also offers a more fuel-efficient Hybrid model with 321 horsepower, which competes with the hybrid version of the Lexus RX and plug-in hybrid BMW X5. Five models are available, with prices topping out around $60,000 for an all-wheel-drive model with the Advance and Entertainment packages, while the Sport Hybrid model starts around $59,000.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a family-friendly 3-row SUV with strong performance, the highest safety ratings and a luxurious interior packed with technology, you’ll like the 2018 Acura MDX. The MDX Sport Hybrid also has a third row, while the Lexus RX 400h does not.</p>, <p>Unlike BMW and Land Rover, Acura does not offer a diesel model in this class. If you’re looking for the most power in the segment, BMW offers significantly more powerful versions of the X5, and there’s more horsepower offered in the Mercedes GLE lineup. Also, some may find the MDX’s third row a bit too tight for their needs.</p>, <p>Last year, the Acura MDX received a significant redesign, inside and out. This year the 2018 MDX gets an improved infotainment system with more intuitive menus and a redesigned dual-screen interface with faster response. The new system supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Acura has also added two new reds to the MDX’s color palette.</p>, <p>Powerful and agile, the 2018 Acura MDX is one of the more athletic 3-row SUVs out there. The Acura’s big V6 is more than strong enough for most buyers and its 9-speed automatic transmission is responsive and smooth. Acceleration is quick enough to be thrilling, and there’s plenty of passing power. This is a big vehicle, but it never feels like an oversized land yacht. Its handling is exceptional. Its ability to turn corners will make you smile, especially models with Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system. The new Acura MDX is also comfortable and luxurious. It rides well. Around town its suspension filters out just enough of the road’s surface and it doesn’t crash over potholes. Visibility is excellent, the steering is light and the MDX is easy to park. Surprisingly the MDX Sport Hybrid is even quicker and it uses technology shared with the Acura NSX supercar to improve handling.</p>, <p>ACURAWATCH<br>
 One reason the 2018 Acura MDX gets the highest ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is AcuraWatch. Standard on every 2018 MDX, AcuraWatch includes automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, road-departure mitigation and adaptive cruise control. These features often cost thousands extra on the Acura’s rivals.<br>
<br>
 SH-AWD<br>
 Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system is a sophisticated system that improves dry-weather handling as well as foul-weather safety. The system continuously divides the engine’s power seamlessly as you drive, sending more to the front when cruising for improved fuel economy, more to the rear to aid acceleration and side-to-side when cornering. For $2,000 the system is a strong value.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Although not the largest 3-row SUV, the 2018 Acura MDX offers comfortable people space and impressive cargo volume. Behind its third row, the MDX offers 15.3 cubic feet of space, matching the Volvo XC90. Fold its third row, which is split 50/50, and there’s 43.4 cubic feet, which just betters the space in the Volvo. Fold the Acura’s second row and there’s over 90 cubic feet of space, which is strong for the class. The MDX Sport Hybrid matches those measurements. Fit/finish is excellent, as is front-seat comfort, but the third row is best used for kids. A pair of 2nd-row captain's chairs is available, but they decrease seating capacity to six. Ergonomically the MDX takes a little getting used too, especially its dual-infotainment screens and its push-button shifter.</p>, <p>Once as homely and awkward as a 6-foot sixth grader, the 2018 Acura MDX has blossomed into a beauty. Last year’s restyle included Acura’s new, more attractive diamond-pentagon grille, as well as a new hood, front fenders and intricate headlights. Although the new look is a little less daring, it’s an improvement and should give the MDX even broader appeal. The SUV’s sporty, dual-exhaust outlets now feature a bright exterior finish, and its sloping window frame gives it a coupe-like look. Higher trims roll on 20-inch wheels, while standard models use 18-inchers. A capless fuel filler means no more unscrewing a cap.</p>, <p>The 2018 Acura MDX is surprisingly well-equipped out the gate. A standard model comes with the AcuraWatch suite of safety and semi-autonomous driving features, leather interior, power-operated and heated front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, power tailgate, power moonroof and the HomeLink garage-door opener. On the audio/entertainment front, the MDX comes with an 8-speaker AM/FM/CD system with multiple USB ports and Bluetooth connectivity. The MDX features Siri Eyes Free compatibility for iPhone users as well as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Safety and driving features include a rearview camera, lane-keep assist, road-departure mitigation, automatic emergency braking, and traction- and stability-control systems.</p>, <p>Aside from all-wheel drive, most major options are bundled into packages. Sport Hybrid models start at the Technology package level, which includes navigation, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, Siri Eyes Free, 20-inch wheels and remote engine start. The Advance package adds the 2nd-row captain's chairs, upgraded leather, ventilated front seats, surround-view camera and front/rear parking sensors. A rear-seat entertainment package brings an entertainment screen, wireless headphones, rear-door sunshades and heated 2nd-row seats, but isn't available on Sport Hybrid models. Note: The rear-seat entertainment system comes with a 2nd-row bench, meaning you have to order it if you want an Advance model with seating for seven.</p>, <p>The Acura MDX uses a 3.5 liter V6 engine making a strong 290 horsepower. The standard setup is front-wheel drive with Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive optional on any model. The Acura uses a refined 9-speed automatic transmission, and Advance models include the idle start/stop system, which shuts off the engine at red lights to save fuel. To further improve fuel economy, Variable Cylinder Management shuts down three of the six cylinders during cruising and deceleration. The standard MDX can tow up to 5,000 pounds. The Acura MDX Sport Hybrid uses a 3.0-liter V6 combined with an electric motor, routed through a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission developed from the NSX supercar's 9-speed. In the rear on the Sport Hybrid are two electric motors, one for each rear wheel.<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6<br/> 290 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br/> 267 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/27 mpg (FWD), 20/27 mpg (FWD w/auto idle stop), 18/26 mpg (AWD), 19/26 mpg (AWD w/auto idle stop)<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter V6 + electric motors (Sport Hybrid)<br/> 321 combined horsepower<br/> 289 lb-ft combined torque<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/27 mpg</p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The 2018 Acura MDX has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $45,000 when including the destination charge. All-wheel drive is an additional $2,000, and adding packages can lift prices several thousand more. A fully loaded 2018 MDX can approach $60,000. These prices are nearly in line with rivals like the Infiniti QX60 and Volvo XC90, and below competitors like the Audi Q7, BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE and GLS. The MDX Sport Hybrid starts around $59,000, which is about $4,000 cheaper than a BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, but it’s more than the starting price of a Lexus RX 400h, which seats five, not bad considering the technology involved. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Acura MDX's resale value is expected to be excellent in the years ahead.<br>

[<p>Designed and built in America, the 2018 Acura NSX is the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand’s fastest, quickest and most powerful machine. Ever. And with a base price of over $155,000, the mid-engine hybrid-powered supercar is also the most expensive <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/acura/">Acura</a>. Ever. With 573 horsepower and all-wheel drive, the sophisticated NSX can squirt to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds and its top speed is over 190 mph. So it has the power and the speed to rival the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> 488 and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lamborghini/huracan/">Lamborghini Huracan</a>, but it costs much less than those Italian exotics. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/r8/">Audi R8</a> and the hybrid-powered <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/i8/">BMW i8</a>, which is also a plug-in, cost about the same, but the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> can’t keep up with the Acura, which is powered by a 500-horsepower twin-turbo, all-aluminum 3.5-liter V6 in combination with three <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motors, a 1.0-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and a 9-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with manual mode and paddle shifters.</p>, <p>If you desire a sophisticated and technically advanced 2-seat supercar with exotic design, everyday civility and world-class speed and performance, you’ll like the 2018 Acura NSX. The plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> can also be driven silently for a few miles on electricity alone, just like the $1,000,000 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/918%20spyder/">Porsche 918 Spyder</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mclaren/p1/">McLaren P1</a>.</p>, <p>On paper, the Acura NSX’s 573 horsepower sounds impressive, and on the road those ponies provide plenty of thrust. But they don’t come with bragging rights. The Audi R8 V10 Plus, Ferrari 488 and Lamborghini Huracan all pack over 600 horsepower. Even the Chevy Corvette Z06 and a long list of <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> and <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> out-power the Acura.</p>, <p>All-new just last year, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/nsx/">Acura NSX</a> has received no changes or updates for 2018.</p>, <p>It isn’t the speed of the 2018 Acura NSX that impresses. Oh, sure, it’s quick. Let it eat and the SH-AWD system does its thing, all four massive Michelins claw at the asphalt and you’re past 60 mph in about three seconds, your head pinned to the seat as the supercar’s 9-speed dual-clutch automatic snatches another gear and then another. Hold your foot down and it’ll crest 190 mph. And man can it corner, thanks to Active Torque Vectoring that independently applies power or braking forces to each front wheel to further enhance grip. And the Acura’s excellent mechanical/regenerative braking system feels great and is extremely positive. But the best part, the part that blows our minds is the civility and the comfort. The NSX is a pussycat in traffic and in the tight confines of the city. You can control these multiple personalities with four driver-selectable settings, Quiet, Sport, Sport+ and Track. Each tunes the steering, brakes, throttle response, Vehicle Stability Assist, magnetorheological dampers and Sport Hybrid SH-AWD while tweaking the level of exhaust roar both inside the car and out.</p>, <p>CARBON-CERAMIC BRAKES<br>
 You know the old saying, “Stopping is just a matter of money. How quickly do you want to stop?” Acura offers a Carbon-Ceramic Brake package on the 2018 NSX and it ain’t cheap. With black calipers the lightweight, heat-resistant track-ready brakes cost an additional $9,900. But the price climbs to $10,600 if you want red or silver calipers.<br>
<br>
 ELS STUDIO AUDIO<br>
 For the additional $2,800 we recommend this audio upgrade. The ELS system packs the NSX with nine speakers and 580 watts of power. That’s twice the power of the standard system, and the 5.1 DTS Neural Sound surround sound turns the supercar’s cabin into a concert hall. I’ve never heard “East Bound and Down” with such punch and midrange pulse.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Acura’s designers have managed to create a warm and welcoming cabin with a modern, high-tech vibe. There’s nothing retro about it; still, the shapes and overall design offer a connection to the interior of the original Acura NSX, which was introduced in 1991. Visibility is excellent for a mid-engine sports car and the interior is well-finished. Deeply bolstered bucket seats trimmed in perforated Milano leather and Alcantara provide an excellent combination of comfort and support without feeling confining and are complemented by extra padding on the door panels and center console. The flat-bottom steering wheel is a cool touch. The 7.0-inch infotainment touch screen is well placed but seems a bit pedestrian at this price point.</p>, <p>Low and hard-edged with a wide stance and a cornucopia of scoops and flares, when it comes to design the new 2018 Acura NSX checks all the supercar boxes. Although it doesn’t exactly break new ground, there’s plenty of sex appeal and purpose to the shape. And plenty of science. Based around a total airflow-management theme, the sleek, aluminum-and-steel bodywork optimizes the NSX’s overall aero profile and high-speed stability while ensuring full functionality of the plethora of radiators and cooling devices required to keep its Sport Hybrid powertrain elements and fluids at proper operating temps under all driving conditions.</p>, <p>While focused on delivering high-energy exhilaration, the 2018 Acura NSX boasts features that make it equally attractive as a daily driver. Despite 4-way-manual seats fitted in the interest of saving weight, comfort/convenience touches include dual-zone climate control, navigation, a 290-watt/8-speaker Premium Audio system that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay apps, Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth phone/streaming audio, keyless smart-entry/smart-start, Active Sound Control and more, including a modestly scaled but fully insulated and surprisingly usable 4.4-cubic-foot trunk that can hold a golf bag. The NSX wears staggered-size forged alloy wheels wrapped in 245/35ZR19 performance rubber up front and 305/30ZR20 boots in the rear.</p>, <p>Built to each individual customer’s order, the new 2018 Acura NSX offers a sizable selection of extras that can impart unique character to this ultimate Acura as well as enhance its overall performance. Optional seat packages add heated power buckets -- with or without semi-aniline leather -- while an ELS Studio Audio and Technology Package upgrades the sound, navigation and telematics capabilities. While a head-up display remains on the wish list, owners can opt for a selection of mass-reducing interior/exterior carbon-fiber bits, carbon-ceramic brakes that chop 52 pounds of unsprung weight, custom wheels, Ultra-Premium Andoro exterior paint finishes and a carbon-fiber roof.</p>, <p>Sole powertrain in the 2018 NSX is Acura’s technologically advanced Sport Hybrid system: a racing-inspired 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 supplemented by three electric motors that are fully integrated to optimize total performance and collectively develop 573 horsepower and 476 lb-ft of torque. The V6 features direct-plus-port fuel injection and dry-sump lubrication that allows it to be mounted low in the chassis to further optimize overall balance. A Direct Drive Motor sits between the engine and the NSX’s 9-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the Twin Motor Unit at the front axle independently energizes each wheel to provide additional motive force as well as steering/braking assist via torque vectoring. With their instant-on torque at launch, the motor array virtually eliminates turbo lag and always ensures superb throttle response.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/22 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Acura NSX has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $158,000, comfortably below the $192,000 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> Turbo S and the $166,000 Audi R8 V10, as well as the Lamborghini Huracan and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ferrari/488%20gtb/">Ferrari 488 GTB</a>, both of which are on the far side of $200,000. The BMW i8 starts around $144,000. It is possible to push the sticker on a fully loaded NSX to nearly $207,000, principally by adding things like the full assortment of exterior/interior carbon-fiber bits ($24,500), carbon-ceramic brakes ($9,900), trick paint ($6,000) and the Audio/Technology upgrade ($3,300). Kelley Blue Book has not yet established a Fair Purchase Price or Residual Value for the 2018 Acura NSX. However, last year the division was honored by KBB.com for having the lowest 5-Year Cost of Ownership for any luxury brand, and we anticipate the NSX’s stats will likely fall in line with those of its less-exotic family members.</p>]

[<p>While the 2018 Acura RDX compact-luxury-crossover <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> faces some stiff competition this year, it remains a favorite of those seeking a <a alt_o_t="Small Luxury SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/luxury-compact-crossover-suv-buyers-guide-new/2000011021/">small luxury SUV</a> that is fun to drive, offers plenty of high-tech features, ample power plus great reliability and resale values. Unlike the turbocharged 4-cylinder engines in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a> and Mercedes-Benz GLC300, the RDX comes standard with a proven V6 that can be mated to your choice of front-wheel or all-wheel drive. If you don’t need the added passenger space of the larger MDX, but you still want an SUV that has ample cargo space, a big rear seat and a tall roof, we think you’ll find the 2018 Acura RDX luxury-crossover SUV checks all the right boxes.</p>, <p>Acura’s RDX compact-crossover SUV for 2018 has a proven reputation for <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>, reliability and performance. The elegant interior is logically laid out, with the numerous user-friendly tech features logically arranged and easy to operate. The RDX’s reasonable price undercuts many competitors, as does its excellent resale history.</p>, <p>The 2018 Acura RDX isn’t a true off-road SUV, so if you’re looking for something more rugged, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery%20sport/">Land Rover Discovery Sport</a> or Evoque makes a better choice. Those seeking better fuel economy from an alternative powertrain might look to the Lexus NX 300h <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a> xDrive28d diesel.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rdx/">Acura RDX</a> for 2018 carries over with no major changes.</p>, <p>With the exception of its mediocre fuel economy, there really is very little else to quibble with regarding the 2018 Acura RDX compact-luxury-crossover SUV. The smooth and quiet 3.5-liter V6 provides abundant power for passing and merging, and the 6-speed automatic performs flawlessly. Get the RDX out on a long stretch of open road and you’ll discover this little SUV’s best attribute is its ability to cruise effortlessly for long distances without creating fatigue or boredom. Should the road begin to turn and twist, however, Acura’s 2018 RDX can handle just about any situation. The driving experience isn’t as dynamic as in a BMW X3 or an <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a>, but we think most people will appreciate what the RDX has to offer. The available AcuraWatch adds a reassuring layer of safety thanks to its adaptive cruise control, autonomous braking, lane-keep assist and collision-warning systems.</p>, <p>ACURA/ELS SURROUND SOUND<br/> Part of the Technology package, Acura’s RDX compact-luxury-crossover SUV for 2018 features the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/acura/">Acura</a> ELS audio system that accurately reproduces sound with the quality and clarity of systems costing twice as much.<br/> <br/> ADVANCE PACKAGE<br/> Adding all the safety and conveniences of the Technology and AcuraWatch Plus package, the Advance package is the best way to enjoy all that the 2018 RDX has to offer at a price well below the $45,000 mark.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Acura RDX offers a limited interior color palette, but that’s about all we can fault. Acura’s dual-screen infotainment system presents a cleanly styled interface devoid of the multitude of buttons found on some competitors. Other touches of note include soft-touch materials, an available 8-way-power passenger seat, 10-way-power driver's seat and a smart use of space for both passengers and cargo. For example, if the comfortable rear seats aren't holding passengers, they quickly fold forward to create up to about 77 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>, <p>Changes from the 2016 update carry over to the 2018 Acura RDX SUV. The exterior looks like a three-quarter replica of the larger MDX and easily conforms to the modern design language of the brand. Brilliant Jewel Eye headlights flank a 3-dimensional grille design, while around back the RDX’s taillights have the same signature look as the rest of the Acura lineup. The RDX’s face and tail liven up the overall package, which, although conservatively handsome, lags behind more radical designs like the Lexus NX and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a> Overland.</p>, <p>Most of the luxury SUV competitors the RDX faces don't have the long list of standard features as the Acura, and fewer still at the price. The 2018 Acura RDX comes with things like dual-zone climate control, a 10-way-power driver's seat, active noise cancellation, a multi-view rearview camera, and a 7-speaker/360-watt AM/FM/CD audio system with a 5-inch LCD display, USB/auxiliary inputs, voice-activated text messaging and Pandora Internet radio. Safety features include six airbags, stability and traction control, and Acura's ACE body structure, which has helped it earn top crash-test ratings from both the government and the <a alt_o_t="Insurance" href="/car-insurance/">insurance</a> industry.</p>, <p>While Acura tends to divide its major options into different model levels, Acura’s 2018 RDX breaks with this rule by offering the AcuraWatch package as a stand-alone option on all models, except the Advance Package, which includes it. AcuraWatch bundles adaptive cruise control, forward-collision braking and warning, and lane-keeping assist and departure warning in one package. All-wheel drive (AWD) is also available across the board. Navigation is available on the Technology and Advance packages, while the Advance adds luxury touches like ventilated front seats, blind-spot monitoring, parking sensors, remote starting, and automatic windshield wipers.</p>, <p>You wouldn't know that the Acura RDX for 2018 has a 3.5-liter V6 engine just from looking at the specs, as an engine of this size in a luxury-performance vehicle usually produces 300-plus horsepower. Still, performance is strong in the RDX, which routes its power through a 6-speed automatic transmission, either to the front wheels (FWD) or through Acura's AWD with Intelligent Control system.<br>
<br>
 3.5-liter V6<br>
 279 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br>
 252 lb-ft of torque @ 4,900 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/28 mpg (FWD), 19/27 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The base FWD 2018 Acura RDX has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $36,800, including the $975 destination charge. AWD adds about $1,500, while AcuraWatch adds $1,300. The most you'll find yourself paying is about $46,000, a pretty solid bargain for such a nicely equipped vehicle. We think it's a good idea to spend the extra $1,300 on the AcuraWatch package, as it adds significant convenience and safety for a relatively small sum. At these prices, a new RDX undercuts almost every rival except the smaller Infiniti QX30 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkc/">Lincoln MKC</a>. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/xc60/">Volvo XC60</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx50/">Infiniti QX50</a> are in the same ballpark, and the Germans can be $15,000 higher when they're loaded up.

[<p>The 2018 Acura RLX is the flagship sedan from the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> division of <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a>. The RLX tends to fly beneath the radar compared to more popular rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a>, but look closer and you'll find a cutting-edge powertrain and a strong value proposition. The RLX luxury sedan is available in two forms: as a standard, V6-powered model, or the Sport Hybrid. In this case, "hybrid" and "sport" do go hand in hand, thanks to a sophisticated system that pairs a V6 with three <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motors and an impressive all-wheel-drive system. For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rlx/">Acura RLX</a> gains freshened styling, more standard features and a price drop in an effort to bring this outlier further into the circle of consideration.</p>, <p>If you prioritize high-tech engineering and value over driving a luxury sedan that everyone immediately recognizes and envies, the 2018 Acura RLX is worth considering. Of the two trims, we recommend the RLX Sport Hybrid, which has standard all-wheel drive, more power, added features and higher fuel efficiency.<b></b></p>, <p>Compared to rivals, the RLX offers far fewer trims, doesn't have CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration, and isn't as well known. And while <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/acura/">Acura</a> vehicles have a good record of reliability, the RLX's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> is below average.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Acura RLX sedan gets updates to its exterior and interior, including a stylish new grille and redesigned seats. Standard V6 models gain a 10-speed automatic transmission, and Sport Hybrid variants get a new battery pack that yields more trunk space. Also new is Traffic Jam Assist, which helps keep the vehicle centered in lanes.</p>, <p>The RLX comes in two flavors, both of which have admirable power and comfort. But your needs and desires will determine whether you go with the standard, front-wheel-drive (FWD) V6 model or the RLX Sport Hybrid, which has all-wheel drive (AWD) standard and a sophisticated powertrain shared in part from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/nsx/">Acura NSX</a> supercar. If you live where it snows or has inclement weather, you'll appreciate the excellent traction from Acura's "super handling all-wheel-drive" (SH-AWD) system. This is also the model to get if you have a performance bent. With a total of 377 horsepower from the V6 and three electric motors, the Sport Hybrid has a 67-horsepower advantage over the standard model. Beyond the extra power is how it's implemented. That electric assist means power is on tap over a broad range. And kudos to the AWD system, which provided great grip when driven hard on L.A.'s famed Mulholland Drive. As a pure sports sedan, we still give the nod to a BMW 5 Series, which has more steering feel and a more agile nature. Where the RLX shines is as a sophisticated sleeper with a quiet and comfortable ride, and a gasoline/electric powertrain that is among the most sophisticated in the business.</p>, <p>PUTTING THE SPORT IN HYBRID<br/> <a alt_o_t="Hybrids" href="/hybrid/">Hybrids</a> aren't usually associated with power and performance, but the RLX Sport Hybrid bucks that notion. Melding a V6 engine with three electric motors -- including two in back that independently power each rear wheel -- this top-line RLX is an engineering marvel with skillful road manners and an innovative AWD system.<br/> <br/> 14-SPEAKER KRELL AUDIO SYSTEM<br/> Here's another reason to opt for the RLX Sport Hybrid. Krell has long been a respected maker of some of the finest home audio hardware that money can buy, and the RLX Sport Hybrid is currently the only vehicle available with its car audio system.<br/> </p>, <p>The Acura RLX has a spacious 5-passenger cabin, with generous room both front and rear. The 12-way-power front seats have been redesigned with more bolstering. We found them comfortable even after a full day of driving. Rear-seat legroom is generous at 38.8 inches. In the standard RLX, trunk cargo room is respectable at 14.9 cubic feet, though that trails the 18-plus of the Lexus GS and Mercedes E-Class. Even though it's been slightly expanded for 2018, the RLX Hybrid's cargo space is limited to 12 cubic feet due to its battery pack. Also, there is no pass-through in the hybrid variant. The infotainment system is centered around a twin-screen system, with an 8-inch screen on top that relays information such as navigation, and a 7-inch touch screen below for audio and climate features. Functions are relatively easy to use, but the system is starting to feel dated, and there's no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto integration -- both of which can be had in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a> economy car.</p>, <p>At the introduction of the 2018 RLX, Acura execs admit that the past styling of this flagship was too sedate, especially considering the performance positioning of the Sport Hybrid. It's a "wolf in sheep's clothing," they said. But with this mid-cycle refresh, Acura "lets more of the wolf show." The metal is all-new up front from the windshield's A-pillar, with the biggest visual distinction being the new diamond-pentagon grille. The rear fascia of this 4-door luxury sedan has also been freshened, with a new, horizontal taillight treatment that really pops. Size-wise, the 2018 RLX remains something of a tweener between mid- and full-size. At over 198 inches in length it is longer than rivals such as the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes E-Class, Lexus GS and Audi A6.</p>, <p>For 2018, Acura has further simplified the offerings in this low-volume seller. The standard RLX has a V6 engine and Acura's P-AWS system -- that stands for Precision All-Wheel Steer -- and a roster of amenities. They include leather interior, navigation with real-time traffic, tri-zone climate control, 12-way-power front seats with heating, moonroof, and 14-speaker audio system with Bluetooth, USB input and HD Radio. The AcuraWatch safety and driver-assist system bundles forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist.</p>, <p>The way to get more amenities and features in a 2018 RLX is by stepping up to the Sport Hybrid model. In addition to more power and its sophisticated powertrain, it adds that fine Krell audio system (see Favorite Features), ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and heated steering wheel, surround-view camera, parking sensors, head-up display and an upgraded climate system with air-quality sensor. Other nice touches include a power rear sunshade, windshield de-icer and auto-dimming side mirrors. Options in the traditional sense are limited to premium exterior paint for a very reasonable $400 and dealer accessories.</p>, <p>The standard RLX is front-wheel drive and is powered by a 3.5-liter V6. New this year is a 10-speed automatic transmission that replaces the previous 6-speed. It is perfectly acceptable and comfortable for a premium car, but not all that engaging to drive. Our preference is the all-wheel-drive RLX Sport Hybrid, which pairs the 3.5-liter V6 engine with three electric motors. One of the motors is housed in front, integrated into the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and turns with the crankshaft. The two others are in back, each powering a rear wheel. In addition to providing power, they can also apply negative torque vectoring through regenerative braking. All this happens behind the scenes, but the effect is smooth and can be engaging when pushed.<br>

The standard RLX has a V6 engine and Acura's P-AWS system -- that stands for Precision All-Wheel Steer -- and a roster of amenities. They include leather interior, navigation with real-time traffic, tri-zone climate control, 12-way-power front seats with heating, moonroof, and 14-speaker audio system with Bluetooth, USB input and HD Radio. The AcuraWatch safety and driver-assist system bundles forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist.</p>, <p>The way to get more amenities and features in a 2018 RLX is by stepping up to the Sport Hybrid model. In addition to more power and its sophisticated powertrain, it adds that fine Krell audio system (see Favorite Features), ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and heated steering wheel, surround-view camera, parking sensors, head-up display and an upgraded climate system with air-quality sensor. Other nice touches include a power rear sunshade, windshield de-icer and auto-dimming side mirrors. Options in the traditional sense are limited to premium exterior paint for a very reasonable $400 and dealer accessories.</p>, <p>The standard RLX is front-wheel drive and is powered by a 3.5-liter V6. New this year is a 10-speed automatic transmission that replaces the previous 6-speed. It is perfectly acceptable and comfortable for a premium car, but not all that engaging to drive. Our preference is the all-wheel-drive RLX Sport Hybrid, which pairs the 3.5-liter V6 engine with three electric motors. One of the motors is housed in front, integrated into the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and turns with the crankshaft. The two others are in back, each powering a rear wheel. In addition to providing power, they can also apply negative torque vectoring through regenerative braking. All this happens behind the scenes, but the effect is smooth and can be engaging when pushed.<br>

Acura has changed the pricing structure for 2018, and by making standard in the Sport Hybrid formerly optional features, has actually dropped the price by several thousand dollars.

---------http://www.kbb.com/acura/tlx/2018
[<p>For 2018, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/acura/">Acura</a> has given its best-selling TLX <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> its first update, and it's a good one. The original TLX did a fine job of establishing itself as a technology-rich, comfortably smooth <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> sedan, but it didn’t stir the driver's soul like other cars in its class. That changes this year. Building on the strong foundation of the first TLX, Acura added gorgeous front-end styling and a compelling A-Spec model that gives the driving experience more bite. Throw in excellent safety features, a strong value proposition, and options like Acura's Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) and a potent V6 engine, and the TLX is the readiest it has ever been to compete with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q50/">Infiniti Q50</a>.</p>, <p>The new TLX is one of the smartest investments in the segment, thanks to its mix of performance, technology and <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>. It also finally has the good looks that show off all the pluses that this car has to offer.</p>, <p>The TLX doesn’t have the prestige of the 3 Series or C-Class, but it's an excellent car that most people will enjoy. The new A-Spec model is fun, but doesn’t add more power and isn't in the same atmosphere as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m3/">BMW M3</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s4/">Audi S4</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats-v/">Cadillac ATS-V</a>.</p>, <p>The TLX's major refresh adds a performance-biased A-Spec model, which has sport-tuned suspension, unique styling cues, a different steering ratio and interior differences compared to the rest of the lineup. All models receive fresh, attractive new front-end styling. Acura also made the infotainment system easier to use.</p>, <p>While there are two engines to choose from, our drive time in the TLX focused on the V6-equipped A-Spec and the V6 Advance. The steering is linear and nicely weighted in both models, but in the A-Spec the response is quicker. There is no power difference between the two V6 models (290 horsepower), and the 9-speed automatic, retuned for 2018, shifts quickly and smoothly. In addition to a sport-tuned suspension, the A-Spec offers better-bolstered seats and unique 19-inch tires. The result is a sporty driver-centric car that's a blast on curvy roads. With the A-Spec you lose some ride quality on straight stretches of road; if that's a problem, you can look to the more serene V6 Advance. The V6 Advance is the more comfortable of the two on the open road and the seats feel a little flatter, but this trim level is still great fun to drive.</p>, <p>SUPER HANDLING All-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
 While many cars are available with all-wheel drive, SH-AWD is different. In addition to providing all-weather traction, SH-AWD is a torque-vectoring setup that constantly routes torque to all four wheels -- splitting power front and rear, and to the individual rear wheels -- improving cornering and stability.<br>
<br>
 A-SPEC SPORT-TUNED SUSPENSION<br>
 The A-Spec package brings a new, more driver-centric attitude to the TLX. At the core is an A-Spec-unique suspension with larger stabilizer bars and stiffer spring rates. It works with a quicker steering ratio and special 19-inch tires to make canyon roads downright entertaining.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The TLX's interior reflects close attention to detail, with fantastic fit and finish and appealing color choices. Acura has made the 2-screen infotainment system easier to use by streamlining menus and reducing the system's response time. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are operated in the top screen through a click wheel, which frees up the lower touch screen for other functions. New features include a surround-view camera, heated steering wheel and rear seats, and built-in wireless charging. The V6 TLX comes with a push-button-operated transmission. A-Spec models have different gauges and steering wheel, plus seats with more side bolstering.</p>, <p>You have to notice a car to see how good it is, and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/tlx/">Acura TLX</a> finally has the styling that will get it noticed. With a clean pentagon grille and sharper LED headlights, the new front end draws the eye and makes the car look fresh and youthful. V6-equipped models add chrome accents in the front and rear, and Advance models receive LED fog lights and a rear spoiler. The A-Spec TLX fills the grille with matte-black diamond accents, adds A-Spec-specific styling cues in the front and rear, and rides on 19-inch Shark Gray wheels.</p>, <p>Base engine for the TLX is a 206-horsepower, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. The TLX 2.4 rides on 17-inch wheels and comes with adaptive cruise control, heated side mirrors, paddle shifters, 7-speaker audio, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, moonroof, and 10-way-power driver seat with power lumbar adjustment. (The passenger seat is power-4-way adjustable.) Standard seat material is Leatherette; front seat heaters are also standard. There's an extensive list of standard safety features -- including AcuraWatch with forward-collision warning, lane-keep assist, road-departure mitigation -- plus collision-mitigation braking and seven airbags.</p>, <p>The TLX's optional engine is a 290-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive is available in V6-powered models. Other options include navigation, 10-speaker audio, leather seats, GPS-linked climate control, parking sensors, rear seat-heaters, ventilated front seats, surround-view camera system, blind-spot information, rear cross-traffic monitor, and wireless smartphone charging. The A-Spec model is the only way you can get an Alcantara interior; it's also the only one available in Still Night Blue Pearl paint and with 19-inch Shark Gray wheels.</p>, <p>There are two available engines. The 206-horsepower, 2.4-liter 4-cylinder is backed by an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Models powered with the 4-cylinder are front-wheel drive (FWD) only. The optional engine is a 290-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Both transmissions have been retuned for 2018. SH-AWD is optional with the V6; any TLX models that aren't equipped with all-wheel drive (AWD) receive Precision All-Wheel Steering. The V6 engine is well-suited to this sedan, and thanks to stop/start (AWD-only) and cylinder deactivation, it offers a lot more power than the 4-cylinder without a huge fuel-economy penalty.<br>

As for resale, we expect the TLX to hold strong 5-year residual values, similar to the Audi A4 and higher than the BMW 3 Series and Infiniti Q50, but just shy of the Lexus IS.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/alfa-romeo/4c-spider/2018
[<p>The 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe and Spider are endowed with a lightweight body, an eager 237-horsepower turbocharged engine and a suspension specifically designed for the track. Unlike the Chevrolet Corvette, BMW Z4 and Porsche 718 Cayman, however, the 4C can’t serve double duty as a comfortable daily driver. The stiff suspension and noisy interior are bad enough, but the standard steering setup offers no power assist. While this design is ideal for performing maneuvers at high speeds, it requires plentiful bicep strength when parallel-parking or attempting a low-speed U-turn. In short, the 4C is a purist’s car, but for those seeking what it has to offer, it may also be the perfect car.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a pure driver’s car, one specifically designed for the track but that’s also street legal, the 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C is it. Once in motion, the driver practically becomes one with the car, and while the ride can be uncomfortable, the driving experience is simply exquisite.</p>, <p>If you desire a performance coupe as comfortable on the track as it is on the highway, the Alfa 4C may not be the best choice. A Porsche 718 Cayman or Chevy Corvette offers more sophistication, better comfort and actual power-assisted steering.</p>, <p>Changes to the 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C are minor. A new front fascia with carbon-fiber vents is optional on both the coupe and convertible, while black leather seating with yellow accent stitching is now optional on cars painted black, white or gray.</p>, <p>The Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe and Spider are the automotive equivalent of a surgeon's scalpel. As a scalpel is the perfect tool in the hands of a skilled surgeon, a good driver can feel great behind the wheel of the 4C. The unassisted steering communicates the experience of every block of tire tread. On paper it's out-powered by a Camry, but the 237-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder is only working against 2,500 pounds, making the 4C genuinely fast with only a hint of turbo lag. The dual-clutch automatic transmission shifts lightning quick, and there's a distinct difference among the various “DNA” (for Dynamic, Natural, Advanced Efficiency) drive modes. Yet, like a scalpel cutting vegetables, the 4C is sorely out of its element once you've left the racetrack. The suspension pounds over bumps, the engine screams constantly, the exhaust barks like a neighborhood dog, and at low speed that unassisted steering feels like pulling your arms out of tar.</p>, <p>CARBON-FIBER MONOCOQUE<br>
 Thanks to a generous helping of carbon fiber, the 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C is both lightweight and fully capable of meeting all crash-test standards. The monocoque body design mimics those of racing cars and exotics far exceeding the 4C price range.<br>
<br>
 UNASSISTED STEERING<br>
 Excluding power assist from the 4C steering was purely a performance-based decision. While difficult to operate at lower speeds, the lack of power assist means the link between the driver and road is unfiltered, resulting in the most precise steering with minimal input.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>One look at the 4C’s interior shows the designers placed a heavy emphasis on function over comfort. While we found much of the material and assembly to be quite good, there were a few glaring no-no’s. The seats bolt directly to the body, are manually operated and have limited range of motion. The result is a rather upright driving position, cramped shoulder room but, thankfully, good legroom. The audio system lacks the power or clarity to overcome interior wind and road noise, and the toolbox excuse for a trunk (3.7 cubic feet) behind the engine can barely hold a single overnight bag.</p>, <p>This is a gorgeous car, with tidy lines, functional scoops and that oh-so-Alfa grille neatly integrated into a compact shape. The design evokes the Type 33 Stradale from the 1960s, but you're struck by the smallness of the Alfa Romeo 4C, especially in a parking lot full of giant SUVs, monstrous Camrys and hulking Civics. That assertive nose sits near the ground, making driveway approaches challenging, and rear visibility is poor. The Spider’s convertible top is a canvas targa top that stores in the trunk when rolled up. Surprisingly, it’s easy to get in and out of this tiny sports car.</p>, <p>Since saving weight was a goal, the Alfa Romeo 4C contains the basics and little else. There are power auto-down windows, air conditioning, a 7-inch color gauge-cluster display and a 4-speaker sound system with USB and audio inputs. The 4C uses its DNA selector that chooses from four different driving modes, which vary the aggressiveness of the throttle, transmission and stability control. Filling out the safety roster are front airbags, door-mounted side airbags and a driver's-knee airbag, along with stability control, traction control and hill-start assist.</p>, <p>Options up the ante on performance, as if it were somehow lacking in the base car. Available are a dual-mode titanium exhaust from aftermarket company Akrapovic, and two track packages featuring firmer shocks and larger anti-roll bars, plus street-legal racing tires and a unique red-stitched steering wheel. There’s an upgraded audio system as well, but honestly, the engine sounds better. The Rosso Competizione Red tri-coat color looks amazing, and you can choose different wheel options as well. Spring for the rear parking sensors; we'd prefer a camera, but we'll take what we can get to help with the poor sightlines.</p>, <p>The Alfa 4C is powered by mid-mounted, 1.7-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine good for 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. While you’ll find more horsepower in most family sedans, the 4C’s diminutive 2,500-pound weight permits an impressive 10.4 power-to-weight ratio. The 4C can sprint to 60 mph in just 4.1 seconds, but you’ll have to get past the brief turbo lag before you really feel the power kick in. The only transmission is a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic that can also be shifted manually via a set of paddle shifters. Even with its downshift rev-matching technology, this transmission just isn’t as satisfying as a good manual, something a car like the 4C is simply screaming for.<br>
<br>
 1.7-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 237 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 2,200 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/34 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The basic 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe starts with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $57,500, including the $1,595 destination charge. The 2018 4C Spider still rings in at about $67,500. If you start adding options, you'll add about another $10,000 to each car thanks to things like a $2,750 carbon-fiber roof bar, a $2,000 carbon-trimmed interior, or the $1,600 Track Package. Still, it's fairly priced considering it's practically a race car. However, note that the far more livable Porsche 718 Cayman and Chevrolet Corvette undercut the Alfa in price, while offering better ride comfort and interior refinement. However, nobody ever bought a new Alfa Romeo on the strength of its resale value (poor to so-so) or low 5-year cost to own. These cars are bought because of love. But if you’re curious, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Alfa 4C.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/alfa-romeo/giulia/2018
[<p>Alfa Romeo’s recent return to the United States market hinges on the success of the new Giulia sedan. The sexy and sophisticated <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/alfa%20romeo/giulia/2018/">2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia</a> is an Italian alternative to popular small German sports sedans like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a>. With rear-wheel drive and powerful engines, the new Giulia offers exceptional performance and spirited handling. Behind the Giulia’s traditional Alfa grille are turbocharged engines starting with a 280-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, while the high-performance Quadrifoglio model gets a class-leading 505-horsepower V6 that outpowers the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m3/">BMW M3</a> and Mercedes C 63 AMG. Six trim levels are available, with prices starting around $39,000, and all-wheel drive is an available option on most trim levels for $2,000.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a sexy small-sports sedan with turbocharged horsepower, room for five and a starting price below $40,000, you’ll like the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/alfa%20romeo/giulia/">Alfa Romeo Giulia</a>. And if you’re looking to outrun and out-style your friend’s BMW M3, then you’ll love the 505-horsepower Giulia Quadrifoglio.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a hybrid sedan in this class, look elsewhere. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and Mercedes offer hybrid versions of the 3 Series and the C-Class. Also, Alfa’s reputation for reliability isn’t the best and the Giulia’s base price is considerably higher than the starting price of a BMW 320i.</p>, <p>Although the Giulia was all-new just last year, updates for 2018 are extensive. Alfa has updated the interior trim on the base model and added Forward Collision Plus and a harman/kardon premium audio system to the Giulia Quadrifoglio. New available options include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.</p>, <p>The 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia has a tidy footprint. Its compact size, snug sport seats and responsive steering are the stuff of which legendary sports sedans are made. In base rear-drive (RWD) form or the slightly tauter Ti versions in either rear- or optional all-wheel drive (AWD), the new Giulia provides spirited handling and a relaxed ride thanks to its 50:50 weight distribution and a willing 280-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. The smooth-shifting 8-speed torque-converter automatic provides quick shifts whether left to its own devices or controlled via steering-column-mounted paddles. For the ultimate in performance, opt for the range-topping rear-drive-only Quadrifoglio trim level with its Ferrari-produced 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6, which pumps out 505 horsepower. For those lucky enough to own the Quadrifoglio (which stands for “4-leaf clover”), they’ll find a car capable of being an everyday driver if left in Comfort mode and yet has the chops to make it a track-day hero.</p>, <p>TURBOCHARGED ENGINES<br>
In this class turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engines are ubiquitous, but Alfa’s version of the popular powerplant puts out 280 horsepower, which is more than the 2.0-liters in the BMW 328i, Audi A4 and Mercedes C 300. Alfa says the Giulia with all-wheel drive sprints to 60 mph in just 5.1 seconds.<br>
<br>
Q4 ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
Available on the base Giulia and the Giulia Ti trim level, Alfa’s Q4 all-wheel drive turns this rear-drive sports sedan into an all-season tourer. The system has the ability to deliver up to 60 percent of the engine’s torque to the front wheels and costs an additional $2,000.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Inside, the 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia looks and feels like a high-performance Italian sports sedan. Alfa even puts the engine start button on the Giulia’s leather-wrapped steering wheel, just like its sister-brand <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ferrari/">Ferrari</a>. It’s a cool touch. Soft Italian leather is standard and sport seats are available on the Ti trim. There are plenty of soft-touch materials and the large flowing dash is covered in a choice of real wood accents or brushed aluminum and carbon fiber for a more performance-oriented style. A 6.5-inch screen is standard, but the Ti and Quadrifoglio trim levels get a more desirable 8.8-inch screen.</p>, <p>An ugly Alfa is like a Justin Bieber presidency, it ain’t ever gonna happen. The 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia brings much needed sex appeal to a segment brimming with attractive but safe and stoic designs. This is a provocative and powerful-looking sedan, from its traditional Alfa triangle grille to the gentle sculpting of the body surfaces, and the new Giulia gains presence as you move up to the Ti and Quadrifoglio models, thanks to larger wheel-and-tire packages. And the optional sport pack on the Ti brings the same front and rear fascias and 19-inch wheels used on the QV.</p>, <p>The equipment list is fairly comprehensive for the new Giulia, which includes Brembo disc brakes, 17-inch alloy wheels, leather interior, dual-zone climate control, push-button start mounted on the steering wheel, rearview camera with cross-traffic detection, park sensors, keyless entry, advanced brake assist, bi-xenon headlights, and 6-way-power seats. Step up to the Ti model and you get 18-inch wheels, heated seats and steering wheel, a larger 8.8-inch screen for the infotainment system and gray wood interior trim. The fully loaded Quadrifoglio includes 19-inch wheels with high-performance tires, 12-way-adjustable sport seats, carbon-fiber and aluminum accents, LED running lights and rear carbon-fiber spoiler.</p>, <p>Alfa has expanded the Giulia’s option list for 2018. Available upgrades include a premium harman/kardon audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, dual-pane sunroof and on Ti models, Q4 all-wheel drive, Sport and Lusso packages including 12-way-adjustable sport seats and 18- and 19-inch wheels as well as navigation. Quadrifoglio buyers can opt for carbon-ceramic disc brakes and power-adjustable Sparco high-performance sport seats covered in a combination of leather and Alcantara and an Alcantara-covered steering wheel. Other cool extras include navigation, and safety systems like blind-spot monitoring, front and rear parking sensors and Lane Departure Warning.</p>, <p>There are two engines in the lineup, the base turbocharged 2.0-liter inline 4-cylinder that makes 280 horsepower and the Ferrari-developed and -built 505-horsepower 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6. In keeping with their pedigree, both engines have exhaust notes that are uniquely Italian. The only gearbox offered on the new Alfa Giulia is an 8-speed torque-converter automatic transmission that provides smooth, sure and swift shifts.<br>

The 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio stickers for about $72,000, with a higher delivery charge of $1,595. The new Alfa Giulia slightly undercuts the BMW 330i’s sticker, while besting that car’s horsepower by 32 ponies; however, the 320i is less expensive than the Alfa and the 340i is more powerful. While the Quadrifoglio is about $6,000 more than the M3, it too has a significant 80-horsepower edge in output.

The Stelvio has an intrinsic allure and natural dynamism that could be just the keys to cracking its competitive segment.</p>, <p>If you want a 2-row/5-passenger compact-luxury SUV that stands out with its design, athletic manners and sheer newness, the 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio checks all the boxes. If you've simply been waiting for an Italian SUV at a reasonable price, the Stelvio's sub-$43,000 starting point is tempting.</p>, <p>The flip side of the above is that the all-new Stelvio is an unknown quantity. And while Alfa Romeo is part of the massive <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/fiat/">Fiat</a> <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> Automobiles conglomerate, the Alfa brand itself is still making inroads back into the United States.</p>, <p>The 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a brand-new compact-luxury SUV. It will debut in five trims, all with standard all-wheel drive and a 280-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder. Forthcoming is the Stelvio Quadrifoglio, a high-performance version with a 505-horsepower twin-turbo V6. The name “Stelvio” refers to a famed driving road in the Italian Alps.</p>, <p>Just about every luxury automaker aspires to put the "sport" in their sport-utility vehicle, but few have found a formula that fights the physics inherent in a higher-riding, 2-ton hauler. Count Alfa among the minority that has made a crossover SUV that is legitimately fun to drive. With 280 horsepower/306 lb-ft of torque on tap, the Stelvio is among the most powerful in its class, with gusto to go 0-60 mph in 5.4 seconds. A rear-biased all-wheel-drive system and near-perfect 50/50 weight balance further the Stelvio's SUV-as-sports-car cause, as do a quick-shifting 8-speed transmission and drive-mode selector with a "dynamic" setting for a sportier feel. Thankfully, the Stelvio's athletic nature doesn't come at the cost of comfort. Away from the mountain passes and in more typical ordinary driving, we found the Stelvio compliant and easy to maneuver, only wishing for less wind intrusion and grabbier brakes.</p>, <p>REASSURING WARRANTY<br/> If you're wary about reliability issues in your Italian luxury SUV, Alfa Romeo aims to inspire confidence in its product via its warranty. The Stelvio comes with a 4-year/50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, while the powertrain is covered for five years/100,000 miles.<br/> <br/> <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/alfa%20romeo/stelvio/">ALFA ROMEO STELVIO</a> QUADRIFOGLIO<br/> We haven't driven it yet, but the specs alone speak volumes. Arriving in early 2018, the Stelvio Quadrifoglio will pack the same 505-horsepower twin-turbo V6 that's been stuffed into the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/alfa%20romeo/giulia/">Alfa Romeo Giulia</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>. With this Ferrari-derived engine, Alfa predicts the Stelvio Quadrifoglio will hit 60 mph in 3.9 seconds.<br/> </p>, <p>The Stelvio has an appealing 2-row/5-passenger cabin. It is well-crafted with leather, available aluminum or wood trim, and a prominently horizontal dash highlighted by a 6.5-inch or 8.8-inch wide-screen infotainment display. The sport front seats have thick side bolsters that will snugly hold you in place, but they may be <i>too</i> snug for those with larger frames. If that's the case, opt for the standard seats. Like many of its rivals, the Stelvio's rear legroom is tight at only 31.9 inches. Cargo capacity is adequate, with 18.5 cubic feet of space with the rear seats up and 56.5 with them down.</p>, <p>It's easy to see this Italian SUV emphasizes "sport" rather than "utility." The Stelvio boasts a sleek and flowing profile, with a long hood whose face looks like nothing else out there. Called the "Scudetto," Alfa Romeos have been using this prominent triangular design for eight decades. The Stelvio's sides have an upward sweeping beltline that meets muscular rear haunches and a sloped rear window, which is certainly more stylish than practical. On the utilitarian side, the Stelvio has a power-operated tailgate and 8.1 inches of ground clearance -- good to help deal with snow or light trails.</p>, <p>Upon debut, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio premium SUV comes in five trims: Base, Sport, Ti, Ti Sport and Ti Lusso. Even a base Stelvio is a nicely equipped, Italian-crafted machine. Among the highlights are leather interior, 10-way-power front seats, power liftgate, dual-zone climate control, rearview camera with rear parking sensors, and rain-sensing wipers. The standard 8-speaker audio system bundles AM/FM/HD Radio, has four USB outlets, and is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Stelvio Sport models have a sport-tuned suspension, big steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles and 19-inch wheels in lieu of the standard 18-inchers.</p>, <p>The midtrim Stelvio Ti still represents a good value and adds heated front seats and steering wheel, heated windshield-washer nozzle, front parking sensors and the larger, 8.8-inch wide-screen display. Ti Sport models include 20-inch wheels and 12-way-power adjustable sport seats with premium leather, while the Ti Lusso swaps aluminum trim for warmer wood accents and luxury leather upholstery. Options include navigation, harman/kardon premium audio system and dual-pane sunroof. Packages bundle features like hands-free tailgate, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking with forward collision, lane-departure warning, and automatic high-beam assist.</p>, <p>The base motivator and initial engine debuting in the Alfa Romeo Stelvio is an impressive 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that spits out 280 horsepower and over 300 lb-ft of torque. These figures are higher than most of the Stelvio's rivals. Also in the Alfa's favor is standard all-wheel drive. The Alfa has a 3-mode selector called Alfa DNA, for Dynamic, Natural or Advanced Efficiency drive modes. The Stelvio uses a ZF 8-speed automatic transmission that pairs well with this engine. Like many of its rivals, the Stelvio has an engine start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle to save fuel. Thankfully, it can be manually defeated. The Stelvio is rated to tow up to 3,000 pounds. Coming later will be the high-performance Stelvio Quadrifoglio.<br>

The Stelvio Sport and Stelvio Ti both start just under $45,000, while the Ti Sport and Ti Lusso begin at $47,490. Festooned with packages and options, an Alfa Stelvio can reach into the mid-$50,000 range. At these prices, this Alfa Romeo SUV is in line with rivals like the BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Audi Q5, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-pace/">Jaguar F-Pace</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/xc60/">Volvo XC60</a>.

[<p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/aston%20martin/vanquish%20s/">Aston Martin Vanquish S</a> is the lone holdout of a seductive design dating back to when <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> owned a controlling stake in the storied British automaker. Due to be replaced next year by an all-new model, Aston Martin’s 2018 Vanquish S exotic remains the company flagship, a brilliant performance coupe that turns heads wherever it goes, even more so in its <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/convertible/">convertible</a> Volante form. At nearly $300,000, the Vanquish S is one of the most expensive mass-produced exotic <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a> on the market, and with its 580-horsepower V12, it’s also one of the most powerful. The design remains awe-inspiring, although technologically it is falling behind newer models like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> Turbo, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/r8/">Audi R8</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ferrari/california/">Ferrari California</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking an exotic, hand-built GT with an unquestioned heritage, gobs of power and a stunning exterior, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/aston%20martin/vanquish%20s/2018/">2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S</a> coupe or Volante convertible certainly deserves a test drive.</p>, <p>Exclusivity comes at a price and in the case of the 2018 Vanquish S, that price is outdated technology and performance that can be matched or surpassed by any number of less expensive exotics, from the Porsche 911 Turbo to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S coupe and Volante convertible are all that remains of the Vanquish fleet. The base Vanquish will finish out its run at the end of 2017 with an all-new design set to debut in 2019.</p>, <p>The 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S employs a snarling V12 good for 580 horsepower, all of which is directed to the rear wheels. This combo helps the sleek British super coupe dart to 60 mph in just over 3.5 seconds and achieve a top speed of 201 mph. On the open road, the Vanquish S is a brilliant performer, a grand touring car that can be comfortable when needed and tenacious when the asphalt gets complicated. It’s not a car that can chase down a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mclaren/">McLaren</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> on the track, but it won’t be far behind. Power from the V12 comes on steadily without hesitation aided by a refined 8-speed automatic transmission. The heated and cooled leather seats are supremely comfortable, although they can feel a bit snug. The steering, braking and cornering all happen without effort or alarm, but this car could do with better rear visibility.</p>, <p>MAGNIFICENT EXTERIOR<br>
Maybe it’s because the 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S’s exterior has stood the test of time, or maybe it’s that whole James Bond thing, but whatever it is that sucks us in, the Vanquish Coupe and Volante Convertible have it in spades.<br>
<br>
V12 ENGINE<br>
There is nothing more mechanically melodious than a perfectly balanced V12 displacing 5.9 liters and making 580 horsepower. In the 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S, this engine delivers its power without hesitation, right up to the 201-mph limit.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Coupe versions of the 2018 Vanquish S GT have seating for two, with the rear area designed to hold cargo. The Vanquish S Volante convertible has 2+2 seating, but the rear seats are tight and best used for storage. Materials are ultra-luxurious, from the plush leather to the carbon-fiber trim. Indeed, Aston Martin’s 2018 Vanquish S's exterior makes a statement to everyone outside, while the interior does the same for the lucky driver and passenger. Even starting up this handcrafted machine is special: Place a rectangular glass prism in a slot in the center stack and the Vanquish roars to life.</p>, <p>Clearly, there is no effort within the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/aston%20martin/">Aston Martin</a> design team to brew up the flavor of the moment. Instantly recognizable as an Aston, the Vanquish S is finely drawn to reflect an unerring salute to the timelessness of the marque’s heritage. This car would have looked great decades ago and will still look great a century from now. The front end is unmistakably Aston Martin, and the form of the whole will never be confused with anything else. Vanquish coupes have a gorgeously raked roof, while the Volante convertible is of course at its best with the fabric roof folded.</p>, <p>What does nearly $300,000 worth of Aston Martin buy? Plenty of ultra-high-performance hardware for sure, starting with that V12 engine. There's an opulent interior, too, drenched in fine leather and top-notch materials. A 13-speaker/1,000-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen system will please audiophiles, and the new AMI III infotainment system with navigation helps make the Vanquish feel somewhat current -- but with a display that's only 6.5 inches, it's no <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> or Mercedes. And while parking sensors and a rearview camera come standard, forget about active safety and driving features like lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control or automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>As if a 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S isn't exclusive enough, you can tailor yours to the color scheme you like, right down to the shade of the brake calipers and seat belts. Ventilated seats are also available, as are a 6-disc CD changer, auto-dimming rearview mirror and universal garage-door opener (yes, those are still extra on a $300,000 British supercar). Unlike mainstream luxury brands, you won't find options like wireless phone charging, automatic parking assist and semi-autonomous driving features.</p>, <p>The 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S is available with one engine and transmission choice: a 5.9-liter naturally aspirated V12 with 580 horsepower and a “rear mid-mounted” 8-speed automatic that can be operated with paddle shifters. Helping put the power to the ground is a limited-slip differential and a launch-control function. The engine defines all the attributes expected for a car at this level: smooth, responsive, strong. It’s likely no Vanquish owner will actually see 200 mph, but rest assured, given enough clear pavement, this thing will do it. It shouldn't be a surprise that such a big engine is thirsty. So thirsty that you'll pay $1,300 in a gas-guzzler tax.<br>
<br>
5.9-liter V12<br>
580 horsepower @ 7,000 rpm<br>
465 lb-ft of torque @ 5,500 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/21 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Aston Martin's flagship Vanquish S coupe carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) around $298,000, including gas-guzzler tax and destination. The Volante starts around $316,000. With paint schemes and trim pieces alone costing several thousand dollars, the Vanquish's price tag can accelerate as quickly as the car itself once options are added. These prices will make most people's jaws drop, but if you're seriously considering this car, it's no doubt just another number. If you're a multimillionaire on a budget, however, know that you can get more performance and features for less in any number of cars, from an Audi R8 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mclaren/570s/">McLaren 570S</a> to a Mercedes-AMG SL65. But we also realize that the 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish S isn't likely to be your only exotic.</p>]

[<p>For 2018, Audi’s A3 compact-luxury sports car is offered as a sedan, convertible and, in the A3 Sportback e-tron, a plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a>. Although small, the A3 contains all the requisite <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> parts, including a powerful engine lineup, a quality interior, loads of high-tech goodies, and the option of quattro all-wheel drive. This combination of features and performance gives the A3, and its high-performance S3 and RS 3 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/rs-3/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) cousins, a leg up on rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/cla/">Mercedes-Benz CLA</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/ilx/">Acura ILX</a>, all while keeping its pricing well below that of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/2%20series/">BMW 2 Series</a>. Audi’s 2018 A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid is the line’s fuel-economy leader, but sadly it doesn’t offer the option of quattro all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With a base price starting around $33,000, it’s easy to load up a 2018 Audi A3 Sedan or Cabriolet convertible with familiar Audi <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> features and still walk away for less than $40K. The sport-oriented S3 and RS 3 offer sizzling performance, but at a hefty price.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A3 doesn’t have the same visual pop as a Mercedes-Benz CLA or an Infiniti QX30, and you’ll find a better price and more legroom in an Acura ILX. Although its base price is attractive, once you start piling on options, the A3/S3 can easily approach the $50,000 mark.</p>, <p>Audi’s 2018 A3 Sedan and Cabriolet gain standard heated front seats and two USB charging ports. The Premium Plus trim gains Audi Side Assist, while the Technology package now includes the Bang &amp; Olufsen audio upgrade. The S3 gains a new S sport package and the e-tron, optional 18-inch wheels.<br>

At the base end, the A3 Sedan offers the perfect balance of performance, luxury and price, while the performance-oriented S3 gives more power and better handling. The 2018 A3 Cabriolet delivers similar performance as the sedan, but with the added benefit of a much larger sunroof. Priced less than many loaded family <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a3/">Audi A3</a> delivers impressive performance, quality and technology, but is woefully lacking in rear-seat legroom. With nearly 300 horsepower on tap, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/audi/s3/2018/">2018 Audi S3</a> Sedan has no problem with acceleration, and its standard quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) makes it a dynamic performer both at the track and when driving through inclement weather. The A3 Sedan and Cabriolet come standard with Audi’s 7-speed dual-clutch S-Tronic automatic, while the S3 and e-tron use a 6-speed version of the same transmission.</p>, <p>BANG &amp; OLUFSEN AUDIO<br>
Exceptional sound reproduction is the hallmark of this 705-watt, 14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system, which is optional on the 2018 Audi A3 and standard on the S3. Now part of the Technology package, for an audiophile it’s a $3,200 upgrade that’s an easy investment.<br>
<br>
AUDI ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP &amp; GO<br>
The 2018 Audi A3’s available adaptive cruise control is more than just a convenience option, it’s a valuable safety asset that could one day save your life. Audi’s radar and camera-based system can bring the car to a complete stop and then resume speed, the perfect companion during stop-and-go traffic.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Audi has set a high bar with its interiors, with high-style design and immaculate fit and finish. Yet while the 2018 A3 scores well on materials and assembly, it's a little on the bland side compared with other Audi vehicles. That said, it is cleanly designed and suitably sporty, with simple audio and climate controls. We wish the MMI infotainment interface wasn't placed quite so low on the console though, as it makes it hard to see which button does what until you've learned it by touch. Not surprisingly, rear-seat accommodations are pretty tight, especially for three passengers.</p>, <p>If you like the Audi styling aesthetic, you'll love the 2018 A3’s defining look. Looking a lot like a smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>, its standard bi-xenon headlights, big sunroof and standard 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels make even the least expensive A3 look great. Bigger 18- and 19-inch wheel-and-tire upgrades jazz up the exterior, and S3 models offer unique styling touches to emphasize the sportiness. Under the short rear deck is a 12.3-cubic-foot trunk, which reduces to 10 cubic feet in all-wheel-drive models. <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">Convertibles</a> of course offer two doors, and look especially sharp with the power soft-top lowered.</p>, <p>Standard on every 2018 Audi A3 are a rearview camera and rear-parking sensors, along with heated mirrors, front seats and windshield-washer nozzles. Other standard equipment for the sedan includes leather seats, a panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control, 12-way-power driver’s seat with power lumbar, LED taillights, Bluetooth with audio streaming, 10-speaker audio with single CD player, sensors for automatic windshield wipers and headlights and a 7-inch audio/information screen controlled by Audi's MMI interface. Opt for the sporty S3 and you'll get more power, along with quattro AWD, 18-inch alloys, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a sport-tuned suspension.</p>, <p>If you'd like to make Audi's inexpensive A3 as pricey as possible, Audi is perfectly happy to help. There are LED headlights, an excellent Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and a navigation system with Google Earth map technology viewed through Audi’s brilliant Virtual Cockpit. The last of those includes a clever touch pad atop the MMI knob that recognizes handwritten text entry. Dynamic safety features include active lane-keep assist, blind-zone warning and dynamic cruise control. Lastly, S3 models can be had with a $1,500 Magnetic Ride Control suspension system featuring three driving modes: Dynamic, Comfort and Individual.</p>, <p>Multiple engine configurations confront prospective Audi A3 owners, although all displace the same 2.0 liters. Front-wheel-drive (FWD) models employ a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder boasting 186 horsepower, which gets delivered through a dual-clutch 7-speed automatic transmission. If you want quattro AWD, you'll get an engine upgrade as well: a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 220 horsepower, as well as a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (which is also used in the econo-oriented A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid). <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s3/">Audi S3</a> models get a version of the 2.0-liter engine that sends its 292 horsepower to all four wheels. Note that both the A3 and S3 require premium fuel. The A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid diverges from its siblings, using a 1.4-liter turbocharged inline 4-cylinder paired with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor/generator.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (FWD)<br/> 186 horsepower @ 4,400-6,000 rpm<br/> 221 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/35 mpg (Sedan), 25/33 mpg (Cabriolet)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (AWD)<br/> 220 horsepower @ 4,500 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/31 mpg (Sedan), 22/30 mpg (Cabriolet)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (S3)<br/> 292 horsepower @ 5,400-6,200 rpm<br/> 280 lb-ft of torque @ 1,900-5,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/28 mpg<br/> <br/> 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 + electric motor (A3 Sportback e-tron)<br/> Engine:<br/> 150 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br/> 184 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-3,500 rpm<br/> Electric motor:<br/> 102 horsepower/243 lb-ft of torque<br/> Net output: 204 horsepower/258 lb-ft of torque<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy, est.: 83 MPGe/34 mpg combined</p>, <p>The base 2018 Audi A3 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,000. Opt for quattro AWD and the price jumps to just under $36,000. The 2018 A3 Cabriolet starts around $39,325 for FWD, or $42,000 if you want AWD. Greenies can get into a Sportback e-tron for just shy of $40,500, and the power-hungry will gravitate to the Audi S3 at just under $45,000. Options and trim levels can add considerably to the price tag, making your "cheap" Audi cost more than $50,000. The Mercedes-Benz CLA starts slightly lower, but with less standard equipment. The Acura ILX and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/verano/">Buick Verano</a> are both thousands less, but without the pedigree brand or AWD option. Check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others paid in your area. As for resale value, the A3 isn't expected to hold up over the long haul as well as the CLA, or even the ILX.<br>

Priced less than many loaded family <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a3/">Audi A3</a> delivers impressive performance, quality and technology, but is woefully lacking in rear-seat legroom. With nearly 300 horsepower on tap, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/audi/s3/2018/">2018 Audi S3</a> Sedan has no problem with acceleration, and its standard quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) makes it a dynamic performer both at the track and when driving through inclement weather. The A3 Sedan and Cabriolet come standard with Audi’s 7-speed dual-clutch S-Tronic automatic, while the S3 and e-tron use a 6-speed version of the same transmission.</p>, <p>BANG &amp; OLUFSEN AUDIO<br>
Exceptional sound reproduction is the hallmark of this 705-watt, 14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system, which is optional on the 2018 Audi A3 and standard on the S3. Now part of the Technology package, for an audiophile it’s a $3,200 upgrade that’s an easy investment.<br>
<br>
AUDI ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP &amp; GO<br>
The 2018 Audi A3’s available adaptive cruise control is more than just a convenience option, it’s a valuable safety asset that could one day save your life. Audi’s radar and camera-based system can bring the car to a complete stop and then resume speed, the perfect companion during stop-and-go traffic.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Audi has set a high bar with its interiors, with high-style design and immaculate fit and finish. Yet while the 2018 A3 scores well on materials and assembly, it's a little on the bland side compared with other Audi vehicles. That said, it is cleanly designed and suitably sporty, with simple audio and climate controls. We wish the MMI infotainment interface wasn't placed quite so low on the console though, as it makes it hard to see which button does what until you've learned it by touch. Not surprisingly, rear-seat accommodations are pretty tight, especially for three passengers.</p>, <p>If you like the Audi styling aesthetic, you'll love the 2018 A3’s defining look. Looking a lot like a smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>, its standard bi-xenon headlights, big sunroof and standard 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels make even the least expensive A3 look great. Bigger 18- and 19-inch wheel-and-tire upgrades jazz up the exterior, and S3 models offer unique styling touches to emphasize the sportiness. Under the short rear deck is a 12.3-cubic-foot trunk, which reduces to 10 cubic feet in all-wheel-drive models. <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">Convertibles</a> of course offer two doors, and look especially sharp with the power soft-top lowered.</p>, <p>Standard on every 2018 Audi A3 are a rearview camera and rear-parking sensors, along with heated mirrors, front seats and windshield-washer nozzles. Other standard equipment for the sedan includes leather seats, a panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control, 12-way-power driver’s seat with power lumbar, LED taillights, Bluetooth with audio streaming, 10-speaker audio with single CD player, sensors for automatic windshield wipers and headlights and a 7-inch audio/information screen controlled by Audi's MMI interface. Opt for the sporty S3 and you'll get more power, along with quattro AWD, 18-inch alloys, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a sport-tuned suspension.</p>, <p>If you'd like to make Audi's inexpensive A3 as pricey as possible, Audi is perfectly happy to help. There are LED headlights, an excellent Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and a navigation system with Google Earth map technology viewed through Audi’s brilliant Virtual Cockpit. The last of those includes a clever touch pad atop the MMI knob that recognizes handwritten text entry. Dynamic safety features include active lane-keep assist, blind-zone warning and dynamic cruise control. Lastly, S3 models can be had with a $1,500 Magnetic Ride Control suspension system featuring three driving modes: Dynamic, Comfort and Individual.</p>, <p>Multiple engine configurations confront prospective Audi A3 owners, although all displace the same 2.0 liters. Front-wheel-drive (FWD) models employ a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder boasting 186 horsepower, which gets delivered through a dual-clutch 7-speed automatic transmission. If you want quattro AWD, you'll get an engine upgrade as well: a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 220 horsepower, as well as a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (which is also used in the econo-oriented A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid). <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s3/">Audi S3</a> models get a version of the 2.0-liter engine that sends its 292 horsepower to all four wheels. Note that both the A3 and S3 require premium fuel. The A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid diverges from its siblings, using a 1.4-liter turbocharged inline 4-cylinder paired with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor/generator.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (FWD)<br/> 186 horsepower @ 4,400-6,000 rpm<br/> 221 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/35 mpg (Sedan), 25/33 mpg (Cabriolet)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (AWD)<br/> 220 horsepower @ 4,500 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/31 mpg (Sedan), 22/30 mpg (Cabriolet)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (S3)<br/> 292 horsepower @ 5,400-6,200 rpm<br/> 280 lb-ft of torque @ 1,900-5,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/28 mpg<br/> <br/> 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 + electric motor (A3 Sportback e-tron)<br/> Engine:<br/> 150 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br/> 184 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-3,500 rpm<br/> Electric motor:<br/> 102 horsepower/243 lb-ft of torque<br/> Net output: 204 horsepower/258 lb-ft of torque<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy, est.: 83 MPGe/34 mpg combined</p>, <p>The base 2018 Audi A3 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,000. Opt for quattro AWD and the price jumps to just under $36,000. The 2018 A3 Cabriolet starts around $39,325 for FWD, or $42,000 if you want AWD. Greenies can get into a Sportback e-tron for just shy of $40,500, and the power-hungry will gravitate to the Audi S3 at just under $45,000. Options and trim levels can add considerably to the price tag, making your "cheap" Audi cost more than $50,000. The Mercedes-Benz CLA starts slightly lower, but with less standard equipment. The Acura ILX and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/verano/">Buick Verano</a> are both thousands less, but without the pedigree brand or AWD option. Check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others paid in your area. As for resale value, the A3 isn't expected to hold up over the long haul as well as the CLA, or even the ILX.<br>

[<p>Last year’s <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> got a bit bolder on the outside and a lot sportier under the skin. The 2018 Audi A4 sedan continues this trend, increasing the availability of quattro all-wheel drive and packing in more hardware and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> features. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> continues to lead the midsize-luxury segment by offering such fantastic features as a customizable color instrument display featuring a virtual speedometer, tachometer and a giant navigation display using Google maps. The adaptive cruise control is also hooked into the system, allowing it to slow down for approaching curves or offramps long before you’ll ever see them. Although not as powerful or fun to drive as a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a>, the A4 nevertheless is one impressive European sedan. If you love the A4 and hunger for more performance, check out the new-for-2018 Audi S4 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/s4/2018/">reviewed separately</a>).</p>, <p>Audi’s A4 sedan for 2018 offers a nearly unbeatable combination of style, technology, luxury and performance, all at a price that may come as a shock to some competitors. With quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) standard on most models, the A4 even has a leg up in the traction and stability department.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A4 luxury sedan may be too high-tech for some, and we have no data on its long-term reliability. Those needing a large rear seat might be happier in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkz/">Lincoln MKZ</a>, while those seeking more performance should look to the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/audi/s4/2018/">2018 Audi S4</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A4 luxury sedan limits front-wheel drive (FWD) to the base Ultra; all other models now come with quattro AWD standard. Some previously optional driver-safety features are added to the Premium Plus, and even more for the Prestige. Also new is a Black Optic package.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-a4.html?ddcref=KBB_Audi_Review">Learn more about the 2018 Audi A4 at audiusa.com</a></br></br></p>, <p>If you could peel away the 2018 Audi A4’s cool virtual gauge cluster, remove the adaptive cruise control and turn off the adjustable shock settings, you’d still have an amazingly fun performer. The A4’s steering is precise and perfectly weighted at all speeds, and the sophisticated suspension finds that happy place between a comfortable ride and adept handling. The high-output version of the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder puts every ounce of its 252 horsepower to good use. So good is this engine, that it can launch Audi’s 2018 A4 sedan to 60 mph in just 5.7 seconds. The 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is a sheer joy in either manual or fully automatic mode, and Audi still offers a 6-speed manual for die-hard old-schoolers. Opt for the Prestige trim and you’ll gain access to an adaptive suspension with adjustable dampers that can be set to stiffen for improved cornering.</p>, <p>VIRTUAL COCKPIT<br>
Audi has taken the LCD gauge concept to the extreme, and its accomplishment is on full display inside the 2018 Audi A4 Prestige. The driver can choose to minimize the virtual gauge sizes allowing the entire screen to be filled with a satellite view of the road. It’s like Google Earth for drivers.<br>
<br>
ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL<br>
The 2018 Audi A4’s adaptive cruise control can help maintain a safe distance between the car and traffic ahead; it can slow or even bring the car to an emergency stop; it can even anticipate upcoming curves or onramps and slow the vehicle to a safe speed before encountering them.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While the big news is the virtual cockpit, there's more to the 2018 A4 interior than the tech. MMI is much improved, using a touch pad to make entering addresses a breeze. The dash is simpler as well, with the MMI screen moved to the top as we've seen in other recent Audi models. The basics are spot-on, too, with comfortable seats, easy-to-use main controls and first-rate materials. The smallish rear seat, lack of a soft spot for the driver's right knee to rest, and a sometimes busy virtual cockpit display are the only real downsides.</p>, <p>Last year’s remake at first didn’t look as if much changed, but upon closer inspection, nothing was left unchanged. The car is a little wider and longer, but with more angular lines around the grille, headlights and details. Take the character line that runs along the side of the car, for example. On the old one it petered out weakly as it approached the taillight. Now it boldly cuts through to the trunk on one end, while in front, the hood itself makes up the upper portion of the line. The proportions are spot-on, and the car looks right from any angle.</p>, <p>Of course the 2018 Audi A4 comes nicely equipped. Standard issue on the base Ultra Premium includes 3-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, leather seating and a power sunroof. The MMI infotainment display is mounted high on the dash, with the rotary controller in front of the shifter. All Audi A4 models come with keyless ignition, HID headlights with cool LED accents, a rearview camera, and LED taillights above dual exhausts. Other standard features include 17-inch alloy wheels, paddle shifters for the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, automatic start/stop to help conserve fuel at stoplights, and Audi's Drive Select adjustable drive modes.</p>, <p>We've talked the virtual cockpit to death, but it's standard on the Prestige and available on Premium Plus models. Also available is a 7-inch infotainment screen, or an 8.2-inch version with navigation and the whole enchilada. A sport suspension option lowers ride height about an inch and gives the A4 more bite in corners, and an available adaptive-damping suspension lowers the car about a half-inch and adds different shock-absorber stiffness for Comfort, Normal and Sport settings. On Prestige models you get the full driver-assist suite including adaptive cruise control and auto high beams.</p>, <p>There's only one engine size available for the 2018 Audi A4, but it comes in two flavors. With 2.0 liters of displacement, it puts out 190 horsepower on FWD Ultra trims and is connected to a 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission that can be operated in normal "D," in sportier "S," or manually through the standard steering-wheel-mounted paddles. All other models have a more powerful 252-horsepower version of the 2.0-liter and include as standard quattro AWD that not only provides superior handling and wet-weather grip, but also accelerates the A4 from a standstill to 60 mph in about 5.7 seconds. The more powerful A4 models also offer the option of a 6-speed manual, the only car in this class to offer a manual with standard AWD.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (A4 Ultra)<br>
190 horsepower @ 4,200-6,000 rpm<br>
236 lb-ft of torque @1,450-4,200 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/37 mpg (FWD)<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (A4 quattro)<br>
252 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br>
273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,000 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/34 mpg (AWD, automatic), 24/33 mpg (AWD, manual)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The base model 2018 Audi A4 Ultra Prestige comes only in front-wheel drive and has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $37,000. That figure is on the lower end of the price spectrum for this class, especially considering standard leather upholstery. If you want quattro, you’ll have to step up the high-output A4 2.0 that starts around $41,500 in Premium trim, $44,700 in Premium Plus and $51,000 for the top Prestige version. Options will quickly push the price north, but even so that's not bad, and easily competitive with models like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac ATS and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus IS</a>. Historically, resale values have generally trailed the Benz, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>.

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/audi/a4%20allroad/2018/">2018 Audi A4 Allroad</a> fulfills the promises made by the original Allroad, but with better technology, a more car-like ride and improved quality. Based on the excellent A4 sedan, the A4 Allroad wagon provides more space for cargo and a more capable suspension for traveling unpaved roads. With only 6.5 inches of ground clearance, the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> isn’t designed for difficult off-road adventures, although it can tackle light off-road duties and snow-covered roads with ease. The moderate ride height also improves the Allroad’s cornering abilities. <a alt_o_t="Wagons" href="/wagon/">Wagons</a> have always been a tough sell in the U.S., but with new competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v90/">Volvo V90</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xf/">Jaguar XF</a> Sportbrake, the Allroad might just be on the winning side of a niche segment about to take off.</p>, <p>With its standard all-wheel-drive capability, large cargo bay and excellent handling, Audi’s A4 Allroad wagon for 2018 offers the best elements of a luxury SUV and nimble sports sedan. Premium features and a stunning interior only serve to sweeten the deal.</p>, <p>The Allroad is a great car, but it costs a small fortune. You can get similar luxury and performance from a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v60/">Volvo V60</a> Cross Country and pay less. If you can forego the panache of a luxury brand, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a> Touring or VW Golf Alltrack will save you a bundle.</p>, <p>Fresh from its introduction last year, the 2018 Audi A4 Allroad wagon sees only minor changes this year. Premium Plus trims gain Audi side assist and pre-sense rear-drive assists, while the Prestige gains active lane assist, adaptive cruise control with stop/go, auto high beams and traffic-sign recognition.</p>, <p>Audi’s 2018 Allroad wagon suffers from the Goldilocks effect, where it splits the difference between the sometimes too-firm ride of a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and the softer suspension setups found with <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> and some <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> vehicles. As a result, the Allroad proves a very comfortable daily driver that dispatches potholes and broken pavement with ease, yet can still illicit thrills when the freeway is exchanged for twisting mountain passes. The Allroad’s turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is a magnificent dynamo of power, and the 7-speed S tronic transmission shifts quickly and always at the appropriate time, although we did experience some roughness at lower speeds. Audi’s selectable drive modes adjust the adaptive suspension and steering feel, allowing for a softer ride in Comfort setting and sportier one in Dynamic mode. Leaving the system in Auto mode allows the Allroad to decide for itself, something most people will be just fine with.</p>, <p>VIRTUAL COCKPIT<br>
 Without question one of our favorite Audi features, the Virtual Cockpit replaces the analog-instrument cluster with a 12.3-inch configurable digital display that can show virtual gauges, a huge Google Maps navigation display, audio setting and driving data.<br>
<br>
 THE SWEETEST SOUNDS<br>
 Who doesn’t love a good audio system. In the 2018 Audi A4 Allroad wagon, you can opt for a 755-watt, 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen unit. Standard on the Premium Plus and Prestige, the B &amp; O system is one feature that sets Audi vehicles apart from more pedestrian cars.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/allroad/">Audi Allroad</a>'s 5-passenger cabin is one of its best assets. Behind the rear seats is over 24 cubic feet of cargo space. Fold the 40/20/40-split rear seats, and there's an SUV-like 58.5 cubic feet of space. North of the transmission lever is the MMI interface, a dial and auxiliary controls for audio, navigation and other functions on the central display screen. We give bonus points to the volume control just to the right, redundant to the knurled one in the steering wheel. Harder to reach are the ignition button and drive-mode controls. The CD player? It's in the glove box.</p>, <p>If you don't think station wagons can look good, rest your eyes on the 2018 Allroad. In one svelte shape it's able to pull off rugged, athletic, practical and luxurious -- the very traits it embodies as a whole. Up front is Audi's pronounced Singleframe grille with vertical slats, while side sills, underbody protectors and roof rails give it an outdoorsy vibe. The newest Allroad has 6.5 inches of ground clearance, which is slightly lower than its predecessor, moderately less than the Volvo V60 Cross Country's 7.9 inches, and quite a bit lower than the 8.7-inch figure of a Subaru Outback.</p>, <p>The 2018 A4 Allroad comes in three trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. Even the base model Premium is well equipped with leather seating, 8-way-power driver's seat with 4-way lumbar support, 7-inch color display with rearview camera, tri-zone climate control, panoramic sunroof and HomeLink garage-door opener. The basic audio system brings 10 speakers, AM/FM/CD player with two USB ports, and CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The mid-trim Premium Plus comes with its excellent 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, heated front seats, power tailgate and LED headlights. All Allroads get the Pre Sense safety system that automatically brakes to prevent a collision.</p>, <p>The top-line Allroad Prestige model adds a larger 8.3-inch color display with navigation, the slick Virtual Cockpit, an upgraded MMI system with handwriting-style input, head-up display, and the side-assist blind-spot monitoring system. With this trim you also get adaptive cruise control, traffic-sign recognition and lane-keep assist. This top trim also can be outfitted with ventilated front seats, while the other trims can be had with navigation and the Audi Connect Prime and Plus system with Wi-Fi connectivity and Google Earth mapping.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi Allroad uses a recently redesigned turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine linked to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. All Allroads have Audi's latest version of Quattro all-wheel drive, called Quattro Ultra, which also helps efficiency efforts. The system works by powering the front wheels when possible, with the ability to instantly send power to the rear wheels when extra grip is needed. In addition to Auto, Comfort, Dynamic and Individual driving modes, the Allroad has an Offroad setting that adjusts the powertrain and disables the Pre Sense systems. Note that the Allroad drinks premium unleaded.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 252 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br>
 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/30 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A4 Allroad has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $45,500. On the other end, a loaded top-line can reach nearly $59,000. At these prices, this Audi off-road wagon is slightly pricier than its closest-of-kind rival, the Volvo V60 Cross Country. However, it’s nearly $25,000 less than the Jaguar XF Sportbrake. As we've mentioned, you could save several thousand with a Subaru Outback, or spend nearly half as much for the far less prestigious yet still capable <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> Alltrack. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. Given its niche status and Audi badge, the Allroad's resale value is expected to remain quite strong in the years ahead.</p>]

[<p>Revamped for 2018, the A5 Coupe and Cabriolet are the sportier, free-spirited siblings of the A4. Though based on that compact-luxury <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>, these 2-door models emphasize design and driver enjoyment, traits made evident by the snug rear seats that only accommodate two, similar to German rivals the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> coupe and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a>. The exception is the A5 Sportback, a 5-door liftback that's as practical as it is stylish. Like the 4 Series Gran Coupe, the A5 Sportback is actually more versatile than a sedan, and arguably the best-looking model in the lineup. Whichever A5 strikes your fancy, you'll get a <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a> filled with technology and safety features, and driving manners that hit the sweet spot between comfort and dynamism.</p>, <p>Whether you're a young professional who is pre-family or an empty-nester ready to drive a fun and stylish <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> coupe or convertible, the 2018 Audi A5 will scratch that itch and make a statement while doing so. The practical A5 Sportback, meanwhile, can seat five and boasts a spacious rear hatch.</p>, <p>In the niche category of luxury-compact <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a> and <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a>, all the players meet a high bar. That can leave your decision to personal preference and design appeal. You might like luxe swagger of the C-Class or the lines of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rc/">Lexus RC</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q60/">Infiniti Q60</a>, both of which also cost less.</p>, <p>The A5 is all-new for 2018. Like the revamped A4 that came before it, the new A5 is loaded with slick technology like <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s Virtual Cockpit digital dash and active safety features. The A5 debuts concurrently with the latest S5 high-performance model (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/s5/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), while the track-ready, 444-horsepower RS 5 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/rs-5/2018/">also reviewed separately</a>) has now arrived at last.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-a5-sportback.html?ddcref=KBB_Audi_Review">Learn more about the all-new 2018 Audi A5 Sportback at audiusa.com</a></p>, <p>Few coupes and convertibles blend sporty handling, refinement and panache like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a5/">Audi A5</a>. If you factor in all-season drivability thanks to standard all-wheel drive, the 2018 A5 is in a class by itself. We really like the A5's blend of acceleration (0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds), grip and overall balance. Adjustable drive modes make a tangible difference in the way the car feels, with steering stiffening and the engine and shifts more responsive in Dynamic mode. We left it in Auto and let the A5 adjust to driving situations as needed. There can be instances of initial lag if you nail the accelerator, but the car soon gets over itself and up to speed. The 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is smooth in almost every instance. If you're in the "save-the-manuals" camp, Audi is among the few to still offer a manual transmission -- and all on three coupe trims, no less.</p>, <p>VIRTUAL COCKPIT<br>
 Audi's fully digital dash has been around a few years now, but it still wows us. This optional setup replaces the traditional instrument cluster with a configurable 12.3-inch digital display. When integrated with Google Earth satellite mapping, it dazzles and seems straight from the future.<br>
<br>
 A5 SPORTBACK<br>
 For those who like to have their cake and eat it, too, this all-new A5 variant combines a sleek coupe-like design with four doors and a large rear hatch area that's easily accessed via a power-operated rear door. The icing? It's the least expensive A5 model.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The latest A5 continues the Audi anthem of sleek, angular lines with only enough buttons and knobs to justify their existence. We love the feel of quality. The A5's front seats are well supported and grant an excellent driving position. The pair of rear seats in coupe and convertible models are small and cumbersome to enter and exit for the less-than-agile. The rear seats do fold, and combined with the large trunk open up commendable cargo space. The A5 Sportback has rear doors and a 3-across bench like a sedan, and 35 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats folded.</p>, <p>The A5 has more conservative lines compared to the more rounded and/or flowing shape of rivals like the Lexus RC, Infiniti Q60 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Restrained as it may be, the A5 is elegant, with one of its biggest splashes being up front with a large trapezoidal grille. Unlike a BMW 4 Series (and like the new Mercedes C-Class convertible), the A5 convertible has a fabric roof instead of a folding hardtop. The A5 Sportback is essentially a smaller version of the captivating A7, blending a 4-door coupe silhouette with an upward-rising power liftgate that hides a good-sized rear cargo bay.</p>, <p>All A5 variants come in three trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. Base models of each have leather interior, power front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, rearview camera, and 18-inch wheels. The basic infotainment system includes a 7-inch display, AM/FM/CD/HD Radio, two USB ports, Bluetooth connectivity, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Coupe models come with a panoramic sunroof; the A5 cabriolet with a power-operated fabric roof. Included is Audi Presence Basic and City. The first instantaneously prepares the car if a collision appears imminent, while the second aims to prevent one by detecting other cars and pedestrians and automatically braking.</p>, <p>We think the mid-trim Premium Plus A5 is worth the extra $3,000 as it adds safety features like blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic, and will even alert you of a coming vehicle when exiting the vehicle. Also included are full LED headlights, heated front seats and hands-free trunk/tailgate release. Prestige trims add the Virtual Cockpit, 8.3-inch display with navigation, and a superb 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen system. Other options include a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, head-up display and Driver Assistance package with adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and traffic-sign recognition. Audi Connect Prime grants 4G LTE connectivity.</p>, <p>The 2018 A5 uses a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that makes 252 horsepower, enough to zip each model to 60 mph in six seconds or less. All A5 variants are all-wheel drive. The A5 Cabriolet and Sportback use a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. The A5 Coupe offers that transmission or, in a nod to enthusiasts, a 6-speed manual transmission. At up to 34 mpg, the A5 is surprisingly efficient given its potency. Helping that is a start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle and which can be defeated with the press of a button. If you're more power-hungry, consider the 354-horsepower S5 with a supercharged V6. If you're power delirious, wait for the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/rs%205/">Audi RS 5</a>, which packs a 450-horsepower biturbo V6.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 252 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br/> 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/33 mpg (manual, Coupe), 24/34 mpg (automatic, Coupe, Cabriolet, Sportback)</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A5 Coupe has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $43,775, a number that is the same whether you choose the manual or automatic transmission. At $43,575, the A5 Sportback is actually the least expensive A5, though only by $200. Starting at $50,575, the Cabriolet sits atop the A5 social ladder. From here, prices only go up. A loaded A5 Coupe or Sportback can reach beyond $55,000, while the A5 convertible can reach into the $60,000 range. At these prices, the A5 is in line with the BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupes, and above the starting marks of the Lexus RC, Infiniti Q60 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a> coupe. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Audi. The A5's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> is expected to hold up very well in the years ahead.<br>

[<p>The 2018 A6 is <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s <a alt_o_t="Midsize Sedan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-sedans/2000009275/">midsize sedan</a>, a Goldilocks of a <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a> that splits the comfort/performance balance of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a>, all while imparting its own personality. Don't let the A6's understated attitude fool you: Underneath that contemporary skin is an executive <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> that's rewarding to drive and technologically advanced. Audi's famed quattro all-wheel-drive system provides excellent traction, and three powertrains -- turbocharged 4-cylinder, supercharged V6 or the twin-turbo V8 in the S6 -- provide good, great or hold-on-to-your-hat performance. In addition to its German rivals, the A6 faces competition ranging from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xf/">Jaguar XF</a> to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ct6/">Cadillac CT6</a>. While the A6 may fly lower on the radar, it merits a spot on yours.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> sedan resides where <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>, performance, technology and sophistication meet. If that sounds like your sweet spot, start planning a test drive. If you're looking for a high-performance alternative to a V8-powered BMW M550i or Mercedes-AMG E43, the S6 packs a wallop.</p>, <p>If you want your car to have instant recognition and vehicular validation, the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class are better known in this class. The Lexus GS, meanwhile, is predicted to have slightly higher resale value.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Audi A6 comes standard with MMI Navigation and Audi's advanced key (keyless entry and ignition). Mid-trim Premium Plus models get LED headlights and full LED interior lighting, while Prestige models now include a top-view camera. Models with the 3.0-liter supercharged V6 gain seven horsepower, for a total of 340.</p>, <p>It's safe to say that all A6 models are swift, with even base 4-cylinder versions hitting the 0-60-mph benchmark in 6.7 seconds. This isn't as quick as a base BMW 5 Series or even an E-Class for that matter, but fast enough for most needs. The supercharged V6 in 3.0 models easily rectifies this, bringing that figure down to 5.1 seconds, while the S6 thrills with a 4.4-second mark. More impressive than outright acceleration is the A6's balance of dynamic handling and compliant manners. This is a car that feels at ease in almost any situation. Helping that factor is the A6's quattro all-wheel-drive system, which we recommend in lieu of the front-drive setup on the least expensive models. If you're not quite up for the high-performance S6, the A6 Competition promises better handling with its stiffer suspension and sport differential.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/audi/s6/2018/">2018 AUDI S6</a><br/> If the A6 flies beneath the radar, the S6 dives further still, making this a serious wolf in sheep's clothing. Few will know that under this sedan's stately and conservative exterior is a pulsating 450-horsepower V8 and performance hardware to match.<br/> <br/> COMFORT SEATING PACKAGE<br/> If you want superior coddling behind the wheel, check this option box. In addition to having plusher front seats overall, they'll also feature ventilation (a lifesaver in hot and humid weather) and a massaging feature. We call that "Ahhh"-inspiring.<br/> </p>, <p>Audi interiors have long been among our favorites. Like these cars themselves, they're classy, comfortable and tech-forward. Along with supple leather upholstery and intricate trims, the 2018 A6 sedan includes Audi’s MMI infotainment and navigational system that continues to dazzle with some help from Google Maps and Audi’s smartphone interface. While the A6 has yet to receive Audi's Virtual Cockpit, a fully configurable digital dashboard, a screen between the gauges has the ability to relay similar content, including maps. The rear seat is accommodating even for taller adults and offers excellent outward visibility. At over 14 cubic feet, the trunk is well-sized.</p>, <p>The A6’s exterior features some bold elements, such as the recently upgraded headlights, grille, front bumper and LED taillights, but overall the shape and styling remain typically Audi conservative. Viewed from behind, the taillights have a sleek profile and are easy to pick out whenever you’re behind one, day or night. The new Competition Package, available on Premium Plus and Prestige trims, brings a more aggressive tone with black exterior mirror housings, red brake calipers and 20-inch, 5-double-spoke Titanium-matte wheels with summer tires. The 2018 Audi S6 performance sedan looks much like an A6 except for its quad exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A6 comes in three main trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. For 2018, the base Premium model comes even better equipped, highlighted by the standard inclusion of Audi's MMI navigation and advance key. Other notable standard features include leather interior, parking sensors and rearview camera, tri-zone climate control, sunroof, heated front seats and 60/40-split folding rear seats. In addition to navigation, the standard infotainment system includes AM/FM/CD audio system and smartphone integration that's CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. Premium Plus trims add blind-spot monitoring, 4-zone climate control, Bose audio system, LED headlights, power-folding side mirrors and power-adjustable steering column.</p>, <p>The top-trim A6 Prestige model includes a standard V6 engine, power-operated trunk, head-up display, the newly standard top-view camera, and rear-window sunshades. Options, many of which are packaged, include driver-assist and safety features like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and automatic emergency braking. In addition to interior and exterior touches, the Competition Package brings sport suspension and sport rear differential for improved handling. The high-performance <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s6/">Audi S6</a> includes a V8 engine, upgraded brakes, adaptive air suspension and 12-way-adjustable front seats.</p>, <p>Two engines are available for the A6: a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder good for 252 horsepower or a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 that, for 2018, makes the 340 horsepower formerly reserved for Competition models. Base 2018 A6 models are front-wheel drive (FWD) and use a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. We've found that transmission a bit unrefined in other Audi models, all the more reason to spend a little more and get a model with the quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system and 8-speed Tiptronic transmission, which provides smoother shifts. The 2018 S6 packs a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that is linked to a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch, but with all-wheel drive.<br>
<br>

That's a $2,100 increase over last year's base price, but the 2018 model carries more content. A base AWD A6 is now $52,875, while an A6 3.0T with the supercharged V6 begins at $57,475. All in, a 2018 A6 can pass the $70,000 mark. The potent Audi S6 starts at $72,875 in Premium Plus trim and over $75,000 as a Prestige model. For comparison, the 5 Series and E-Class start slightly higher, at around $52,000 and $53,000, respectively. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>'s potential rivals begin higher (CT6) and lower (CTS). Also starting lower are the Jaguar XF, Lexus GS and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a>. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Audi. The A6's resale value is expected to hold up well, though not quite at <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>' level.</p>]

[<p>Those who proclaim Americans won’t buy <a alt_o_t="Hatchbacks" href="/hatchback/">hatchbacks</a> have clearly never driven (or even seen) the stunning <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a7/">Audi A7</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s7/">Audi S7</a> for 2018. Practical side notwithstanding, the 2018 Audi A7-- and its performance stablemates the S7 and RS 7 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/rs-7/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) -- deliver impressive levels of performance, styling, technology and desirability. The lineup is designed to thrill at different levels, meaning the “base” A7 offers copious <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> features with ample performance, while the S7 includes much of the A7’s technology while placing an emphasis on blistering speed and razor-sharp handling. Audi’s well-established quattro all-wheel drive is along for the ride, as is a brilliant suspension every bit the equal of cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/6%20series/">BMW 6 Series</a> Gran <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/cls/">Mercedes-Benz CLS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/panamera/">Porsche Panamera</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A7 and Audi S7 offer all the virtues of a roomy sedan wrapped in a sleek, coupe-like body. With two powerful engine choices, dynamic handling and what is arguably one of the most beautiful interiors ever crafted, it’s hard to find reasons not to like these two cars.</p>, <p>All that we love about the 2018 Audi A7 <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> comes at a rather lofty price. You can get the same style and performance from a less expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x4/">BMW X4</a> or even a domestic like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkz/">Lincoln MKZ</a>.</p>, <p>Audi’s A7 luxury performance sedan gains a more powerful 3.0T V6, while the Prestige trim adds a corner-view camera. A new Competition package is offered featuring a unique quattro sport differential, red brake calipers, sport seats, a flat-bottom steering wheel and S-line styling cues. The S7 gains more wheel options.</p>, <p>With its 340-horsepower supercharged V6 engine, even the least expensive 2018 Audi A7 delivers a stellar performance, darting from zero to 60 mph in just over five seconds. It’s one of our favorite drivetrains, generating ample power at nearly any speed and operating so smoothly we sometimes glanced at the tachometer to be certain the engine was still running. Moving up to the more aggressive S7 sacrifices some ride comfort and cabin quietness, but the trade-off is more than worth it. Audi’s 2018 S7 derives its power from a 450-horsepower V8, which can seem like overkill on paper, but never from behind the wheel. The S7 is a delightful performer, agile, quick and confident. Yet, behind all the power and performance figures for both the A7 and S7 is a truly remarkable luxury story, one wrapped in an elegant design, premium wood and leather, and supremely comfortable seating both front and rear.</p>, <p>INTERIOR REFINEMENT<br>
 One look inside the 2018 Audi A7 reveals fine leathers, sculpted dash and door panels, and an 8-inch display that electronically rises from the dash. Spend more time and you’ll discover obsessive minor details, such as the knurled dials for audio and climate controls.<br>
<br>
 GOOGLE NAVIGATION<br>
 Beyond the standard navigation found in the most basic cars these days, the A7 offers Google Earth and traffic, putting it on par with some of the best smartphone navigation apps. The system can even utilize Google Street View, providing life-like street and building details.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>There's so much to like inside the Audi A7 it's hard to know where to start. There are high-quality materials, like standard leather seating, with an upgrade to diamond-stitched higher-quality hides in S7 models. The A7 seats five, but the S7 seats four because of a pair of contoured rear seats instead of a 3-person bench. Thanks to the standard 8-way-power/4-way-lumbar adjustment and power-operated steering-wheel adjustment, it's easy for drivers of various shapes and sizes to be comfortable. And, in a nod to practicality, the A7 is a hatchback, with plenty of cargo space.</p>, <p>Ever since its debut in 2012, the A7's fastback shape has been a defining element. Sure, beauty is subjective, but most agree this is a fine-looking car from virtually any angle. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> calls it a "sedan," but a rear power-operated hatch makes it a hatchback. It offers easy access to the cargo area with its 24.5 cubic feet of space. Models are visually distinguished through exterior styling, with the higher-performing S7 boasting its own front and rear bumper design, and the almighty RS 7 featuring a carbon-fiber splitter and diffusor. All models include a sunroof and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> rear spoiler.</p>, <p>With a base price of about $70,000 and an Audi badge on the nose, you'd expect even the base A7 to come nicely equipped. With standard features like a supercharged V6 engine, 4-zone climate control, an interior awash in leather and wood, and heated 8-way-power front seats, you'd be right. Also standard on the 2018 A7 is navigation, a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring (Audi calls it "side assist”), and a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD player with satellite and HD Radio with two USB ports. Also standard is Audi connect and Audi smartphone interface, both of which enhance your smartphone ownership experience.</p>, <p>There's a long list of options for the Audi A7 lineup, not the least of which is choosing between the A7 and S7. Beyond that there are massaging front seats with ventilation, and an available fighter-jet-style head-up display that projects pertinent driver information onto the windshield. The Driver Assistance package adds active lane assist, adaptive cruise control, corner-view cameras and a host of other technology, including Audi pre sense plus, which applies the brakes to avoid or lessen the impact of a frontal collision. A new A7 Competition package adds more performance features for better handling.</p>, <p>Last year’s A7 Competition 3.0T supercharged V6 is now the standard powertrain in all A7 models, while the S7 continues to offer a potent 450-horsepower 4.0-liter V8. The 2018 Audi A7 comes with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and quattro all-wheel drive is also standard; the S7 comes with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. But don't worry, none of these cars is a slouch, with even the "base" A7 scooting to 60 mph from a standstill in just over five seconds.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/27 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base 2018 Audi A7 starts just below $71,000; add $3,000 for the Competition package. The higher-performance S7 starts right around $81,000. If that's not enough, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/rs%207/">Audi RS 7</a> starts at about $112,000, and the uber RS 7 Performance will run you north of $130,500. Note that's all before adding options; start checking those boxes and the price escalates quickly. The 2018 A7 splits the difference between the CLS-Class 4-door coupe on the low end and the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> 640i Gran Coupe on the high end.

---------http://www.kbb.com/audi/a8/2018
[<p>The 2018 Audi A8 is the flagship <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> for the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> German automaker, a rolling statement of success that competes in the rarefied air of executive haulers like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/s-class/">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/7%20series/">BMW 7 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/ls/">Lexus LS</a>. Audis have long nailed a fine balance between comfort and performance, all while showcasing the brand's tenacious quattro all-wheel-drive system and futuristic technology. These characteristics remain true of the 2018 A8 even as it enters its final year of production before an all-new version arrives. The high-performance S8, meanwhile, takes all this and adds over 600 horsepower to the recipe. While 2018 marks the last of this current-gen A8, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s flagship still has a lot to offer those seeking a posh and polished German luxury sedan.</p>, <p>If you desire an executive sedan that is just different enough to spark interest yet comes from a brand whose luxury credentials need no explaining, the 2018 Audi A8 satisfies. If you want that in a high-end sedan with thrilling power and performance, look to the souped-up S8 variant.</p>, <p>If you can wait for the 2019 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a8/">Audi A8</a>, you'll get an even more advanced vehicle. Otherwise, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series are fresher flagships, while an all-new Lexus LS is around the corner. If you want CarPlay or Android Auto, wait or look elsewhere.</p>, <p>In its last year of production before an all-new A8 arrives for 2019, few changes are in store for this 2018 model. Among them is an Executive Package on base 3.0T models that bundles driver-assistance features like active lane keeping and amenities including ventilated and massaging front seats.</p>, <p>Is it a luxury sedan or a performance car? With the 2018 A8, you get both. The scales tip toward the latter in the A8 4.0T with its V8 engine, though even the standard supercharged V6 does a fine job hustling Audi's flagship up to speed. Naught to 60 mph arrives in a 5.5 seconds in the base model, and decreases to a blazing 4.4 seconds in the 4.0T. Need more? The S8 will rocket you from 0 to 60 in a supercar-like 3.7 seconds, all while tackling corners like a smaller and lither car. All A8 models have a fine degree of finesse and comfort thanks to standard air suspension and all-wheel drive, the latter especially appreciated in cold-weather states. In our time with an A8 high in the Rocky Mountains, we found it to be quiet and exceedingly comfortable in everyday driving. The S8, a driver's car, danced through corners.</p>, <p>22-WAY MULTI-CONTOUR SEATS<br>
 Face it: No matter where you drive an A8, you'll always be in the same place -- the front seat. Thus, we recommend getting the most comfortable one you can. Those in the Executive Package adjust nearly two dozen ways and will even massage you. Front passengers get the same treatment.<br>
<br>
 S8: A 605-HORSEPOWER SLEEPER<br>
 We love the S8 for many reasons: Its shorter overall length than the A8 makes it easier to maneuver in tight spots, while its torque-vectoring rear sport differential helps ensure optimal power delivery and grip. Most of all, we love this 605-horsepower sedan's sleeper status.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Though on the cusp of replacement, the A8's interior has held up well. While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of even its newer A4 sibling such as the Virtual Cockpit or Apple CarPlay/Android integration, the A8's cabin is a commendable cocoon of indulgence. We've already waxed poetic on the 22-way-adjustable front seats, each straddled by a wide console festooned with buttons and a gearshift that looks like it was taken from a jet. A8 models, only available as "L" for long-wheelbase, have scads of rear-seat legroom at nearly 43 inches, while the S8 still boasts a commendable 38.7 inches.</p>, <p>Like other Audis, this flagship sedan is stately but reserved, eschewing the fluidity of, say, the latest S-Class for a more conservative shape. We say "mostly" reserved save for the front, which is distinguished by Audi's signature LED strip underneath the headlights and a massive, trapezoidal grille. The A8 is only available in one length -- long wheelbase -- and comes in at 207.4 total inches. The S8 is a bit shorter and easier to park at 202.6 inches. One of the easiest ways to distinguish the 2018 S8 performance model is to look for the wide quad tailpipes in back.</p>, <p>Even the least expensive 2018 A8 3.0T can make you feel rich with such standard features as leather interior, 18-way power-operated and heated front seats, Bose audio system, navigation, quad-zone climate control and sunroof. Thoughtful features include power-rear sunshade, rear-seat vanity mirrors and even a headlight washer. Every A8 also comes with a 6-month subscription to Audi connect, which offers in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. Quattro -- Audi's term for its all-wheel-drive system -- is also standard. In addition to the V8 engine, the 4.0T model includes 22-way front seats with ventilation and massaging, heated rear seats, head-up display and panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>On the 3.0T model, the Executive Package adds active safety and driving aids like blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, plus a top-view camera. On A8 4.0 models it also includes separate power-operated rear outboard seats with ventilation and massage functionality. The S8 performance sedan has a sport-tuned suspension, sport rear differential and 21-inch wheels. The S8 can be further upgraded with ceramic brakes, night-vision assistant, Alcantara headliner and Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p>, <p>Two gasoline engines are available for the 2018 Audi A8 sedan, both connected to a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission. The A8 3.0T uses a supercharged V6 while the 4.0T Sport gets a turbocharged V8, both of which have fuel-saving start/stop technology. The star athlete, however, is the S8 Plus with its 4.0-liter turbo V8 tuned to make 605 horsepower. With a blistering 0-60-mph time of 3.7 seconds, the 2018 S8 will embarrass many sports cars. All A8 and S8 models include quattro all-wheel drive.<br>

[<p>All-new for 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a> enters its second generation with added power, higher efficiency, a tailored new suit and even more brains. It's all an improvement on a recipe that has worked so well for <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s compact-luxury SUV that within a few years of its introduction in 2009, the model went on to become the German brand's best seller. Along with the new Q5 is a higher-performance SQ5, boasting a turbocharged V6 engine, better handling, and improved performance capability all around. Together, they make a compelling case in a booming segment that includes competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rdx/">Acura RDX</a>, and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-pace/">Jaguar F-Pace</a>. Even against that crowd the 2018 Audi Q5 and SQ5 stand out with a stellar blend of performance, comfort and capability, and an impressive roster of standard safety features.</p>, <p>If you want a smaller <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV with excellent overall driving manners, standard all-wheel drive, gee-whiz technology and active safety features like automatic emergency braking, the 2018 Audi Q5 checks every box. The new SQ5 includes all that, and adds a dose of faster to the mix.</p>, <p>There's no <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> or diesel version of the Q5, so luxury fuel sippers will need to look at the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/glc/">Mercedes-Benz GLC</a> for their savings. The Acura RDX and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a> have lower starting prices. The performance-oriented SQ5 model is fun, but nicely equipped models come close to the $70,000 mark.</p>, <p>The 2-row/5-passenger Audi Q5 luxury SUV is all-new for 2018. It enters its second generation with a bump in power and fuel efficiency, a new 7-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission, slightly roomier interior and a roster of standard features that include Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility and Audi pre sense safety systems. SQ5 models offer a turbocharged V6 and 8-speed transmission, along with high-performance suspension and brakes.<br>

<a href="https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-q5.html?ddcref=KBB_Audi_Review">Learn more about the all-new 2018 Audi Q5 at audiusa.com</a></br></br></p>, <p>The new Q5 strikes a lovely balance between an X3 and GLC, with a personality we'd summarize with the word "confident." When we pushed the new Q5 hard on mountain roads, its manners felt more sports <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> than <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV. In both around-town driving and highway stretches, the Q5 is quiet and comfortable. And though most owners aren't likely to get their Q5 very dirty, it's surprisingly competent on dirt trails. The Q5's 252-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and 7-speed transmission make a good pairing. With a 0-60-mph time of 5.9 seconds, the new Q5 is faster than the prior version with the optional V6. The SQ5 takes all of that and amplifies it with about 100 more horsepower, sharper handling, better brakes, and even better steering. Yet the SQ5 gives up almost nothing when it comes to ride comfort or daily practicality.</p>, <p>AUDI PRE SENSE SAFETY SYSTEMS<br/> The 2018 Q5 and SQ5 come standard with both "basic" and "city" versions of this system. The first prepares the vehicle for an impact by closing windows and pre-tensioning safety belts. The second can detect other cars and pedestrians, and apply the brakes at up to 52 mph to mitigate or lessen an impact.<br/> <br/> PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM<br/> We're suckers for a sweet audio system, and the latest Q5 and SQ5 <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> offers an ear-popping one with its optional Bang &amp; Olufsen setup. With 16 speakers pumping out 755 watts from a variety of sources -- including "old-school" compact discs -- it's bound to enhance any drive.</p>, <p>As with other Audis, the new Q5 and SQ5 offer up a 2-row/5-passenger interior at the intersection of contemporary design, cutting-edge technology and premium amenities. It's sleek yet handsome, and thankfully not overwhelmed with buttons. One of the highlights is the optional Virtual Cockpit, which turns the instrument cluster into a customizable 12.3-inch digital display that can show everything from the expected -- speed and mpg -- to the gee-whiz, such as realistic Google Maps. At 37.8 inches, rear legroom is good, as is cargo volume of over 60 cubic feet with the 40/20/40-split seats folded. The front seats are supportive, a benefit for longer commutes.</p>, <p>This latest Q5's squat and dignified exterior has changed just enough to keep it interesting while still remaining familiar. Up front is that gaping grille, surrounded by a new fascia, standard xenon headlights and LED running lights. Around back are a pair of elongated tailpipe housings and the all-important power tailgate. Standard roof rails help remind that this is an SUV. The Q5 rolls on 18-inch wheels as standard, with 19- and 20-inch variants optional. While other crossover SUVs have traded ground clearance for a more sedan-like ride, the 2018 Q5's stance has actually increased slightly, from 7.9 inches to 8.2 inches. The SQ5 adds to the look with a unique grille treatment, roof spoiler, and distinctive headlights.</p>, <p>The 2nd-gen Audi Q5 is available in three trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. The base Premium model is nicely equipped, even for a luxury-crossover SUV, with standard features like leather interior, tri-zone climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility, power-operated front seats, HomeLink garage-door opener and power tailgate. As mentioned in Favorite Things, the Q5 also includes impressive safety systems. The standard 10-speaker/180-watt audio system has an AM/FM and HD Radio, CD player and USB and SD card inputs, along with Bluetooth connectivity. A 7-inch center infotainment display and rearview camera are also included.</p>, <p>If you can swing it, we recommend the mid-trim Q5 Premium Plus with blind-spot monitoring, hands-free tailgate, heated front seats with driver's seat memory, full LED lights and panoramic sunroof. This trim opens the door to further options. The top-line Q5 Prestige adds the Virtual Cockpit, navigation system, Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system, top-view camera system with parking sensors, head-up display, 8.3-inch center screen, and 20-inch wheels. The Q5 can be upgraded with heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, adaptive damping suspension and a driver-assistance package that bundles adaptive cruise control, active lane-keeping assist, traffic-sign recognition, and automatic high-beam control.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine in the Q5 comes standard with a 7-speed dual-clutch S tronic transmission. That transmission routes power to all four wheels through quattro all-wheel drive, standard equipment on all Q5 models. The sophisticated system enhances fuel efficiency by powering the front wheels when possible, and instantly shift up to 100 percent of the power to the rear wheels as needed, so lightning-fast that you'll likely never notice it working. The SQ5 packs 102 more horsepower from its turbocharged 354-horsepower V6 engine, which comes connected to a Tiptronic 8-speed automatic transmission.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Audi Q7 is the flagship SUV from the German <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand, a 3-row/7-passenger hauler that deftly competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx60/">Infiniti QX60</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>. The Q7 was revamped last year, when it entered its second generation as a lighter, lither and more advanced luxury vehicle. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s largest <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV stands out with its dynamic driving nature and sophisticated technology that touts everything from innovative safety and semi-autonomous driving features to its future-is-here Virtual Cockpit with realistic Google-maps navigation. You won't find monstrous V8 power under the hood or acres of room in the third row, but if you want a luxury SUV with brand cachet, standard all-wheel drive, sleek design and smart technology, the 2018 Audi Q7 nails the list.</p>, <p>If you crave a 3-row luxury SUV that packs style, technology, enjoyable driving dynamics and the prestige that comes with every Audi, the 2018 Q7 has it all. Standard Quattro all-wheel drive and the ability to tow up to 7,700 pounds and blast from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds feel like icing.</p>, <p>If you intend on regularly utilizing the third row, you can find more space in an Infiniti QX60 or Acura MDX. The Q7's new cousin, the 3-row <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/atlas/">Volkswagen Atlas</a>, is a lower-priced alternative with excellent interior flexibility. If you need more room still, look to the larger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/yukon/">GMC Yukon</a>.</p>, <p>All-new just last year, Audi has since added a turbocharged 4-cylinder base engine to the existing supercharged V6, which drops the Q7's starting price to around $50,000. Updates for the 2018 Q7 include standard Audi advanced key, while Premium Plus trims gain the 3D Bose Surround Sound system.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-q7.html?ddcref=KBB_Audi_Review">Learn more about the 2018 Audi Q7 at audiusa.com</a></br></br></p>, <p>The first-gen <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> was already among the most fun-to-drive 3-row <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> available, and its dynamics and driving enjoyment have only gotten better with this new, 2nd-gen model. That's what happens when you lose roughly 500 pounds, lower your center of gravity by 1.7 inches and install a 5-link front/rear suspension. On the road, this translates to an SUV that's supple and quiet in everyday driving, and dynamically polished when the need for speed or a curvy road beckons. The supercharged 3.0-liter V6 is a commendable powerhouse. The new 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine packs decent motivation for its size but lacks the deeper reserves of the V6 for high-speed passing and towing. Whichever model you choose, you'll be rewarded with fantastic steering feel. Opt for the Adaptive Chassis Package available on the Prestige variants, and you'll get full air suspension and 4-wheel steering that helps slice three feet off the turning circle.</p>, <p>AUDI VIRTUAL COCKPIT<br>
This tech option makes the 2018 Audi Q7 dash look like something out of the future. The Virtual Cockpit replaces traditional analog speedometer and gauges with an immersive 12.3-inch digital display. Fully configurable and connected via 4G LTE, it can show everything from Google Earth maps to what's playing on satellite radio.<br>
<br>
ADAPTIVE AIR SUSPENSION<br>
Exclusive to the top-end Q7 Prestige trim, Adaptive Air Suspension is part of the Adaptive Chassis Package that also includes 4-wheel steering. Along with improving comfort and control, it can raise ride height 2.4 inches for better off-road ground clearance, and lower it an inch at freeways speeds to reduce aero drag.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Audi has a knack for crafting some of the finest yet most useful cabins, and the Q7 is no exception. The interior of Audi's flagship SUV is highlighted by standard leather upholstery and a recast dash with an A8-style double-inlay design. Logically arrayed controls, a fresh 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel and highly legible instrumentation -- both conventional and the via the Virtual Cockpit display -- round out its more user-friendly character. The Q7’s new platform expands interior volume and cargo space, which includes nearly 15 cubic feet of space behind the third row. For humans, that last row is quite tight.</p>, <p>Although exterior dimensions and wheelbase on the latest-gen Q7 have decreased marginally, this latest iteration puts a more sophisticated visual spin on the SUV formula while imparting an even sleeker character that brings an impressively low 0.32 coefficient of drag. Up front, the Q7's prominent Singleframe grille portrays strength and premium appeal, while edgier fascia treatments, bolder front/rear lighting elements and sporty-looking twin tailpipes in back bring it all together. On the practical side, the tailgate is power-operated, and the standard xenon headlights make night driving easier.</p>, <p>The 2018 Q7 comes in three trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. With a name like "Premium," it's no surprise that even a base Q7 is well-equipped. Highlights include leather interior with heated front seats, 3-zone climate control, power tailgate and panoramic sunroof. The Q7 features a 7-inch center display, 10-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio with USB/SD card inputs and Bluetooth streaming. The Q7's safety features include Audi pre sense and pre sense city, which can monitor traffic and watch for pedestrians. If a collision appears imminent, the car will warn the driver and, ultimately, apply the brakes on its own.</p>, <p>If you want Apple CarPlay or Android Auto compatibility standard, step up to Q7 Premium Plus. We recommend this midtrim model, and think its $4,000 increase over the base model is justified with its navigation system, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, 3D Bose premium audio system and power-adjustable steering column. Top-line Prestige models come with the V6 engine, 19-speaker Bose audio system, Virtual Cockpit, full LED headlights and 20-inch wheels. Options include a superb Bang &amp; Olufsen audiophile sound system, Driver Assistance Package with adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist, adaptive suspension, and rear-seat entertainment package.</p>, <p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Q7. The new base engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that makes 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. That's enough for a pretty swift 0-60-mph time of 7.1 seconds, but with more than a couple of passengers and their gear, this engine risks feeling saddled. Not so with the optional supercharged V6, which makes 333 ponies and 325 lb-ft of twist, and has a 0-60-mph time of 5.7 seconds. Both engines are linked to a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission, and all Q7s have standard all-wheel drive. The 4-cylinder is rated to tow 4,400 pounds and the V6 a stout 7,700 pounds. Like more and more <a alt_o_t="New Cars" href="/new-cars/">new cars</a>, the Q7 has an idle start/stop system that can be manually deactivated.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
252 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br>
273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,500 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/25 mpg<br>
<br>
3.0-liter supercharged V6<br>
333 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm<br>
325 lb-ft of torque @ 2,900-5,300 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/25 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With the introduction of the 4-cylinder Q7, getting into one of these Audi luxury SUVs just became easier. The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Q7 begins at $50,875, including destination charge. The recommendable midtrim Premium Plus model starts at $54,875. Adding the supercharged V6 to either trim costs $6,500. The top-line Q7 Prestige, which includes the V6, begins over $66,000. All in, a fully loaded Q7 luxury SUV can top $80,000. At these figures, the Audi has a lower starting price than the BMW X5 and 5-passenger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gle/">Mercedes-Benz GLE</a>, though those both come standard with a 6-cylinder engine. For less money, you can get an Infiniti QX60, Acura MDX or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/xc90/">Volvo XC90</a>. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Q7. As with other Audis, the Q7's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> is expected to hold up well.<br>

[<p>The beauty of modern exotic cars like the 2018 Audi R8 goes far below the sexy skin. Rather than just occasional playthings for the rich, so uncomfortable in daily driving that they're taken out only on weekends, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/r8/">Audi R8</a> exemplifies the modern exotic. It sacrifices none of the high-powered straight-line performance or track-specific handling expected from an exotic car costing in the $200,000 range. However, like its <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/nsx/">Acura NSX</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> Turbo competition, the Audi R8 is just as comfortable when driven to and from the track, or even to the grocery store or on a daily commute. The Audi R8, all-new last year, is wider, faster and lighter than its predecessor, yet its elegant interior never lets you forget it's an <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>.</p>, <p>Audi couples its reputation for high-tech, elegant and comfortable interiors with the kind of supercar performance normally associated with <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lamborghini/">Lamborghini</a>. It's a combination that results in a car that's simultaneously thrilling to drive, yet eminently comfortable for daily use.</p>, <p>While sharply styled, the Audi R8 doesn't have the universally beloved standout styling of a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> or Lamborghini. And, despite Audi's many racing successes, that pedigree isn't as widely recognized. There's also no manual transmission. If you don't want all-wheel drive, you're out of luck.</p>, <p>All-new last year, the 2018 Audi R8 gets only a handful of updates this year. All models come equipped with Audi's smartphone interface that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A new Black Optic package adds 20-inch 10-spoke wheels and other black trim. V10 models can be equipped with laser headlights.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi R8 lets you indulge in all the supercar excesses you can dream of, or simply cruise serenely. With its wonderfully quick steering and sharp suspension, the R8's reactions to driver inputs make it feel light and agile. In no time -- well, a bit more than three seconds, anyhow -- you'll be exceeding the speed limit, and to a ridiculous degree if you refuse to back off the gas. Tickle the throttle in traffic, and suddenly that tight knot of cars is a group of distant dots in the rearview mirror. Its V10 engine and 7-speed automatic work harmoniously, letting the engine lope at sane highway speeds, or scream when you unleash that 610-horsepower beast. The responsive drivetrain, balanced handling and tenacious grip make road courses a pleasure, and using launch control actually snaps your head back as you reach 60 mph in 3.2 seconds.</p>, <p>R8 V10 PLUS<br>
 The standard R8 V10 puts out 540 horsepower, a lot by any measure. But if it's not enough, there's the R8 V10 Plus, with a 610-horsepower version of that engine. In addition, the Plus adds more performance modes in the Drive Select, sport exhaust, carbon-ceramic brakes and special racing seats.<br>
<br>
 STEERING-WHEEL CONTROLS<br>
 Buttons on steering wheels are nothing new, but the 2018 R8 takes it to extremes. In addition to cruise and audio controls, there's a bright-red start/stop button, Drive Select, sport exhaust, launch control and -- behind the rim -- paddles to manually shift the 7-speed automatic.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Audi interiors are always top-notch, and as the top-notch Audi, the R8 boasts a beautifully styled and intuitively laid-out cockpit. There's the 13-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, in case the V10's song somehow bores you. The supportive and comfortable seats are covered in Nappa leather, and the R8 now comes with Audi's MMI navigation system. The multi-function steering wheel incorporates many of the street/track functions, and Audi's excellent Virtual Cockpit replaces physical gauges with a high-res 12.3-inch display that shows information chosen by the driver. The R8 V10 Plus comes with racing-shell seats.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi R8 doesn't have the immediate emotional impact of exotics from Italy or England. Yet its distinctive grille and headlights make it unmistakably Audi. This generation R8 uses almost 50 percent of its parts with the R8 LMS race car, yet it's visually similar to its predecessor. The low, wide stance and choice of hard or soft top remain, although Audi has reduced the profile of the signature "blade" on the side to a more subtle contrasting air-intake panel. Opt for V10 Plus over V10, and you get ceramic brakes, a sport exhaust, carbon-fiber rear diffuser and fixed spoiler.</p>, <p>Only a supercar could offer a 5.2-liter 540-horsepower V10 as the "base" engine, here connected to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic and quattro all-wheel drive. In addition, you get Audi's Drive Select variable drive modes, magnetic shocks and Audi's very cool and useful Virtual Cockpit in all R8 models. Audi's MMI infotainment interface also comes standard, as do Audi Connect and Google Earth-powered navigation. Even the side mirrors are high-tech: They're power-folding, power-adjustable, auto-dimming and heated. Also standard is a spoiler that rises depending on speed and 19.5-inch wheels. A 13-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system is standard on the R8 V10.</p>, <p>Some people don’t want a "base" anything, even if it's a supercar, so Audi provides the R8 V10 Plus. Its V10 engine puts out 610 horsepower, it boasts a top track speed of 205 mph, and it comes with all sort of racy equipment: racing-shell seats, ceramic brakes, sport exhaust, enhanced aerodynamics. You can also get Dynamic Steering, which offers a variable steering ratio. Drive Select in the V10 Plus adds a performance mode that optimizes the car's performance based on dry, wet and snowy conditions. Also available are diamond-stitched leather, contrast stitching, 20-inch wheels, and of course the drop-top R8 Spyder.</p>, <p>There are two versions of one V10 engine available for the 2018 Audi R8. Base -- if you can call them that -- R8 models get a 5.2-liter V10 with 540 horsepower; the R8 V10 Plus comes with a 610-horsepower version. Both are connected to a quick-shifting 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with paddle shifters mounted on the steering wheel. Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system is also standard across the board. Fuel economy isn't great, and the R8 is subject to a gas-guzzler tax, but relative to competitors its 22 mpg on the highway isn't too bad, is it?<br>
<br>
 5.2-liter V10<br>
 540 horsepower @ 7,800-8,700 rpm<br>
 398 lb-ft of torque @ 6,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/22 mpg<br>
<br>
5.2-liter V10<br>
 610 horsepower @ 8,250-8,700 rpm<br>
 413 lb-ft of torque @ 6,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/22 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>If you want to get into a 2018 Audi R8, you'll need about $166,000 to cover the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and the $1,250 destination charge. The R8 V10 Spyder starts at about $178,300, and the R8 V10 Plus comes in at a hefty $195,600. That's all before adding options of course, and they add up quickly; it's not hard to push the price of the V10 Plus well over the $200,000 mark. That's a lot, but it's competitive with the likes of the Acura NSX ($160,000) and Porsche 911 Turbo S ($189,000). <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">Resale value</a> for exotic cars depends on a variety of factors, but generally they hold their value well.

Its conservative A3-based styling gets dressed up with big wheels, a deeper front bumper, silver-painted accents and massive brakes. Inside there are performance seats embroidered with RS 3, and on the lower edge of the grille you'll find the famous "quattro" badge in inch-high letters, just in case you forget. But this is not a styling exercise. The RS 3 is a seriously fast, sharp-handling, delightfully fun car to drive hard, an easy counterpunch to the likes of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m2/">BMW M2</a>.</p>, <p>If your priorities skew toward driving fun instead of rear-seat passenger legroom or cargo space, then the 2018 Audi RS 3 should be at or near the top of your shopping list.</p>, <p>The rear seat is cramped, the trunk is small, and it's a little tight inside. A fully loaded BMW M2 costs less than a similarly loaded RS 3. Other choices such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s4/">Audi S4</a> and S5 are options, but neither is as fun to drive as the RS 3.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi RS 3 is all-new this year and designed specifically for the U.S. market. Based on the refreshed <a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/a3/2018/">Audi A3 and S3 sedan</a>, it offers a unique engine, performance suspension and brakes, and other high-tech goodies.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi RS 3 sedan is designed to be an absolute blast to drive, a job it performs exceedingly well. The turbocharged 5-cylinder engine produces its 354 lb-ft of torque at a low 1,700 rpm, and at the other end of the tachometer there's 400 horsepower to play with. Audi says the RS 3 will leap from a standstill to 60 mph in about 3.9 seconds. That's Corvette quick, and if you keep your foot down the RS 3 tops out at 174 mph when equipped with the Dynamic Plus package. But it's no straight-line special, and with the Dynamic package the RS 3 gets front tires wider than the rears, giving it excellent balance in corners despite its inherent front-weight bias. The quattro all-wheel-drive system's drama-free traction means the RS 3 tackles corners with abandon, and the razor-sharp steering provides good feedback. Around town, the RS 3 proves surprisingly docile. On our shortlist of improvements: less turbo lag.</p>, <p>5-CYLINDER ENGINE<br>
Audi has stuck with 5-cylinder engines, and we're happy to see it in the RS 3. The engine puts out excellent power and torque, and manages to deliver acceptable fuel economy as well. As a bonus, there's that famous 5-cylinder thrum as the engine approaches redline.<br>
<br>
REVERSE STAGGER TIRES<br>
The RS 3 boasts wider tires in front than in the rear (255/35-R19 front, 235/35-R19 rear). This is to counter the front weight bias of the transverse-mounted 5-cylinder engine. The arrangement may seem odd, but it works beautifully, giving the RS 3 a balanced and neutral cornering attitude.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Audi RS 3 benefits from the general upgrade the entire A3/S3 lineup got a couple years ago. That means nice materials inside, Apple CarPlay, and an available Virtual Cockpit that swaps out physical gauges for a high-resolution screen with a 60-fps refresh rate for a stutter-free presentation. The RS 3 also gets special sport seats; they only adjust manually, but in corners they grip you like a long-lost friend, and when cruising are about as comfortable as dad's easy chair. Rear-seat passengers aren't quite as lucky, as there's a definite lack of legroom for even average-sized passengers. Cargo room isn't terrific, although the rear seatbacks fold if you need extra space.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/rs%203/">Audi RS 3</a>'s exterior stays close to the rest of the lineup, but with enough sporty flourishes to distinctively set it apart from its less powerful stablemates. The grille gets a unique silver paint surround, with QUATTRO in black inch-high letters under the black mesh of the grille, in case you somehow forget all four wheels get power. The 19-inch wheels are filled with massive carbon-ceramic brakes if you opt for the Dynamic Plus package (and you should opt for it), and out back there are the black-tipped exhausts and a small ducktail spoiler on the trunk. It's subtle, and if you opt for a more neutral color than our test car's Catalunya Red Metallic, the RS 3 has all the makings of a Q-ship.</p>, <p>Coming standard with the high-output engine are a 7-speed automatic transmission, quattro all-wheel drive and a magnetically adjustable suspension that changes the firmness depending on what driving mode you select. The 2018 Audi RS 3 also comes with a panoramic sunroof, manually adjustable sport seats covered in Nappa leather, dual-zone climate control, and a color driver-information system with a trip computer. Outside there are LED headlights, and on the standard model, the tires are all the same size: 235/35-R19 summer performance tires.</p>, <p>The three main option packages -- all of which you'll likely want -- add about $12,000 to the price of the car, but it's all worth it. The Dynamic package adds the staggered wheel-and-tire package and sport-exhaust system, while the Dynamic Plus package replaces the magnetic suspension with a setup with fixed settings, adds ceramic brakes in front, and lifts the top speed to 174 mph. The technology package adds MMI navigation, Audi Connect, Audi side assist with cross-traffic alert, and an outstanding Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system. Some paint colors also add to the price, and there's a $600 carbon-fiber package to dress up the interior if you're so inclined.</p>, <p>There's only one engine for the 2018 Audi RS 3: a 2.5-liter turbocharged 5-cylinder with 400 horsepower. There's some turbo lag, but it's quickly forgotten once the engine revs and the turbo's at full song. In Dynamic mode, throttle response felt better, and the engine's 354 lb-ft of torque is all available from 1,700-5,850 rpm, an impressive spread. All RS 3 models come with quattro all-wheel drive, and all come with Audi's excellent S Tronic 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Even fuel economy is acceptable for so much power, with up to 28 mpg on the highway.<br>

That gets you the basic car, but as is common for European performance cars, options add up quickly. For max performance, you'll want the Dynamic Plus package ($4,800), which includes the Dynamic package ($1,450). The Technology package ($3,900) and Driver Assistance package ($1,400) are worth the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>. Additionally, any color other than Nardo Gray will cost you at least an additional $575. Click all the option boxes and you could wind up pushing the cost of your RS 3 to more than $70,000, more than you'd pay for a loaded BMW M2 and Mercedes-AMG CLA45, but less than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m4/">BMW M4</a> or AMG C43.

[<p>Audi’s all-new RS 5 Coupe is a high-performance grand tourer boasting 444-horsepower and a comprehensive list of technology tasked with putting that prodigious power to the ground -- necessary hardware when battling the acclaimed BMW M4 and Mercedes-AMG C 63. While the 2018 Audi RS 5 raises the performance bar to new levels, don’t be misled to believe its occupants have been forgotten. Passengers are pampered within one of the best appointed, and most luxurious, cabins offered today. If the RS 5's $71,000 starting price gives you pause, the also-delicious-though-less-exotic Audi A5 Sportback (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/a5/2018/">reviewed here</a>) offers much to less hardcore enthusiasts for a lot less money (and less magic and less performance).</p>, <p>If you insist that your automotive transportation is sleek, stylish and extraordinarily fast without compromising innovation, technology and luxury, welcome home. If you demand nothing but the finest in European engineering, in a head-turning package, the new Audi RS 5 has your name on it.</p>, <p>High-performance drivers seeking a vehicle with track-honed talent, which will be used on a racing circuit (e.g., driver’s education events or autocross), are better served by the competition. The Audi is an exceptional grand tourer, with neck-snapping performance, but it is not a racecar.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi RS 5 is an all-new model that is lighter, faster and technically advanced well beyond its predecessor. While last year’s acclaimed V8 engine is gone, it has been replaced with a turbocharged V6 that delivers more useable power and much better fuel efficiency.</p>, <p>Without a doubt, the Audi RS 5 delivers driving dynamics to support its aggressive appearance. Press the start button and the turbocharged V6 comes to life with an emphatic roar. There is minimal throttle lag, meaning acceleration is nearly instantaneous and violently fast.<br>
<br>
Audi’s 4-mode (Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, and Individual) Drive Select system allows the operator to tailor vehicle driving dynamics to the road, or the mood. Comfort is the most relaxed setting, and likely the best of the various modes. The ride is still firm, but handling is barely compromised -- the Audi coupe carves canyons like a champ without any sign of harshness. The story is much different in Dynamic mode, which makes the (optional) dynamic dampers violently firm -- unreasonably so (unless driving on a perfectly smooth surface, we suggest never using it). Suspension tuning aside, the steering is accurate, the brakes deliver confident stopping, and body roll is minimal. And power from the splendid turbocharged V6 feels unlimited -- the RS 5 delivers the impression that it would cruise at triple-digit speeds all day long.</br></br></p>, <p>2.9-LITER BITURBO V6 ENGINE<br>
This all-new powerplant, which also powers the Porsche Panamera 4S, is wickedly strong, notably efficient, and it delivers a thrilling sound track out the exhaust pipes.<br>
<br>
AUDI VIRTUAL COCKPIT<br>
Virtual gauges, driving information, and real-time Google maps are displayed on a beautiful full-color 12.3-inch primary instrument panel, which is refreshed at 60 frames per second thanks to NVIDIA quad core processing power.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Few will find fault with the beautiful passenger cabin within the 2018 Audi RS 5. A hallmark wrap-around dashboard, near-impeccable ergonomics, and brilliantly illuminated high-resolution screens simplify vehicle operation. Materials fit and finish is first class, too, an accolade that Audi has earned over the past decade.<br>
<br>
Differentiating the RS 5 Coupe interior from its standard Audi A5 siblings are the contoured bucket seats, with RS embossing, a fat -- flat-bottom -- steering wheel with paddle shifters, and stainless-steel pedals. High quality leather and Alcantara upholstery is standard, but most shoppers will check off a few option boxes to customize their interior with premium leather and contrasting stitching.<br>
<br>
If there’s a downside, it’s the two rear seats that are cramped and uncomfortable -- consider the space additional room for luggage and small children, not adults.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While the Audi RS 5 is a high-performance derivative of the standard S5, there is no mistaking its high-performance mission. With heavy design influence from Audi’s racing 90 quattro IMSA GTO, the RS 5 Coupe features wider and flatter Singleframe signature grille, wider front and rear quarter panels (note the gray extension on the outboard side of the headlights -- that accommodates the flare), a lowered ride height, and wider wheels. There is a discreet rear spoiler on the back decklid, and the rear valance has been re-sculpted to accommodate signature oval “RS” exhaust pipes.</p>, <p>Unlike standard A5 models, which are offered in several trim levels, the 2018 Audi RS 5 is all-encompassing -- there is just one premium trim, which is very well configured. The extensive list of standard equipment includes perforated leather upholstery with diamond stitching, smartphone integration, RS sport suspension, 19-inch wheels with performance tires, 3-zone automatic climate control, panoramic sunroof, and Audi pre sense basic, which is a suite of safety-related driver-assistance systems.</p>, <p>Like many premium automakers, Audi offers RS 5 buyers a rainbow of choices in terms of an exterior color -- far beyond the standard palette -- with its Audi Exclusive program. Vivid exterior colors may be matched with carbon-fiber cabin inlays, and optional wheels. Enthusiasts will want the Dynamic Package, with red-painted brake calipers, upgraded suspension, and sport exhaust, while those seeking the ultimate in cabin appointments will want the Fine Nappa leather package with contrasting stitching, LED interior lighting, and leather on the center console and armrests.</p>, <p>Nobody with a pulse will miss the outgoing V8 powerplant, and the new biturbo V6 is bullish regardless of where it’s spinning on the tachometer. Tons of torque down low, combined with Audi’s impressive Quattro all-wheel drive, an 8-speed automatic transmission, and launch control, delivers dizzying acceleration off the line. Mash the throttle on the highway and the RS 5 passes slower traffic in a mere blink -- yes, it’s honestly that quick.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (RS 5)<br>
444 horsepower @ 5,700-6,700 rpm<br>
443 lb-ft of torque @ 1,900-5,000 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/26 mpg</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Base price of the 2018 Audi RS 5 is $70,875 (which includes a $975 destination fee). As expected, the price aligns well with the $69,695 (includes a $995 destination fee) base price of the BMW M4, and the $68,495 (includes a $995 destination fee) base price of the Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupe. Nearly all buyers in this premium segment will add about $10,000 (or more) in options, raising the average purchase price to about $80,000. Keep in mind that most shoppers aren’t seeking the least expensive in this segment -- this is an emotional purchase, based on visual impact, perceived cachet, luxury, and even the sound of the exhaust note.</p>]

[<p>With their timeless style, all-wheel-drive powertrains, beautifully crafted interiors, and top-notch safety and infotainment technologies, the 2018 Audi RS 7 and Audi RS 7 Performance rank among the world’s most desirable hatchbacks. Power, of course, plays a role. The standard RS 7’s twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 puts out 560 horsepower, and in the Performance model, that bumps to 605 hp, which is good for a claimed top speed of 190 mph. Quattro all-wheel drive (AWD) adds to the composure of these super sedans, aided by an 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox that can function like a standard automatic or be shifted manually via paddles on the steering wheel. Competitors include the Porsche Panamera Turbo, BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, and Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S, although the latter two are not hatchbacks.</p>, <p>Looking for a super-fast European sedan that coddles and carves yet has the added practicality of a hatchback? The Audi RS 7 is for you. Moreover, it oozes style and you won’t see yourself coming and going in this rare German.</p>, <p>With a starting price of almost $115,000, the 2018 RS 7 isn’t inexpensive. And if you need more cargo capacity, a sport wagon such as the Mercedes-AMG E 63 wagon is a better choice. Also, the RS 7 seats only four, not five.</p>, <p>The standard aluminum-alloy wheels on this potent Audi are now 21 inches, up from 20. What’s more, a sport exhaust is now standard for 2018.</p>, <p>In either version of the 2018 Audi RS 7 (560 or 605 horsepower), drivers will be awed by the acceleration. This Audi plants you in your seat like few other cars, yet the quattro all-wheel-drive system keeps these sprints remarkably composed. Audi says the RS 7 Performance hits 60 mph in only 3.6 seconds, and has a top speed of 190 mph (the standard RS 7 tops out at 174).<br>
<br>
 But there’s more to these Audis than just raw speed. They exude luxury inside, their build quality is stellar, and they have a comfortable ride that can be adjusted via Audi Drive Select, which allows the driver to choose among Dynamic, Comfort and Auto modes, or select an Individual setting that lets the driver tailor steering effort, transmission shift points and throttle response. While the RS 7 is well suited for the high speeds of the German <i>Autobahnen,</i> it feels totally relaxed and refined in the city and on the daily commute, where it pleases drivers with neat technologies such a head-up display, adaptive cruise control, a night-vision camera, corner-view camera, active lane assist, and MMI touch, which lets drivers “write” an entry by moving their fingers across a touchpad. While this the RS 7 doesn’t quite have the agility of, say, a BMW M5 or an E 63 AMG Mercedes, it relishes sweeping mountain roads, where the comfortable seats, beautifully sculpted dash, sumptuous leather and powerful audio system combine to make that ski trip to Colorado feel much shorter than it actually is.</br></br></p>, <p>GORGEOUS INTERIOR<br>
 Audi does interiors right, and the RS 7’s is a prime example. In appearance, function and feel, the RS 7 cabin, with its multifunction flat-bottom steering wheel and slick carbon-fiber trim, has few rivals. We love the knurled dials for the audio and climate controls, and the 8-inch display that rises each time you start the car.<br>
<br>
 QUATTRO SPORT DIFFERENTIAL<br>
 Standard on the RS 7, the quattro sport rear differential helps the big Audi turn into corners, even when physics tries to make the car continue straight. How so? Unbeknownst to the driver, the sport diff overdrives the outside rear wheel, creating a force that helps rotate the RS 7 into corners, greatly aiding its agility.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>There's much to like inside. The Valcona leather seats are especially handsome, replete with contrast-stitched honeycomb elements and embossed RS 7 logos. Likewise, the 3-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel is exemplary, comfortable in hand and boasting numerous controls yet somehow managing to avoid being too busy. Carbon-fiber inlays on the dash, center console and door panels add high-tech sizzle, while the overall ergonomics are excellent, placing the major controls where expected. As a German sedan, the RS 7 accommodates tall drivers well, but back-seat headroom leaves something to be desired. On a positive note, the rear seat splits and folds to help this Audi better carry large or awkward cargo.</p>, <p>The RS 7 is based on the A7, the hatchback Audi sedan (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/a7/2018/">reviewed here</a>) that has been turning heads since 2012 with its smooth silhouette and sleek fastback roofline. What sets the RS 7 apart? In addition to aluminum-look paint around the grille, there’s a lower front lip spoiler, front-bumper air intakes, and unique side-view mirror housings. And in back, there’s a powered rear spoiler that deploys automatically for increased downforce. Unique 21-inch Audi Sport wheels are available in silver, black and titanium colors. The RS 7 Performance distinguishes itself with a black grille surround and carbon-fiber trim on the front air intakes, side-view mirror housings and rear diffuser.</p>, <p>With a base price of $114,875, the 2018 Audi RS 7 is far from sparsely equipped. Apart from that glorious twin-turbo V8, standard equipment includes the quattro sport rear differential, air suspension, navigation, a 14-speaker Bose audio system, a head-up display, SiriusXM satellite radio, and a 7-inch driver information system. Also included: 12-way Valcona leather seats, split-folding rear seats (with pass-through), a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and LED headlights and taillights. The RS 7 Performance model goes a step further, adding the mighty 605-horsepower engine, electronically adjustable suspension, and track-ready ceramic brakes.</p>, <p>If you want adaptive cruise control (with stop and go functionality) and active lane assist, it’s available as part of the $2,000 Driver Assistance Package. Other notable options include a night-vision camera ($2,500), a Carbon-Optic package ($4,500), massaging front seats ($1,950) and a Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system ($4,900). The Performance model has basically the same options with one exception: a lightweight Audi Sport titanium exhaust that adds 10 horsepower. A point to consider: While the exhaust saves 18 pounds, its $9,350 option price equates to a payout of nearly $520 per pound saved.</p>, <p>The RS 7’s twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 produces 560 horsepower at 5,700 rpm and a sweet 516 lb-ft plateau of torque from 1,750 rpm to 5,500. The RS 7 Performance ramps that up to 605 hp at 6,100 rpm and 553 lb-ft. of torque from 2,500 rpm to 5,500, thanks to revised turbochargers, camshafts and intercoolers. Both engines mate to an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission and quattro AWD.<br>

The RS 7 Performance is listed at $131,675. With just about every option, the standard RS 7 (if there is such a thing) will set you back about $133,000. The 2018 Audi RS 7 Performance model can pass $150,000 with options, including the expensive titanium exhaust. For the record, a Porsche Panamera Turbo, a newer design, starts at about $151,000 and can reach $180,000.

Although small, the A3 contains all the requisite <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> parts, including a powerful engine lineup, a quality interior, loads of high-tech goodies, and the option of quattro all-wheel drive. This combination of features and performance gives the A3, and its high-performance S3 and RS 3 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/rs-3/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) cousins, a leg up on rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/cla/">Mercedes-Benz CLA</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/ilx/">Acura ILX</a>, all while keeping its pricing well below that of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/2%20series/">BMW 2 Series</a>. Audi’s 2018 A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid is the line’s fuel-economy leader, but sadly it doesn’t offer the option of quattro all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>With a base price starting around $33,000, it’s easy to load up a 2018 Audi A3 Sedan or Cabriolet convertible with familiar Audi <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> features and still walk away for less than $40K. The sport-oriented S3 and RS 3 offer sizzling performance, but at a hefty price.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A3 doesn’t have the same visual pop as a Mercedes-Benz CLA or an Infiniti QX30, and you’ll find a better price and more legroom in an Acura ILX. Although its base price is attractive, once you start piling on options, the A3/S3 can easily approach the $50,000 mark.</p>, <p>Audi’s 2018 A3 Sedan and Cabriolet gain standard heated front seats and two USB charging ports. The Premium Plus trim gains Audi Side Assist, while the Technology package now includes the Bang &amp; Olufsen audio upgrade. The S3 gains a new S sport package and the e-tron, optional 18-inch wheels.<br>

Exceptional sound reproduction is the hallmark of this 705-watt, 14-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system, which is optional on the 2018 Audi A3 and standard on the S3. Now part of the Technology package, for an audiophile it’s a $3,200 upgrade that’s an easy investment.<br>
<br>
AUDI ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP &amp; GO<br>
The 2018 Audi A3’s available adaptive cruise control is more than just a convenience option, it’s a valuable safety asset that could one day save your life. Audi’s radar and camera-based system can bring the car to a complete stop and then resume speed, the perfect companion during stop-and-go traffic.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Audi has set a high bar with its interiors, with high-style design and immaculate fit and finish. Yet while the 2018 A3 scores well on materials and assembly, it's a little on the bland side compared with other Audi vehicles. That said, it is cleanly designed and suitably sporty, with simple audio and climate controls. We wish the MMI infotainment interface wasn't placed quite so low on the console though, as it makes it hard to see which button does what until you've learned it by touch. Not surprisingly, rear-seat accommodations are pretty tight, especially for three passengers.</p>, <p>If you like the Audi styling aesthetic, you'll love the 2018 A3’s defining look. Looking a lot like a smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>, its standard bi-xenon headlights, big sunroof and standard 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels make even the least expensive A3 look great. Bigger 18- and 19-inch wheel-and-tire upgrades jazz up the exterior, and S3 models offer unique styling touches to emphasize the sportiness. Under the short rear deck is a 12.3-cubic-foot trunk, which reduces to 10 cubic feet in all-wheel-drive models. <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">Convertibles</a> of course offer two doors, and look especially sharp with the power soft-top lowered.</p>, <p>Standard on every 2018 Audi A3 are a rearview camera and rear-parking sensors, along with heated mirrors, front seats and windshield-washer nozzles. Other standard equipment for the sedan includes leather seats, a panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control, 12-way-power driver’s seat with power lumbar, LED taillights, Bluetooth with audio streaming, 10-speaker audio with single CD player, sensors for automatic windshield wipers and headlights and a 7-inch audio/information screen controlled by Audi's MMI interface. Opt for the sporty S3 and you'll get more power, along with quattro AWD, 18-inch alloys, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and a sport-tuned suspension.</p>, <p>If you'd like to make Audi's inexpensive A3 as pricey as possible, Audi is perfectly happy to help. There are LED headlights, an excellent Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, and a navigation system with Google Earth map technology viewed through Audi’s brilliant Virtual Cockpit. The last of those includes a clever touch pad atop the MMI knob that recognizes handwritten text entry. Dynamic safety features include active lane-keep assist, blind-zone warning and dynamic cruise control. Lastly, S3 models can be had with a $1,500 Magnetic Ride Control suspension system featuring three driving modes: Dynamic, Comfort and Individual.</p>, <p>Multiple engine configurations confront prospective Audi A3 owners, although all displace the same 2.0 liters. Front-wheel-drive (FWD) models employ a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder boasting 186 horsepower, which gets delivered through a dual-clutch 7-speed automatic transmission. If you want quattro AWD, you'll get an engine upgrade as well: a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 220 horsepower, as well as a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (which is also used in the econo-oriented A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid). <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s3/">Audi S3</a> models get a version of the 2.0-liter engine that sends its 292 horsepower to all four wheels. Note that both the A3 and S3 require premium fuel. The A3 Sportback e-tron plug-in hybrid diverges from its siblings, using a 1.4-liter turbocharged inline 4-cylinder paired with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor/generator.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (FWD)<br/> 186 horsepower @ 4,400-6,000 rpm<br/> 221 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/35 mpg (Sedan), 25/33 mpg (Cabriolet)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (AWD)<br/> 220 horsepower @ 4,500 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/31 mpg (Sedan), 22/30 mpg (Cabriolet)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (S3)<br/> 292 horsepower @ 5,400-6,200 rpm<br/> 280 lb-ft of torque @ 1,900-5,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/28 mpg<br/> <br/> 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 + electric motor (A3 Sportback e-tron)<br/> Engine:<br/> 150 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br/> 184 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-3,500 rpm<br/> Electric motor:<br/> 102 horsepower/243 lb-ft of torque<br/> Net output: 204 horsepower/258 lb-ft of torque<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy, est.: 83 MPGe/34 mpg combined</p>, <p>The base 2018 Audi A3 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $33,000. Opt for quattro AWD and the price jumps to just under $36,000. The 2018 A3 Cabriolet starts around $39,325 for FWD, or $42,000 if you want AWD. Greenies can get into a Sportback e-tron for just shy of $40,500, and the power-hungry will gravitate to the Audi S3 at just under $45,000. Options and trim levels can add considerably to the price tag, making your "cheap" Audi cost more than $50,000. The Mercedes-Benz CLA starts slightly lower, but with less standard equipment. The Acura ILX and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/verano/">Buick Verano</a> are both thousands less, but without the pedigree brand or AWD option. Check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others paid in your area. As for resale value, the A3 isn't expected to hold up over the long haul as well as the CLA, or even the ILX.<br>

[<p>A wolf in sheep's clothing, the 2018 Audi S4 sedan appears nearly identical to its A4 sibling (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/a4/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), but packs significantly more performance. Like the A4, the 2018 S4 is all-new, the latest in what has become a cult favorite among compact- performance-luxury <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>. It boasts the impressive roster of technology, safety and driver-assistance features that came with the new A4, but is blessed with a new turbocharged V6 under the hood. Paired with a slick 8-speed automatic transmission, standard Quattro all-wheel drive and upgraded brakes, the S4 excels on just about any road and weather condition. The 2018 S4 is a deft challenger to the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> C43 and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> 340ix, and our choice for drivers craving dynamic performance and understated elegance.</p>, <p>If you want performance without panache, the 2018 Audi S4 sedan blends all-wheel-drive dynamism and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> as few others can. With its brawn also comes plenty of brains, highlighted by <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s excellent suite of driver-assistance, active safety and tech-laden infotainment offerings.</p>, <p>If you must have rear-wheel drive and/or a manual transmission, look elsewhere. A BMW 340i can grant you both, while a Mercedes C43, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q50/">Infiniti Q50</a>, V6-powered <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xe/">Jaguar XE</a> 35t offer a rear-drive layout. Crave even more power? Go M3, C63 or keep those fingers crossed for an RS4.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s4/">Audi S4</a> is all-new for 2018. This compact-luxury-performance sedan comes a year after -- and builds upon -- the all-new A4 sedan. With its 354-horsepower V6, the S4 has over 100 more horsepower than the A4 and boasts a bevy of other performance enhancements.</p>, <p>We'll just come out and say it: We love the way the 2018 Audi S4 handles no matter the situation. Straight-line performer? Zero to 60 mph is extinguished in 4.4 seconds. Serpentine asphalt up and down a mountain? Consider it carved. Supple highway cruising? The S4 is calm and collected. Like so many other <a alt_o_t="Luxury Cars" href="/luxury-car/">luxury cars</a>, the Audi S4's driving behavior and dynamics can be tailored for the road at hand via its standard Audi drive-select programming. But even in "Auto" mode it's smart enough to figure out an ideal balance of comfort and agility. The S4 is just a finely balanced, dynamic, extremely enjoyable car to drive. The 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 is a well of power, and any instances of turbo lag are few and far between. Even the exhaust note is confident, though it can be a bit intrusive when left in Sport mode.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>SLEEPER STATUS<br>
The S4 isn't festooned with a big spoiler and doesn't shout its performance credentials. This is a sleeper through and through. Other drivers will likely see it as just another A4. You'll then quickly be seeing them in your rearview mirror.<br>
<br>
MASSAGING SEATS<br>
It may sound indulgent, but there's nothing quite like having your back massaged while driving or riding as a passenger in the front seat. This feature puts the "comfort" in creature comfort, and best of all it's standard in the 2018 Audi S4.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Audi has a knack for interiors that are tech-savvy, contemporary, minimalistic yet luxurious. One highlight is the optional Virtual Cockpit, a fully configurable digital instrument cluster that can display Google Earth maps, driving data and other info. It complements a center-mounted 7.0-inch infotainment display (an 8.3-inch is optional) that is controlled via a rotary dial and auxiliary buttons above the transmission selector. Speaking of, the Audi uses a "monostable"-type shifter that springs back into place. If you're new to this type of selector, make sure you get comfortable with it. Like other compact-luxury sedans, rear-seat room can be tight for taller passengers.</p>, <p>The S4 appears very similar to its lesser brother, the A4. Still, discerning eyes can parse the differences. For one, the S4 sits 23 millimeters lower than your everyday A4. Up front, full LED lights come standard. Aside from the subtle "S4" badges, the easiest way to tell the two apart is in back. Just look for the S4's quad exhaust outlets. This all-new S4 also benefits from a trunklid lip spoiler. Here, too, its subtlety speaks volumes. The S4 comes with 18-inch wheels with summer or all-season tires. Optional are 19-inch wheels with summer tires.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi S4 sedan comes in two trims: Premium Plus and Prestige. With a name like "Premium Plus," you'd be correct in assuming even a base model is equipped well: Think heated and 12-way-power adjustable front seats with massage functionality, a 755-watt/19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, tri-zone climate control, sunroof, and an infotainment system that works with everything from CDs and HD Radio to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other features include leather/Alcantara seating, 40/20/40-split folding rear seats, driver-seat memory, and Audi's pre sense basic and city systems, which can detect moving objects like pedestrians and automatically apply the brakes.</p>, <p>The S4 Prestige brings Audi's Virtual Cockpit, upgraded 8.3-inch display with navigation and touch/handwriting input, head-up display, top-view rearview camera and blind-spot monitoring. Many options can be bundled into the base model. Others include cold- and warm-weather packages, rear side airbags and Nappa leather interior. The Driver Assistance Package for the Prestige trim brings active lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control with traffic-jam assist, and traffic-sign recognition. For those seeking to wring the most out of this luxury-performance sedan, get the S Sport package. It bundles a sport rear differential that actively splits torque between the rear wheels and adaptive damping suspension.</p>, <p>This is where the real difference exists: Instead of the A4’s 4-cylinder, the new S4 uses a V6. Whereas past S4 models used supercharging to boost power, this new one is turbocharged. Among the results is a gain of 21 horsepower and 44 lb-ft of torque over the previous generation. All 2018 S4s use Audi's fantastic Quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. An 8-speed automatic is your only transmission, but it's a good one; smooth all the way. Like so many other <a alt_o_t="New Cars" href="/new-cars/">new cars</a> seeking to eke out better fuel economy, the Audi S4 uses an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle. It can be aggravating in urban settings, but can be disabled with the press of a button.<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter turbocharged V6<br/> 354 horsepower @ 5,400-6,400 rpm<br/> 369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,370-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/30 mpg</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi S4 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $51,875 for a Premium Plus model and $56,775 for the Prestige. Fully loaded, an S4 can run into the high $60,000 range. At these prices, the S4 is nearly in line with the all-wheel-drive BMW 340ix, Mercedes-Benz AMG C43 sedan, and Infiniti Q50 Red Sport 400 AWD. An AWD <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> 3.5t can be had for less, as can the lower-powered <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s60/">Volvo S60</a> T6 AWD R-Design and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus IS</a> 350 F Sport AWD. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Audi. We expect the all-new Audi S4's resale value to hold up quite well over the years.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Audi S5 is the performance version of the A5, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s compact-luxury <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/convertible/">convertible</a>. These 2-door/4-passenger models begin with the appealing looks, impressive technology and free-spirit attitude of the all-new A5 coupe and convertible (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/a5/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), and inject them with a turbocharged V6 engine, upgraded brakes and other spruced-up hardware. The S5 comes standard with Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system, one of the keys to its excellent traction, and a distinguisher between the S5 and rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> 440i and the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q60/">Infiniti Q60</a> Red Sport, in which AWD is optional. Still to come is a third model, a sleek 5-door hatch called the S5 Sportback that will compete with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a> Gran Coupe.</p>, <p>If you already have your eye on the A5 coupe or convertible -- impressive in their own right -- but seek a serious bump in power and performance, the 2018 Audi S5 is the logical choice. The S5 is also a powerhouse when it comes to tech and active safety features.</p>, <p>If you're among the few drivers who still demand a manual transmission, look to the BMW 4 Series. If you want your convertible to have a retractable-hardtop roof instead of fabric, the 4 Series is also the way to go. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rc/">Lexus RC</a> and new Infiniti Q60 bring arguably more fluid looks.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi S5 is all-new. Based on the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a5/">Audi A5</a>, the S5 packs a serious performance upgrade thanks to a turbocharged V6 engine that spits out 354 horsepower, stronger brakes and other hardware. The S5 will be the lineup's top performer until the ultra-hot <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2018-audi-rs-5-audi-sport-takes-on-bmw-m4-and-mercedes-amg-c63/2100004099/">2018 Audi RS5</a> arrives next year.</p>, <p>The new Audi A5, the S5's lesser sibling, already has an excellent blend of power, dynamics and everyday drivability. In the S5, the performance equation gets a serious boost, all without sacrificing comfort. The 2018 Audi S5 is the automotive equivalent of having your cake and eating it, too. Power delivery from the new turbocharged V6 is immediate and gratifying. In coupe form, the S5 can hit the 0-60-mph performance benchmark in 4.4 seconds, while the S5 cabriolet is just a few ticks behind at 4.8. The sound of its exhaust is deep and powerful in Dynamic mode, though we admittedly prefer its quieter operation in the Standard drive mode after extended time on the road. Much more than a mere straight-line performer, the S5 shines when the road twists and turns. Here its asphalt-sticking ways help it adhere even when driven very hard.</p>, <p>MASSAGING FRONT SEATS<br/> As with the also-new <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/audi/s4/2018/">2018 Audi S4</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>, the latest S5 comes with S sport front seats with massage functionality. It's an unexpected indulgence, and one you can be thankful for on long and dreary commutes.<br/> <br/> IT'S SMART, TOO<br/> For all the S5's brawn, it's brainy, too. This being an Audi, it features the German <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand's slick Virtual Cockpit digital instrument display, realistic Google Maps navigation integration, 4G LTE wireless connectivity and a full roster of active safety features.<br/> </p>, <p>Both the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s5/">Audi S5</a> coupe and convertible have seating for four instead of the five found in the A4 and S4, and the two rear seats aren't much to boast about. Most adults will be cramped, and just getting in and out of the rear seats in the coupe can be an exercise in agility. Thankfully the front seats are sublime. We've already mentioned their standard massage functionality in Favorite Features. In addition, they have pneumatic side bolsters that help cradle you during spirited driving. The cabin itself is sleek and contemporary, with an infotainment screen that blooms from the center dash.</p>, <p>As with the S4/A4 sedan relationship, the S5 coupe and convertible look very similar to their lesser A5 brethren. Up front are Audi's big ol' Singleframe grille -- quite tasteful for what it is -- and a domed hood that is meant to evoke muscularity. One way to tell the difference between an S5 and A5 is go around back. The S5 has quad tailpipe outlets, which more than hint at this model's enhanced power. The S5 coupe has a panoramic sunroof as standard, while the cabriolet has a black fabric that can be operated at speeds up to 31 mph.</p>, <p>The 2018 S5 comes in two trims: Premium Plus and Prestige. With a designation like "Premium Plus," know that even a base model is nicely equipped. Included are leather/Alcantara upholstery, 12-way-adjustable heated and massaging front seats, tri-zone climate control, and HomeLink garage-door opener. The base audio/information system centers around a 7-inch display and has 10 speakers, AM/FM/HD Radio, CD player, and inputs for USB and SD card. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility is standard. The S5’s safety features include side assist (blind-spot monitoring) and Audi's pre sense systems that can automatically stop the car to avoid or mitigate a collision.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the Prestige trim adds the sweet Virtual Cockpit feature that turns the dashboard into a configurable digital screen, 19-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, navigation, a larger 8.3-inch dash display, and parking system with top-down-view camera. Other options include an S Sport Package with adaptive damping suspension and sport rear differential, ventilated front seats and Nappa leather interior. A Driver Assistance package on Prestige models bundles semi-autonomous driving aids like lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and traffic-sign recognizer. Both coupe and convertible can be had with 19-inch wheels in lieu of the standard 18-inch rollers.</p>, <p>The Audi S5 boasts a sweetheart of an engine -- a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that puts out 354 horsepower -- that's 102 more than the 4-cylinder in the A5. Tying it all together is an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission that we like even more than the A5's dual-clutch 7-speed, and Audi's famed Quattro all-wheel-drive system. The S5 can be tailored to different driving styles and feel with its 4-mode selector (Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual). For all but the most intense driving exercises, we found the Auto mode a fine balance. While automatic is the only transmission choice, the S5 has steering-wheel-mounted paddles for do-it-yourselfers.<br>
<br>
3.0-liter turbocharged V6<br>
 354 horsepower @ 5,400-6,400 rpm<br>
 369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,370-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/30 mpg (coupe), 20/29 mpg (convertible)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Audi S5 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $55,575 for the coupe and $63,275 for the cabriolet. The Prestige trims of each begin at $59,975 and $67,675, respectively. Options can lift those prices by a few thousand more. At its starting price, the 2018 S5 is higher than that of the BMW 440i and in line with the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> AMG C43. Those two are the S5's most direct competitors, but others are within its hemisphere, including V6 versions of the Infiniti Q60 coupe, which start lower, and the Lexus RC 350 coupe. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. Resale value is still to be determined on this new S5, but past models have enjoyed good residuals in the past.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 A6 is <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s <a alt_o_t="Midsize Sedan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-sedans/2000009275/">midsize sedan</a>, a Goldilocks of a <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a> that splits the comfort/performance balance of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a>, all while imparting its own personality. Don't let the A6's understated attitude fool you: Underneath that contemporary skin is an executive <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> that's rewarding to drive and technologically advanced. Audi's famed quattro all-wheel-drive system provides excellent traction, and three powertrains -- turbocharged 4-cylinder, supercharged V6 or the twin-turbo V8 in the S6 -- provide good, great or hold-on-to-your-hat performance. In addition to its German rivals, the A6 faces competition ranging from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xf/">Jaguar XF</a> to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ct6/">Cadillac CT6</a>. While the A6 may fly lower on the radar, it merits a spot on yours.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> sedan resides where <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>, performance, technology and sophistication meet. If that sounds like your sweet spot, start planning a test drive. If you're looking for a high-performance alternative to a V8-powered BMW M550i or Mercedes-AMG E43, the S6 packs a wallop.</p>, <p>If you want your car to have instant recognition and vehicular validation, the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class are better known in this class. The Lexus GS, meanwhile, is predicted to have slightly higher resale value.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Audi A6 comes standard with MMI Navigation and Audi's advanced key (keyless entry and ignition). Mid-trim Premium Plus models get LED headlights and full LED interior lighting, while Prestige models now include a top-view camera. Models with the 3.0-liter supercharged V6 gain seven horsepower, for a total of 340.</p>, <p>It's safe to say that all A6 models are swift, with even base 4-cylinder versions hitting the 0-60-mph benchmark in 6.7 seconds. This isn't as quick as a base BMW 5 Series or even an E-Class for that matter, but fast enough for most needs. The supercharged V6 in 3.0 models easily rectifies this, bringing that figure down to 5.1 seconds, while the S6 thrills with a 4.4-second mark. More impressive than outright acceleration is the A6's balance of dynamic handling and compliant manners. This is a car that feels at ease in almost any situation. Helping that factor is the A6's quattro all-wheel-drive system, which we recommend in lieu of the front-drive setup on the least expensive models. If you're not quite up for the high-performance S6, the A6 Competition promises better handling with its stiffer suspension and sport differential.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/audi/s6/2018/">2018 AUDI S6</a><br/> If the A6 flies beneath the radar, the S6 dives further still, making this a serious wolf in sheep's clothing. Few will know that under this sedan's stately and conservative exterior is a pulsating 450-horsepower V8 and performance hardware to match.<br/> <br/> COMFORT SEATING PACKAGE<br/> If you want superior coddling behind the wheel, check this option box. In addition to having plusher front seats overall, they'll also feature ventilation (a lifesaver in hot and humid weather) and a massaging feature. We call that "Ahhh"-inspiring.<br/> </p>, <p>Audi interiors have long been among our favorites. Like these cars themselves, they're classy, comfortable and tech-forward. Along with supple leather upholstery and intricate trims, the 2018 A6 sedan includes Audi’s MMI infotainment and navigational system that continues to dazzle with some help from Google Maps and Audi’s smartphone interface. While the A6 has yet to receive Audi's Virtual Cockpit, a fully configurable digital dashboard, a screen between the gauges has the ability to relay similar content, including maps. The rear seat is accommodating even for taller adults and offers excellent outward visibility. At over 14 cubic feet, the trunk is well-sized.</p>, <p>The A6’s exterior features some bold elements, such as the recently upgraded headlights, grille, front bumper and LED taillights, but overall the shape and styling remain typically Audi conservative. Viewed from behind, the taillights have a sleek profile and are easy to pick out whenever you’re behind one, day or night. The new Competition Package, available on Premium Plus and Prestige trims, brings a more aggressive tone with black exterior mirror housings, red brake calipers and 20-inch, 5-double-spoke Titanium-matte wheels with summer tires. The 2018 Audi S6 performance sedan looks much like an A6 except for its quad exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A6 comes in three main trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. For 2018, the base Premium model comes even better equipped, highlighted by the standard inclusion of Audi's MMI navigation and advance key. Other notable standard features include leather interior, parking sensors and rearview camera, tri-zone climate control, sunroof, heated front seats and 60/40-split folding rear seats. In addition to navigation, the standard infotainment system includes AM/FM/CD audio system and smartphone integration that's CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. Premium Plus trims add blind-spot monitoring, 4-zone climate control, Bose audio system, LED headlights, power-folding side mirrors and power-adjustable steering column.</p>, <p>The top-trim A6 Prestige model includes a standard V6 engine, power-operated trunk, head-up display, the newly standard top-view camera, and rear-window sunshades. Options, many of which are packaged, include driver-assist and safety features like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and automatic emergency braking. In addition to interior and exterior touches, the Competition Package brings sport suspension and sport rear differential for improved handling. The high-performance <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s6/">Audi S6</a> includes a V8 engine, upgraded brakes, adaptive air suspension and 12-way-adjustable front seats.</p>, <p>Two engines are available for the A6: a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder good for 252 horsepower or a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 that, for 2018, makes the 340 horsepower formerly reserved for Competition models. Base 2018 A6 models are front-wheel drive (FWD) and use a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. We've found that transmission a bit unrefined in other Audi models, all the more reason to spend a little more and get a model with the quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system and 8-speed Tiptronic transmission, which provides smoother shifts. The 2018 S6 packs a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that is linked to a 7-speed S tronic dual-clutch, but with all-wheel drive.<br>

That's a $2,100 increase over last year's base price, but the 2018 model carries more content. A base AWD A6 is now $52,875, while an A6 3.0T with the supercharged V6 begins at $57,475. All in, a 2018 A6 can pass the $70,000 mark. The potent Audi S6 starts at $72,875 in Premium Plus trim and over $75,000 as a Prestige model. For comparison, the 5 Series and E-Class start slightly higher, at around $52,000 and $53,000, respectively. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>'s potential rivals begin higher (CT6) and lower (CTS).

[<p>Those who proclaim Americans won’t buy <a alt_o_t="Hatchbacks" href="/hatchback/">hatchbacks</a> have clearly never driven (or even seen) the stunning <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a7/">Audi A7</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s7/">Audi S7</a> for 2018. Practical side notwithstanding, the 2018 Audi A7-- and its performance stablemates the S7 and RS 7 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/audi/rs-7/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) -- deliver impressive levels of performance, styling, technology and desirability. The lineup is designed to thrill at different levels, meaning the “base” A7 offers copious <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> features with ample performance, while the S7 includes much of the A7’s technology while placing an emphasis on blistering speed and razor-sharp handling. Audi’s well-established quattro all-wheel drive is along for the ride, as is a brilliant suspension every bit the equal of cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/6%20series/">BMW 6 Series</a> Gran <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/cls/">Mercedes-Benz CLS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/panamera/">Porsche Panamera</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi A7 and Audi S7 offer all the virtues of a roomy sedan wrapped in a sleek, coupe-like body. With two powerful engine choices, dynamic handling and what is arguably one of the most beautiful interiors ever crafted, it’s hard to find reasons not to like these two cars.</p>, <p>All that we love about the 2018 Audi A7 <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> comes at a rather lofty price. You can get the same style and performance from a less expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x4/">BMW X4</a> or even a domestic like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkz/">Lincoln MKZ</a>.</p>, <p>Audi’s A7 luxury performance sedan gains a more powerful 3.0T V6, while the Prestige trim adds a corner-view camera. A new Competition package is offered featuring a unique quattro sport differential, red brake calipers, sport seats, a flat-bottom steering wheel and S-line styling cues. The S7 gains more wheel options.</p>, <p>With its 340-horsepower supercharged V6 engine, even the least expensive 2018 Audi A7 delivers a stellar performance, darting from zero to 60 mph in just over five seconds. It’s one of our favorite drivetrains, generating ample power at nearly any speed and operating so smoothly we sometimes glanced at the tachometer to be certain the engine was still running. Moving up to the more aggressive S7 sacrifices some ride comfort and cabin quietness, but the trade-off is more than worth it. Audi’s 2018 S7 derives its power from a 450-horsepower V8, which can seem like overkill on paper, but never from behind the wheel. The S7 is a delightful performer, agile, quick and confident. Yet, behind all the power and performance figures for both the A7 and S7 is a truly remarkable luxury story, one wrapped in an elegant design, premium wood and leather, and supremely comfortable seating both front and rear.</p>, <p>INTERIOR REFINEMENT<br>
 One look inside the 2018 Audi A7 reveals fine leathers, sculpted dash and door panels, and an 8-inch display that electronically rises from the dash. Spend more time and you’ll discover obsessive minor details, such as the knurled dials for audio and climate controls.<br>
<br>
 GOOGLE NAVIGATION<br>
 Beyond the standard navigation found in the most basic cars these days, the A7 offers Google Earth and traffic, putting it on par with some of the best smartphone navigation apps. The system can even utilize Google Street View, providing life-like street and building details.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>There's so much to like inside the Audi A7 it's hard to know where to start. There are high-quality materials, like standard leather seating, with an upgrade to diamond-stitched higher-quality hides in S7 models. The A7 seats five, but the S7 seats four because of a pair of contoured rear seats instead of a 3-person bench. Thanks to the standard 8-way-power/4-way-lumbar adjustment and power-operated steering-wheel adjustment, it's easy for drivers of various shapes and sizes to be comfortable. And, in a nod to practicality, the A7 is a hatchback, with plenty of cargo space.</p>, <p>Ever since its debut in 2012, the A7's fastback shape has been a defining element. Sure, beauty is subjective, but most agree this is a fine-looking car from virtually any angle. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> calls it a "sedan," but a rear power-operated hatch makes it a hatchback. It offers easy access to the cargo area with its 24.5 cubic feet of space. Models are visually distinguished through exterior styling, with the higher-performing S7 boasting its own front and rear bumper design, and the almighty RS 7 featuring a carbon-fiber splitter and diffusor. All models include a sunroof and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> rear spoiler.</p>, <p>With a base price of about $70,000 and an Audi badge on the nose, you'd expect even the base A7 to come nicely equipped. With standard features like a supercharged V6 engine, 4-zone climate control, an interior awash in leather and wood, and heated 8-way-power front seats, you'd be right. Also standard on the 2018 A7 is navigation, a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring (Audi calls it "side assist”), and a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD player with satellite and HD Radio with two USB ports. Also standard is Audi connect and Audi smartphone interface, both of which enhance your smartphone ownership experience.</p>, <p>There's a long list of options for the Audi A7 lineup, not the least of which is choosing between the A7 and S7. Beyond that there are massaging front seats with ventilation, and an available fighter-jet-style head-up display that projects pertinent driver information onto the windshield. The Driver Assistance package adds active lane assist, adaptive cruise control, corner-view cameras and a host of other technology, including Audi pre sense plus, which applies the brakes to avoid or lessen the impact of a frontal collision. A new A7 Competition package adds more performance features for better handling.</p>, <p>Last year’s A7 Competition 3.0T supercharged V6 is now the standard powertrain in all A7 models, while the S7 continues to offer a potent 450-horsepower 4.0-liter V8. The 2018 Audi A7 comes with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and quattro all-wheel drive is also standard; the S7 comes with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. But don't worry, none of these cars is a slouch, with even the "base" A7 scooting to 60 mph from a standstill in just over five seconds.<br>

Note that's all before adding options; start checking those boxes and the price escalates quickly.

[<p>The 2018 Audi A8 is the flagship <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> for the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> German automaker, a rolling statement of success that competes in the rarefied air of executive haulers like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/s-class/">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/7%20series/">BMW 7 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/ls/">Lexus LS</a>. Audis have long nailed a fine balance between comfort and performance, all while showcasing the brand's tenacious quattro all-wheel-drive system and futuristic technology. These characteristics remain true of the 2018 A8 even as it enters its final year of production before an all-new version arrives. The high-performance S8, meanwhile, takes all this and adds over 600 horsepower to the recipe. While 2018 marks the last of this current-gen A8, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s flagship still has a lot to offer those seeking a posh and polished German luxury sedan.</p>, <p>If you desire an executive sedan that is just different enough to spark interest yet comes from a brand whose luxury credentials need no explaining, the 2018 Audi A8 satisfies. If you want that in a high-end sedan with thrilling power and performance, look to the souped-up S8 variant.</p>, <p>If you can wait for the 2019 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a8/">Audi A8</a>, you'll get an even more advanced vehicle. Otherwise, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series are fresher flagships, while an all-new Lexus LS is around the corner. If you want CarPlay or Android Auto, wait or look elsewhere.</p>, <p>In its last year of production before an all-new A8 arrives for 2019, few changes are in store for this 2018 model. Among them is an Executive Package on base 3.0T models that bundles driver-assistance features like active lane keeping and amenities including ventilated and massaging front seats.</p>, <p>Is it a luxury sedan or a performance car? With the 2018 A8, you get both. The scales tip toward the latter in the A8 4.0T with its V8 engine, though even the standard supercharged V6 does a fine job hustling Audi's flagship up to speed. Naught to 60 mph arrives in a 5.5 seconds in the base model, and decreases to a blazing 4.4 seconds in the 4.0T. Need more? The S8 will rocket you from 0 to 60 in a supercar-like 3.7 seconds, all while tackling corners like a smaller and lither car. All A8 models have a fine degree of finesse and comfort thanks to standard air suspension and all-wheel drive, the latter especially appreciated in cold-weather states. In our time with an A8 high in the Rocky Mountains, we found it to be quiet and exceedingly comfortable in everyday driving. The S8, a driver's car, danced through corners.</p>, <p>22-WAY MULTI-CONTOUR SEATS<br>
 Face it: No matter where you drive an A8, you'll always be in the same place -- the front seat. Thus, we recommend getting the most comfortable one you can. Those in the Executive Package adjust nearly two dozen ways and will even massage you. Front passengers get the same treatment.<br>
<br>
 S8: A 605-HORSEPOWER SLEEPER<br>
 We love the S8 for many reasons: Its shorter overall length than the A8 makes it easier to maneuver in tight spots, while its torque-vectoring rear sport differential helps ensure optimal power delivery and grip. Most of all, we love this 605-horsepower sedan's sleeper status.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Though on the cusp of replacement, the A8's interior has held up well. While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of even its newer A4 sibling such as the Virtual Cockpit or Apple CarPlay/Android integration, the A8's cabin is a commendable cocoon of indulgence. We've already waxed poetic on the 22-way-adjustable front seats, each straddled by a wide console festooned with buttons and a gearshift that looks like it was taken from a jet. A8 models, only available as "L" for long-wheelbase, have scads of rear-seat legroom at nearly 43 inches, while the S8 still boasts a commendable 38.7 inches.</p>, <p>Like other Audis, this flagship sedan is stately but reserved, eschewing the fluidity of, say, the latest S-Class for a more conservative shape. We say "mostly" reserved save for the front, which is distinguished by Audi's signature LED strip underneath the headlights and a massive, trapezoidal grille. The A8 is only available in one length -- long wheelbase -- and comes in at 207.4 total inches. The S8 is a bit shorter and easier to park at 202.6 inches. One of the easiest ways to distinguish the 2018 S8 performance model is to look for the wide quad tailpipes in back.</p>, <p>Even the least expensive 2018 A8 3.0T can make you feel rich with such standard features as leather interior, 18-way power-operated and heated front seats, Bose audio system, navigation, quad-zone climate control and sunroof. Thoughtful features include power-rear sunshade, rear-seat vanity mirrors and even a headlight washer. Every A8 also comes with a 6-month subscription to Audi connect, which offers in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. Quattro -- Audi's term for its all-wheel-drive system -- is also standard. In addition to the V8 engine, the 4.0T model includes 22-way front seats with ventilation and massaging, heated rear seats, head-up display and panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>On the 3.0T model, the Executive Package adds active safety and driving aids like blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, plus a top-view camera. On A8 4.0 models it also includes separate power-operated rear outboard seats with ventilation and massage functionality. The S8 performance sedan has a sport-tuned suspension, sport rear differential and 21-inch wheels. The S8 can be further upgraded with ceramic brakes, night-vision assistant, Alcantara headliner and Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p>, <p>Two gasoline engines are available for the 2018 Audi A8 sedan, both connected to a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission. The A8 3.0T uses a supercharged V6 while the 4.0T Sport gets a turbocharged V8, both of which have fuel-saving start/stop technology. The star athlete, however, is the S8 Plus with its 4.0-liter turbo V8 tuned to make 605 horsepower. With a blistering 0-60-mph time of 3.7 seconds, the 2018 S8 will embarrass many sports cars. All A8 and S8 models include quattro all-wheel drive.<br>

The V8-powered A8 4.0 pushes the price just shy of $93,000. The S8 Plus debuts near $117,000. The Executive Package can add several thousand more to the bottom line. The Audi A8's starting price is significantly less than that of the nearly $100,000 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, though the Benz comes standard with a V8. The A8's starting price is nearly the same as a base BMW 7 Series, and above that of the Lexus LS, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xj/">Jaguar XJ</a> and new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/genesis/g90/">Genesis G90</a>.

[<p>All-new for 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a> enters its second generation with added power, higher efficiency, a tailored new suit and even more brains. It's all an improvement on a recipe that has worked so well for <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s compact-luxury SUV that within a few years of its introduction in 2009, the model went on to become the German brand's best seller. Along with the new Q5 is a higher-performance SQ5, boasting a turbocharged V6 engine, better handling, and improved performance capability all around. Together, they make a compelling case in a booming segment that includes competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rdx/">Acura RDX</a>, and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-pace/">Jaguar F-Pace</a>. Even against that crowd the 2018 Audi Q5 and SQ5 stand out with a stellar blend of performance, comfort and capability, and an impressive roster of standard safety features.</p>, <p>If you want a smaller <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV with excellent overall driving manners, standard all-wheel drive, gee-whiz technology and active safety features like automatic emergency braking, the 2018 Audi Q5 checks every box. The new SQ5 includes all that, and adds a dose of faster to the mix.</p>, <p>There's no <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> or diesel version of the Q5, so luxury fuel sippers will need to look at the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/glc/">Mercedes-Benz GLC</a> for their savings. The Acura RDX and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a> have lower starting prices. The performance-oriented SQ5 model is fun, but nicely equipped models come close to the $70,000 mark.</p>, <p>The 2-row/5-passenger Audi Q5 luxury SUV is all-new for 2018. It enters its second generation with a bump in power and fuel efficiency, a new 7-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission, slightly roomier interior and a roster of standard features that include Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility and Audi pre sense safety systems. SQ5 models offer a turbocharged V6 and 8-speed transmission, along with high-performance suspension and brakes.<br>

<a href="https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-q5.html?ddcref=KBB_Audi_Review">Learn more about the all-new 2018 Audi Q5 at audiusa.com</a></br></br></p>, <p>The new Q5 strikes a lovely balance between an X3 and GLC, with a personality we'd summarize with the word "confident." When we pushed the new Q5 hard on mountain roads, its manners felt more sports <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> than <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV. In both around-town driving and highway stretches, the Q5 is quiet and comfortable. And though most owners aren't likely to get their Q5 very dirty, it's surprisingly competent on dirt trails. The Q5's 252-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and 7-speed transmission make a good pairing. With a 0-60-mph time of 5.9 seconds, the new Q5 is faster than the prior version with the optional V6. The SQ5 takes all of that and amplifies it with about 100 more horsepower, sharper handling, better brakes, and even better steering. Yet the SQ5 gives up almost nothing when it comes to ride comfort or daily practicality.</p>, <p>AUDI PRE SENSE SAFETY SYSTEMS<br/> The 2018 Q5 and SQ5 come standard with both "basic" and "city" versions of this system. The first prepares the vehicle for an impact by closing windows and pre-tensioning safety belts. The second can detect other cars and pedestrians, and apply the brakes at up to 52 mph to mitigate or lessen an impact.<br/> <br/> PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM<br/> We're suckers for a sweet audio system, and the latest Q5 and SQ5 <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> offers an ear-popping one with its optional Bang &amp; Olufsen setup. With 16 speakers pumping out 755 watts from a variety of sources -- including "old-school" compact discs -- it's bound to enhance any drive.</p>, <p>As with other Audis, the new Q5 and SQ5 offer up a 2-row/5-passenger interior at the intersection of contemporary design, cutting-edge technology and premium amenities. It's sleek yet handsome, and thankfully not overwhelmed with buttons. One of the highlights is the optional Virtual Cockpit, which turns the instrument cluster into a customizable 12.3-inch digital display that can show everything from the expected -- speed and mpg -- to the gee-whiz, such as realistic Google Maps. At 37.8 inches, rear legroom is good, as is cargo volume of over 60 cubic feet with the 40/20/40-split seats folded. The front seats are supportive, a benefit for longer commutes.</p>, <p>This latest Q5's squat and dignified exterior has changed just enough to keep it interesting while still remaining familiar. Up front is that gaping grille, surrounded by a new fascia, standard xenon headlights and LED running lights. Around back are a pair of elongated tailpipe housings and the all-important power tailgate. Standard roof rails help remind that this is an SUV. The Q5 rolls on 18-inch wheels as standard, with 19- and 20-inch variants optional. While other crossover SUVs have traded ground clearance for a more sedan-like ride, the 2018 Q5's stance has actually increased slightly, from 7.9 inches to 8.2 inches. The SQ5 adds to the look with a unique grille treatment, roof spoiler, and distinctive headlights.</p>, <p>The 2nd-gen Audi Q5 is available in three trims: Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. The base Premium model is nicely equipped, even for a luxury-crossover SUV, with standard features like leather interior, tri-zone climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility, power-operated front seats, HomeLink garage-door opener and power tailgate. As mentioned in Favorite Things, the Q5 also includes impressive safety systems. The standard 10-speaker/180-watt audio system has an AM/FM and HD Radio, CD player and USB and SD card inputs, along with Bluetooth connectivity. A 7-inch center infotainment display and rearview camera are also included.</p>, <p>If you can swing it, we recommend the mid-trim Q5 Premium Plus with blind-spot monitoring, hands-free tailgate, heated front seats with driver's seat memory, full LED lights and panoramic sunroof. This trim opens the door to further options. The top-line Q5 Prestige adds the Virtual Cockpit, navigation system, Bang &amp; Olufsen premium audio system, top-view camera system with parking sensors, head-up display, 8.3-inch center screen, and 20-inch wheels. The Q5 can be upgraded with heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, adaptive damping suspension and a driver-assistance package that bundles adaptive cruise control, active lane-keeping assist, traffic-sign recognition, and automatic high-beam control.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine in the Q5 comes standard with a 7-speed dual-clutch S tronic transmission. That transmission routes power to all four wheels through quattro all-wheel drive, standard equipment on all Q5 models. The sophisticated system enhances fuel efficiency by powering the front wheels when possible, and instantly shift up to 100 percent of the power to the rear wheels as needed, so lightning-fast that you'll likely never notice it working. The SQ5 packs 102 more horsepower from its turbocharged 354-horsepower V6 engine, which comes connected to a Tiptronic 8-speed automatic transmission.<br>

The higher-performance SQ5 starts at about $55,300, and prices can climb up to the $70,000 once you start loading it with options. The Q5 and SQ5 start slightly higher than the equivalent BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC models, but the gap narrows once you select all-wheel drive on those models.

[<p>The 2018 Audi TT is a counterpunch to sporty <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a> and <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/z4/">BMW Z4</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q60/">Infiniti Q60</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayman/">Porsche Cayman</a> and Boxster. Like virtually everything <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> makes, the 2018 TT seamlessly blends its performance, style and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>, never favoring one aspect of its personality over the other. Under the hood is a superb 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, putting out 220 horsepower in the TT or 292 in the TTS. Add in Audi's excellent quattro all-wheel-drive system, and high-tech features like the so-cool "virtual cockpit" and you have a car that encapsulates 21st-century driving. It's brilliant fun at its limits, especially in TTS form, but it's also practical, with generous front-seat room and plenty of cargo space in coupe models, too.</p>, <p>From the base coupe to the TTS convertible, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/tt/">Audi TT</a> and Audi TTS offer a unique blend of style, technology and all-wheel drive. With a starting price in the mid-$40,000 range, you could even call it a sensible choice for a luxury-sports car.</p>, <p>Neither version comes in rear-wheel drive, and neither offers a manual transmission, which could kill the deal for some enthusiasts. If that's you, the BMW Z4 or 4 Series and Porsche Cayman and Boxster come with manual transmissions, as does the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> if you're willing to make the financial stretch.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi TT coupe and roadster now get standard parking sensors, and an updated technology package now includes a 12-speaker Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. A new S-line competition package adds high-gloss interior trim, brushed aluminum doorsills and other visual goodies.</p>, <p>Audi says it committed to making a pure sports car for this 3rd-generation TT and TTS, even going so far as to call it a "baby brother" to the vaunted <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/r8/">Audi R8</a> exotic. That, to be honest, is a stretch, but there's no doubt that the 2018 Audi TT and 2018 TTS have the performance and handling chops to take on its rivals from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>. The way the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/quattro/">Audi quattro</a> all-wheel-drive system sends the 220 horsepower from the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine to the ground is like adding gravity, keeping the car pinned in hairpin turns and high-speed sweepers. There's no lack of power; the TT coupe gets to 60 mph in about 5.3 seconds, and the TTS gets there in s 4.6. Yet, despite all this sports-car talk, the TT and TTS remain surprisingly livable in quiet and relaxed driving.</p>, <p>VIRTUAL COCKPIT<br>
This is a must-have feature on a new Audi. It replaces the physical gauges with a 12.3-inch digital display running at 60 frames per second, powered by an NVIDIA quad-core computer processor. The upshot is that you get a flicker-free experience, with multiple levels of information available right in front of you.<br>
<br>
QUATTRO<br>
Audi didn't invent all-wheel drive, but its quattro system is so intrinsic to the brand's DNA that you could be forgiven for thinking it had. Proven on rally cars around the world, the system not only improves grip on slick roads, but on dry roads as well.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The air vents in the 2018 Audi TT cabin don't just aim the air. The elegant design incorporates the controls as well, showing the climate readout in the vent dial, and using the housing to control adjust temperature, seat heat and more. That kind of simplicity and elegance permeates the TT's cabin, whether it's the vents, the Virtual Cockpit, or the excellent ergonomics and comfortable front seats. It's an excellent experience for the driver and front passenger, but the coupe's rear seats aren't really fit for people. Better to fold and forget them. We wish the TT's sun visors offered more adjustments.</p>, <p>The 1st-generation TT boasted an "upside-down bathtub" shape, most of which is gone on the newest version, with the rounded wheel arches and central exhaust the only vestiges of that iconic styling. However, the TT and TTS are still distinctive cars. The hatch on the coupe models blends neatly into the tail, while the roadster's fabric roof opens and closes in 10 seconds, at speeds up to 31 mph. The squat and muscular shape of its immediate predecessor remains, but with taut lines, a trapezoidal grille, and full LED headlights adding distinctive touches.</p>, <p>Newly standard on the 2018 TT and TTS are parking sensors, which combine with the standard rearview camera to make backing up a snap. Also standard are power-folding and automatically dimming heated exterior mirrors, the Virtual Cockpit, MMI touch-based infotainment system, and a 9-speaker/155-watt AM/FM/CD/HD Radio with two USB inputs and Bluetooth connectivity. There's automatic climate control and full LED headlights. Leather upholstery comes standard, as do the 12-way power-adjustable heated front seats. Roadsters come with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> wind blocker along with its power-operated top, while the higher-performing 2018 Audi TTS comes with adjustable suspension, larger wheels and tires, and TTS-specific styling.</p>, <p>Along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 12-speaker 680-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system is available for the 2018 Audi TT and TTS. It's all part of the Technology package, which also adds navigation, Audi Connect 4G LTE service with Wi-Fi, and a side-assist blind-spot monitoring system. An S-line competition package adds glossy interior accents, aluminum doorsills and inlays, red brake calipers, suspension upgrades, and unique seats and leather. The TTS Coupe offers Nappa leather-trimmed seats with contrast diamond stitching and three color options, including an eye-catching Calendula Yellow.</p>, <p>The 2018 Audi TT and TTS come with different versions of the same 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. In the TT it puts out 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, rushing the TT Coupe from a standstill to 60 mph in only 5.3 seconds, with plenty in reserve. The Audi TTS uses a high-output version of that engine that puts out a whopping 292 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, enough to blast the TTS from 0-60 in just 4.6 seconds. Regardless of model, the TT and TTS come standard with quattro all-wheel drive, Audi drive select for different drive modes ranging from relaxed to sporty, and an excellent 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Fuel economy is also decent, with the TT getting an EPA-estimated 30 mpg.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (TT coupe &amp; roadster)<br>
220 horsepower @ 4,500 rpm<br>
258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600 rpm<br>

280 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/27 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just under $45,000 when you include the $975 destination charge, we're tempted to call the standard 2018 Audi TT coupe a bargain. Even the drop-top Roadster isn't bad, coming in at about the $48,500 mark. The high-performance TTS coupe starts at a little under $54,000, which is still a decent price for a high-performance luxury-sports coupe. With options a standard TT coupe will come in at about $50,000, give or take, easily undercutting the likes of the Porsche Cayman and Boxster, and the BMW Z4. Those prices are more in line with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rc/">Lexus RC</a> 350, Infiniti Q60, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a>, and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/slk/">Mercedes-Benz SLK</a> roadster.

[<p>When one of the world’s oldest and most renowned luxury-automobile manufacturers jumps into the SUV pool, you know there’s been a sea change in the way luxury buyers see their future transportation needs. So exists the case for the 2018 Bentley Bentayga luxury SUV, a vehicle that not only sets new standards for luxury off-roaders, but a new price point as well. To separate itself from other luxury SUVs, the Bentayga places an emphasis on outrageous power, over-the-top luxury and an array of interior and exterior colors not seen in a showroom since the 1970s. Although the Bentayga holds this space to itself for now, equally elegant competitors from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/maserati/">Maserati</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/aston%20martin/">Aston Martin</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/rolls-royce/">Rolls-Royce</a> are on their way.</p>, <p>When money is no object, the object of your automotive desire should be the 2018 Bentley Bentayga luxury-crossover SUV. Unlike some rivals, this SUV can actually tackle the toughest off-road obstacles and with a top-speed of nearly 190 mph, the Bentayga is also the world’s fastest production SUV.</p>, <p>Styling is subjective, but we think there are a number of more distinctive luxury SUVs offering the same or better off-road performance for a lot less money. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/land%20rover/">Land Rover</a> offers a number of options, as do <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bentley/bentayga/">Bentley Bentayga</a> luxury-crossover SUV gains a 7-seat option, new wheel and color choices and a new Breitling clock with a black or white Mother of Pearl face. A new Mulliner trim is added this year.</p>, <p>The 2018 Bentley Bentayga SUV blends “sport” and “utility” in a way that actually doesn’t make a liar of the famed British coachbuilder. The Bentayga mimics the power and handling of a larger sports car, then marries it with the roomy interior and off-road ability of a rugged off-roader. No small feat, to be sure. With a top speed of 187 mph and a zero-to-60-mph time around four seconds, Bentley’s 2018 Bentayga is the world’s fastest SUV. When it comes to practicality, the Bentayga offers up plenty of room for people and gear, admirable towing power and, courtesy of its adjustable air suspension, up to 9.2 inches of ground clearance. All this engineering and electronic goodness permits the 5,672-pound <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bentley/">Bentley</a> a surprising degree of nimbleness and neutral handling, while delivering the kind of smooth and stable ride one expects from a vehicle of this caliber.</p>, <p>FRONT-FACING PARKING CAMERA<br>
One way to avoid scuffing your new SUV is to have a spotter guide you through tough off-road situations. However, should you be solo, the Bentayga’s front-facing camera provides a bumper-level view complete with guidelines.<br>
<br>
MULLINER HAMPER<br>
Tailgating never had it so good. Then again, when you pay $32,000 for the 2018 Bentley Bentayga’s 3-box cargo-bay hamper, you should expect a little more. The slide-out system includes a small refrigerator, dry storage for nonperishables and a third drawer for silverware, fine crystal and china.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Close your eyes and let us help you slip inside the Bentley Bentayga. Now open them up. You’d never guess you were in an SUV. The British marque’s first SUV boasts a cabin easily as lavish as any of its more traditional sedans, coupes and convertibles. Outfitted as either a 4- , 5- or 7-seater, it envelops you in supple leather, available in 15 different hues, as well as four different veneer trims. The Bentayga gets Bentley’s newest infotainment system. Options include a rear fridge, a 3-compartment picnic basket in the rear and the $170,000 Breitling Tourbillon self-winding clock.</p>, <p>Bentley delivered something of a surprise when it pulled the wraps off its first-ever SUV, the 2018 Bentayga adopting a relatively conventional SUV design, rather than the more swoopy sheet metal many manufacturers are opting for. That approach has been called out by some critics, but to our eye it’s fitting for a vehicle that really can handle serious off-road driving. The upright grille, massive air intakes and broad shoulders underscore the power of the Bentayga’s 600-horsepower W-12 and the ute’s dramatic capabilities.</p>, <p>The Bentayga comes with a mix of features balancing its on- and off-road capabilities, including all-wheel drive, trailer-sway control, a 4-corner auto-leveling suspension and electronic brake controls that largely cover for its lack of locking differentials. The base infotainment system offers a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot and an impressive, 700-watt, 12-speaker package, though the 1,950-watt Naim system is a must option for audiophiles. There are 14 different leather options to envelop the 16-way-adjustable front bucket seats.</p>, <p>From a purist’s standpoint, there’s the 1,950-watt Naim audio package. For safety and long-distance cruising, the Touring Specification adds active cruise, night vision, lane-keeping assist and other technologies. And for bragging rights, go for the $170,000 self-winding Breitling Tourbillon clock.</p>, <p>When nearly three tons of SUV can go from a dead stop to 60 mph in four seconds, everybody notices and most people smile. The new Bentley Bentayga sprints that good, launched by its 600-horsepower twin-turbo W-12 engine matched to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy takes a hit, but you're certainly not paying six figures to scrimp on performance.<br>
<br>
 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged W-12<br>
 600 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 664 lb-ft of torque @1,350 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 12/19 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Bentley Bentayga W12 starts with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $231,825, with the better-equipped Bentayga W12 First Edition pushing to $300,125 -- both figures including $2,725 in delivery fees. The British maker allows for a wide range of customization, so add features like the $170,000 Breitling Tourbillon clock, the Mulliner Hamper and special paints and you’ll nudge $500,000. There’s really no direct competition yet. Luxury SUVs currently on the market -- like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayenne/">Porsche Cayenne</a>, the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/maserati/levante/">Maserati Levante</a> -- play in decidedly lower-priced niches. But look for more direct comparisons in the near future as we see ute offerings coming to market from top-line marques like Lamborghini, Aston Martin and even Rolls-Royce. Do check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what the Bentayga is going for in your area.</p>]

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/bmw/2%20series/2018/">2018 BMW 2 Series</a> hearkens back to a time when BMWs were small, sporty cars that didn’t cost an arm and a leg. Unlike those early cars, however, the 2 Series is a thoroughly modern design loaded with BMW’s best technology and performance features. In contrast to front-drive competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a3/">Audi A3</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/cla/">Mercedes-Benz CLA</a>, the 2 Series routes power to its rear wheels, although both the 230i and M240i do offer the option of all-wheel drive. Power for the 230i comes from a brilliant turbocharged 4-cylinder engine good for 248 horsepower; the M240i exceeds expectations with a 335-horsepower turbocharged inline-6. We only wish the slick 6-speed manual available on the rear-drive cars was also available on all-wheel-drive models.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for 4 Series performance without 4 Series monthly payments, the 2 Series deserves a good long look. Pocket the savings or put it toward some desirable options. If you’re looking for a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> in this segment, the 2 Series is the only game in town.</p>, <p>If you regularly carry rear-seat passengers, you’ll be better off with a 4-door like the Audi A3 or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a>. Those looking for a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> or diesel option will have to look elsewhere. A well-equipped <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/ilx/">Acura ILX</a> costs less than a base model 2 Series.</p>, <p>Changes to the 2018 BMW 2 Series are minimal this year. A new instrument panel, new color options and two new wheel designs mark the most notable changes, along with new LED headlights and taillights.</p>, <p>Tossable, light and nimble, the 2018 BMW 2 Series is a true enthusiast’s car, the modern-day equivalent of great BMWs like the 2002ti and 320i. Regardless of the numeral on the trunklid, the 2 Series is guaranteed to put a smile on the face of whoever gets behind the wheel. Both the 230i and M240i possess abundant power, exceptional suspension tuning and a manual gearbox that is sure to please anyone even remotely fond of rowing their own gears. Those with deep pockets can get even more thrills from the 365-horsepower M2. The 2 Series’ small dimensions make it easy to live with in crowded city confines, and despite its enthusiast nature, the littlest <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> returns surprisingly good fuel economy. The EPA rates the 230i with an automatic transmission at 35-mpg highway, but during our time with the car we managed to see nearly 38 mpg.</p>, <p>TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER<br>
 The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine in the 230i is one of the most powerful and refined engines of its kind on the planet. Generating 248 horsepower and a zero-to-60-mph run in under six seconds, this engine is perfectly suited to the needs of today’s driver, as is its 35-mpg highway fuel-economy rating.<br>
<br>
PARKING ASSISTANT<br>
 For city dwellers the thought of parallel parking can be stressful. Thankfully, the 2 Series can be ordered with BMW’s Parking Assistant that does all the hard work, leaving the driver to operate the gear selector, brake and gas.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 2 Series has seating for four, but its rear seats are best used for very small people or extra storage. Materials are high-quality, and the interior’s fit and finish are impressive. BMW interiors are never overly ornate, and the interior of the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/2%20series/">BMW 2 Series</a> is simple and elegant. Seat comfort is exceptional as is the driving position. The gauges are clear and concise. Above the center dash sits a high-res color screen that displays navigation, audio and other info. It’s controlled by BMW's now familiar iDrive rotary dial below the gearshift.</p>, <p>Although we wouldn’t call it the prettiest BMW, we like the muscular proportions of BMW’s 2018 2 Series. This is a very attractive little 2-door, with an aggressive stance, dramatically swept headlights, BMW’s now-signature L-shaped taillights, and a beautifully tapered roofline. Befitting the "M" designation, the M240i dials up the visual muscularity to back up its additional performance. It boasts a deeper front spoiler, larger air intakes, contoured rocker panels, and a unique rear lower valance. Like most drop-tops, the <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a> look better top-down. Both offer 13.8 cubic feet of trunk space, marginally better than the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/acura/">Acura</a> rivals.</p>, <p>The base-model 2018 BMW 230i coupe and convertible come standard with 8-way manually adjustable front seats, sport front seats, a 60/40-split rear seat, a 10-speaker audio system with a 6.5-inch display and HD Radio, keyless push-button start, a tilt/telescopic steering wheel, rain-sensing windshield wipers and 17-inch wheels with all-season tires. The standard powertrain is a spectacular 248-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder backed by an 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters, auto start/stop and rear-wheel drive. The 4-year/50,000-mile warranty is also standard, as is BMW Ultimate Care, which includes free scheduled maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available on all models, as well as a Track Handling Package. The Handling package lowers the car by 10 mm, includes Adaptive M suspension with Comfort and Sport settings, variable sport steering, larger M Sport brakes and high-performance tires. At $2,300 for the 230i coupe without the M Sport packages it's a very good deal. Other options include a highly recommended Driver Assistance package that bundles together a rearview camera with active guidelines and front and rear parking sensors, and a Cold Weather Package that includes heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 230i gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine putting out 248 horsepower, and routing it to the rear or all four wheels (RWD, AWD) through either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. The M240i uses a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6, boasting 335 horsepower and also available with the same drivetrain options. To help improve fuel economy in the city, all 230i models include an auto-stop/start function that shuts off the engine at complete stops. And its 248 horsepower gives it the title of the most powerful base model in its class. In fact, its excellent performance will make you question whether the 80 extra horsepower you get in the M240i is worth the money.<br>
<br>
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (230i)<br>
 248 horsepower @ 5,200 rpm<br>
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,450 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/35 mpg (automatic, RWD), 21/32 mpg (manual, RWD), 24/33 mpg (automatic, AWD), 24/34 mpg (convertible, RWD), 23/33 mpg (convertible, AWD)<br>
<br>
 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (M240i)<br>
 335 horsepower @ 5,800 rpm<br>
 369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,400 rpm<br>

The 2018 BMW M240i Coupe starts around $46,500. AWD on either model costs an extra $2,000. Order all the options, and you'll wind up with a 230i and M240i costing about $50,000 and $55,000, respectively. Convertible models add about $5,500 to the price of a 230i coupe, or about $4,600 to the price of an M240i. The Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA start a grand or two lower. The less refined Acura ILX starts even lower, around $29,000, but you lose performance and cachet in the bargain. Check out Kelley Blue Book’s Fair Purchase Price Tool before heading to the dealership. We expect the 2018 BMW 2 Series coupe to retain slightly above-average residual values, better than the Acura ILX, on par with the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA.</p>]

[<p>For over 40 years, the BMW 3 Series has been the car that best demonstrated BMW’s long-running slogan, “the Ultimate Driving Machine.” In the 2018 BMW 3 Series sedan, the legend continues unabated albeit in a larger, more luxurious and more powerful version. The current 3 Series lineup competes head-on with the Audi A4, Infiniti Q50 and Cadillac ATS. Yet, as good as the competition is, none has ever been able to capture that perfect balance of luxury, performance, power and styling in quite the same way the 3 Series does. One thing that has changed is the range of models. For 2018, the Series now includes a plug-in hybrid, sporty wagon, versatile hatchback, and the incomparable 2018 BMW M3 high-performance sedan (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/m3/2018/">reviewed separately</a>).</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a midsize-performance sedan with an unquestioned reputation for performance, quality, luxury and safety, the 2018 3 Series from BMW checks all the right boxes. The Gran Turismo hatchback and 3 Series Sport Wagon offer impressive versatility, while the plug-in hybrid and diesel models deliver superior fuel economy.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 3 Series comes at price, especially when adding optional equipment often found standard on its competitors. The Cadillac ATS is an impressive performer in its own right, as is the Infiniti Q50. Even the new Jaguar XE is distinct enough to lure away potential BMW buyers.</p>, <p>The BMW 3 Series for 2018 receives a new touch-screen display that works in conjunction with the iDrive controller. Also new is a standard rearview monitor and LED headlights. On 320i models, LED fog lights replace traditional fog lights.</p>, <p>Above every other aspect, the 2018 BMW 3 Series sedan, hatchback and wagon place an emphasis on driving pleasure. It’s been the brand’s calling card for nearly four decades and neither time nor technology has gotten in the way. Speed and agility are standard on every model, and even the base 320i with only 180 horsepower can hit 60 mph in 7.1 seconds. Similar performance can be found in the 328d diesel, which affords the added benefit of a 40-mpg highway rating. Moving to the 248-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine in the 330i brings what we think is the best combination of performance and price, while the 320-horsepower 340i delivers V8-like power and growl. For those seeking the elusive M3, it’s a track-ready terror whose dual-clutch automatic doesn’t quite live up to the car’s promise. Go with the manual.</p>, <p>WAGON, HATCH VARIANTS<br>
 While the most recognizable 2018 3 Series is the sedan, BMW also offers a versatile hatchback called the Gran Turismo and a sporty all-wheel-drive Sports Wagon. Both models offer a more versatile cargo area without compromising 3 Series ride and handling.<br>
<br>
 TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER<br>
 While there are many 2.0-liter turbocharged engines in the world, none is quite as smooth, refined or powerful as the engine found in BMW’s 2018 3 Series. The 248-horsepower engine is capable of propelling the 3 Series to 60 mph in under six seconds, yet achieves a respectable 34-mpg highway.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>BMW interiors are never overly ornate and the interior of the BMW 3 Series is simple, elegant and minimalistic in design. It’s also beautifully assembled with tight fits and upscale materials. Seat comfort is exceptional as is the driving position. The gauges are clear and concise. The center controls are angled toward the driver, putting them in easy reach. The sedans have acceptable legroom in the second row, and it's downright impressive in the larger 3 Series Gran Turismo. The Sports Wagon and Gran Turismo models offer sizable cargo-hauling advantages over sedan-only rivals like the Lexus IS and Mercedes C-Class.</p>, <p>This is simply one of the most attractive cars on the road. With short overhangs and a low, wide stance, BMW’s 3 Series for 2018 just looks athletic. It looks like it’s fun to drive. It’s a completely modern design, but there are enough links to previous generations, including the signature twin-kidney grille, that even casual observers know they're looking at a BMW. The more rotund Gran Turismo is an acquired taste, while the Sports Wagon is universally admired, and the bulging, scooped and flared skin of the macho M3 hints at the potency below its domed hood.</p>, <p>At its most basic, 320i models come with BMW's faux-leather upholstery (SensaTec), manually adjustable front seats, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, a 9-speaker audio system with a 6.5-inch LCD display, USB port, Bluetooth music streaming and HD Radio. Safety features standard on every 2018 BMW 3 Series include eight airbags, active head restraints to help reduce the severity of whiplash injuries, and impact sensors that unlock the doors, activate the hazard lights, and shut down electrical systems after a collision. New BMWs also include four years/50,000 miles of no-cost scheduled maintenance and four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance.</p>, <p>Options on the 2018 3 Series are extensive and pricey. However, many are worth the investment, including the Surround View camera, a hands-free power trunklid that opens by waving your foot under the bumper, navigation, a head-up display, and adaptive cruise control. The sport seats, aerodynamic enhancements, suspension tuning, and lightweight wheels of the M Sport Package (standard on the 340i) help bridge the performance gap between lesser models and the fire-breathing M3. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available on many models in lieu of rear-wheel drive (RWD), although not on the M3, and is standard on the Sports Wagon and Gran Turismo.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 3 Series lineup offers three 4-cylinder turbocharged engines: a 2.0-liter in the 320i, a more powerful version in the 330i, and a 2.0-liter turbodiesel. Then there’s the new turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 in 340i models, and the twin-turbo version in the M3, which makes 425 horsepower. Most models can be ordered with a 6-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed automatic. The M3 comes with the manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. New last year was the 330e plug-in hybrid, which pairs an electric motor and a turbocharged 4-cylinder for 25 miles on battery power alone or total range of 373 miles. Most 3 Series models come with a fuel-saving stop/start feature. Unfortunately it shudders when the engine restarts and thankfully can be deactivated.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (320i)<br/> 180 horsepower @ 5,000-6,250 rpm<br/> 200 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/35 mpg (RWD manual), 24/35 mpg (RWD automatic), 23/34 mpg (AWD)<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (330i)<br/> 248 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,800 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/32 mpg (RWD manual), 24/34 mpg (RWD automatic), 23/33 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel inline-4 (328d, 328d xDrive Sports Wagon)<br/> 180 horsepower @ 4,000 rpm<br/> 280 lb-ft of torque @ 1,750-2,750 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 31/43 mpg (RWD), 30/40 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (330i xDrive Gran Turismo, 330i xDrive Sports Wagon)<br/> 248 horsepower @ 5,000-6,000 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,800 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/33 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (340i xDrive Gran Turismo)<br/> 300 horsepower @ 5,800-6,000 rpm<br/> 300 lb-ft of torque @ 1,300-5,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/29 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (340i sedan)<br/> 320 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm<br/> 330 lb-ft of torque @ 1,300-5,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/29 mpg (RWD manual), 21/32 mpg (RWD automatic), 19/29 mpg (AWD manual), 21/31 mpg (AWD automatic)<br/> <br/> Turbocharged inline-4 + electric motor (330e plug-in hybrid)<br/> 248 horsepower (combined)<br/> 310 lb-ft of torque (combined)<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30 mpg (combined city/highway)<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-6 (M3)<br/> 425 horsepower @ 5,500-7,300 rpm<br/> 406 lb-ft of torque @ 1,850-5,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/26 mpg (RWD manual), 17/24 mpg (RWD automatic)</p>, <p>The least expensive 3 Series is the 320i sedan with a manual transmission, its Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $36,000, with 6-cylinder 340i variants beginning just under $50,000. The high-performance BMW M3 begins over $65,000. Wagon and Gran Turismo hatchbacks start in the mid-$40,000 range and the plug-in hybrid 330e starts around $46,500. All-wheel drive is available on most models and adds about $2,000. At these levels most 3 Series models are in line with small-luxury-sedan rivals like the Lexus IS, Audi A4, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Infiniti Q50 and Jaguar XE.

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/bmw/4%20series/2018/">2018 BMW 4 Series</a> is available in three forms: a coupe, a retractable-hardtop convertible, and a 4-door liftback called the Gran Coupe. The first two, with their 2-door/4-passenger configurations, prioritize sportiness, while the 5-passenger Gran Coupe adds a surprising dose of practicality thanks to its large rear cargo bay. All are offered with turbocharged 4- or 6-cylinder engines and rear- or all-wheel-drive (RWD, AWD). The high-performance M4 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/m4/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), meanwhile, comes in coupe or convertible form. In true <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> fashion, a manual transmission is still offered, which sets the 4 Series apart from rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> coupe, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q60/">Infiniti Q60</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rc/">Lexus RC</a> (a stick still exists in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a5/">Audi A5</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a> coupe). Minor updates keep the 4 Series fresh for 2018.</p>, <p>The 4 Series coupe and convertible are essentially 2-door versions of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a>. If you want the well-regarded driving dynamics of that <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> in a sleeker package or with a retractable-hardtop roof, the 4 Series is it. As for the 4-door Gran Coupe, it blends fine handling, sharp looks and strong practicality.</p>, <p>Impressive as the 4 Series lineup is, these luxury-performance <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a> aren't the only game in town. You may prefer the tech advances of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe and new Audi A5, or the fresh and fluid lines of the Lexus RC and Infiniti Q60.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a> receives new front and rear exterior tweaks, stiffer suspension and upgraded steering, new exterior colors and four new rim choices. Adaptive full LED headlights are now available, while interior mods include a new steering-wheel rim and freshened digital interface for models with navigation.</p>, <p>The 2018 4 Series takes the agility, acceleration and balance of the 3 Series and strengthens it with a wider stance and lower center of gravity. It makes the 2-door versions of the 4 Series the perfect partner for enthusiasts who still relish the act of driving, and who won't mind the trade-offs of increased road noise and a stiffer ride. The Gran Coupe, however, is aimed at the grand touring crowd, and it does a grand job. We love its blend of lively yet smooth road manners and appreciable space for cargo and passengers. Base 430i models use BMW's 248-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder. It's one of our favorite 4-cylinder engines and in truth will satisfy the majority of drivers. Those craving even more punch can opt for 440i models with the 320-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder. If you're really maniacal about power, there's the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/bmw/m4/2018/">2018 BMW M4</a>, a beast that gets its own review.</p>, <p>2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINE<br>
We said that the old base-level engine in the 4 Series was good enough that there was little reason to shell out for the 6-cylinder variant. That's truer still with this latest engine, which arrived last year. It's more powerful, and at up to 34 mpg, impressively efficient.<br>
<br>
FOLDING HARDTOP<br>
The BMW 4 Series convertible doesn't force you to choose between a classic coupe or open-top convertible, thanks to its power-operated retractable hardtop. Top up, it's a sharp coupe with the classic BMW "Hofmeister kink" at the rear window; top down you have open-air enjoyment for yourself and three passengers.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The BMW 4 Series coupe and convertible models have four seats, but only the front two are suitable for adults for longer durations. The rear seats are tight on leg- and headroom (convertible notwithstanding), and it's not particularly easy to get back there in hardtop models. The Gran Coupe's rear doors and elongated roof do improve access. In all models it's the one behind the steering wheel who's truly pampered, with a driver-focused cockpit, easy-to-reach controls and an improved iDrive infotainment system. Cargo space is fine in the coupes, but the Gran Coupe has more than 45 cubic feet with rear seats folded.</p>, <p>The BMW 4 Series has been updated for 2018, but the revisions are minor: a restyled nose, larger central air intake, and elongated design of the rear light clusters. Not surprisingly, the 4 Series coupe and convertible look the most alike. With its hardtop roof up, the convertible essentially is a 4 Series coupe. It's the 2018 4 Series Gran Coupe that stands out. Though the same length as its siblings, the Gran Coupe can appear longer with its four doors and elongated roof. Instead of a trunk, the Gran Coupe has a rear hatch for easy loading and unloading of gear.</p>, <p>Base 430i versions of the 2018 BMW 4 Series Coupe, Gran Coupe and Convertible may look different, but all have similar standard equipment. There are 10-way-power front seats, LED headlights, automatic climate control, and on the Coupe and Gran Coupe, a moonroof; the Gran Coupe also gets a power tailgate. Standard infotainment is a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio system with USB audio input, Bluetooth streaming and 6.5-inch display (unfortunately, a rearview camera still costs extra). The 440i offers the stronger 6-cylinder engine. New BMWs come with Ultimate Care, which includes three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance and four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance.</p>, <p>In true German luxury-car fashion, there's a plethora of ways to upgrade and personalize your 4 Series. You can upgrade to a 16-speaker/600-watt harman/kardon sound system, a hands-free trunk that opens when you wave your foot under the bumper, and leather upholstery to replace the synthetic SensaTec material. Most options are bundled into packages, like the Technology Package that includes navigation and dedicated apps. A Driver Assistance package adds the blind-spot monitoring and Active Driving Assistant with lane-departure warning, collision-mitigation automatic braking and pedestrian detection. Also available are wireless charging for compatible smartphones and a Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>, <p>Two engines are available in the 2018 BMW 4 Series. Base 430i models use a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder good for 248 horsepower, while the more powerful 440i models pack a 3.0-liter turbocharged 6-cylinder that makes 320 horsepower. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is the standard setup, and BMW's xDrive all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. Most models are mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission that is nearly flawless. For the "save-the-manuals" crowd, a stick shift is still available in the 430i coupe, 440i coupe and 440i xDrive coupe. Auto start/stop is standard on the 430i and 440i models; if you don't like the jarring restarts you can shut it off. Also note these premium engines require premium gasoline.<br>

A base coupe starts at $200 more than that, while the hardtop convertible is appreciably more with a starting price of $51,545. Opting for a 6-cylinder 440i model bumps those prices by around $6,000-$7,000, and packages can add several thousand more to the bottom line. At these prices, the BMW 4 Series is still in line with other <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> coupes and <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a> like the Audi A5, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Lexus RC, while the Infiniti Q60 and Cadillac ATS coupe begin a few thousand lower. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. We expect the 2018 4 Series' <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> to be about average, trailing that of the Lexus RC.</p>]

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a> midsize-luxury sedan entered its seventh generation just last year as an all-new model, boasting evolved driving manners, premium accouterments and the stately style that have made it the automotive prize of executives for decades. In addition to the sporty dynamics and sense of engagement that have long given the 5 Series a performance edge over rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>, the latest 5 Series is brimming with technology that can do everything from self-parking to collision avoidance. For 2018, the 5 Series' initial lineup of turbocharged 4- and 6-cylinder models is joined by the V8-powered M550i xDrive and 530e plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>, which encourage even more performance on one end and efficiency on the other.</p>, <p>If you want a midsize-luxury sedan with all the expected premium trappings, loads of technology and an edge for drivers who favor sporty driving dynamics, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/bmw/5%20series/2018/">2018 BMW 5 Series</a> remains the one to beat. Powertrains now range from fuel-miserly 4-cylinder models to a voracious V8 with all-wheel drive.<b></b></p>, <p>Subjectively, you might find the 5 Series' styling too conservative. If you eye a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a> or Lexus GS instead, you'll also benefit from a lower starting price and, with the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>, higher resale value. If you want a diesel <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> sedan, your choices have dwindled to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xf/">Jaguar XF</a>.</p>, <p>All-new last year when it arrived in 4- and 6-cylinder form, the 2018 BMW 5 Series lineup expands with the V8 M550i xDrive and 530e, a plug-in hybrid that pairs a 4-cylinder engine and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> powertrain. The 5 Series Gran Turismo hatch is no more. If you want to go all the way over the top, check out the high-performance M5 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/m5/2018/">reviewed separately</a>).</p>, <p>Four different powertrains equal four flavors of the 5 Series. Though small in size, the turbocharged 4-cylinder in 530i models does a commendable job propelling this substantial sedan, enabling 0-60-mph sprints in six seconds or less. Drivers will find more grunt in the 540i and its turbocharged 6-cylinder that cuts 0-60 to under five seconds. The most powerful 5 Series outside of an M5 is the new M550i xDrive, a turbocharged V8 5 Series that puts 456 horsepower to all four wheels. With a 0-60-mph time of 3.9 seconds, it's faster than the last M5. The 530e plug-in hybrid offers up to 29 mpg combined, but power delivery from the gasoline engine and electric motor isn't as linear as the other, gasoline-only models. This German luxury sedan is highly satisfying thanks to great steering feel, a quiet cabin, and the ability to strike a balance between agile handling and overall comfort.</p>, <p>REAR- OR ALL-WHEEL DRIVE (RWD, AWD)<br/> Every version of the 5 Series is available with traction-enhancing all-wheel drive, which <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> calls xDrive. This is true even in the 530e plug-in hybrid, and standard in the new M550i, where the AWD system helps put all its power to the ground.<br/> <br/> REMOTE CONTROL PARKING<br/> Wanna impress folks? Step outside your car and have it park itself. Once fantasy, it's now reality in 540i and M550i xDrive models. This feature -- commanded by you via the key fob -- is especially useful for fitting the car into tight spaces where it'd be difficult to open the door.<br/> </p>, <p>This 2018 BMW 5 Series' elegant dash is covered in SensaTec faux leather or the real thing, has a horizontal layout, and controls for climate and audio are sensibly laid out. A 10.25-inch screen relays navigation, audio, car data and more. The jet-fighter transmission lever looks cool but can be awkward initially. The 5 Series executive sedan uses BMW's latest iDrive 6.0 system, whose rotary control also has touch-based operation (and optional gesture control). The rear seat is roomy, and at 18.7 cubic feet, the trunk is huge.</p>, <p>This latest-generation, 2018 5 Series remains quite conservative, and we for one don't mind that. Mercifully, there's no gaping grille, just the latest treatment of BMW's signature twin-kidney design, flanked by headlight housings that now meet each grille's edge. Overall the 5 Series' message is one of maturity and strength. On 530e models, there's what appears to be a fuel-cap door just aft the driver-side wheel. Don't try to use it for gasoline. Rather, that's where you plug in an electric cord to charge the battery. The performance-oriented M550i xDrive model has unique, more aggressive-looking front and rear fascias.</p>, <p>Befitting a $50,000-plus luxury sedan, even a base 2018 BMW 530i is well-equipped. You'll get mighty fine 16-way-adjustable front seats, moonroof, navigation system with real-time traffic information, 18-inch wheels, universal garage opener, and LED headlights. Standard audio is a 205-watt/12-speaker system with AM/FM/Bluetooth, USB and something that's becoming harder to find on new cars -- a CD player. As is oft the case with German <a alt_o_t="Luxury Cars" href="/luxury-car/">luxury cars</a>, a rearview camera is extra, as is a genuine leather interior. In addition to its more powerful engine, the 540i does include leather upholstery and opens the door to more options.</p>, <p>Another BMW trait is a plethora of options, ranging from advanced safety systems to that diamond-infused Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio system. A variety of driver-assistance systems brings the 5 Series another step closer to semi-autonomous driving. In addition to active cruise control and blind-spot monitoring, the Side Collision Avoidance system can steer the car to evade a vehicle drifting into your lane. The Luxury Seating Package adds ventilation and massaging functionality to the front seats. If you routinely drive in snowy, slick conditions, consider the xDrive all-wheel-drive system. Apple CarPlay compatibility is available, but $300 extra.</p>, <p>Four turbocharged powertrains are available. The base 530i has a 248-horsepower 4-cylinder; the midtrim 540i an inline-6 good for 335 horsepower, and at the top is the M550i xDrive’s 456-horsepower V8. The new 550e plug-in hybrid marries a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with an electric-propulsion system, which can be charged in less than seven hours on a standard 120-volt outlet or less than three on a 240-volt system. The 530e can travel up to 16 miles on electricity alone. All 5 Series models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. Except for the M550i xDrive that is only available with AWD, all models can be had in standard RWD or AWD. The 5 Series uses an engine start/stop system to save fuel at idle, but it is defeatable.<br>

The 530e iPerformance plug-in hybrid starts at just $200 more. The 6-cylinder 540i sedan begins over $57,000. Adding the xDrive AWD system to any of those models is an extra $2,300. The powerful M550i xDrive is a sizable step up, with a starting price of over $73,000. An option-loaded M550i xDrive can pass the $80,000 mark. At these prices, the 5 Series sedan starts just shy of its Mercedes-Benz E-Class rival. Other competitors, from the Audi A6 and Lexus GS to the Jaguar XF and Volvo S90, all have a lower starting price.

As an all-new 6 Series is on deck for 2019, buyers can expect dealers may be anxious to move models off the lot.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a luxury-performance convertible or 4-door coupe with a proven track record, the 2018 BMW 6 Series cars deserve consideration. The 6 Series is more reasonably priced than some European competitors, yet despite its age, can still run circles around many of them.</p>, <p>BMW’s 2018 6 Series doesn’t offer anything you can’t find in newer, less expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a> convertible, Audi S5 or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rc/">Lexus RC</a> F Sport. Those needing a modicum of rear-seat room won’t find it in the 6 Series Convertible.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 6 Series Coupe is dropped, leaving the Convertible and Gran Coupe Sedan. The M Sport package gains the carbon-fiber trim from the M6, and 20-inch bi-color M wheels are now available.</p>, <p>Whether driving the open-air 6 Series Convertible or the thrilling M6 Gran Coupe (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/m6/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), the 2018 BMW 6 Series never disappoints. The 6 Series cars provide differing levels of power and suspension tuning, allowing for a completely unique driving experience. Powering the 640i is a smooth and responsive 6-cylinder engine that motivates the 6 Series to 60 mph in just about five seconds. The 650i ups both power and price, with a potent V8 engine outdone only by the high-performance V8 engine found in the M6 Gran Coupe. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> equips the 6 Series with its Driving Dynamic Control that allows for various settings from Comfort to Sport+, the latter permitting the driver to adjust transmission shift points and firm up the suspension when a more aggressive driving style is required. Despite its size, the Convertible’s passenger compartment remains rather snug.</p>, <p>ANY WAY YOU WANT IT<br/> In the 2018 BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, you get the look of the old M6 Coupe with the convenience of four doors and a usable rear seat. Want more power and better handling? Step up to the 650i xDrive.<br/> <br/> BANG &amp; OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM<br/> The 1,200-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system inside the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/6%20series/">BMW 6 Series</a> is nothing short of amazing. With sound flowing through 16 individually amplified speakers, you’ll hear every note with eardrum-piercing clarity.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 6 Series includes an attractive and functional steering wheel with numerous controls and a touch-sensitive iDrive controller that rounds out an already complete cockpit. With premium materials everywhere, exquisite fit and finish, wood or carbon-fiber accents, a high-end audio system and supremely comfortable driver's seat, BMW’s 2018 6 Series leaves a lasting impression. Not surprisingly, rear-seat room is tight in the convertible models, but acceptable on the Gran Coupe. Trunk space is largely unaffected when the convertible's top is folded.</p>, <p>The recently redesigned nose on the 2018 BMW 6 Series is subtly effective, with the number of vertical bars in each "kidney" now nine instead of 10. The rear end looks menacing when viewed head-on, which is just as it should be. But whether you choose the Gran Coupe or Convertible, a 6 Series boasts an athletic profile, defined by a long hood and a striking crease that's nearly the length of the body.</p>, <p>As one of BMW's higher-end models, the base 6-cylinder 2018 640i Convertible and Gran Coupe come very well-equipped with leather and wood inside, xenon headlights, a navigation system with 10.2-inch display and touch-sensitive iDrive controller, dynamic cruise control and rearview camera. A new 650i adds a V8 engine, along with even softer Nappa leather, 20-way-power front seats, 19-inch wheels and a 12-speaker/500-watt audio system. BMW 6 Series xDrive models offer all-wheel drive, and all BMWs offer four years or 50,000 miles of scheduled maintenance.</p>, <p>While there are stand-alone options like all-wheel drive available for BMW’s 6 Series for 2018, most of the desirable upgrades are divided into packages. An Executive Package adds ventilated front seats, soft-close doors and a futuristic head-up display that projects travel information onto the windshield so you can focus on the road. Definitely get the wonderful Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system, and performance-minded drivers should check out the active steering and Adaptive Drive. The Black Accent package adds high-gloss black trim on the grille and interior trim, black tailpipes, bi-color 20-inch alloy wheels, and black Nappa leather.</p>, <p>Two engine options tempt prospective BMW 6 Series buyers. The 640i gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 that makes a robust 315 horsepower, while the 650i gets a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine that puts out 445 horsepower. The 640i and 650i use an 8-speed automatic transmission, with either rear- or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). To save on its thirst for premium fuel, the 2018 BMW 6 Series uses auto start/stop to cut engine power at idle.<br>
<br>
3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (640i, 640i xDrive)<br>
 315 horsepower @ 5,800-6,000 rpm<br>
 330 lb-ft of torque @ 1,400-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/28 mpg (AWD convertible), 20/29 mpg (RWD Gran Coupe and convertible), 19/28 mpg (AWD Gran Coupe)<br>
<br>
 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (650i, 650i xDrive)<br>
 445 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm<br>
 480 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/25 mpg (RWD convertible, Gran Coupe), 16/25 mpg (AWD convertible, Gran Coupe)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the base 2018 BMW 640i Convertible undercuts some of its more lofty competition, but $86,095 -- including the $950 destination charge -- is still serious coin. If you want a V8 engine, you'll be looking at nearly $97,500. The 4-door Gran Coupe drops that price to $80,795 for the V6 and $92,195 for the V8. Want all-wheel drive? Add another $3,000. Options inflate the price quickly, and it's not hard to get to six figures. That said, the 2018 6 Series is competitive against cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> coupe, and it seriously undercuts cars like the Porsche Panamera and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/maserati/granturismo/">Maserati GranTurismo</a>. Before buying, be sure to check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the BMW 6 Series. Long-term resale value should be about the same as a Mercedes-Benz E-Class Cabriolet, but lower than an Audi S5.</p>]

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/bmw/7%20series/2018/">2018 BMW 7 Series</a> is the flagship sedan from the German <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> automaker, and a pinnacle among full-size, high-end executive haulers. Totally revamped for its sixth generation just two years ago, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>'s largest and most expensive sedan enters 2018 with a variety of engines choices and just about every creature comfort you can imagine -- and some you might not even have known existed. Powertrains range from an efficient plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> with a 4-cylinder engine to a monstrous, 600-plus-horsepower V12. The 7 Series maintains the performance bent that has long distinguished it from rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/s-class/">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/ls/">Lexus LS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a8/">Audi A8</a>, all while packing the commendable ride quality and superb craftsmanship expected in a sedan with a starting price around $85,000.</p>, <p>If you want a full-size executive sedan with a performance edge, the latest 7 Series brings it while also packing a wallop of technology and innovation. If you're more inclined to ride than drive, the 7 Series can be outfitted with a pair of reclining, massaging and climate-controlled rear seats.</p>, <p>The BMW's design is certainly handsome, but may be too conservative for some. If you're looking for a full-size luxury sedan at a lower cost, you can find it -- and higher predicted <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> -- in a Lexus LS.</p>, <p>After a busy year filling the lineup with the powerful V12 M760i and the Alpina B7 xDrive models, the 2018 7 Series lineup mostly sees tweaks to packages and options. The Parking Assistance Package is now available on 740i, 740e and 750i models, and standard on the Alpina B7.</p>, <p>At over 206 inches in length and tipping the scales at more than two tons, the 2018 BMW 7 Series certainly has the size and weight of a full-size luxury sedan, yet it's every bit as nimble and athletic as one would expect of a car wearing the blue-and-white propeller badge. The real attention-grabber is how BMW has enhanced this latest-generation 7 Series’ handling and steering response while simultaneously improving the car’s ride comfort. The air suspension includes an optional upgrade that can detect road conditions and adapt the suspension in real time. Three drive modes can also be adjusted on the fly, prioritizing comfort, sporty driving or efficiency. The 7 Series' suspension is so smart it can actually learn your driving style and modify the suspension to match inputs. Equally smart is the 8-speed automatic transmission that is tied into the navigation system to literally anticipate the road ahead.</p>, <p>M760i XDRIVE<br/> We can count on two fingers the current number of 12-cylinder mainstream luxury <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>. Between the BMW M760i and the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> S600, the Bimmer is notably quicker to 60 mph -- 3.6 seconds vs. 4.5 -- and around $14,000 less. This is the "go-big-or-go-home" BMW.<br/> <br/> DISPLAY KEY FOB<br/> The 2018 BMW 7 Series’ Display Key fob includes a small touch screen for remote control of the vehicle’s security systems, as well as monitoring maintenance schedules, fuel levels and range. Via the optional Remote Control Parking feature, you can even command the BMW to park itself from outside the car.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 7 Series sedan’s interior features elegant wood veneer, aluminum trim and chrome accents. On 740i and 740e models, you can choose from five colors of Dakota leather with Nappa leather as an option, while 750i and M760i models are all equipped with the latter. There’s plenty of room in the rear seat and all models are equipped with a panoramic moonroof. A Luxury Rear Seating package swaps the standard 3-person bench for a pair of first-class seatbacks that recline, massage and even have their own fold-out footrest. The large trunk can be accessed via a power-operated trunklid that opens with the motion of your foot.</p>, <p>The 6th-generation <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/7%20series/">BMW 7 Series</a> sedan can best be described as an evolution of the previous model despite its all-new sheet metal and extended overall length. The twin-kidney grille is more pronounced, and it incorporates an active-shutter system to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. The profile of the car features a striking chrome accent that drops down from the front fender vent and sweeps rearward. The side glass is framed by a chrome strip, and the famed Hofmeister kink at the C-pillar is incorporated into the rear door. There is an M aerodynamic package for the 2018 M760i xDrive.</p>, <p>It's no surprise that even a base 2018 BMW 740i sedan comes well-equipped. Highlights include 14-way-power front seats, leather interior, 16-speaker 600-watt harman/kardon sound system with AM/FM/CD/HD Radio and USB input, rearview camera, iDrive 5.0 with touch pad, 10.2-inch touch screen and eight programmable memory buttons, navigation, keyless entry and start, power trunklid, soft-close doors, panoramic moonroof, 4-zone climate control and park-distance control. Also standard are BMW’s gesture control, Qi wireless phone charging and a head-up display on 750i and M760i models. BMW’s Active Protection System pretensions the seatbelts, closes windows and moonroof and activates post-crash braking.</p>, <p>Several packages and stand-alone options are offered, including a full suite of driver assists such as night-vision aid, 3D surround-view cameras, rear-crossing traffic warnings, lane-departure warning and assist, frontal-collision and pedestrian warnings, blind-spot detection and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go function. This latest generation of parking assist can automatically park the car in both parallel and perpendicular spaces and has an autonomous braking feature. Audiophiles will appreciate the Bowers &amp; Wilkens Diamond surround-sound system that delivers 1,400 watts of sonic bliss. For a personalized experience, there's the BMW Individual Composition that enables you to pick your own exterior colors and upholstery.</p>, <p>Each 7 Series model has its own unique turbocharged powertrain. An inline-6 powers the 740i models, while a V8 is used on the 750i. The 740e plug-in hybrid pairs a 4-cylinder with a 111-horsepower <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor for a combined output of 322 horsepower. The car can run in several, modes including full electric. There is also the high-performance Alpina B7 model that tweaks the 750i’s V8 for an additional 155 horsepower. A V12 powers the mighty M760i xDrive. The 7 Series is rear-wheel drive (RWD), with the xDrive all-wheel-drive (AWD) system optional on 740i and 750i and standard in the 740e, Alpina B7 and M760i. With a 0-60-mph time of 3.6 seconds for the Alpina and M760i, these 7 Series offer fabulous performance.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4/AC Synchronous electric motor (740e xDrive)<br/> 322 horsepower (total)<br/> 369 lb-ft of torque (total)<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy, est.: 27 mpg/64 MPGe combined<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (740i, 740i xDrive)<br/> 320 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm<br/> 332 lb-ft of torque @ 1,380-5,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/29 mpg (RWD), 20/29 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 4.4-liter turbocharged V8 (750i, 750i xDrive)<br/> 445 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm<br/> 479 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/25 mpg (RWD), 16/25 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 4.4-liter turbocharged V8 (Alpina B7 xDrive)<br/> 600 horsepower @ 5,750-6,250 rpm<br/> 590 lb-ft of torque @ 3,000-5,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/25 mpg<br/> <br/> 6.6-liter turbocharged V12 (M760i xDrive)<br/> 601 horsepower @ 5,500-6,500 rpm<br/> 590 lb-ft of torque @ 1,550-5,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/20 mpg</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW 7 Series has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $84,000 for a base 740i model. A RWD, V8-powered 750i begins over $97,000, and adding AWD to either is another $3,000. The 740e xDrive plug-in hybrid starts over $91,000. The blistering Alpina B7 begins just shy of $140,000; the V12-powered M760i xDrive over $157,000, including the gas-guzzler tax. The 7 Series' starting price is near that of the Audi A8, below the Mercedes-Benz S-Class's nearly $100,000 and above the Lexus LS and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xj/">Jaguar XJ</a>, which both start around $70,000. If you're looking for a large, premium sedan for significantly less, there's the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a> (under $50,000) and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rlx/">Acura RLX</a>, (mid-$50,000 range). Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The 7 Series' resale value is expected to be about average, trailing that of the Lexus LS.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/bmw/i3/2018
[<p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> offers both the 2018 BMW i3 and the new more powerful i3s as pure electrics or as plug-in <a alt_o_t="Hybrids" href="/hybrid/">hybrids</a> with extended range. Both are sporty, quick and quirky with unconventional styling and advanced technology like lightweight carbon-fiber construction. The i3’s open-space interior concept also separates it from the pack, as does its nearly $45,500 entry-level price tag, which gets you a pure <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> vehicle with a range of about 114 miles on a full charge. Add the range extender, which is a small 2-cylinder gas engine with a 2.4-gallon fuel tank, and the price goes up to over $49,000. This setup is good for a total range of 180 miles, which is more than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500e/">Fiat 500e</a>, VW eGolf and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/leaf/">Nissan Leaf</a>, but shy of the range offered by the less expensive Chevy Volt and Bolt or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius/">Toyota Prius</a> Plug-in.</p>, <p>As a city runabout and daily commuter it’s hard to beat the 2018 BMW i3. If you’re looking for a comfortable, spacious, and fun-to-drive eco-friendly ride with a beautifully finished interior and funky styling, you’ll like the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/i3/">BMW i3</a> or the new i3s that offers more power, even quicker acceleration and improved handling.</p>, <p>Yes, the 2018 BMW i3 is a 4-door, but its rear doors open front to back, like the rear doors on small <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/pickup/">pickup</a> <a alt_o_t="Trucks" href="/pickup-truck/">trucks</a>. They can be a pain in tight parking spaces and they do not open unless the front door is opened first, so rear-seat passengers can feel trapped. Also, the new BMW i3 costs more than its competition, and the Chevy Volt and the Chevy Bolt EV offer far greater range.</p>, <p>For 2018, BMW has created the new i3s, which is a more powerful and better-handling version of the i3. Like the i3, it’s available as a pure electric or as a plug-in hybrid. The i3s packs 184 horsepower, which is 14 more than the standard model, and gets wider tracks, larger wheels and tires and a sport-tuned suspension. Prices start around $48,650.</p>, <p>With a 0-60-mph time of just 7.2 seconds, the standard 2018 BMW i3 is plenty quick. Quick enough to leave most <a alt_o_t="Compact Cars" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small cars</a> in its emissions-free wake of self-righteousness. And the new sportier i3s model is even quicker, running from 0-60 mph in just 6.8 seconds. That’s quicker than BMW’s 320i sedan. An electric motor delivers its torque all at once, so the acceleration is instantaneous, and continuous. With no mechanical transmission, the momentum is uninterrupted by gear changes, giving the i3 an almost slingshot-like effect. Power is routed to the rear wheels, which gives the i3 better handling than most of its front-drive rivals, although it surrenders that advantage in snow or on slick roads. Its steering is quick and the i3’s wide stance and short wheelbase give it go-kart-like agility. This is a fun car to drive once you get used to its unique power delivery and the funky feel of its regenerative braking system, which recharges the batteries with the energy captured from the brakes.</p>, <p>ACC STOP &amp; GO + ACTIVE DRIVING ASSISTANT<br>
 This advanced safety system is part of the $2,500 Technology and Driving Assistant Package. The autonomous technology maintains the desired distance from the car ahead at speeds above 19 mph. In more congested conditions, it creeps, accelerates and stops the car for you as bumper-to-bumper traffic inches along.<br>
<br>
 PARKING ASSISTANT<br>
 When a proper parking space has been found, the driver activates this autonomous system with the press of a button, and it essentially parallel parks the BMW i3 for you. Parking Assistant takes control of the BMW i3’s steering, braking and acceleration. It even controls the gear selection. This system is optional on the i3 but it is unavailable on the i3s.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Much like the exterior of the 2018 BMW i3, its interior is a design exercise that isn’t for everyone. It’s minimalistic, futuristic and environmentally friendly, and it either touches your soul or your gag reflex. The build quality is exceptional, and some of the materials have the look and feel of fine custom furniture. The responsibly forested eucalyptus dash and wide-screen displays reward the senses. Unfortunately, some of the other earth-friendly dash materials resemble attic insulation. Seat comfort is also high, and the two rear seats are roomier than you may expect, though beware of the i3's high step-in. To accommodate extra cargo, the rear seats split and fold.</p>, <p>This is BMW’s smallest car. It’s about 20-inches shorter than a BMW 230i and at just 157.4 inches long, the 2018 i3 is shorter than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a>. With its snub nose, short overhangs and black pillars, which make the roof look like it’s floating, the new i3 is futuristic and maybe a bit over the top. Its carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic body helps shed weight and its large-diameter yet skinny wheels and tires minimize wind and rolling resistance. Even the doors of the 2018 BMW i3 are strange yet functional. The rear set opens outward, which makes entering and exiting easier for rear passengers, but they can be cumbersome in tight parking spaces.</p>, <p>The new 2018 BMW i3 is available in three trims, or as BMW calls them, “worlds”: Mega, Giga and Tera. The base Mega comes well-equipped with a navigation system, LED headlights, 19-inch wheels, Comfort Access, DC fast-charging port (allows you to charge the battery up to 80 percent in 20 minutes), heated seats, SensaTec leather-like upholstery, and BMW's ConnectedDrive that syncs to your smartphone to enable the use of apps. The Giga model has a leather-and-wool interior. Top-line Tera models feature full leather upholstery, 19-inch forged alloy wheels and leather-covered dash with Dark Oak or Light Eucalyptus wood trim.</p>, <p>In addition to the range-extending gasoline engine, the 2018 BMW i3 <a alt_o_t="Electric Car" href="/electric-car/">electric car</a> offers other hardware and software to make your commute safer and more comfortable. Among the offerings are a 12-speaker/360-watt harman/kardon audio system and the Navigation Professional System with range assistant, real-time traffic info and Traffic Jam Assist. Other options include a power moonroof, forward-collision warning and pedestrian detection, automatic parking system, and a collision-mitigation feature that can automatically apply the brakes in emergency situations.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW i3 electric vehicle uses an electric motor powered by a lithium-ion battery back. Range-extended models have a supplemental 650-cc gasoline engine that acts solely as a generator and has a fuel capacity of 2.4 gallons. The BMW i3's electric-only range is estimated at 114 miles (94 Ah). Extended-range models are said to add another 66 miles to the battery range. Hyper-milers can eke more distance by switching to the ECO PRO mode, meant to increase distance by 12 percent, or ECO PRO+, which adds another 12 percent. The i3 electric vehicle uses a single-speed transmission and is rear-wheel drive. Recharging takes three hours on 220 volts or 20-plus hours on a standard 110-volt outlet.<br>

Those prices include a $995 fee for destination and shipping. The BMW i3 is eligible for incentives and federal tax credits. At these prices, the i3 resides in a middle ground among electric vehicles. It is over $12,000 more than a Nissan Leaf, but nearly $30,000 less than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/tesla/model%20s/">Tesla Model S</a>. Also in this range are the VW e-Golf, Fiat 500e, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/bolt%20ev/">Chevrolet Bolt EV</a>, Chevy Volt, Toyota Prius Plug-in and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a> electric. Check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for an i3. The i3 holds average resale values, better than the Fiat 500e, Ford Focus Electric and Nissan Leaf and on par with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/e-golf/">Volkswagen e-Golf</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> Sportback e-Tron hybrid.

---------http://www.kbb.com/bmw/m2/2018
[<p>The 2018 BMW M2 is the muscular, track-ready alter-ego of the standard 2 Series. Whereas the regular 2 Series is offered as a coupe or convertible, the M2 is a coupe only. At just over $55,000, it carries a significant premium over a base 2 Series, but on the flip side is the least expensive new BMW M model. And this is a real-deal M. Thanks to its tidy portions, 365-horsepower turbo 6-cylinder engine, rear-wheel drive and master-class handling, it might just remind you of a modern-day E36 M3 from the 1990s. The more powerful Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 and Audi RS 3 are similar in size, but have four doors and all-wheel drive. They lack another motivating factor that attracts enthusiasts to the M2 -- a manual transmission.</p>, <p>If you yearn for a car from BMW’s high-performance M division, the M2 is an amazing and authentic entry point. Starting in the mid-$50,000 range, it is a little powerhouse that’s dynamite on a track.</p>, <p>If you want a convertible, stick to the standard 2 Series or step up to an M4. If you live in a place where real-wheel drive and slippery roads make a bad combination, we’d suggest sacrificing a little power for traction with the BMW M240i xDrive or checking out another small German rocket: the new, all-wheel-drive Audi RS 3.</p>, <p>Changes are minimal for the 2018 M2. Updates include LED headlights swapped for the previous xenon units, and a standard rearview camera. BMW has already announced that the forthcoming 2019 M2 will have a more powerful, 405-horsepower engine and other performance improvements.</p>, <p>In a word, BMW’s M2 high-performance coupe is a blast. Off the track, where most of its life will be spent, BMW's little beast is a pleasant companion. The cabin is impressively quiet when not at full throttle, and the driver's seat adeptly hugs your body. Also notable is how civilized the M2 is on the highway given its immense capabilities on the track. The BMW M2 is one of the great high-performance coupes of our time. This is truly a sports car with a dual nature, and it's easy to love both personalities. Around town its turbocharged powerband is broad and wide, with a reservoir of grunt, and the standard 6-speed manual transmission remains stellar and is the one we recommend. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is available, but as with the M3 and M4, it's not as refined as the automatics offered by Audi or even Cadillac's V-Series performance cars. On the track, however, the 7-speed shines.</p>, <p>M DRIVER’S PACKAGE<br>
 This package includes an experience you won’t forget: a day of high-performance driving instruction at one of BMW’s tracks in California or South Carolina. In addition, it also raises the M2’s electronically limited top speed from 156 mph to 168 mph.<br>
<br>
 M LAPTIMER APP<br>
This app developed by BMW records the M2’s speed, longitudinal and lateral acceleration, rpm, gear, steering angle, accelerator position and fuel consumption. Drivers can analyze their inputs corner by corner, as well as compare their laps with other drivers. They can also easily share the data by e-mail or Facebook.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Like a standard 2 Series coupe, BMW’s M2 has 4-passenger seating, with the rear seats best thought of as extra storage space or for use in quick trips with small and nimble passengers. The bucket seats up front are highly supportive and up to the task of keeping you in place during spirited driving. Materials like carbon-fiber trim announce quality, and the interior’s overall fit-and-finish is impressive. Above the center dash sits a high-res color screen that displays navigation, audio and other info. BMW's familiar iDrive rotary dial below the gearshift controls the on-screen action, and now features integration with a GoPro app for recording your drives. The gear selector for automatic-transmission models can be confusing to use at first -- just another reason to do it right and go with a manual.</p>, <p>Whereas a standard 2 Series is handsome, the M2 is tough. It’s like a 2 Series that put in quality gym time. Although the two models share the same wheelbase, the M2 is wider, slightly longer and it is meaner-looking with unique front and rear fascias that express this coupe's extra muscle. From behind, an M2 can be positively identified by its wider hips and its quad tailpipes. It's a beautiful little monster, and better proportioned than the M version of the old 1 Series. Standard-issue wheels are 19 inches, wrapped in performance tires. Power-folding mirrors are also a nice touch.</p>, <p>The BMW M2 comes out the gate with a slew of racing-focused hardware and high-performance bits like an Active M rear differential, track-ready cooling system and upgraded brakes. But even if you never track it -- and let’s be honest, will you? -- the M2 is still a German luxury car. In that respect it arrives with amenities like black Dakota leather upholstery, 14-way-power front seats, dual-zone climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 3-stage heated front seats and universal garage remote. The BMW’s infotainment system consists of an 8.8-inch center screen, navigation with real-time traffic, and a 12-speaker harman/kardon premium audio system with AM/FM/USB/HD Radio/CD player and Bluetooth connectivity. Also included is BMW’s Ultimate Service, which includes three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.</p>, <p>Aside from an automatic transmission, most options for the 2018 BMW M2 are bundled into the sole, $1,550 Executive Package. It includes adaptive headlights that swivel as you turn, heated steering wheel, wireless charging cradle and in-car Wi-Fi, and rear parking sensors. It also includes the Active Driving Assistant, a recommendable safety and driver-assist system that bundles lane-departure warning, frontal-collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Apple CarPlay is available for an extra $300, and a moonroof is offered at around $1,000. The M Driver’s Package (see Favorite Features) is $2,500.</p>, <p>The heart of the 2018 BMW M2 is an all-aluminum turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 that has direct injection and variable camshaft timing and variable-valve lift control to make a robust 365 horsepower. Torque output is rich at 343 lb-ft, and an overboost function allows it to briefly increase that twist to 369 lb-ft. These figures allow the M2 to hit the 0-60-mph benchmark in as little at 4.1 seconds. All M2s are rear-wheel drive. A 6-speed manual is the standard transmission (and our recommendation), and a 7-speed twin-clutch automatic is optional. An automatic engine start/stop system cuts power at stoplights to save fuel, but can be defeated if you find the start-ups too abrupt. As we already noted, the 2019 M2 has already been previewed, and it will pack a new engine that makes 405 horsepower and enables the new M2 to hit 60 mph in four seconds flat.<br>

[<p>“M3” could be among the two most important characters in the automotive kingdom. For decades, enthusiasts have dreamed about and salivated over them, knowing they equate to the top-dog, track-ready version of the BMW 3 Series (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/3-series/2018/">reviewed separately</a>). At roughly $70,000, the 2018 BMW M3 continues to bolster the German automaker’s bottom line while fulfilling the aspirations of serious drivers and the merely badge conscious. It’s the rare high-powered luxury sedan that can pound a track, incite envy from friends and strangers, and still needs no introduction. Once the unquestioned benchmark, BMW’s little rocket now faces more powerful and fresher rivals like the Mercedes-AMG C 63, Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio, Audi RS 5 and Cadillac ATS-V. Still, on a track the M3 holds its own.</p>, <p>Whether you’re a longtime enthusiast seeking the highest-powered BMW 3 Series sedan or simply want immediate access to an automotive icon, the M3 will grant your wish. Rolling up in an M3 shows you have taste, passion and a love of performance.<b></b></p>, <p>The BMW M3 is hardly the only game in town. The Mercedes-AMG C 63, Cadillac ATS-V and Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio are all more powerful and have smoother automatic transmissions should you forgo the manual. The forthcoming Audi RS 5 has its own twist with standard all-wheel drive and a sleek yet practical sportback design.</p>, <p>The BMW M3 performance sedan carries over mostly unchanged for 2018. Minor changes include an updated iDrive 6.0 infotainment system with touch-screen display as standard, LED headlights replacing the former xenon units, and high-gloss black M3 badging on the seats. A special edition, the 2018 BMW M3 CS, boasts higher power, lighter weight and a global production of just 1,200 units.</p>, <p>Driving -- more specifically, the ability to drive hard -- is the <i>raison d’être</i> for the M3. For the most part, it won’t disappoint. With 425 horses funneled to the rear wheels, BMW’s high-performance compact sedan can do 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds. That benchmark number matches that of the more powerful Mercedes-AMG C 63 S and is only a tick behind the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio with its Ferrari-derived engine. But the M3 is so much more than a straight-line missile. For real fun, seek out a mountain road or, if you’re truly serious, a track. It’s in these environs where the M3’s overall balance and weightier steering effort reward with point-and-shoot precision. If we have one issue with the M3, it’s the optional 7-speed double-clutch automatic transmission. It just isn’t as smooth or refined as those of its rivals. Know how to get around that? Drive it as designed and go with the standard, 6-speed manual transmission. You’ll get the full experience and save $2,900 in the process.</p>, <p>COMPETITION PACKAGE<br>
 Checking this option box unlocks more power from the 2018 BMW M3 -- increasing its horsepower count to 444 and shaving its 0-60-mph time to 3.8 seconds. The package also grants a more direct steering ratio, tweaked Adaptive M Suspension, and 20-inch forged, light-alloy wheels.<br>
<br>
 EXECUTIVE PACKAGE<br>
 This package bundles additional creature comforts and driving aids into the new M3, helping strengthen its proposition as luxury car. Included are a heated steering wheel, bird’s-eye camera system, head-up display, automatic high beams and parking sensors.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Compared to its competitors, the BMW M3’s 5-passenger cabin is more stern and serious. Where the Mercedes easily coddles and the Audi wows with its tech-centric touches, the BMW M3 can look all business. That business is driving, and if that’s your intent it’s a good one to be in. This isn’t to say it’s uncomfortable, however. The leather-covered seats are supportive and well-bolstered, and craftsmanship is top-notch. The iDrive infotainment system now uses a touch screen on the display above the dash in addition to inputs from the rotary control below the gear shift. Speaking of, yet another reason to choose the manual transmission over the automatic is that the latter is a non-gated stub of a shift gear that can be awkward to use at first.</p>, <p>The M3 easily looks the part of the best-performing 3 Series. Telltale signs that this is the big dog are the “power-dome” hood bulge up front and quad tailpipe outlets in back. Compared to its lesser siblings, the new M3 has a slightly wider and longer stance, and sits lower. As part of its weight-saving plan, the M3 uses an aluminum hood and, even more impressively, a carbon-fiber roof. A darkened version of BMW’s kidney grille is available, while the Competition Package adds other high-gloss black elements to the side gills and tailpipes. The rare BMW M3 CS ups the ante and lightens its load further with carbon-fiber front and rear splitters and optional carbon-ceramic brakes.</p>, <p>In addition to its powerful engine and track-ready hardware, the BMW M3 comes with 14-way-power-adjustable front seats with 3-stage heating, leather and cloth interior, universal garage-door opener, dual-zone automatic climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and auto-dimming rearview mirror. The M3’s infotainment system bundles navigation and a 600-watt, 16-speaker harman/kardon audio system with AM/FM/CD/HD Radio and 20 gigs of hard-drive storage for audio files.</p>, <p>Optional on the M3 is the 7-speed automatic transmission, the Competition and Executive packages (see Favorite Features), and the Driving Assistance Plus package that bundles lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning, and automatic emergency braking. A la carte options include a moonroof, power rear sunshade, active blind-spot detection, and a more comfort-oriented standard suspension. The BMW is CarPlay compatible, but is $300 extra. At this time, it doesn’t feature Android Auto. A wireless phone charger and in-car Wi-Fi are also available. One intriguing option is an experience. The M Driver’s Package ($2,500) gets you a day of high-performance driver training at one of BMW’s track facilities in California or South Carolina.</p>, <p>The M3 has a gift under the hood in the form of a twin-turbo, 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine. Standard output is 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque that enable a 0-60-mph blast of 3.9 seconds and governed top speed of 155 mph. With the Competition power, horsepower is increased to 444. If you’re lucky enough to score a <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2018-bmw-m3-cs-no-coupe-for-you/2100004825/">2018 BMW M3 CS</a>, you’ll get 453 horsepower, a 3.7-second 0-60-mph time, and a top speed that rises to 174 mph. The M3 is rear-wheel drive and features the Active M Differential that automatically distributes power to each wheel for the best performance. The M3 comes standard with a 6-speed manual transmission. Less recommendable but likely more popular is the 7-speed twin-clutch automatic.<br>

[<p>The 2018 BMW M4 is the alter ego of the standard 4 Series (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/4-series/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), a high-performance version of the German <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand's coupe and hardtop <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/convertible/">convertible</a>. As with the 4 Series, the M4 boasts plenty of premium amenities and handsome design inside and out. But the M4's biggest appeal is its startling performance. With a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine that sends 425 horsepower to the rear wheels and a chassis that's been aggressively massaged by <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>'s M division, the M4 coupe and convertible boast performance and driving manners that remain benchmarks for rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> C63, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats-v/">Cadillac ATS-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rc/">Lexus RC</a> F and the upcoming <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> RS5. Starting around $67,000, the M4 also packs a significantly higher price than the standard 4 Series.</p>, <p>Formerly known as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m3/">BMW M3</a> coupe and convertible before getting its own nomenclature as the M4, this 2-door BMW performance car has a proud history. Even as new rivals emerge, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m4/">BMW M4</a> is as proven as its power, and grants immediate access to a tribe of driving enthusiasts.</p>, <p>If you opt for an automatic transmission in your high-performance coupe or convertible, know that the BMW's 7-speed dual-clutch isn't as refined as those in its competitors. If you crave the enhanced traction of all-wheel drive, Audi's forthcoming RS5 looks to be the one to beat.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW M4 carries over with only minor changes. The biggest news is the new M4 CS edition coupe, which packs even more bite with 454 horsepower and slots in the lineup above the M4 with the competition package.</p>, <p>The M4 is a ferocious counterpart to the standard 4 Series coupe and convertible. With 425 horsepower standard, the 2018 M4 coupe can hit 60 mph in under four seconds, while the M4 hardtop convertible does it in 4.2 seconds. Precise handling and excellent road feel have long been hallmarks of M cars, and that remains true. On a track it's a blast but in stop-and-go city driving it can be a bit much, especially with the idle start/stop fuel-saving function. The M4 still offers a manual transmission, and it even features a rev-matching system for more fluid shifts. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is available, too, but in our testing we found it rougher than the automatics used in rivals like the Lexus RC F and Cadillac ATS-V. The good news with the auto is BMW touts the "Smokey Burnout" function, which does exactly what you think.</p>, <p>HARDTOP CONVERTIBLE<br>
We like the M4 convertible for the same reason as the 4 Series convertible: It's essentially two cars in one. Top down, it is a 4-passenger open-air chariot built for speed. With hardtop in place, it's essentially an M4 coupe.<br>
<br>
COMPETITION PACKAGE<br>
For M4 buyers with a "go big or go home" attitude, this package increases horsepower to 444, tweaks the steering ratio and adaptive suspension, and includes 20-inch forged light alloy wheels, among other distinguishing factors.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Both the 2018 M4 coupe and convertible have seating for four, and like their more mainstream 4 Series siblings, space is tight in the rear. That likely won't matter much to buyers of the M4, as their primary concern will be behind the wheel. Here the business of serious driving is emphasized, thanks to deeply sculpted, 10-way power-adjustable seats with 4-way lumbar support. The steering wheel is well-padded, and most of the controls are intuitive. The non-gated lever for the automatic transmission can take some getting used to -- or it's just another reason to get a stick.</p>, <p>The M4 coupe and convertible look similar to those of the 4 Series, but their unique traits are easy to see if you know where to look. The hood features a power dome that you can think of as a bicep signaling this performance car's extra muscle. Around back are quad exhaust outlets. While the M4's wheelbase is nearly identical to the standard 4 Series, this beefed-up model has a wider track and overall stance. The M4 convertible has a metal roof that retracts, while the M4 coupe's fixed roof is carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, part of a weight-saving effort.</p>, <p>The rationale for buying an M4 over a 4 Series is for its track-ready performance, and to that end every M4 coupe and convertible comes with a 425-horsepower 6-cylinder turbo engine and a bevy of performance hardware. Aside from the go-fast upgrades, other notable ingredients include leather interior with carbon-fiber and black-chrome trim, 16-speaker harman/kardon AM/FM/CD/HD Radio audio system with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, navigation system, rearview camera and auto-dimming rearview mirror. Helpful features include a hands-free trunk opening and universal garage-door opener. Also included is BMW Ultimate Care -- three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.</p>, <p>In addition to the Competition Package is the Executive Package, which bundles features like side- and top-view camera, parking sensors, adaptive full LED headlights and head-up display. Individual options include Apple CarPlay compatibility, heated steering wheel, wireless phone charging and Wi-Fi hotspot, and power rear sunshade. Among the performance upgrades are carbon-ceramic brakes, while a standard suspension is available for enhanced comfort. Safety aids include blind-spot monitoring and active driving assistant, which has lane-keeping assist and frontal-collision and pedestrian warnings. Various shades of leather are available inside, and if you want any exterior color other than basic white, that will cost extra.</p>, <p>Heart of the 2018 M4 is a turbocharged 3.0-liter 6-cylinder engine that makes a stout 425 horsepower. Opt for the Competition Package, and that output rises to 444 horsepower, while the 2018 BMW M4 CS ups the pony count to 454. A 6-speed transmission is standard and the recommended choice for the M4, while a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional. The M4 remains rear-wheel drive.<br>

Loaded, an M4 can reach beyond $90,000. At these considerable prices, the M4 is still in line with the Mercedes-Benz C63. This high-performance German luxury coupe and convertible remain above the starting prices of the Lexus RC F and Cadillac ATS-V <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a>. Another less expensive alternative is the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q60/">Infiniti Q60</a> Red Sport coupe.

[<p>After taking a year off so the all-new 5 Series could establish itself, the 2018 BMW M5 crowns the lineup and proves there’s still life for high-performance sedans. Now in its sixth generation, the 2018 M5 is all-new, and it comes packing the most power and features to date. Its revamped V8 makes 600 horsepower, but even more interesting is how that power is laid down. In a first for an M5, BMW’s pinnacle performance sedan is all-wheel drive, which enables blistering 0-60-mph blasts of 3.2 seconds and grip that keeps this midsize missile glued to the ground. For experienced drivers seeking serious thrills, the M5 can be switched into a rear-drive-only mode so drifts and burnouts can ensue. Throw in luxury amenities galore, and the new M5 puts the Mercedes-AMG 63 S on notice.</p>, <p>Whether you’re a longtime BMW M performance aficionado or simply want the most powerful model in the 5 Series lineup, the new M5 answers the call. It's certainly no surprise that this super sedan captured honors as the World Performance Car at the 2018 World Car Awards in New York. While its track skills are impressive, so are its everyday manners. This is a performance sedan that doesn’t forget its luxury credentials.</p>, <p>Brand loyalties aside, the new M5 is a pricey proposition at over $104,000. For about $30,000 less, you can get an M550i (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/5-series/2018/">reviewed separately</a>). It's the top model in the standard BMW 5 Series lineup that also packs a V8 and brings prodigious performance and features.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW M5 sedan is all-new. Now in its sixth generation, it is BMW’s fastest M performance car to date. In addition to boasting 600 horsepower, it debuts the German automaker’s M xDrive system, which can be switched from all-wheel drive to rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>In a word, the new M5 is ferocious. We had the chance to test its mettle on Portugal’s famed Estoril racetrack, a high-speed course that formerly hosted F1 races. Here we felt firsthand the benefits of the new M-finessed all-wheel-drive system. Directing the V8’s 600 horsepower to all four wheels has a couple of benefits. First is acceleration. This new BMW M sedan can rip from 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds because all four wheels are clawing at the tarmac. That same grip enables the new M5 to hang on in corners better than a 2-ton midsize sedan rightfully should. It just sticks. This is mostly the case in standard “4WD” mode. Switch to “4WD Sport,” and the system allows the car to slide around more by decreasing its traction thresholds. Finally, there’s the “2WD” mode, which sends all power to the rear wheels, like every past M5. It also disables traction controls, so you should know what you’re doing. This allows expert drivers to drift the M5 like a gymkhana superstar. When not at the track this top-line 5 Series drives like, well, a top-line 5 Series. Whereas the past M5 felt rather beastly in the city and suburbs, this one is plush and serene when its driver-adjustable settings are tailored for comfort. High marks also go to the new 8-speed automatic transmission, which is more refined than the past 7-speed twin-clutch automatic. If the new M5 is missing anything over past models, it’s a manual transmission. BMW says just not enough buyers were choosing it.</p>, <p>BOWERS &amp; WILKINS AUDIO SYSTEM<br>
 This optional audio system -- all 16 speakers and 1,400 watts of it -- is among the finest we’ve heard in a car. In fact, we wrote an entire <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/audio-road-test-bowers-and-wilkins-in-2018-bmw-5-series/2100004788/">Audio Road Test</a> review of it from our last time in a 2018 BMW 5 Series.<br>
<br>
 M DRIVER’S PACKAGE<br>
 So you just bought the King Kong of luxury-performance sedans. Do you know how to drive it? Offered as a $2,500 option, this one-day class at a BMW Performance Center in California or South Carolina will teach crucial skills to get the most out of your new BMW M performance car.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 M5’s interior is, unsurprisingly, similar to that of the standard 5 Series. But like everything else M, it has been taken up a notch. For example, the transmission selector, one of the first things you’ll touch, is nubbier than the pistol grip of the standard model, and in the M5 it’s surrounded by additional buttons to tailor how the vehicle drives. As it’s more of a toggle than a standard mechanism that moves up and down on a track, it can be a little awkward at first use. Also notable on the M5 are two red buttons peering from on top of the steering wheel like little ears. Labeled M1 and M2, they enable you to call up two customized driving setups tailored to your preference for everything from steering feel and dampers to the xDrive setup.</p>, <p>As with its interior, the M5 retains the basic shape of its lesser 5 Series siblings, but has M-specific treatments for better performance. The M5’s track and overall width are slightly wider than the standard 5 Series sedan, while its overall height is a hair higher. The roof is made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic to cut weight, and there’s a unique front apron with enlarged air intakes and standard 19-inch wheels. If you’re still not sure it’s an M5, look in back. The biggest giveaways are the quad exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>As the top dog in the 2018 5 Series lineup, the M5 comes very well equipped out the gate. In addition to all its performance upgrades, you’ll get 20-way-power front seats, extended Merino leather upholstery, head-up display, power-operated trunk, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats and steering wheel, and universal garage remote. Safety features include blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, and frontal-collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The standard infotainment system is a good one: It bundles a 10.2-inch, high-res screen with navigation and a harman/kardon audio system with AM/FM/HD Radio, CD player, USB input and Bluetooth streaming.</p>, <p>The Driving Assist Plus package adds driving and safety aids like active cruise control, active lane-keeping assist and evasive aid. You can up the luxury factor on the M5 with the Executive Package that bundles amenities like power rear sunshade, soft-close automatic doors, wireless phone charging and in-car Wi-Fi, front seats with massaging and ventilation, surround-view camera and 4-zone climate control. Interestingly, you’ll still have to pay extra for Apple CarPlay integration, but only $300. Android Auto is not currently available in the BMW. Other a la carte extras include that wonderful Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio system, night-vision system, rear-seat entertainment system, moonroof and carbon-ceramic brakes.</p>, <p>A revamped twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 makes 600 horsepower in the new BMW M5. As mentioned, more than just power, what sets the latest M5 apart from all past versions is its use of all-wheel drive (AWD), but an M-specific system that can be switched to a rear-wheel-drive (RWD) mode at the driver’s discretion. Even when the xDrive all-wheel-drive modes are implemented, the car is rear-biased as a performance car should be. Transmitting the power is a fantastic new 8-speed automatic transmission. Ironic as it may be, this high-performance sports sedan is in line with other new models that use an engine start/stop feature that cuts power at idle. We find the restarts can be abrupt, and thankfully the system can be deactivated with the press of a button.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The new BMW M5 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $104,000 when including destination charge and a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. That puts it some $30,000 over the second-highest 5 Series, the M550i xDrive, itself a highly capable and competent performance sedan. At this price, the 2018 M5 is directly in line with its German rival, the Mercedes-AMG E 63 S sedan. Slightly below in price and above in horsepower is the Cadillac CTS-V, a 640-horsepower rear-wheel-drive performance sedan that starts around $88,000. Are there more powerful sedans for even less? Sure. A 707-horsepower Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat lists for under $70,000. But a big part of the BMW’s price and appeal have to do with provenance as much as performance. Before ordering yours, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As this is an all-new version, we have yet to predict this new M5’s resale value.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 BMW M6 loses the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> model this year, leaving the 4-door Gran Coupe and Convertible as the lone 6 Series models under the M umbrella; the all-new 6 Series Gran Turismo doesn't qualify. The M on the trunk means a twin-turbocharged V8 under the hood of the Gran Coupe or Convertible M6, putting out either 552 horsepower in the regular M6 or 600 horsepower in the Competition Package models; yes, there's a more M6-er version of the M6. We're sentimental to the loss of the classic coupe, but the Gran Coupe and Convertible are both excellent options for those considering grand touring <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> like the Mercedes-AMG CLS63 or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> RS7, or <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a> like the Mercedes-AMG S63 Convertible or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> Cabriolet.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m6/">BMW M6</a> skews heavily toward the performance side of the luxury-performance spectrum; double for the Competition Package. Although it's older than most of its competitors, the M6 still holds its own, with timeless style and powerful performance.</p>, <p>While the BMW M6 models are impressive, you could make an argument that much of what they offer is available elsewhere. For example, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m4/">BMW M4</a> is an actual coupe and costs considerably less. Also factor in that the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/6%20series/">BMW 6 Series</a> is also older than many of its competitors.</p>, <p>Like the rest of the BMW 6 Series lineup (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/6-series/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), the actual M6 coupe is dropped from the M6 family. Aside from that, changes are minor and include a new Parking Assistance Package that includes side- and around-view, and a reconfigured Driving Assistance Package that includes blind-spot detection and more.</p>, <p>While it's not like the standard 6 Series is a slouch, the 2018 BMW M6 Convertible and M6 Gran Coupe up the performance ante considerably. Neither is what we'd call a hard-core sports car; instead, they simply take the grand touring mission of the standard 6 Series cars and turn it up to 11, or maybe even 12. The power from the twin-turbo V8 feels endless, especially in Competition Package models, and the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission shifts with a smooth urgency regardless of what mode you're in. Combine it with the sharp steering and stiff suspension, and the Convertible and Gran Coupe both exceed expectations, which is saying a lot considering the expectations that come with the M-labeled cars. Yet for all the sport, both are equally good at comfortable cruising. Slip the Driving Dynamic Control into a more comfortable mode, and the M6 reverts to its luxurious 6 Series roots.</p>, <p>COMPETITION PACKAGE<br/> Somewhere in <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>, someone drove the M6 and thought, "Y'know, it could use a little more juice." So BMW dialed up the wick to 600 horsepower, making this the most powerful M6 ever.<br/> <br/> BANG &amp; OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM<br/> When you're not reveling in the sonorous V8 engine, the 1,200-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system inside the BMW M6 is nothing short of amazing. With sound flowing through 16 individually amplified speakers, you’ll hear every note with eardrum-piercing clarity.<br/> </p>, <p>Like the rest of the 6 Series lineup, the 2018 BMW M6 features a beautifully styled and functionally elegant interior. Premium materials are everywhere, with special touches for the M6, such as M badges and special seats. The steering wheel controls include an "M" button, which allows the driver to store preset performance settings. While the Gran Coupe is technically a sedan, don't expect 7 Series levels of room back there, although it is notably better than the convertible. Trunk space in the Gran Coupe is quite good, and even the Convertible offers good space thanks to its somewhat old-school soft-top mechanism.</p>, <p>The M6 is visually distinguished from its non-M brothers by unique grille inserts, a more aggressive and lower bumper treatment in front and rear, and of course M6 badges on the nose, fender vents and tail. But it's a subtle difference, playing off the already powerful and sexy styling of the 6 Series itself. The Gran Coupe does a respectable job of imitating a 2-door thanks to its low-slung roof and wide stance (just ignore the door handles), and the convertible sports a soft-top instead of the more fashionable hardtop found on other cars.</p>, <p>It should be no surprise that many of the optional features on the 6 Series are standard on the M6. That includes 20-way-power M front seats with 4-way lumbar support and an articulated upper backrest, covered in Merino leather. The 16-speaker harman/kardon audio system is also standard, as are a rearview camera and dynamic cruise control. There are also 4-zone automatic climate control, iDrive infotainment on a 10.2-inch screen, navigation, and Bluetooth and USB inputs for your phone. Safety systems include BMW's Active Protection System, which detects an imminent accident and prepares by pretensioning seatbelts, closing windows and activating post-crash braking.</p>, <p>Besides the Competition Package -- which adds power and performance -- there's a new Driving Assistance Package that adds blind-spot detection, a head-up display and speed-limit information, it also includes BMW's Active Driving Assistant, which bundles lane-departure warning, front-collision warning, city collision mitigation and pedestrian protection, expanding the safety envelope through cameras. An Executive Package for the Gran Coupe adds heated rear seats, power sunshades in the rear and a heated steering wheel. A parking-assistance package adds an around-view camera to assist in parallel parking.</p>, <p>Surprise, manual-transmission lovers! The 2018 BMW M6 Convertible and Gran Coupe are both available with a 6-speed manual, as long as you don't spring for the Competition Package. Otherwise you get the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Either transmission gets connected to a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine putting out 552 horsepower or, in the Competition Package, an even 600 horsepower. The M6 is rear-wheel drive only, and it should be no surprise that it demands premium fuel. While we wouldn't call the M6 a fuel-sipper, it does at least offer a stop/start system that cuts the engine at idle to save fuel.<br>

If you want the M6 convertible, you'll be spending about $122,300. That's all before options of course, and when you start checking boxes you start adding money, with a fully loaded M6 Convertible getting comfortably into $130,000 territory. That's not cheap by any definition, but it is in line with competitors like the Mercedes-AMG CLS63 and Audi RS7 for the Gran Coupe, while undercutting the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/panamera/">Porsche Panamera</a> Turbo. If you're looking at the M6 Convertible, note that it's about the same price as a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> Carrera S Convertible, at least to start.

[<p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> likes to call its <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> vehicles “SAVs,” short for Sports Activity Vehicle. Numerous models carry the X designation including the smallest of the bunch, the 2018 BMW X1. No less capable than the larger X3 and X5, the X1 mixes the performance abilities of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a> with a taller ride height and BMW’s sophisticated all-wheel-drive (AWD) setup. Because it’s an entry-level vehicle, the X1 can be crossed-shopped against all sorts of competitors ranging from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/encore/">Buick Encore</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a> to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gla/">Mercedes-Benz GLA</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a>. Numerous driver assists ensure the drive will be as safe as it is fun, the latter promise backed up by the X1’s gutsy 228-horsepower 4-cylinder engine.</p>, <p>If you grew up a fan of BMW’s small <a alt_o_t="Wagons" href="/wagon/">wagons</a> back in the day, the 2018 X1 compact SUV might just stir something in your soul. The most affordable BMW SAV isn’t as bulky as the bigger X5, yet still provides ample interior space, a sporty ride and year-round driving confidence.</p>, <p>BMW’s 2018 X1 inherits the company’s traditionally firm ride. If you’re looking for something a bit softer, the Lexus NX or Buick Encore is a better choice. You could also spend less and get more power with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a> V6 or turbocharged <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a> XT.</p>, <p>The 2018 X1 gets BMW’s new trim system that reorganizes equipment levels and opens new single options as a specific tier is reached. New standard equipment for the X1 includes a rearview monitor and extended telematics services.</p>, <p>Our test vehicle was the all-wheel-drive 2018 X1 xDrive28i, a vehicle we found to be quite fun. We’re hoping to get a chance in the front-drive version soon as it represents BMW’s first front-drive platform and transverse engine. We found the X1’s lightweight body a good fit for the turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, delivering immediate bursts of power when requested while returning impressive fuel economy in both our city and highway test loops. However, if you’re the type that likes to push a car hard at its limits, the X1 isn’t going to meet your expectations unless you opt for the M Sport suspension package. And, while BMW makes no claims of rugged off-road adventuring in the X1, with the right tires it can tackle minor run-ins with rutted dirt roads, loose gravel and fresh snow.</p>, <p>POWER TAILGATE<br>
Fitting BMW’s premium brand, the 2018 X1 is fitted with a standard power rear liftgate. Adding the Convenience Tier brings Comfort Access keyless entry that allows the liftgate to be activated simply by swiping your foot under the bumper.<br>
<br>
APPLE CARPLAY<br>
Apple CarPlay allows you to mirror your iPhone’s most important functions on the X1’s touch screen, giving you access to Siri, iTunes music, text message and maps. Although this convenient feature is now standard on most competitors, it’s still a $300 upgrade on the 2018 X1.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x1/">BMW X1</a> for 2018 is a 2-row, 5-passenger SUV with plenty of room for people and cargo. Rear-seat passengers have excellent legroom unless the front passengers are so tall they have the front seats in their rearmost position. If this is the case, we recommend spending the additional $300 for the sliding rear-seat option that also reclines. Up front, power seats are standard. This baby BMW's dash is sleek and angular. Materials have a premium look and feel, such as the soft-touch dash and wood accents. The standard SensaTec fake-leather seating feels down-market, though.</p>, <p>The X1 proudly displays its BMW lineage with a noticeably rugged and angular design that makes it look less like a tall wagon and more like a <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUV</a>. For better or worse, the styling works. The X1’s 7.2 inches of ground clearance allow it to venture more securely off-road, while up front BMW's familiar kidney grille, standard LED daytime running lights and optional LED headlights make a strong visual statement and brightly guide your path. The M Sport Package adds further flair with an aerodynamic kit, sport suspension and high-gloss roof rails.</p>, <p>A base 2018 BMW X1 sDrive28i comes with front-wheel drive, while the xDrive28i includes all-wheel drive. Standard equipment includes 8-way-power front seats, automatic climate control, power tailgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, rearview monitor, push-button ignition, and 18-inch wheels with run-flat tires. The standard infotainment system includes a 6.5-inch screen, 7-speaker AM/FM/HD Radio/CD player with USB input and Bluetooth audio streaming/phone connectivity. The X1 also includes BMW Assist eCall emergency-request system with an SOS button, complimentary scheduled maintenance for four years/50,000 miles, and roadside assistance for four years/unlimited miles.</p>, <p>As with most BMWs, there are plenty of ways to upgrade the X1, and they can make the vehicle's base price climb quickly. Even most of the X1's exterior paint colors are extra money, unless you go with non-metallic black or white. You'll also pay extra for Apple CarPlay, a feature that is becoming standard on mainstream <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a>. Other notable extras include a higher-resolution 8.8-inch monitor, panoramic moonroof, navigation, leather interior, heated front seats, and 12-speaker harman/kardon audio system. New driver-assistance features include lane-departure warning, frontal-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and active cruise control.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X1 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes 228 horsepower. BMW promises the X1 can hit the 0-60-mph benchmark in 6.3 seconds. A Sport mode livens throttle response and stiffens steering feel, while Comfort and Eco modes tone down settings. The X1 offers the option of front-wheel or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD) and uses an 8-speed Aisin automatic transmission. A start/stop system shuts off the engine at idle to save fuel. If you find the restarts jarring, it can be defeated. Premium gasoline is recommended.<br>

[<p>The 2018 BMW X2 is a sporty alternative to the BMW X1 SUV. Using the same basic mechanical underpinnings -- including the same 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, 8-speed automatic and available all-wheel drive -- the X2 adds a sporty flair to the mix. With unique styling and an emphasis on driving entertainment over utility, the X2 is poised to take on other subcompact utilities, like the Audi Q3, Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class, and the Infiniti QX30. But we think this is the best variation on the formula so far. The sharp looks make promises that the X2 easily keeps, and even the price is reasonable, at least for a European luxury brand. While something like the Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 is undoubtedly quicker, the X2 is fun, good looking, and less expensive.</p>, <p>If you've been looking for a European luxury crossover SUV you can afford, but one that still offers the kind of sporty flair and driving sophistication to match, this may be what you've been waiting for.</p>, <p>If you need a bigger back seat, a compact SUV like the BMW X3 or Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class may be a better choice. If you're OK with the size but want more performance, the Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 will deliver. However, both alternatives cost more money.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X2 is an all-new model, but with some familiar hardware since it's based on the BMW X1. However, the styling is all new, the mission is different from the X1, and there's never been a BMW X2 before.</p>, <p>Surprisingly, our first time behind the wheel of the BMW X2 was on a racetrack. This seems like an odd place to get one's first experience with a subcompact luxury SUV, but the 2018 BMW X2 puts an emphasis on its handling and performance. So, maybe not so surprisingly, it proved perfectly satisfying. The little BMW SUV boasts sharp steering, good power, and makes the most of its all-wheel-drive setup as it powers out of turns and down straightaways. Yet this doesn't mean it's brutal on the streets. Instead, the new X2 is as comfortable and composed on surface streets as you'd hope. The engine's 258 lb-ft of torque is available from a very low 1,450 rpm, meaning the X2 feels exceptionally responsive in traffic and when passing. The suspension that feels so adept on the track in Sport mode is perfectly comfortable and accommodating in Comfort on the street. </p>, <p>STYLE<br>
The 2018 BMW X2 shape manages to combine sleek lines and the promise of utility without unnecessary bulk or the weird roofline of its X4 and X6 cousins. Of special note: This is the first time the BMW logo has appeared on the rearmost roof pillar since the BMW CSi in the 1970s.<br>
<br>
PRICE<br>
With the caveat that anything with a premium European badge is going to be on the pricey side, the 2018 BMW X2 is more affordable than you might think. Prices start at less than $40,000, and a nicely equipped model will come in at about $45,000. Best of all, the X2 feels worth every penny.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 X2 shares its dash, center console, iDrive display, and switchgear with the more upright X1. The biggest difference is room. While front-seat passengers are perfectly comfortable, the rear seat suffers in leg room and especially head room. If there's a tall driver, make sure the shortest passenger is behind. However, it's not worse than other subcompact crossovers like the Mercedes GLA. There's decent cargo space with extra storage space under a floor panel. Overall, it's comfortable and quiet for the class, but rear visibility is severely compromised, so you'll make good use of the parking sensors and backup camera, but note that blind-spot warning isn't available. One last quibble: The wireless charging pad in the center armrest is exactly too small for large-size smartphones.</p>, <p>Even-numbered BMW X-cars are generally the sporty version of the one-lower odd numbered model, e.g., X3/X4 and X5/X6. However, we're liking the looks of this new BMW X2 more than the others, and it's probably because the X2 doesn't share the sloping hatch design of the X4 and X6. Instead, it's boasting just enough styling flourishes to capture your attention without making you wonder what they were thinking. We already mentioned the BMW logo on the C-pillar, but also take note of the reshaped "kidney" grille in front. </p>, <p>The base model 2018 BMW X2 sDrive28i comes with front-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic transmission. Inside, there's a 10-way power driver's seat with power side bolsters, faux-leather upholstery, an audio system with iDrive, Bluetooth, USB, and Aux inputs, and a touch-screen/knob-based control system. Automatic climate control is also standard, along with rain-sensing windshield wipers, push-button start, and a power tailgate. In addition to multiple airbags and stability control, the X2 comes standard with a rearview camera, exceptionally useful considering the pinched rear view.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available on all models, and worth the $2,000 for it. Besides that, the X2 gets divided into two levels: standard design and M Sport X Design, the latter giving it a more aggressive appearance and including the standard model's Convenience Tier option package, which adds power-folding outside mirrors, auto-dimming rearview mirror, keyless entry, and a panoramic sunroof among other things. The Premium tier on both standard and M Sport adds a head-up display, navigation with real-time traffic info, heated front seats and steering wheel, and BMW's remote services. Other options include any color other than white or black, leather upholstery, wireless charging and a Wi-Fi hotspot, an upgraded Harman Kardon audio system, Apple CarPlay, parking sensors, and active cruise control with stop and go.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder we drove is the only engine you can get in the 2018 BMW X2. Its 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque feel perfectly stout under the hood, and BMW says whether you choose front or all-wheel drive, the engine hauls the X2 from a standstill to 60 mph in about 6.2 seconds. The transmission is an 8-speed automatic with manual shift control and, we're happy to see, a standard PRNDL shift lever instead of BMW's less intuitive electronic gear selector. The EPA estimates decent fuel economy, up to 31 mpg on the highway, which is good news since BMW recommends premium fuel.<br>

All-wheel drive will add $2,000 to that price, and we think it's worth it. If you opt for the sportier M Sport X version, prices start at just over $42,000, although you get quite a bit more equipment. If you go nuts with the options you can push the price to well over $53,000, which is more expensive than many of its competitors. However, you can keep the price in a more reasonable mid-$40,000 range and still get a lot of cool stuff. Generally, the BMW X2 is a little more expensive than the Mercedes-Benz GLA 250, Audi A3, Infiniti QX30, and Lexus NX 300, none of which have the sporty leanings of this model.

[<p>The 2018 BMW X3 is the answer to the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-pace/">Jaguar F-Pace</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a>, and a slew of other compact luxury SUV models from just about any manufacturer that wants to be relevant. To say the compact luxury SUV market is hot is to say water is wet, Elon Musk is ambitious, and so on. But the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a> comes ready to fight, with a pair of powerful engines, tons of cargo space, great driving dynamics, and standard all-wheel drive. This 3rd-generation X3 also has all the modern technology and luxury you'd expect from a European luxury SUV. While the X3 isn't exactly cheap, it's in line with its competition, and should be a top consideration for any luxury SUV shopper.</p>, <p>The all-new BMW X3 comes in two varieties. The xDrive30i is perfect for the day-to-day luxury SUV buyer who needs extra cargo space, but maybe will take their SUV onto the occasional unpaved road. The X3 M40i does that, but its powerful engine and sport suspension lets you enjoy those mountain roads even more.</p>, <p>While standard all-wheel drive helps with dynamics and traction, some buyers don't want the added expense or hit to fuel economy, and may shop elsewhere. Additionally, the infotainment lacks Android Auto, which may turn off some customers.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X3 is all-new this year, building on the successes of the previous two generations with a roomy and luxurious interior, a pair of powerful engines to choose from, and sporty driving dynamics.</p>, <p>Most of our time was spent driving the 2018 BMW X3 M40i, the sportier of the two models, boasting a more powerful engine, firmer suspension, bigger brakes, and electronically controlled shocks. The upshot is an SUV that likes to pretend it's a sport sedan. The 355-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder engine ensures excellent acceleration, going from a standstill to 60 mph in about 4.6 seconds. The suspension lets the X3 M40i take corners like a pro, and the standard all-wheel drive boasts a rearward bias to take the most advantage of the 50:50 weight distribution. The Driving Dynamics Control's Sport+ mode amps everything up, but it makes the steering too firm in our opinion. Luckily, the Individual mode lets you customize the settings. While we didn't get a chance to drive the xDrive30i just yet, our experience with its 2.0-liter turbocharged engine tells us to expect excellent power delivery, even if it's not quite as straight-line quick as the 6-cylinder. Most surprising was the X3's off-road ability -- while not as agile as a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/wrangler/">Jeep Wrangler</a>, still acquitted itself nicely on deeply rutted roads.</p>, <p>M40i<br>
 The X3 M40i is the ideal solution if you're stuck choosing between a sport sedan and an SUV. With plentiful power from its 6-cylinder engine, surprisingly good handling, sharp steering, and excellent brakes, you'd think it was a sporty wagon. But it's comfortable off pavement as well, something most sporty sedans can't match.<br>
<br>
 SPACE MANAGEMENT<br>
 The new BMW X3 manages its dimensions admirably, offering ample interior space for front and rear passengers, and all their stuff in the cargo area. We particularly like the triple-split folding rear seatbacks, which allow you to fold down the center section for long objects without having to sacrifice two seating positions.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The new BMW X3 interior boasts the same design aesthetic as other recent <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> vehicles. There's a wide-view display mounted high on the dash, iDrive control knob alongside BMW's unique gear selector, and the same ergonomics that have been part and parcel of the BMW ownership experience for the better part of the last couple decades. But the new X3 is extraordinarily roomy inside, even for the class. The driver and front passenger have plenty of space, and even rear-seat passengers will find good legroom as long as they're not beyond the 95th percentile. Headroom should be no problem for anybody, and the cargo space is near the top of the class in both usability and outright space.</p>, <p>The 2018 X3 is actually a little bigger than the first-generation <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>, which is technically a size bigger. But the new X3 wears its volume well and doesn't look oversized. The optional 20- or 21-inch wheels look great, and the wide stance imparts a sense of stability. We think the overall integration of headlights, grille and various other elements feels more cohesive on this model than its predecessor. The same is true in the back, where the taillights flow cleanly into the tailgate. The X3 M40i wears more aggressive sheet metal, with deeper front and rear bumpers, body-color side-sill extensions, and more aggressive wheel-and-tire combinations.</p>, <p>The entire 2018 BMW X3 lineup comes standard with all-wheel drive, a departure from its predecessor which offered a rear-drive version. In addition, the X3 offers a standard power liftgate, active grille shutters, power-folding heated side mirrors, and LED low-beam and fog lights. Inside there's automatic climate control, adaptive cruise control, 10-way power adjustable front seats, SensaTec faux leather upholstery, and a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel. The infotainment system is BMW's iDrive 6.0, which includes Bluetooth, USB input, and a 12-speaker audio system.</p>, <p>The standard 2018 X3 xDrive30i offers three jumping off points called: xLine, Luxury and M Sport. The Luxury adds chrome trim, while the M Sport gives the standard model a sporty looking flair. While there are plenty of standalone options, BMW has grouped many of them into "tiers." The Convenience tier adds lumbar support, keyless entry, and a panoramic sunroof, the Premium adds a head-up display, navigation, and a heated steering wheel and seats, and the Executive adds adaptive full LED headlights, digital instrument cluster, parking assistant, surround view with 3D view, and BMW's Gesture Control. Besides a more powerful engine and other performance gear, the M40i takes a different approach, offering many of those features as standalone option packages. Note that both models offer leather as an option, not standard.</p>, <p>Two engines are available for the 2018 BMW X3, and neither is a bad call. The standard X3 xDrive30i gets a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder putting out 248 horsepower. This is an engine that's been doing yeoman's duty under the hoods of virtually every BMW out there these days, and if you choose it you'll likely never feel shortchanged. The upgrade engine in the X3 M40i is the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 that, again, finds itself under the hood of many other BMW vehicles. With power (355 hp) and torque (369 lb-ft) to spare, this engine hardly ever feels strained. Both come connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission, and both drive all four wheels. Fuel economy is better than many of its rivals, too. BMW announced a diesel engine for the U.S., but specifications aren't yet available.<br>

However, with so many options, the price climbs quickly, with colors, leather interior, and other options rapidly inflating the price well beyond that into the $50,000 range. The 6-cylinder-powered M40i offers more standard features, but its base price of about $55,300 also climbs rapidly.

[<p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> is intent on slicing the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> market into ever smaller slices. The 2018 BMW X4 is the perfect example. A combination of <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> styling, SUV ride height and all-wheel drive, and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> utility, the 2018 X4 is at once all of those things and none of them. This emotional play appeals to those who prioritize form over function, and who will pay a premium for it. Smaller inside than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a> on which it's based, it looks better, and it’s arguably more fun to drive, too, whether you're considering the standard model or the more powerful X4 M40i. If you think it's wacky, take note: <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> has paid the ultimate flattery with its similarly designed and conceived <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/glc%20coupe/">Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe</a>.</p>, <p>If you're seeking a stylish SUV with the valet appeal and envious looks you get from a European luxury brand, the 2018 BMW X4 could be just what you're looking for. It still offers a nod to practicality, thanks to its cargo space and standard all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>While it offers some practicality, the reality is that the X4's coupe-like body cuts down on interior space. If you need more room, the X4's sibling, the BMW X3, is a more traditional design, with more traditional SUV qualities. It's even cheaper by a few thousand dollars.</p>, <p>BMW has rearranged its options packages this year, bundling popular items together into a tiered structure. Also standard on all BMW models is a rearview camera, something that's been conspicuously optional on BMW models until now.</p>, <p>BMW's talk about the 2018 X4 combining sedan-like reflexes and SUV utility sounds like marketing mumbo jumbo until you drive it, and it mostly lives up to the billing. The X4 leans even more heavily toward the sporty end of things. Its standard all-wheel drive is focused more on performance driving than off-road capability, although of course it's a traction-enhancing godsend in foul weather. Whether you choose the base model with its 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, or the X4 M40i and its 355-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder engine, both paired to a quick-shifting 8-speed automatic, you'll likely be surprised with the X4's acceleration. The 4-cylinder sprints to 60 mph in about six seconds, while the M40i does it in less than five. The tight suspension makes the X4 remarkably agile with a small ride penalty, and four different drive modes range from fuel-efficient Eco Pro all the way to the max-aggression Sport+.</p>, <p>DISTINCTIVE DESIGN<br/> The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x4/">BMW X4</a> arguably looks better than its X6 big brother for that very reason: It's smaller. The tighter proportions work to its favor from a design standpoint, giving it a lithe look that compares favorably to the more ponderous-looking X6.<br/> <br/> M40i<br/> The 355 horsepower in the X4 M40i almost seems like overkill, considering how satisfying the older 300-horsepower 6-cylinder was. Where the old car was already quick, this one's even faster, and that much better of making good on the promise of its exciting bodywork.<br/> </p>, <p>BMW drivers will immediately be comfortable inside the X4, with its familiar horizontally aligned dash and controls, brushed-aluminum accents, center-mounted color display and quirky gear selector. Yet even those who aren't familiar with BMW's way of doing things will get used to the interior quickly, thanks to its sound ergonomics and ever-improving iDrive infotainment system. In back, the rear-seat's headroom may surprise, as will its 3-across accommodation, although don't expect as much legroom as the X3. If you need more than the standard 17.7 cubic feet of cargo space, the 40/20/40-folding split rear seat expands capacity to 49.4.</p>, <p>The BMW X4's styling has generated controversy, but the coupe-like body over the high-riding SUV chassis works better here than on the larger X6. We think even nicer than the somewhat amorphous Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe. Of course, it should be no surprise that the cool-looking slope of the rear hatch comes at the expense of rear-seat headroom and cargo space. But the X4's customers are likely more interested in style and performance than passenger room and cargo hauling, even though the standard power tailgate offers a hands-free feature to open it with a wave of your foot under the bumper.</p>, <p>The base X4 xDrive28i comes standard with its 4-cylinder routing power to all four wheels. It also includes power fronts seats, moonroof, automatic climate control, power tailgate, universal garage-door opener and rear parking assist. The Driving Dynamics Control is also standard, as is hill-descent control in case you decide to take your luxury SUV off-road. The seats are upholstered in SensaTec faux leather that does a decent job of imitating the real thing, and the audio system includes iDrive and nine speakers. Also standard is dynamic cruise control and, finally, a rearview camera.</p>, <p>The premium you pay for the X4 M40i buys more than a bigger engine. You also get leather upholstery, dynamic damper control, the comfort access keyless-entry system, sport seats with lumbar support, and the base model's premium harman/kardon audio system. Options are mostly bundled into packages, with the M Sport package on base models adding sporty exterior trim, sport seats, increased top speed and more; it's standard on the M40i. A Driving Assistance Plus Package adds blind-spot detection, head-up display, and collision mitigation. Navigation is available as a stand-alone item, as are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>Both available engines for the 2018 BMW X4 are turbocharged. The base engine is a 240-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, while the upgrade engine in the X4 M40i is an inline-6 that puts out 355 horsepower. Both drive all four wheels full-time through an 8-speed automatic transmission. While the 6-cylinder is obviously the star of the show when it comes to acceleration, that 2.0-liter 4-cylinder is no slouch, either, and its 240 horses are suspiciously strong. Both engines require premium fuel, but luckily fuel economy is pretty good, with the 4-cylinder getting in the high 20s on the highway.<br>

If you want the additional power of the 6-cylinder, you'll have to fork over about $60,250 for the M40i, That's considerably more than the BMW X3 on which the X4 is based, although the X4 comes standard with all-wheel drive, which is a $2,000 option on the X3. The most direct comparison is to the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, which starts at about the same price for both its 4- and 6-cylinder versions. Other competitors include the Range Rover Evoque and new <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> F Pace, both of which start for less, but neither shares the X4's coupe-like form.

[<p>The 2018 BMW X5 is the German automaker’s midsize-crossover SUV, slotting between the compact X3 and the forthcoming X7. Loathe to call it an SUV, the luxury brand prefers “Sports Activity Vehicle,” a designation that highlights the X5 favoring of on-road dynamics over off-road ruggedness. Indeed, compared to rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz GLE, Audi Q7, Lexus RX and Acura MDX, this BMW luxury-crossover SUV feels inherently athletic. Like those rivals, the X5 is filled with technology, advanced safety features and creature comforts. It also boasts a wider variety of powertrains than its competitors. With choices ranging from gasoline V6 and V8 engines to a plug-in hybrid and even a diesel, the 2018 X5 lineup is suited to a variety of tastes.</p>, <p>If you want a midsize-luxury-crossover SUV that feels more like a sports sedan than a traditional SUV, put the BMW X5 on your list. If a new diesel SUV is on your wish list, the X5 is one of just a few in this segment to still offer one (others are the Land Rover Discovery and Range Rover Velar).</p>, <p>The X5’s benefits don’t come cheap. Prices start over $58,000, and you’ll easily spend more with options. Rivals like the Acura MDX, Volvo XC90 and Infiniti QX60 can be had for much less, with that last one starting nearly $14,000 cheaper. If you regularly need a third row, wait for the 2019 BMW X7 or opt for the QX60, MDX or a full-size SUV.</p>, <p>Only minor updates have been made to the 2018 BMW X5. Among them are new wheel options and a revised interface for the iDrive navigation, audio and communication systems. Also, the tilting function of the rear glass in the panoramic moonroof has been removed.</p>, <p>With four different powertrains, the 2018 X5 luxury SUV has four distinct driving experiences. Broadly speaking, all have quick acceleration and nimble handling for an SUV. As with other BMWs, the X5 favors sportiness rather than a cream-puff ride, though it’s by no means uncomfortable. Starting with the base 35i model, plenty of power is on tap thanks to the standard turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. The difference is how it’s laid down: The sDrive35i is rear-wheel drive (RWD) and the only X5 as such. Drivers in Sunbelt states will do fine with this model and can save some money in the process. All other 2018 X5 models come with xDrive, BMW’s term for all-wheel drive (AWD), which provides enhanced traction for a variety of roads and weather conditions. Opting for the diesel xDrive35d grants swift acceleration and satisfying torque. The xDrive40e plug-in hybrid has the most distinct driving feel, as it can travel on gasoline, electricity alone (up to 14 miles) or both. The transitions may take some getting used to. Then there’s the xDrive50i. With its 445-horsepower turbo V8, it can blast to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds and sounds gratifying doing it. If you’re still power-hungry, look to the high-performance X5 M (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/x5-m/2018/">reviewed separately</a>).</p>, <p>POWERTRAIN VARIETY<br>
 The X5 offers a wide selection of powertrains in its class and suits a variety of desires and tastes. Those who appreciate green will like the xDrive40e plug-in hybrid, while those who want mean will relish the turbo V8 in the xDrive50i. In between are satisfying 6-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines.<br>
<br>
 INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM<br>
 We already liked the BMW X5's big 10.2-inch infotainment screen and intuitive scroll-and-click user interface. Now it's even better with a new touch screen, letting you either tap the screen or use the dial when it makes the most sense. Plus, the high-resolution screen is super-sharp.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>All models of the BMW X5 except for the plug-in hybrid can be optioned with three rows and seating for seven, but we don’t recommend putting humans in the last row for extended periods of time. If you opt for it, you’ll probably find it best used flat to open up cargo space. The first and second rows, however, are plenty comfortable for adults of most shapes and sizes. That 2nd-row seat folds in a 40/20/40 configuration, handy for fitting long items in the middle without sacrificing a seating position. Up front, the cockpit has BMW’s familiar horizontally aligned array of buttons and knobs. As usual for a BMW, the cabin is more minimalistic than those of other luxury brands, but feels sophisticated all the same. The latest iDrive 6.0 infotainment system with its crisp, 10.2-inch touch screen is easier to use, and the controls are a snap to find and understand.</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X5 luxury SUV retains its muscular yet set smooth lines, and its considerable size is proportioned well. As with its interior, the X5’s exterior style prefers clean and sharp. You won’t find ostentation here, and we think this is the kind of design that will age well like so many other BMWs. We are particularly fond of the signature twin-port "kidney" grille that flows into the headlights, and the elegant creases in the hood. You can tell the plug-in hybrid X5 from the others by its additional filler cap on the front driver’s side. This is where the electric port is located to recharge the X5’s lithium-ion battery pack.</p>, <p>Even a base 2018 BMW X5 sDrive35i comes nicely equipped, as should be expected of an SUV costing nearly $60,000. The X5’s standard equipment includes 14-way power-operated heated front seats, navigation with a 10.2-inch high-res touch screen that's updated to the latest iDrive 6.0 system, power tailgate, power moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, xenon headlights and universal garage-door opener. In addition to navigation, the basic infotainment includes a 9-speaker/205-watt audio system with AM/FM/CD player, HD Radio and a surprise: a 200-gig hard drive with 20 gigs available to store audio files. The X5 offers CarPlay compatibility, but it’s an extra $300. Android Auto is not fully integrated into BMWs at the moment, though the BMW Apps interface allows some Android-based phones to operate certain functions. All new BMWs include complimentary maintenance for three years/36,000 miles.</p>, <p>One notable exception on the standard-features roster is leather upholstery. On all 2018 X5 trims except the xDrive50i, you’ll have to pay an extra $1,300 for it in place of the SensaTec faux leather. Your first choice will be to pick a “line” with exterior and interior aesthetics. From there, you have a wide range of options, ranging from a heated steering wheel and ventilated seats to a night-vision assist system and surround-view cameras. Driving-assistance features include blind-spot monitoring, head-up display, active cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Two upgraded audio systems are available: a harman/kardon system or an audiophile-grade Bang &amp; Olufsen.</p>, <p>The sDrive35i and xDrive35i use a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 with 300 horsepower, while the xDrive35d uses a turbodiesel with 255 horsepower and a whopping 413 lb-ft of torque. The V8-powered xDrive50i has a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 with 445 horsepower. The xDrive40e plug-in hybrid mates a 2.0-liter turbo-4 to an integrated electric motor for a total of 308 horsepower. It has an electric-only driving range of up to 14 miles before the gasoline engine kicks in. There are also various drive modes to maximize efficiency or save the battery. Recharging can take a few hours and can be done on a 120- or 220-volt line. Every engine comes connected to a slick 8-speed automatic transmission, and all X5 SUVs have a start/stop function that shuts down the engine at idle. It restarts quickly enough when you lift your foot from the brake, but its intrusiveness had us reaching for the "off" button.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4/electric motor (xDrive40e)<br/> 308 horsepower (combined) <br/> 332 lb-ft of torque (combined) <br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 56 mpge (combined), 24 mpg (combined)<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (sDrive35i and xDrive35i)<br/> 300 horsepower @ 5,800 rpm<br/> 295 lb-ft of torque @ 1,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (RWD), 18/24 mpg (AWD)<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.0-liter turbocharged diesel inline-6 (xDrive35d)<br/> 255 horsepower @ 4,000 rpm<br/> 413 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-3,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/29 mpg<br/> <b><br/> </b>4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (xDrive50i)<br/> 445 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm<br/> 479 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/21 mpg</p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X5 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $58,000 for a rear-wheel-drive sDrive35i. Opting for all-wheel drive lifts that price to just over $60,000. If you want a diesel X5, plan to spend around $62,000 on a base xDrive35d. The plug-in hybrid X5, the xDrive40e, begins just under $65,000, but is eligible for a $4,668 tax credit. The V8-powered X5 xDrive50i begins around $75,000. Keep in mind these prices are before options, which can add several thousand dollars to the bottom line. At these prices, the X5 sits above rivals like the Mercedes-Benz GLE, Lexus RX, Audi Q7, Acura MDX, Volvo XC90, Infiniti QX60, Land Rover Discovery and Range Rover Velar, and Cadillac XT5. It’s not quite as much as a Porsche Cayenne. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The BMW X5’s resale value is expected to be about fair, trailing rivals like the Lexus RX and Acura MDX.</p>]

[<p>Think of the 2018 BMW X5 M as the evil twin of the standard X5 luxury-midsize-crossover SUV. While the regular X5 is no slouch, the X5 M ups the ante to staggering levels. This high-performance SUV boasts 567 horsepower and can do 0-60 mph in four seconds flat -- which keeps it ahead of the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 S and just a tick behind the more expensive Porsche Cayenne Turbo. Along with the added power and other performance upgrades is a first-rate interior with all the amenities expected in a $100,000-plus luxury SUV. Potential downsides? Well, there’s that 6-figure price tag, and the X5 M may not have the emotional appeal of, say, a Cayenne, Maserati Levante or the forthcoming Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio.</p>, <p>If you want the ultimate BMW X5, this is it. Packing a turbo V8 with 567 horsepower and M-tuned suspension and brakes, the X5 M melds sports-car performance with SUV utility. Just owning a BMW M vehicle also puts you in an exclusive club of like-minded enthusiasts.</p>, <p>The new Porsche Cayenne Turbo will get to 60 mph slightly faster and feels nimbler in the corners, too, which is also likely for the forthcoming Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio. If you’re only about the numbers, a Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk has 707 horsepower, does 0-60 mph 3.5 seconds, and costs over $15,000 less.</p>, <p>The BMW X5 M receives only minor updates for 2018. Among the changes are an updated iDrive infotainment and navigation system, and the formerly available Driver Assistance Plus package is now bundled into the Executive Package. Active Blind Spot Detection can now be had as a stand-alone option for $500.</p>, <p>If you don’t believe a sport-utility vehicle can sub for a sports sedan, then test-drive a BMW X5 M. You’ll soon find that this high-performance luxury SUV has the guts to not just match a sports sedan’s abilities, but likely beat them. This is certainly true in a straight line, as attested by the X5 M’s 0-60-mph time of 4.0 seconds. In corners, the X5 M does its best to defy physics and its own 5,260-pound heft. Comparatively, the all-new Porsche Cayenne Turbo weighs 464 pounds less and has rear-axle steering, enabling it to feel lither in corners. Still, the X5 M with its aging platform does an admirable job of hanging with the latest Porsche, and the BMW’s active-roll stabilization and active-suspension control help quell body roll.</p>, <p>M DRIVER’S PACKAGE<br>
 This option isn’t physical but experiential -- and one you’ll likely never forget. For $2,500, you get a day of high-performance driving instruction in BMW M vehicles at a racetrack in either California or South Carolina. It’s a day of training that can foster skills for a lifetime.<br>
<br>
 BANG &amp; OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM<br>
 If you’re spending over $100,000 on an SUV, it’s clear you enjoy the finer things in life. If that applies to your music collection, treat yourself to the $3,700 Bang &amp; Olufsen audiophile sound system. It’s one of the best we’ve heard, and will make your music come alive no matter the source.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While the standard X5 offers a third row and seating for up to seven, the X5 M is made solely as a 2-row/5-passenger luxury SUV. That’s not necessarily a detriment, as the third row in the standard X5 is quite small, and we think the better use for that space is for cargo. Being the top dog in the X5 lineup, this M model is even more luxurious than what is already a laudable luxury SUV. The cabin is fitted with Merino leather upholstery, a leather dashboard and special M badging sprinkled throughout. On the practical side, the rear seats fold in a 40/20/40 split and can expand rear cargo space from 35.8 cubic feet to a spacious 76.7. Up front are well-bolstered seats, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, and the crisp but minimalistic audio and climate controls for which BMW is known. Most controls are easy to use, but the nub-like gearshift can be confusing initially.</p>, <p>The X5 M stands out from its lesser brethren with an aggressive front fascia, a wider track and lower stance. Aside from the M badging, look for the telltale sign of quad tailpipes that also distinguish the X5 M. This BMW performance SUV rides on big 21-inch wheels and features bright xenon adaptive headlights with a slick auto-leveling feature.</p>, <p>The 2018 X5 M comes exceptionally well-equipped in standard form. In addition to its high-performance engine and hardware, this SUV’s long list of standard equipment includes a power tailgate, panoramic moonroof, 4-zone automatic climate control, leather interior and 18-way front seats with 3-stage heating, universal garage remote, rearview camera and parking sensors. The standard infotainment system includes a 10.2-inch high-res touch screen with navigation and 16-speaker harman/kardon AM/FM/CD HD Radio audio system with built-in hard drive. Like other new BMWs, the X5 M comes with complimentary maintenance for three years/36,000 miles.</p>, <p>Unlike the lower-trim X5 models, there isn’t a vast selection of options for the X5 M. Part of that is because it’s so well-equipped to begin with. Also, the sole package available bundles a lot. For $6,100, the Executive Package includes ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel and heated rear seats, surround-view camera, soft-close automatic doors, head-up display, and in-car Wi-Fi and wireless phone charging. Aside from blind-spot monitoring (also available as a sole option), the package is the only way to get driver-assist features like lane-departure warning, frontal-collision warning and automatic emergency braking. If you want Apple CarPlay integration, it’s an extra $300. Also available is night-vision assist, a rear-seat entertainment system and that excellent Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system.</p>, <p>Here’s the heart of the X5 M, and the beating muscle of this beast is a 4.4-liter turbo V8 tuned to make 567 horsepower. All-wheel drive, which BMW calls xDrive, is standard. That enhanced traction system has M-specific tuning for -- you guessed it -- better performance. As with the standard X5 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/x5/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), this performance variant uses an 8-speed automatic transmission that also has gotten the M treatment. With a sense of irony, we’ll mention that there’s also an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle in order to save fuel. If you’re not a fan of the engine shutting off at traffic signals, the system can be defeated. On the fuel-economy front, what are you expecting? With an EPA rating of 16 mpg combined, the most powerful X5 is also the least efficient.<br>
<br>
4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8<br>
567 horsepower @ 6,000-6,500 rpm<br>
553 lb-ft of torque @ 2,200-5,000 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/19 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 BMW X5 M has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $102,695. Loaded with every option, BMW’s top-line X5 can reach nearly $120,000. This is rich territory for sure, but not out of the ordinary for high-performance luxury SUVs of this caliber. The Mercedes-AMG GLE 63, for instance, nearly mirrors the X5 M’s price, while the Porsche Cayenne Turbo debuts around $125,000. A Range Rover Sport SVR also starts higher, near the $115,000 mark. Other potential rivals include the Maserati Levante, which has less power but possibly more cachet, and the forthcoming Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, which is in the same boat. The Maserati begins in the $70,000 range, and we wouldn’t be surprised if the Alfa aims for that mark, too. While not a luxury brand, the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk has significantly more power and starts under $90,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. The X5 M’s resale value is expected to be fair, likely trailing that of the new Porsche Cayenne.</p>]

[<p>Think of the 2018 BMW X6 as the more vivacious, less practical sibling of the X5. Whereas the BMW X5 midsize-luxury <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> prioritizes hauling people and gear, the X6 favors a sportier nature and design flair with its coupe-like form. This blending of a high-riding premium-crossover SUV with a sports <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> may seem strange, but the X6 has found success among laissez-faire buyers and a newer German rival in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gle%20coupe/">Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe</a>. The X6 packs a turbocharged 6-cylinder or V8 engine, and can be had in even more powerful form as the X6 M (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/x6-m/2018/">reviewed separately</a>). Form over function has a price in the X6. At nearly $64,000, the X6 starts over $6,000 beyond its X5 brother.</p>, <p>If you want a nonconformist sport-utility vehicle that’s more sport than utility yet still boasts BMW’s <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> and performance credentials, the 2018 X6 remains a standout. With an ample 8.3 inches of ground clearance and optional all-wheel drive, the X6 is also a worthy winter-weather hauler.</p>, <p>With its signature sloping roof, cargo space and rear sightlines take a back seat to style in the X6. Unlike the X5, there is no 3rd-row option, and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> prices this “Sports Activity Coupe” higher than the X5. Mercedes’ AMG-finessed GLE Coupe rivals, meanwhile, win the horsepower war.</p>, <p>There are only minor changes for the 2018 BMW X6. Among them are updates to the iDrive infotainment system, upgraded navigation and new wheel options.</p>, <p>The X6 isn’t just an amalgamation in the way it looks. The same is true of the experience behind the wheel. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x6/">BMW X6</a> is one dynamic performer. First, it’s fast. The 6-cylinder models can do 0-60 mph in a commendable six seconds flat. Step up to the V8-powered xDrive50i, and you can hit that number in 4.6 seconds -- right up there with high-powered sports cars. Beyond impressive straight-line performance, the X6 has respectable cornering ability for such a large and heavy vehicle. One differentiator between the BMW X6 and Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupe is that you can get the X6 in rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) vs. just AWD in the Mercedes. This is relevant because some sports-car purists want a rear-drive car. It also enables the BMW to undercut the Mercedes’ starting prices by about $7,500. When not trying to imitate a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m3/">BMW M3</a>, the X6 has comfortable highway manners. Two things to be aware of are its massive rear blind spots and the engine’s start/stop system, which cuts power at idle to save fuel. At least the latter can be remedied by disabling that feature with the press of a button.</p>, <p>NONCONFORMIST NATURE<br>
The X6 has the design and attitude of a maverick, yet is wholly part of the BMW brand portfolio. It’s also a progenitor, spawning the smaller X4 and X2, along with rivals from other brands.<br>
<br>
BANG &amp; OLUFSEN SOUND SYSTEM<br>
If your ears can appreciate an audiophile sound system and your pockets are deep enough to spend an extra $4,500, this high-end 16-speaker audio system aims to make sonic journeys as memorable as your actual ones.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While the X6’s exterior lines are a departure from other BMWs, its interior will feel familiar to BMW buyers. As with the X5, the front seats are roomy and the seating position is high, providing driver and passenger a good view out front. A wide armrest/stowage bin separates the driver and passenger seat, and centered prominently in the dash is a 10.2-inch screen that controls navigation, audio and other functions via touch or a rotary dial and surrounding keys. Unlike the X5 that can seat up to seven with an optional third row, the X6 maxes out at five passengers, and those in back might feel more cramped due to the reduced headroom. Thanks to folding seats and its hatch design, the X6 has some cargo-carrying practicality, but not as much as the more squared-off X5.</p>, <p>Take one look at the 2018 X6 and you’ll probably come to one of two conclusions: You’ll like it or won’t. BMW took a risk when it introduced the X6 nearly a decade ago, and for some it was and remains a head-scratcher -- a coupe-like design with four doors and a rear liftgate, all lifted like an SUV. For its 2nd-generation revamp a few years ago, the basic contours remained but the skin got nipped and tucked, resulting in even more style. The X6’s most distinctive feature is its sloped roof. Whereas the X5 has the blocky profile of a traditional SUV, the X6 has a tapered top that evokes a stylish coupe. Some could argue the X6 lets you have your cake and eat it, too, by marrying a vehicle with the design of a grand touring coupe and the utility of an SUV.</p>, <p>The 2018 X6 comes in two major forms: the sDrive35i/xDrive35i and the xDrive50i. The first two are 6-cylinder models with either rear- or all-wheel drive, while the last one comes with a V8 and AWD. The 35i variants come with Dakota leather upholstery, power tailgate, 14-way-power front seats, rearview camera with front and rear parking sensors, 3-stage heated front seats, universal garage-door opener, dual-zone climate control, and power-adjustable steering column. The X6’s standard infotainment system bundles a 10.2-inch touch-screen display with complementary rotary dial and key controls, navigation, and 9-speaker/205-watt AM/FM/CD/HD Radio audio system with Bluetooth connectivity and USB input. New BMWs come with Ultimate Care, which provides complimentary maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is standard on the 2018 X6 xDrive35i and the X6 xDrive50i. That top-line model also boasts a more powerful 4.4-liter turbocharged V8 engine, 20-way-power front seats, upgraded 16-speaker harman/kardon audio system and 4-zone climate control. Numerous options are offered across trims, including Apple CarPlay smartphone integration (but no Android Auto), driving-assist packages that include features like active blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning and automatic emergency braking. Other amenities include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, heated steering wheel, wireless phone charging and in-car Wi-Fi, and night-vision assist with pedestrian detection. Performance options include a rear-axle air suspension with dynamic damper control.</p>, <p>You have a choice of two engines in the 2018 X6. The sDrive35i and xDrive35i use a turbocharged inline 6-cylinder, with “sDrive” designating rear-wheel drive (RWD) and “xDrive” meaning all-wheel drive (AWD). If you want the potent, turbocharged V8, step up to the xDrive50i. All models use an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission, and all also feature an auto stop/start function that stops the engine in situations such as traffic lights where it would otherwise idle. The start-ups can be jarring and, if frequent, annoying. Thankfully it can be disabled with the touch of a button. As with other BMWs -- and most <a alt_o_t="Luxury Cars" href="/luxury-car/">luxury cars</a> for that matter -- be ready to spend extra for premium gasoline.<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 (sDrive35i, xDrive35i)<br/> 300 horsepower @ 5,800-6,400 rpm<br/> 300 lb-ft of torque @ 1,200-5,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (RWD), 18/24 mpg (AWD)<br/> <b><br/> </b>4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (xDrive50i)<br/> 445 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm<br/> 480 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/21 mpg<b></b></p>, <p>Factoring in the $995 destination fee, the 2018 BMW X6 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just shy of $64,000. Stepping up to the all-wheel-drive X6 xDrive35i puts you over the $66,000 mark, and going further still to the V8-powered X6 xDrive50i will run you over $78,000. These are just the starting points. With options, these figures can swell by thousands. All-in, a V8 X6 can surge past the $100,000 mark. At its starting price, the X6 begins several thousand dollars higher than its X5 sibling but below its most like-minded rival, the Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupe that starts over $71,000. The all-new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayenne/">Porsche Cayenne</a>, meanwhile, starts directly in line with the X6 all while nailing the performance/utility equation.

---------http://www.kbb.com/bmw/x6-m/2018
[<p>The 2018 BMW X6 M is the high-performance version of the standard BMW X6. The X6 M picks up where the xDrive50i ends, tweaking the turbocharged V8 engine to make a rip-roaring 567 horsepower. The result is a high-end hauler that does 0 to 60 mph in a physics-defying 4.1 seconds. Beyond added power, this ultra X6 gets the BMW M treatment that massages the chassis, transmission, all-wheel-drive system and other components for the highest performance. As with the standard X6 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/x6/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), this M version blends a coupe-like body with the ride height and enhanced cargo capacity of an SUV. Rivals are few, but the Mercedes-AMG 63 S GLE Coupe technically has more power, while the all-new Porsche Cayenne Turbo is faster.</p>, <p>The X6 is already a uniquely styled, nonconformist SUV. If you want that <i>and</i> a massive helping of horsepower and performance upgrades, the 2018 X6 M is your vehicle. With standard all-wheel drive, you can even justify it as your winter vehicle, while its rear hatch and cargo area make it a decent hauler.</p>, <p>Beyond its polarizing design, on a utility level the X6 M has less interior space than its X5 M performance SUV sibling. If only horsepower figures matter, the Mercedes-AMG 63 S GLE Coupe has a few more. For off-the-line performance, a Porsche Cayenne Turbo is faster, and the all-electric Tesla Model X is faster still.</p>, <p>Changes are minimal for the 2018 BMW X6 M. Among them is an updated version of BMW’s iDrive infotainment system, including its navigation.</p>, <p>The X6 M takes the standard X6’s physics-defying mentality and pushes it to the next level. Pure acceleration is enthralling. With the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 pumping out 567 horsepower, you’ll keep up with sports cars between traffic lights as this performance-luxury-crossover SUV hits 60 mph in just over four seconds. More impressive is the stiff grip of this nearly 5,200-pound hauler. BMW’s M performance engineers have enabled this beast to feel athletic in corners despite its considerable heft. It all feels like a lesson in contrasts, which is true for the X6 as a whole. Just don’t race a Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk or a Tesla Model X up the onramp. We’ve done 0-60 mph in 3.4 seconds in Jeep’s 707-horsepower bruiser, while Tesla’s all-electric SUV can get there in a mind-bending 2.9 seconds.</p>, <p>HIGH-END AMENITIES<br>
 For all its high-performance headlines, the X6 is still a BMW, and a $100,000-plus one at that. That means the inside is cocooned in fine leather, boasts savvy technology and offers impressive safety features.<br>
<br>
 HANDS-FREE TAILGATE<br>
 In addition to being able to open the X6 M’s liftgate via a button on the remote, you can also do it with a wave of your foot. It’s a convenient feature when your hands are otherwise preoccupied carrying groceries or gear.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As with the standard X6, this high-performance M version has a 2-row/5-passenger interior. This one, though, is outfitted with finer extended Merino leather upholstery, a leather dashboard and Alcantara headliner. Front passengers are treated to big, plush seats and a good view out, but rear passengers -- especially taller ones -- may experience a lack of headroom due to the sloping roof. That roof also creates large blind spots for the driver. We like the high-resolution 10.2-inch central display that shows navigation, audio info and more. It can be controlled via touch or the iDrive rotary controller and surrounding keys.</p>, <p>BMW doesn’t call the X6 an SUV, but rather a “Sports Activity Coupe.” There’s something to this more than marketing-speak. With its sloped roof yet raised ride height and cargo hull accessed by a liftgate, the X6 combines attributes of both a grand touring coupe and an SUV. The X6 M ups the performance attitude with large 21-inch wheels, quad exhaust outlets, M rear spoiler and shadowline exterior trim.</p>, <p>As the top dog in the 2018 X6 lineup, the X6 M comes very well equipped out the door. In addition to all the performance upgrades, there are 18-way power-operated and heated front seats, high-end leather interior, 4-zone climate control, and power-operated hands-free tailgate. The X6’s infotainment system includes a 10.2-inch display, the latest iDrive 6.0 system with updated navigation, and a 16-speaker/600-watt harman/kardon audio system. Like other new BMWs, the X6 M high-performance-crossover SUV includes Ultimate Care, a complimentary maintenance program good for three years/36,000 miles.</p>, <p>The X6 M’s sole main package, Executive, bundles a plethora of features including ventilated front seats, soft-close doors, head-up display, heated rear seats and steering wheel, surround-view cameras, wireless phone charging and in-vehicle Wi-Fi. It also includes active safety and driver-assist features like lane-departure warning, active blind-spot detection, and frontal-collision warning with automatic emergency braking. A la carte options include Apple CarPlay compatibility (but not Android Auto), a high-end Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system, rear-seat entertainment system and night-vision system. Also tantalizing is the M Driver’s Package that includes a 1-day high-performance driving class at a BMW Performance Center in South Carolina (the state where the X6 is made) or in California.</p>, <p>The heart of the BMW X6 M is a twin-turbocharged V8 that makes 567 horsepower. It sends that power to all four wheels via BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system. This, too, has been M-tuned for greater performance. The same goes for the 8-speed automatic transmission. Ironic as it may seem, this engine has a start/stop feature that shuts down the engine at idle to save fuel. So if you come to a stoplight and the engine shuts off, this is totally normal. Restarts are quick but can be frustrating, especially in heavy traffic. Thankfully the system can be defeated with the press of a button.<br>

That’s a $27,000-plus premium over the standard V8-powered X6, the xDrive50i, and over $42,000 more than a base X6 sDrive35i. The standard V8 X6 is no slouch, so at nearly $30,000 more, you’re paying a hefty price for the X6 M’s enhanced performance and exclusivity. Still, the X6 M is nearly $7,000 less than the Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 S Coupe. It’s also less than the new Porsche Cayenne Turbo, which comes in around $125,000. A Tesla Model X, meanwhile, ranges from roughly $87,000 to $140,000 depending on the desired power and range. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. The X6 M’s resale value is expected to hold up relatively well, and slightly better than its Mercedes-AMG GLE Coupe rival and the Tesla Model X.</p>]

[<p>A stylish 4-passenger convertible, the 2018 Buick Cascada is a sporty and luxurious ride for sun-worshipers looking for some fresh air. Buick’s first convertible in 25 years competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/2%20series/">BMW 2 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a3/">Audi A3</a> as well as soft-top versions of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/mustang/">Ford Mustang</a> and Chevy Camaro. The front-wheel-drive Cascada is powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine making 200 horsepower, which is less than you’ll find in a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> 230i but it out-muscles the standard engine in the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>. The <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/buick/">Buick</a> beats them both on price. Three trim levels are available, the base, Premium and Sport Touring with prices starting around $34,000. That’s about $7,000 less than the BMW and about $4,000 under the Audi. Standard equipment includes a 6-speed automatic transmission, 20-inch aluminum wheels, onboard Wi-Fi and a power top, which opens in 17 seconds.</p>, <p>Blue sky. Your favorite road, maybe it’s along the coast or through farm country past red barns and grazing horses. Top down. Wind in your hair. Sun on your face. Life, work, the city, it’s all in your rearview mirror. If this sounds good, you’ll like the 2018 Buick Cascada.</p>, <p>If an all-wheel-drive (AWD) convertible is on your wish list, Buick does not have what you’re looking for; the Cascada is only available with front-wheel drive (FWD). BMW and Audi, however, offer AWD on the 2 Series and the A3 Cabriolet. Those looking for razor-sharp handling will likely be happier in the BMW or Audi as well.</p>, <p>For 2018, Buick hasn’t messed with success. Improvements to the Cascada are limited to a few new colors including Darkmoon Blue Metallic. Also, the popular Dark Effects Package is now available on two more exterior colors in addition to Sport Red.</p>, <p>This is the perfect car for that lazy Sunday drive up the coast. With top down you can feel the sun on your face, hear the waves crashing into the sand and smell the salty sea air. The 2018 Buick Cascada is sporty, but it isn’t a sports car. It’s a cruiser, not a bruiser. At 4,000 pounds, the 200-horsepower convertible is adequately spunky, delivering good acceleration with only the faintest hint of turbo lag. Its 6-speed automatic transmission isn’t exactly state-of-the-art, but its gear changes are smooth. Still, the Buick is slower than its rivals with a 0-60-mph time of over 8.0 seconds. We also wouldn’t pit it against a BMW 2 Series in the corners, despite its standard 20-inch wheels and tires. But the roomy and comfortable <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/cascada/">Buick Cascada</a> is a fantastic Sunday drive companion, with a smooth ride, a rigid structure and lightly weighted and responsive steering.</p>, <p>AUTOMATIC ROLL-OVER POP-UP BARS<br/> Some buyers shy away from <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a> because they worry about safety in a roll-over accident. Buick has addressed this with hidden spring-loaded, pyrotechnically activated rollbars behind the rear seats. Linked to the car’s airbag system, when deployed the rollbars, which are made of high-strength steel, extend approximately 14 inches to match the height of the windshield and protect the car’s occupants.<br/> <br/> DRIVER CONFIDENCE PACKAGE<br/> Although optional on the base model, this safety-focused package is standard on the Cascada Premium and Sport Touring models. It adds Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning, Front and Rear Park Assist, rain-sensing windshield wipers and automatic high-beam control. An adaptive-cruise-control system is not offered on the Cascada.<br/> </p>, <p>Impressively roomy for a drop-top this size, the 2018 Buick Cascada can seat four average-size adults. Seat comfort is high, and the rest of the interior is well finished and nicely detailed. Unfortunately there are a few dated design details like a bazillion buttons on the dash and a smallish infotainment screen. Buick’s signature Quiet Tuning is evident with the top up, and sound levels and wind buffeting remain commendably low even when the Cascada is running in al fresco mode. However, flipping its lid does trim the car’s generous 13.4-cubic-foot trunk capacity to a still-serviceable 9.8 cubic feet.</p>, <p>This is not a <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small car</a>. At 184.9 inches long, the 2018 Buick Cascada is 10 inches longer than a BMW 2 Series. The Buick is also several inches wider than the BMW. But the Cascada wears its size well, with a radically raked windshield, nicely flared wheel arches and a stubby well-tapered proboscis. Certainly the Buick looks best with its fabric top stowed away underneath the cleanly designed hard boot, but its curb appeal isn’t completely sabotaged with it up either. In fact, the Cascada looks downright sexy with its top up but its four windows rolled down, giving the Buick a classic hardtop profile.</p>, <p>To enhance the new Buick Cascada’s appeal, both base and the Premium variants come with a bounty of up-line features that complement the excellent soft top, and a full range of power assists. Highlighting that formidable roster are auto-controlled high-intensity headlights, heat-reflective leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel and seats, Buick's IntelliLink system with a 7.0-inch color display, OnStar with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hotspot, Siri Eyes Free for iOS phones, a navigation system, dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, Rear Park Assist, <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> seatbelt presenters, dual 12V powerpoints, and spring-loaded/pyrotechnically activated pop-up roll-over bars behind the rear seat linked to the car’s seatbelt system.</p>, <p>Options are a relatively rare commodity on the 2018 Cascada. Save for a few extra-cost exterior colors, all versions of the Cascada convertible are mono-spec offerings. The only upgrades included on the Cascada Premium and Sport Touring models add Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning, front as well as rear Park Assist, tunnel detection for the automatic-headlight control, Rainsense automatic wipers, front/rear air deflectors, and a unique “diamond-graphic” finish on the wheels on the Premium and a Sterling Silver finish on the Sport Touring. The popular Dark Effects Package adds dark exterior trim, red interior stitching and piano-black interior trim.</p>, <p>There’s just one powertrain for all three variants of the 2018 Buick Cascada: a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that drives the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. Part of GM’s new-generation Ecotec family, this free-revving four boasts direct injection and continuously variable-valve timing that help it turn out 200 horsepower -- a heady 125 horsepower per liter. It also develops 207 lb-ft of torque from 1,800-4,500 rpm, which can be cranked up to 221 lb-ft in 10-second bursts thanks to an overboost function. A remapping of throttle response also helps enhance the car’s pleasantly brisk acceleration. The modest downside to that enthusiasm is fuel economy. With EPA ratings of 20/27 city/highway mpg, the Cascada falls well shy of best in class.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/29 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Buick Cascada in base 1SV trim has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $34,000, while the Premium model with its active/passive driver assists opens at the slightest nudge under $37,000. The Sport Touring adds another $1,000 to the bottom line. The Premium’s price is roughly where the Audi A3 and BMW 2 Series convertibles commence and while domestic drop-top alternatives like the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro start lower, neither of those models includes standards like leather, power seats and navigation, items that further burnish the Cascada’s overall value story. Before you set out to purchase, be sure to check KBB’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for the 2018 Buick Cascada in your area. We expect the Cascada to hold average values a few points below the BMW 2 Series and Ford Mustang, but on par with the Audi A3 Cabriolet.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/buick/enclave/2018
[<p>It’s been a decade since Buick first introduced the Enclave, a 3-row crossover SUV that arguably has set the standard for the genre. But other than minor facelifts and equipment upgrades, the GM division has done little else to this workhorse. But now, it has totally redesigned the Enclave, added a new range-topping version call Avenir and generally lifted the bar for what buyers can expect in this segment that has some pretty tough competition in the form of the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60 and Mazda CX-9. In fact, with its better packaging and affordable price, it still has enough upscale aura to possibly turn the heads of Audi Q7 and Volvo XC90 intenders.</p>, <p>The new Enclave may be for you if you need a full-size 3-row crossover SUV that has plenty of room, great visibility and ease of use, and it drives like a much smaller vehicle.</p>, <p>Let's say you’re looking to carry eight passengers. Though the 2018 Enclave is larger than the vehicle it replaces, it has eliminated the 2nd-row bench because of a low take rate from buyers. Unlike other SUVs in the category, it has 2+2+3 seating. While the “way back” is roomy, it can be difficult getting a trio back there.</p>, <p>This is the first major redesign in the vehicle’s history. It rides on an all-new platform, has distinctive and fresh styling and offers a host of new features. The 3.6-liter V6 engine puts out more power and is now mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. And for the first time, Buick is offering a factory-installed towing package that will allow the Enclave to pull up to 5,000 pounds.</p>, <p>The all-new Enclave still has the smooth ride of the previous model, but even more so thanks to a 2-inch-longer wheelbase providing a better ride and shorter turning radius. There’s good visibility all around and the V6 now puts out an estimated 310 horsepower, which provides some much needed get-up-and-go. A new 5-link independent rear gives the Enclave sharper response and is tuned to minimize body roll in corners. The electric power steering has an active return assist, which gives the steering a lighter touch when unwinding the wheel. Overall, the handling of the new Enclave is much improved with little or no sacrifice to ride comfort. Available in either front- or all-wheel-drive (FWD, AWD), there’s little to distinguish the two in the driving experience save that the FWD model is quicker off the line thanks to its lighter curb weight. While the Enclave doesn’t deliver the same kind of spirited handling as the Mazda CX-9, it makes up for it in spades by having a much more usable cabin.</p>, <p>INTERIOR SPACE<br/> With its 2-inch-longer wheelbase and tidier packaging of its new independent rear suspension, the Buick Enclave boasts 10 cubic feet more of interior space. Even with the third row up, it has 23.6 cubic feet of storage space behind. Both the second and third rows fold flat to turn it into cavernous cargo hauler.<br/> <b><br/> </b>QUIET TUNING<b><br/> </b>Quiet Tuning is a Buick hallmark and what distinguished the previous model from the competition. The cabin is downright serene thanks to the attention to detail in controlling noise, vibration and harshness. The laminated glass returns as does the extensive use of sound-deadening material. But also further attention to stiffening the structure through the use of high-strength steel has paid dividends.<br/> </p>, <p>The interior features a clean, flowing design with a layered look to the dashboard that incorporates a padded surface set off by chrome and wood accents. The large 8-inch screen dominates the center of the dash, and electronic analog gauges are positioned in front of the driver. The comfortable front buckets are divided by a huge center console that has plenty of storage space. Controls are logically arrayed and easy to use in concert with the touch screen. As mentioned, the 2nd-row bench is no more, but there are two comfortable 2nd-row captain’s chairs and the third row has comfortable seating for two, and three in a pinch.</p>, <p>Riding on a 120.9-inch wheelbase and measuring 204.3 inches in overall length, the 2018 Buick Enclave is a big boy and yet the svelte exterior styling takes a bit off that bulk. Gone is the waterfall grille design, a styling cue that has not aged well for Buick. In its place is a more contemporary opening with wings extending from either side of the rather largish Buick tri-shield logo. Step up to the range-topping Avenir and you’ll get a really slick-looking 3D mesh grille. The roofline is sleeker and the overall look is more like a really tall sports wagon than a boxy SUV. Think Mazda CX-9 on a grand scale.</p>, <p>Buick’s new Enclave has three trim levels, base, Essence and Premium. All models feature keyless entry and push-button start, hands-free power-programmable rear liftgate, tri-zone automatic climate control, universal home remote, six USB ports, OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Standard safety equipment includes a rearview camera, rear park assist, seven airbags, Teen Driver tracking and rear-seat reminder. Step up to an Avenir and you get 20-inch wheels, leather upholstery, heated/ventilated front seats, heated 2nd-row seats, 360-surround-view camera, a rearview mirror used as a conventional unit or a camera, and a dual moonroof.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is offered as an option on all trim levels except the base model. Options include navigation, upgraded Bose sound system, adaptive cruise control on higher-trim models with full-speed stop-and-go, forward automatic braking, a premium adaptive suspension, heavy-duty cooling, and a sport model.</p>, <p>The 2018 Buick Enclave has a reworked direct-injection 3.6-liter V6 mated to an all-new 9-speed automatic transmission. Buick estimates EPA fuel economy at 18-mpg city, 26-mpg highway and 21 mpg combined on FWD models, while the AWD versions come in at an estimated 17-mpg city, 25-mpg highway and 20 mpg combined. For comparison, the Acura MDX and Infiniti QX60 are rated up to 27 mpg for FWD and 26 mpg for AWD. To help bolster fuel economy, the Enclave is equipped with seamless stop/start technology. The powertrain has a base towing capacity of 1,500 pounds, but a new trailer-towing package that includes additional cooling and other tweaks enables the Enclave to have a tow rating of 5,000 pounds.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Buick Encore delivers upscale features and style in a compact-crossover SUV as attractive to first-time buyers as it is longtime <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/buick/">Buick</a> devotees looking to downsize. Sharing its platform with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/trax/">Chevrolet Trax</a>, the Encore plays in the same segment as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mini/countryman/">Mini Countryman</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> Limited. Some might even compare it to small-luxury-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a>. While interior space is not huge, there’s good legroom front and rear plus a modest cargo area. The Encore’s optional all-wheel drive alleviates winter-road-trip worries, and in good weather helps improve handling on dry pavement. The Encore also recently garnered a top spot on KBB’s Best Compact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">Crossover</a> 5-Year <a alt_o_t="Cost to Own" href="/new-cars/total-cost-of-ownership/">Cost to Own</a> list.</p>, <p>Looking to downsize but still want full-size <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>, comfort and amenities? The 2018 Buick Encore may be exactly what you’re looking for. Excellent fuel-economy figures and loads of high-tech options further bolster a case for this little Buick.</p>, <p>Though priced slightly higher than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/soul/">Kia Soul</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Kona and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a>, most will find the Encore delivers a lot of car for the money. Those needing maximum space in a small-crossover SUV will be happier shopping a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/compass/">Jeep Compass</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018 the compact <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/encore/">Buick Encore</a> SUV gains an ionizing interior air filter, capless fuel fill and HD radio.</p>, <p>Using the best of GM’s global architecture to its advantage, the 2018 Buick Encore delivers a world-class driving experience that belies its small size. The Encore’s European-derived suspension has been adjusted to suit American tastes without giving up much in the way of direct feedback, agile handling and adept cornering. If there’s one weak spot in the Encore’s performance, however, it can be found under the hood. The 1.4-liter Ecotec engine is turbocharged for added get-up-and-go, but once additional passengers start piling in, the little engine begins to bog down. Optional all-wheel drive adds even more weight, but its added traction makes it a must-have for anyone enduring regular run-ins with Old Man Winter. For an additional $900, buyers can upgrade to a slightly more powerful version of the 1.4, but only on the Sport Touring and higher trims. Fuel-economy figures for both engines are near the top of its class.</p>, <p>QUIET TUNING WITH ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION<br/> In keeping with Buick’s exacting standards for interior quiet, the Encore comes with Active Noise Cancellation that uses the car’s speakers to send out sound-cancelling sound waves. Ample insulation and Buick’s Quiet Tuning engineering combine to make the Encore one of the quietest <a alt_o_t="Compact SUVs" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUVs</a> on the road.<br/> <br/> “ACTIVE ON-DEMAND” ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br/> Offering maximum traction in any weather situation, the Encore’s Active On-Demand all-wheel drive works by detecting wheel slip and routing power to the wheel or wheels with the best traction. When not needed, the Encore reverts to front-drive mode which helps maximize fuel economy.<br/> </p>, <p>The interior of Buick’s compact Encore SUV shows significant thought went into both its design and detail. An 8-inch color touch screen moves from atop the dash to the center stack, while the larger gauge cluster includes a 4.2-inch driver-information screen. Whether rendered in cloth and Leatherette or available leather, the cabin offers room for five with a 60/40-split rear bench that accommodates two average-sized adults plus a kid in the center spot. A large hatch provides easy access to its 18.8-cubic-foot cargo bay, which expands to 48.4 cubic feet with the aft seatbacks folded.</p>, <p>From its handsome winged grille and sculpted hood to the stylish 18-inch alloy wheels, the Encore compact SUV for 2018 puts a contemporary spin on each of these elements to create a package that’s skewed toward a more youthful, progressive mind-set. The Encore’s highly sculpted bodywork and a tasteful assortment of bright accent bits are effectively set off by prominent LED-accented projector-beam headlights and LED-infused taillights. Brushed-aluminum faux rear skidplates and a wide wheel/tire package add a bit more aggressive flair to the overall mix.</p>, <p>The well-equipped Encore Preferred has air conditioning, Buick IntelliLink telematics with an 8-inch touch screen, a tilt/telescoping steering column, cruise control, a power driver’s seat, push-button start, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi hotspot and a rearview camera. The Sport Touring gains fog lights and a rear spoiler, while the Encore Preferred II adds dual-zone climate control, remote starting and fog lights and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The Encore Essence adds leather trim, heated front bucket seats/steering wheel, a power passenger seat and LED headlights. The top-line Encore Premium boasts Bose audio, front/rear park assist and Forward Collision Alert/Lane Departure Warning.</p>, <p>Largely prepackaged within its trim hierarchy, Buick’s 2018 Encore does offer several individual extras. All but the base and Preferred trims can be fitted with the more powerful 153-horsepower engine. Other options offered include GPS-enabled navigation system, a power sunroof, an oil-pan heater and 18-inch chrome-alloy wheels as well as the 7-speaker premium Bose Audio system -- which is already included in the Encore Premium.</p>, <p>Every version of the Buick Encore compact-crossover SUV for 2018, whether front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD), shares the same basic powertrain, although higher trims can be upgraded with direct-injection technology for an added 15 horsepower. The engine is GM’s familiar 1.4-liter turbocharged Ecotec 4-cylinder that makes 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque (153 horsepower/177 lb-ft in upgraded). Here, it’s paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission that features manual-style shifting capabilities via a lever-mounted rocker switch on front-drive Encore models. The combination yields respectable acceleration and impressive EPA figures for a vehicle of its type. To complement its mileage-maxing prowess, the engine is designed to run on regular gasoline, not the premium grade required by some of the Encore’s chief rivals.<br>
<br>
 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 (base, Preferred)<br>
 138 horsepower @ 4,900 rpm<br>
 148 lb-ft of torque @ 1,850-4,900 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/33 mpg (FWD), 26/31 mpg (AWD)<br>
<br>
 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 (Opt. Sport Touring, Preferred II, Essence and Premium)<br>
 153 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/33 mpg (FWD), 24/30 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the base 2018 Buick Encore starts around $24,000. Moving up the line, the Encore Preferred opens around $25,360, the Sport Touring at $26,560, the Preferred II at $27,800, the Essence just over $30,000 and finally the Premium at just a hair north of $31,500. AWD will add $1,500, and a fully loaded top-line Encore will hit the street close to $35,000. Although not the lowest priced among competitors, the Encore does become a far more compelling value when you factor in its extensive roster of standard features and low 5-Year Cost to Own. The Encore’s resale values are better than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500l/">Fiat 500L</a>, on par with the Chevrolet Trax but still below the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mini/cooper/">Mini Cooper</a> Countryman, Mazda CX-3, Jeep Renegade and Kia Soul.

[<p>Comfortable and quiet, the new 2018 Buick Envision is perfect for families looking for a premium 5-passenger SUV with an upscale interior and a starting price of around $35,000. Built in China, the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/envision/">Buick Envision</a> is larger than the subcompact <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/encore/">Buick Encore</a>, and competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rdx/">Acura RDX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkc/">Lincoln MKC</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a>. Five trim levels are offered, base, Preferred, Essence, Premium I and Premium II. A 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is standard on the lower trim levels and it makes a respectable 197 horsepower. Front-wheel drive is standard, but all-wheel drive is available for about $2,000. The Premium models get a 252-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter and standard all-wheel drive. Onboard Wi-Fi is standard on all models along with GM’s clever Teen Driver technology.</p>, <p>Buick’s new 2018 Envision is a refined SUV with an upscale interior and room for five. It’s perfect for families looking for a premium SUV with a smooth ride and the highest crash-test scores. The Envision is rated a Top Safety Pick+ by the <a alt_o_t="Insurance" href="/car-insurance/">Insurance</a> Institute for Highway Safety.</p>, <p>There are sportier <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> in the segment. If you’re looking for a <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUV</a> with athletic handling, check out the Audi Q5 and Acura RDX. Porsche’s Macan also offers sports-car-like performance but it costs considerably more. If off-roading is a priority, shop the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a> and Grand Cherokee.</p>, <p>To keep its carpets cleaner, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/buick/">Buick</a> now offers an optional all-weather floor liner in the 2018 Buick Envision. Otherwise, the SUV is unchanged from last year.</p>, <p>This has to be one of the quietest SUVs in this segment. Thanks to smart use of sound-deadening materials and active noise-cancellation technology, the 2018 Buick Envision does a masterful job of isolating its occupants from the harsh outside world. The Envision’s interior is calm and serene with very little wind or road noise, even out on the highway at 80 mph. That lack of intrusion along with the Buick’s upscale interior and smooth ride, provides a true <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> experience. Power is sufficient with the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, but you may want more if you plan to pile in the kids and load the SUV down with a week’s worth of camping equipment. The standard 6-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, but it’s antiquated compared to the 7- and 8-speed units in the Audi Q5. The 252-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, which is standard on the top Premium models, is more satisfying.</p>, <p>TEEN DRIVER TECHNOLOGY<br>
 Families with new drivers will appreciate this clever system which monitors your teen’s driving habits and provides you with updates and alerts. It even allows you to set a speed alert and disables the Envision’s sound system until the occupants have buckled their seatbelts. It’s standard on all trim levels.<br>
<br>
 SAFETY SEAT ALERT<br>
 This unique safety system is standard on the Premium models. It vibrates the driver’s seat bottom cushion to alert the driver of hazards. And it’s directional, vibrating the right seat bottom bolster if the threat is coming from the right or the left bolster if the driver should look left.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Clever packaging of the Buick’s powertrain has flattened its floor, which gives the 2018 Envision more rear-seat legroom and makes this small SUV comfortable for five passengers. Its rear seat also slides forward if you’d like to sacrifice some of that rear-seat legroom to increase cargo volume. The SUV’s climate and audio controls are simple and well laid out, with large knobs and buttons, and the Buick’s well-designed infotainment system is easily controlled through a large 8-inch touch screen. Also, the seats are comfortable and the materials feel premium, although the analog clock on the dash seems like an afterthought.</p>, <p>There’s an understated elegance to the new 2018 Buick Envision. Buick’s designers have created a shape that is handsome, well-proportioned and subtle in its detailing. At first the Envision comes off as overly conservative, maybe even a little plain, but look closer and you’ll find its sculpted sides, wide stance and the intricate curve of its C-pillar. Buick has also kept the chrome to a minimum, limiting the brightwork to the Envision’s shapely grille and a delicate stripe that artfully dissects its clean taillights. We also like the standard power tailgate that has adjustable lift height and hands-free operation.</p>, <p>While the new base model 2018 Envision is more lightly equipped, it's still a lot of premium-compact SUV for the money. Buyers get dual-zone climate control, a power liftgate, tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, and cloth seats with Leatherette trim. It comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 8-way-power front seats with power lumbar and heaters, and an infotainment system that includes an 8-inch color touch screen and 6-speaker audio system, a rearview camera and backup sensors, plus 10 airbags and six months of complimentary OnStar service. Also standard on the base model is the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine powering just the front wheels.</p>, <p>Options are added by working your way up the model ladder. Moving to Preferred lets you choose all-wheel drive (AWD), while Essence models add things like rear-seat climate control, blind-spot monitor, heated rear outboard seats, memory for the front seats, and leather seating surfaces all around. It also offers a heated steering wheel. Step up to Premium I or Premium II and you'll get the turbocharged engine and standard dual-clutch all-wheel drive (AWD), plus rear cross-traffic alert, front parking sensors, lane-keeping assist and forward-collision alert. Premium II models can add a surround-vision camera, automatic braking and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>Two engine choices await 2018 Buick Envision buyers. First is the base engine, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 197 horsepower through a 6-speed automatic transmission to the front or, in Essence models, all four wheels. The Premium and Premium II models both use a 2.0-liter 252-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder. It sends power through a 6-speed automatic and a different AWD system that uses a dual-clutch system for better power delivery. Power from the turbo is more than adequate, if not segment-leading, with negligible lag and impressive torque available at a low rpm. Fuel economy in front-wheel-drive (FWD) models is an EPA estimated 29 mpg on the highway; it's lower in the AWD turbos, which also require premium fuel.<br>
<br>
 2.5-liter inline-4<br>
 197 horsepower @ 6,300 rpm<br>
 192 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/29 mpg (FWD); 21/27 mpg (AWD)<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 252 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br>
 260 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/26 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a base 2018 Buick Envision is around $35,000 when you include the $925 destination charge. Preferred models start about $1,800 higher than that, and Essence models are another $1,900 higher. An all-wheel-drive Envision Essence model will run a little shy of $41,000. If you want turbo power, the Premium model starts a little above $43,500, and the top-line Premium II is just under $46,000. The base prices of lower-end models are in line with many of its rivals, including the Acura RDX, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx50/">Infiniti QX50</a>, and thousands less than the Audi Q5, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a> and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Envision. Also be aware that <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> is not one of the Envision's strong suits, being average at best.</p>]

[<p>All-new just last year, the stylish 2018 Buick LaCrosse is a traditional full-size luxury sedan with a quiet and comfortable interior, standard hybrid power and available all-wheel drive. The new LaCrosse offers a unique mix of in-cabin technology, including onboard Wi-Fi, safety features and luxurious appointments, which makes it a standout in a class that includes the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/es/">Lexus ES</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon/">Toyota Avalon</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/cadenza/">Kia Cadenza</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/maxima/">Nissan Maxima</a>. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/buick/">Buick</a> offers the 2018 LaCrosse, which is its largest and most expensive sedan, in five trim levels: base, Preferred, Essence, Premium and the new top-of-the-line Avenir. Prices start around $30,500 for the base model, which is front-wheel drive and powered by a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in combination with a small electric motor and battery pack. The powertrain delivers 194 horsepower and 35 mpg on the highway. Other models get a 310-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 with standard front- or optional all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a roomy, quiet and comfortable luxury sedan, the new 2018 Buick LaCrosse delivers with an award-winning interior and class-leading in-cabin infotainment technology. Tech features include onboard Wi-Fi hotspot, wireless phone charging, an easy-to-use navigation system as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a hybrid-powered luxury sedan in this class, you may be disappointed in the Buick’s fuel economy. Both the Lexus ES300h and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkz/">Lincoln MKZ</a> Hybrid have significantly higher miles-per-gallon ratings than the LaCrosse in the city and out on the highway.</p>, <p>For 2018, the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/lacrosse/">Buick LaCrosse</a> gets a standard battery pack and small electric motor to improve the fuel efficiency of its 4-cylinder engine. Buick has also created the LaCrosse Avenir, a new top trim level that features exclusive exterior trim, enhanced interior appointments, standard all-wheel drive and a list of advanced safety systems.</p>, <p>Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a big Buick sedan. Soft and quiet, right? Right. But the new 2018 Buick LaCrosse is exceptionally quiet, but it’s not as marshmallow-soft as you might guess if you haven’t been in a Buick in the past 10 years. The Buick is traditional, but it’s not old-fashioned. Instead of overstuffed seats and flaccid suspension tuning, the new LaCrosse delivers Buick-level comfort with a strong body, sophisticated suspension, and sculpted, supportive front seats. In addition to the comfortable highway ride and responsive and confidence-inspiring handling, the LaCrosse delivers plenty of power via its 310-horsepower V6 engine and smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. The new LaCrosse lineup also includes a version with big 20-inch wheels and an active suspension with Touring and Sport modes, but most LaCrosse buyers would do well to stick with the 18-inch wheel setup for superior ride comfort and no practical compromise in driving satisfaction.</p>, <p>TEEN DRIVER TECHNOLOGY<br>
 Parents of new drivers will appreciate this important safety system, which is standard on every 2018 LaCrosse. It sends you updates and alerts about your teen’s habits behind the wheel, allows you to set a speed alert and a max volume limit on the LaCrosse’s audio system. It can even disable the Buick’s sound system until the front-seat occupants buckle their seatbelts.<br>
<br>
SAFETY SEAT ALERT<br>
 Standard on the 2018 Buick LaCrosse Premium, this unique safety system alerts the driver of hazards by vibrating the driver’s-seat bottom cushion. And the warnings are directional; it vibrates the right-seat bottom bolster if the threat is coming from the right or the left bolster if the driver should look left.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You don’t climb into the 2018 Buick LaCrosse, you enter its tranquility. Its door closes with a solid thud, sealing you off from the harsh outside world and into a silent sanctuary of leather, wood and personal entertainment. The Buick’s award-winning interior is built with care and for comfort. Its large seats are supportive, heated and height-adjustable. There are pleasing shapes and uncomplicated controls. The frameless 8-inch touch screen is within easy reach and there’s a tidy collection of buttons and knobs. It’s spacious and the rear seat is wide enough for three with ample legroom, and the Buick’s trunk is large for the class with space for multiple golf bags.</p>, <p>The 2018 Buick LaCrosse is the luxury brand’s flagship sedan, and it’s one of the best-looking Buicks in the company’s 115-year history. With its curvaceous lines, long, low and wide proportions and abundance of chrome trim, the LaCrosse looks like a luxury flagship. It looks important. It looks expensive. It has presence. From its simple grille with its stylish “wing” element set against a dark backdrop, to its fastback roofline and familiar portholes, the LaCrosse is detailed to perfection. HID headlights and LED taillights are standard across the line, with the biggest visual differentiator being the 18-, 19- and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>At its starting sticker price of $30,500, the new 2018 Buick LaCrosse comes well-equipped with standard keyless entry and push-button start, rearview camera and parking sensors, auto on/off headlights, dual-zone auto climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi, OnStar, and Leatherette seat trim. It also gets an 8-inch touch screen, Teen Driver technology, HID headlights, LED daytime-running Lights and LED taillights, Bluetooth, an 8-speaker audio system, remote start, a split fold-down rear seat, power front seats with adjustable lumbar, a tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, heated outside mirrors, 18-inch wheels and tires and front-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Some of the appealing extras on the long options sheet for the new Buick LaCrosse include heated/ventilated/massaging front seats, perforated leather upholstery, a sunroof, navigation, wireless phone charging, a heated steering wheel, a power rear sunshade, auto-dimming-outside mirrors and a head-up display. Also on offer is a long list of driver-assistance and safety technologies, like blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control, automatic park assist, front pedestrian detection and automatic braking. All-wheel drive is also available, as are larger 19- and 20-inch wheels and a 310-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine backed by a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>For 2018, the new Buick LaCrosse is powered by a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in combination with a small electric motor and battery pack. The powertrain delivers 194 horsepower and 35 mpg on the highway. It’s paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. However, most trim levels get a sophisticated new 310-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 engine with direct injection, cylinder deactivation, and auto stop/start technologies. Combined with a new 8-speed automatic transmission the Buick’s V6 delivers strong acceleration, and it’s available with front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD). The 4-cylinder is FWD only.<br>

</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Buick LaCrosse starts at around $30,500 MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price, including destination) and tops out at over $55,000 for a LaCrosse Avenir with all the fixin’s. Although the base LaCrosse is appealing and a high value at its low starting price, moving up to the Preferred, Essence or Premium adds features as well as the more powerful engine. Also, AWD, which costs an additional $2,200, is only available on V6 models and it’s a worthwhile option if you live where the white stuff falls from the sky. The bottom half of that wide range is in line with Toyota Avalon pricing, while the top half puts it in Lexus ES territory as well as other sedans from European luxury automakers like <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> and Mercedes-Benz. The LaCrosse can be an appealing alternative to any of those vehicles, but shoppers should keep in mind that Toyota, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> and some of the European brands have a resale-value advantage over the Buick.

The 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/regal/">Buick Regal</a> is no longer a sedan per se, but a “Sportback.” Instead of a trunk, it has a liftgate and large hatch. The result is a Regal with sleek exterior styling yet more practicality. The new Buick Regal Sportback’s flexibility is further heightened with optional all-wheel drive. This 6th-generation Regal comes with a satisfying turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, and more punch can be had in the V6-powered Regal GS. For years the Regal has been an outlier among premium <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, but this all-new version packs style and practicality, all at a lower price than rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/stinger/">Kia Stinger</a> and Audi A5 Sportback.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a premium alternative to a mainstream sedan like a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord/">Honda Accord</a>, or seek the style and flexibility of a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> fastback like the Audi A5 Sportback at a lower price, the 2018 Buick Regal hits the mark with a starting price under $26,000.</p>, <p>With its front-drive architecture, the standard Regal Sportback isn’t as inherently athletic as rear-drive rivals like the Kia Stinger or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a> Gran <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a>. Brand-wise, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/buick/">Buick</a> still straddles the mainstream and luxury markets, and continues to fight perceptions of its past, elderly-embraced vehicles.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/buick/regal%20sportback/2018/">2018 Buick Regal Sportback</a> and its higher-power GS variant are all-new. While it looks like a sleek sedan, the Sportback is secretly a cargo-swallowing 5-door liftback. Another model, the Regal TourX, has a similar name but a taller, crossover-SUV-like body. It is a separate model and has its own review.</p>, <p>Because it’s based on the Opel Insignia, the new Regal is made in Germany, which technically makes this a premium European car. Still, the Buick has been tuned for the American market, which means it’s less <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and more, well, Buick. That isn’t a slight. New Buicks such as this are competently athletic, yet still compliant. The new Regal Sportback will tolerate being thrown into corners, but doesn’t exactly beg you for more. If sporty handling is your thing, you’ll probably want to wait for the Regal GS. What this will serve up is competent power from its 250-horsepower engine, and the comfort and quiet manners expected in a Buick. As a road-tripping car or grand touring vessel, we’d take one any day. Like other new GM vehicles, the 2018 Regal Sportback has a start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle, such as stoplights. The system can’t be turned off, but it’s at least smooth enough to not be bothersome. Speaking of smooth and not bothersome, we also applaud the Buick’s 9-speed automatic transmission. Unlike some we’ve tried, it proved quick and refined.</p>, <p>HUGE REAR HATCH<br/> Why do those in the know love <a alt_o_t="Hatchbacks" href="/hatchback/">hatchbacks</a>? Cargo space without compromise. Behind the Regal Sportback’s rear seats is 31.5 cubic feet of space -- about twice that of a comparable trunk. With seats folded, there’s over 60 cubic feet -- like that of an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>.<br/> <br/> ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br/> Another compelling way the Regal Sportback sets itself apart from, say, a really nice <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry/">Toyota Camry</a> is with all-wheel drive. Buick’s traction-enhancing system is a good one, too, and we’d highly recommend it if you live in a foul-weather state.<br/> </p>, <p>The Regal’s 5-passenger interior ranges from respectable to really nice, depending on trim. Lower trims make do with cloth seats, and on the lowest trim you’re stuck with manual adjustments. All models have sun visors that don’t slide. Those detractors aside, even the least-expensive Regal Sportback boasts a contemporary dash layout with a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system (or an 8-inch screen in better-equipped models). The best thing about the Regal’s interior is its room for cargo and humans. Rear-seat space is good, and rear-cargo space is even better. As we noted in Favorite Features, if you fold the rear seats you’ll have SUV-like cargo space. We fit a full-size bicycle in the hatch without having to remove its front wheel.</p>, <p>The Regal Sportback deserves praise for its flexible and practical interior. That it doesn’t come at the expense of a stylish exterior is just as impressive. In fact, if you didn’t know about the upward-lifting rear hatch door, you probably wouldn’t even know the Sportback had one. Seen in profile, Buick’s new Sportback looks more like a sleek sedan. With its stately grille, athletic stance and dapper tail, we don’t think it’s too much to say this is the best-looking Regal that Buick has ever made.</p>, <p>The new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/regal%20sportback/">Buick Regal Sportback</a> comes in four major trims: base, Preferred, Preferred II and Essence. The lowest-priced version still comes with a turbocharged engine, 6-way manual-adjust driver seat, rearview camera and a trial of OnStar 4G LTE connectivity with in-car Wi-Fi. The basic infotainment system consists of a 7-inch touch-screen display with AM/FM radio, Bluetooth and USB input. We’d suggest stepping up to at least the Preferred model, which adds power front seats, auto-dimming rearview mirror and the ability to add popular features like Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration.</p>, <p>Preferred II models add dual-zone climate control, 18-inch wheels, heated steering wheel, 40/20/40-split rear seat, remote start, 8-inch infotainment screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and ambient interior lighting. Crucial for cold-weather states, you’ll also have to select this model or higher if you want all-wheel drive. The topline Buick Regal Sportback Essence trim includes leather interior and heated front seats. Options include a moonroof, parking sensors, Bose premium audio system and navigation. Among the optional safety and driver-assistance systems are blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision alert and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The standard Buick Regal Sportback uses a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that makes a generous 250 horsepower. In front-wheel-drive (FWD) form, the engine is good for 260 lb-ft of torque, while all-wheel-drive (AWD) models boost that number to 295. FWD models use a 9-speed automatic transmission, and AWD models have an 8-speed. The sportier and more powerful Buick Regal GS has a 3.6-liter V6 good for 310 horsepower. All Regal GS models are all-wheel drive, and they use a 9-speed automatic transmission. All models have an engine start/stop that cuts power at idle to save fuel. Speaking of, a FWD model earns up to 32 mpg.<br>

That’s a tempting price, and one that puts this premium brand within easy reach of sedans from mainstream brands. That said, we suggest stepping up to at least a Preferred model, starting at $28,590, as it’s a more well-rounded package offering more options. If you want an AWD Buick Regal Sportback, you’ll have to step up to a Preferred II trim ($30,655), then add another $1,950. The topline Essence model debuts at $32,655 and can nudge $40,000 with options. The higher-powered, performance-oriented Buick Regal GS begins just under $40,000 and can add a few thousand from there. At these prices, the Buick Regal Sportback easily undercuts even its mainstream rival the Kia Stinger, which starts around $33,000, and certainly luxury sportbacks like the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe and Audi A5 Sportback, each of which starts well over $40,000. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As this is an all-new model, the Buick Regal Sportback’s resale value is still unknown at this time.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Regal TourX is part of Buick’s overhauled midsize lineup that’s looking to fill in some white spaces in the market. Ostensibly an all-wheel-drive station wagon (though <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/buick/">Buick</a> execs are loathe to characterize it as a wagon), the Regal TourX is inspired by European competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v60/">Volvo V60</a> Cross Country and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/allroad/">Audi Allroad</a>. And it is paired in the division’s lineup with the Regal Sportback, which is a liftback version of the traditional 4-door sedan. Both are built in Germany by the former GM unit Opel, which is now a part of the French PSA Group. By stressing high style and utility, Buick is looking to further differentiate its models as it looks to offer premium vehicles above the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> lineup without cutting into <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> territory staked out by <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>.</p>, <p>In the market for something with the utility of a crossover SUV coupled with much sleeker, car-inspired styling? Those with active lifestyles will find this vehicle hits a sweet spot with its all-wheel-drive, back-road agility and capability to carry a lot of gear.</p>, <p>If off-roading is on your to-do list, the new Regal TourX is not for you. Also, if you’re looking for pure wagon styling like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v90/">Volvo V90</a>, there’s no way to ditch the black composite fender arches that say “SUV wannabe.”</p>, <p>Like the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/buick/regal%20sportback/2018/">2018 Buick Regal Sportback</a>, the TourX is all-new for 2018 and features standard all-wheel drive, a powerful yet efficient 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with an 8-speed automatic, class-leading cargo space and a decidedly European take on design. It is also the first wagon to be offered by Buick in two decades.</p>, <p>If you’ve driven the current crop of Buicks and have some experience behind the wheel of European <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, you’ll feel right at home in the TourX. With a long 111.4-inch wheelbase, the TourX has a supple, stable ride thanks to its independent suspension that includes a 5-link rear setup. It’s nimble without being harsh. The steering has a direct feel that’s precise and nicely weighted. It’s not a sports sedan by any means, but it’s no land yacht either in the mode of Buick’s last wagon, the Roadmaster. Best of all is Buick’s Quiet Tuning, which provides a serene cabin environment without making you feel as if you’re detached from the car. The use of laminated glass, specific insulation and even tires that incorporate a foam belt take noise, vibration and harshness levels down to extremely low levels. The quiet coupled with firm, supportive seating will go a long way in reducing fatigue on road trips. Although this is a big car, the 2.0-liter turbo 4-cylinder is tuned to deliver 250 horsepower and a whopping 295 lb-ft of torque, enabling the 3,708-pound TourX to feel relatively light on its feet. The 8-speed transmission shifts seamlessly, and the car is equipped with an equally smooth stop/start system that helps save fuel without being annoying.</p>, <p>CARGO CAPACITY<br>
 The TourX has a generous 196.3-inch overall length (3.4 inches more than the Sportback), which translates to 32.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. That area expands to 73.5 cubic feet when the back seat is folded down. As an added bonus, there are plenty of tie-downs in the cargo area to help secure whatever you are hauling.<br>
<br>
 ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
 As the X in TourX implies, this wagon comes with all-wheel drive as standard on all trim levels. Equipped with dual clutch packs on the rear axle, the TourX can deliver torque to the wheel with the most grip, which adds to its ability to take on unpaved two-tracks and slippery surfaces.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Buick does premium well, and it’s reflected by the quality and design of the interior. There are plenty of soft-touch surfaces, leather seating on higher trim levels and a clean, well-organized design. The TourX has a roomy cabin that seats five passengers comfortably. There’s nothing fussy about the controls including a gearshift lever (seemingly a rarity in this day of rotary dials and push buttons), plenty of knobs and analog switches, supplemented by steering-wheel controls and a large 7-inch infotainment touch screen with sharp graphics. Top-line Essence models benefit from an 8-inch display. In front of the driver are traditional analog gauges flanking a center driver-information screen. The long wheelbase contributes to plenty of room front and rear, and the wagon body style provides cargo carrying capability on par with most crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Regal TourX is a handsome vehicle with flowing lines and a sleek rake to the roof that give it a far sportier look than even coupe-inspired SUVs. Chrome accents around the daylight opening and brightwork on the roof rails (which dip down and through the rear taillights) give the TourX a decidedly upscale appearance. The crossover bits, which include the black composite wheel-arch flares, the lower rockers and front and rear faux skidplates do give the TourX a muscular appearance. If that’s your thing, get either white or red body color to make those elements stand out. If you want a subtler look that emphasizes the sleek wagon profile, go with a darker hue on the exterior.</p>, <p>Buick’s new Regal TourX comes in three major trims: base, Preferred and Essence. All models come equipped with push-button start, keyless entry, fog lights, 18-inch alloy wheels and all-wheel drive. Other standard features across the range include Apply CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, a Bose premium sound system, a rearview camera and active-noise cancellation. A cool safety feature on all TourX models is an active-hood system that between speeds of 16 and 30 mph will lift the rear of the hood up to four inches if it senses that the car is about to hit a pedestrian. The raised hood acts as a relatively soft buffer between the person and harder engine parts.</p>, <p>Preferred models have an 8-way-power driver’s seat, auto-dimming mirror, 3-spoke steering wheel and sill plates. The Essence comes with dual-zone climate control, heated seats and steering wheel, remote start, and hands-free power liftgate. A Sights and Sound package that lists for $1,095 includes navigation, premium sound system and HD radio. A $1,725 Driver Confidence package, available on Preferred and Essence models, includes wireless charging, LED headlights with cornering and self-leveling features, rear park assist, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-change alert with blind-spot warnings, seat and mirror memory settings, driver 4-way-power lumbar support, and outside heated mirrors.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/regal%20tourx/">Buick Regal TourX</a> uses a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that makes 250 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque delivered through an 8-speed automatic transmission to an all-wheel-drive system. All models have an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle to save fuel. The Regal TourX has an EPA combined mileage rating of 24 mpg.<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 250 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 295 lb-ft of torque @ 3,000-4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/29 mpg</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/buick/regal%20tourx/2018/">2018 Buick Regal TourX</a> starts with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $29,995 including delivery.

The Preferred model comes in at $33,595, but in reality, the top-line Essence with a starting price of $35,995 represents a pretty good deal for all the extra equipment that comes with the range topper. Add in the two option packages for the infotainment system and driver assists and a fully loaded 2018 Buick Regal TourX comes in at just under $40,000. That’s a lot of car for the money.

[<p>The 2018 ATS is the gateway into Cadillac, representing the American luxury brand's least expensive model. Available as a sedan or coupe, the 2018 Cadillac ATS competes with popular entry-level executive cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4 and Lexus IS. While those rivals are more established and better known, the Cadillac ATS has done an admirable job of not only matching their talent, but in some instances beating them at their own game. The Cadillac's standard engine, for example, is more powerful than those of its rivals, while its sub-$36,000 starting price slots in below most. Far pricier and far more powerful is <a href="https://www.kbb.com/cadillac/ats-v/2018/">the 2018 Cadillac ATS-V, a BMW M fighter that we review separately</a>.</p>, <p>If you're looking for an American-luxury alternative to the more familiar German and Japanese nameplates, check out the 2018 ATS. In addition to bringing more power and features at a lower price than rivals, it does so with standout looks and impressive technology.</p>, <p>While the Cadillac ATS can match or beat rivals in the performance and features department, its badge may not have the same appeal as that of a Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, BMW or Audi. With the exception of Lexus, those competitors also offer convertible variants of their entry-level luxury cars.</p>, <p>Only minor changes are in store for the 2018 Cadillac ATS lineup. Among them is an update to the Cadillac-user-experience (CUE) infotainment system that, in addition to featuring CarPlay and Android Auto, has a more intuitive layout. The ATS also receives GM's Rear Seat Reminder technology.</p>, <p>When ATS dropped the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder last year that formerly served as its base engine, it said adios to one of this model's weakest links. Now standard is a more invigorating turbocharged 4-cylinder that enables this small Cadillac to hit 60 mph in the mid 5-second range while still being quite efficient. Unlike more and more rivals, you can still get a manual transmission, and it's a crisp one that enthusiasts will enjoy. The V6 provides slightly smoother acceleration, but we think the 4-cylinder is the better choice, given the V6's added cost. And while you may equate Cadillac with comfort, the ATS' suspension is stiffer, befitting its sporty ambitions. The Cadillac's 8-speed automatic transmission is fluid and fast, and though its steering isn't quite as precise as that of a BMW's, its feedback is still credible. We really like the magnetic-ride-control feature, but it's offered only on top-end Premium Performance trims.</p>, <p>VALUE FOR THE MONEY<br>
Unlike some rivals, even the least expensive Cadillac ATS sedan comes out the gate filled with a strong engine and a long list of amenities. From its standard CarPlay/Android Auto integration and Bose audio system to its Brembo brakes and built-in 4G LTE with Wi-Fi, the Cadillac ATS is an impressive value.<br>
<br>
STYLISTIC COUPE<br>
The 2018 ATS Coupe carries its own sense of style and athleticism. It's the latest in a line of Cadillac coupes that look dazzling, and in the ATS' case, its design looks far more expensive than its sub-$40,000 price tag.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Whether sedan or coupe, the 2018 Cadillac ATS has a sophisticated, well-appointed interior. Leather seating is standard in most models, while base trims use faux Leatherette. Available wood or carbon-fiber trim also makes the ATS look and feel like a luxury car. Front-seat legroom is adult-sized, but headroom can get cramped with the sunroof. Rear-seat legroom is tight in the 5-passenger sedan, and more so in the 4-passenger coupe. The available CUE touch-screen system looks sleek, but some of its hard-touch controls can be finicky to operate, especially when moving. Rear visibility in the coupe is compromised from the sloping roof.</p>, <p>The Cadillac ATS' angular bodywork and elongated, LED-infused headlight treatments give it an edge. With the exception of those boomerang headlights, our eyes think it all works pretty well. The 2018 Cadillac ATS Coupe has the same 109.3-inch wheelbase as the sedan, but is slightly wider, lower and longer. Most trims of the ATS sedan roll on standard 17-inch wheels, while 18-inch wheels come on the coupe version and on the top trim of the sedan. A variety of 19-inch wheels is also available.</p>, <p>As noted in Favorite Features, even the least expensive ATS is surprisingly well equipped. Included are power front seats, Brembo performance front brakes, dual-zone automatic climate control, Qi wireless-charging phone cradle and GM's OnStar communications system with 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi (a subscription is required after a 3-month trial). Cadillac's CUE infotainment system bundles 8-inch touch screen, Bose premium audio system and Apple CarPlay and Android integration. Stepping to the Luxury trim adds leather interior, heated front seats and steering wheel, 60/40-split folding rear seats, front and rear parking sensors, navigation, and universal-garage remote.</p>, <p>Continuing the climb to the Premium Luxury trim brings the V6 engine, sunroof, high-intensity headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers and active safety features like blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist and forward-collision alert. The Driver Awareness Package that comes on this trim will literally vibrate the seat to warn you of dangers like being too close to an object when parking. Top-line Premium Performance models add a limited-slip differential, head-up display, performance tires, magnetic-ride control and performance suspension. Optional is a system that can automatically apply the brakes in both forward and reverse if a collision seems imminent, and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac ATS compact-luxury sedan and coupe offer a choice of two engines. The two lower trims, simply called ATS and Luxury, come with an excellent 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder good for 272 horsepower and a stout 295 lb-ft of torque. The two higher trims, called Premium Luxury and Premium Performance, have a standard 3.6-liter V6 good for 335 horsepower and 285 lb-ft of torque. All ATS models have rear-wheel drive (RWD) as standard, with all-wheel drive (AWD) optional. If you want a manual transmission, it's found only on 4-cylinder rear-drive models. The rest get a smooth 8-speed automatic. Of course, if you want a seriously high-performance ATS, you can step up to the ATS-V (reviewed separately) with its twin-turbo 3.6-liter V6 good for 464 horsepower.<b><br>

The ATS Coupe starts a few thousand higher. At the high end of the spectrum, a 2018 ATS can reach the mid-$50,000 range. A base ATS Sedan is in line with rivals like the Audi A4 and Infiniti Q50, and below others like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Lexus IS. The Acura TLX starts lower, as does the Volvo S60. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Cadillac ATS' resale value is expected to be below average, and far below that of the Lexus IS and Audi A4.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/cadillac/ats-v/2018
[<p>The 2018 Cadillac ATS-V is the twin-turbocharged alter-ego of the standard ATS sedan and coupe (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/cadillac/ats/2018/">see separate review</a>). Building on the foundation of that already-impressive compact-luxury car, Cadillac's go-fast team injects the ATS-V with a 464-horsepower V6 engine and track-ready hardware. The recipe is a good one, resulting in a high-performance sedan and coupe that match or exceed numbers put up by the BMW M3 and Mercedes-AMG C 63, all while coming in at a lower price. Keep in mind that cost is relative here, as the ATS-V's roughly $62,000 starting price is about $26,000 more than a basic ATS. That money buys a lot of performance and premium amenities, if not the instant cred that comes with the better-known models from its German rivals.</p>, <p>If you want an American alternative to high-performance luxury sedans and coupes like the BMW M3/M4, Mercedes-AMG C 63 and Audi RS5, the 2018 ATS-V is where it's at. Additionally, it packs more power and is faster than BMW's fabled M, all at a lower starting price.</p>, <p>While the Cadillac has no problem in the power department, some buyers --especially younger ones -- may not think the brand is as prestigious as those of its European rivals. Unlike the Infiniti Q50/Q60 Red Sport and upcoming 2018 Audi RS5, the ATS-V is rear-drive only, with no option for all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Only minor updates are in store for the 2018 Cadillac ATS-V sedan and coupe. Among them are an updated Cadillac-user-experience (CUE) infotainment system and a new exterior paint color: Satin Steel Metallic.</p>, <p>The Cadillac ATS-V truly is "track-ready," and much of our experience in this high-performance Cadillac happened in just such a setting. With no speed limits, we tasted just what the ATS-V can do, and it's very, very good at its limits. With a 0-60-mph time of 3.8 seconds, the ATS-v is a hair quicker than a BMW M3. More significantly, the Cadillac's ATS-V's 8-speed automatic transmission is more refined than the BMW's 7-speed twin-clutch. A 6-speed manual is the standard operating system, and it's crisp and has a far lighter clutch pedal than that of the old CTS-V. A range of traction settings keeps the car in check or will let you slide to your heart's content, depending on your skill level. On regular roads, the ATS-V is noticeably stiffer than the standard ATS, but not punishing. We recommend the "Touring" setting, which optimizes the magnetic-ride control for more comfort.</p>, <p>BRAGGING RIGHTS<br>
You probably won't ever go 189 mph in your Cadillac ATS-V, and not every start needs to be a 0-60-mph sprint of 3.8 seconds, but the fact that both those numbers are better than a BMW M3 means you can brag all day long. Another reason: 464 horsepower vs. 425.<br>
<br>
PERFORMANCE DATA RECORDER<br>
Part gee-whiz technology, part track trainer, this optional system records video of your driving sessions plus data points such as speed, how many g's you pulled in that turn and more. If you're particularly proud of a run, you can even share it with friends.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The ATS-V sedan and coupe share the same basic layout as the standard ATS models, with the sedan configured for a total of five passengers and the coupe having room for four. The rear seats of both are a bit cramped, even more so in the coupe. Up front are two well-bolstered seats. Optional are Recaro performance seats that further envelop. The ATS-V's infotainment and climate systems rely on a combination of touch-screen and touch-sensitive sliding controls. The latter can be touchy (no pun intended) in their operation. At 10.4 cubic feet, the ATS-V's trunk is on the small side.</p>, <p>Cadillac’s ATS-V shares its angular and muscular profile with the standard ATS, but with a little training it's easy to tell this high-performance model apart. The hood has a prominent bulge and vent, and the rear sports quad-exhaust housings. The ATS-V is also slightly wider and longer. The 2018 ATS-V coupe has two fewer doors and even more aggressive styling. We're quite fond of its athletic stance on the outside, but in the driver's seat beware of blind spots due to limited visibility. Fun fact: To achieve a 50/50 weight balance, the ATS-V's hood is made from lightweight carbon fiber.</p>, <p>As it already sits atop the ATS food chain, the ATS-V high-performance sedan and coupe come well-equipped out the gate. Included in their $60,000-plus price tags is all that high-performance hardware, plus leather interior, 18-way-power front seats, power-adjustable steering column, and dual-zone climate control. The Cadillac offers a robust infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen, Bose premium audio and the OnStar communications system with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi capability (includes a 3-month trial). This latest Cadillac-user-experience system has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration built-in, and a trio of USB ports to keep devices juiced.</p>, <p>Aside from the 8-speed automatic transmission with magnesium paddle shifters and Recaro seats, most major options for the Cadillac ATS-V are bundled into packages. The Luxury package includes navigation, split-folding rear seats, universal garage remote and high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights. Another package bundles safety features like forward-collision warning, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and more. If you're fond of carbon fiber and have an extra $5,000, you can add the light but strong material to the rear, front splitter and other portions of the ATS-V. A sunroof is available, ditto a head-up display and even higher-end Bose audio system.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac ATS-V Sedan and Coupe use a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V6 that generates an impressive 464 horsepower. The ATS-V high-performance cars are rear-wheel drive (RWD) only and come with a 6-speed manual transmission or optional 8-speed automatic. They also feature an electronic limited-slip differential and high-performance Brembo brake calipers. Premium unleaded gasoline is recommended.<br>

ATS-V coupe models start higher at just over $64,000. If you want an automatic transmission, you'll have to add another $2,000 to these prices. At its starting price, the Cadillac ATS-V slightly undercuts rivals like the BMW M3 sedan and M4 coupe, and the Mercedes-AMG C 63. The coupe-only Lexus RC F is right in line with the ATS-V coupe. Red Sport versions of the Infiniti Q50 sedan/Q60 coupe start about $10,000 less than their ATS-V counterparts, but pack "only" 400 horsepower. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what buyers in your area paid for their ATS-V. The Cadillac ATS-V's resale value is expected to fare better than the standard ATS, but still trail that of rivals like BMW M models, and Lexus RC F and Mercedes-AMG C 63.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac CT6 aims to convince you that Caddy can beat <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> heavyweights like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/7%20series/">BMW 7 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/ls/">Lexus LS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a8/">Audi A8</a> at their own game. Draping the uniquely American styling language already established for CTS and ATS models on its low, wide body, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> has packed the 2018 CT6 with luxury and technology. The interior's sumptuousness exceeds any other Cadillac, there's state-of-the-art technology, and the drivetrains -- including a twin-turbo V6, rear- or all-wheel drive, and even a plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> -- complement the sharp handling and luxurious ride. Yet, like its competition, the 2018 Cadillac CT6 is more than just the sum of its parts. This car feels special, offering a unique driving experience that matches, and in some ways surpasses, its competitors.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ct6/">Cadillac CT6</a> is the best interpretation yet of Caddy's Art and Science design language, and its uniquely American interior sacrifices no luxury to its European and Japanese competitors. The high-tech features will capture the attention of younger buyers, and its turbocharged engines and excellent handling will win over enthusiasts.</p>, <p>There's no long-wheelbase version, and while the back seat is available with an executive package, the CT6 is shorter than many rivals. There's also no V8 available, and while the CT6 is a very nice luxury sedan, Cadillac still needs to rebuild its brand equity to <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> levels.</p>, <p>After last year's introduction of the plug-in hybrid, only modest changes are in store for the 2018 Cadillac CT6. Among new colors and trim, the Auto Parking Assist now allows hands- and feet-off automatic parking. Additionally, a new entertainment system package bundles the rear-seat entertainment system and the excellent Panaray audio system.</p>, <p>Cadillac has established enviable weight-saving voodoo that must flummox its rivals. The 2018 CT6, for example, is notably larger than the CTS, yet it weighs only 17 pounds more, and is nearly 1,000 pounds lighter than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/s-class/">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a> or BMW 7 Series. Combine this weight-saving advantage with a rigid structure, excellent engines and advanced suspension setup, and the CT6 moves with an agility that you’ll need to experience to believe. Even the base, rear-wheel-drive (RWD) CT6 with the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder is an absolute joy to drive. Toss in all-wheel drive (AWD), the 404-horsepower turbo V6 and the Active Chassis Package with 4-wheel steering, and you’ll get a car equally at home on the Nurburgring as it is the 405 Freeway. Yet when you're just cruising, the CT6 is just as enjoyable; with a comfortable ride and outstanding sound system, the Cadillac CT6 proves its luxury game is just as strong.</p>, <p>BOSE PANARAY AUDIO SYSTEM<br>
If you consider yourself an audiophile, a music enthusiast, or if you just have functioning ears, you'll appreciate the Bose Panaray audio system. Bose places 34 small speakers strategically through the cabin, and uses a processor from its high-end home-entertainment systems for crisp highs, deep bass and seemingly limitless volume.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>ACTIVE CHASSIS PACKAGE<br>
Cadillac's Magnetic Ride Control is already a yardstick for other active-suspension technologies, yet by combining it with the on-demand all-wheel-drive system and 4-wheel steering, the Active Chassis Package offered on V6-powered trims and standard on the Platinum Hybrid takes the stability game to a whole new level.<br>
</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Cadillac's 2018 CT6 offers a uniquely styled interior, distinct from its German and Japanese rivals, yet boasting the tasteful blend of wood, fine leather, and metallic and carbon-fiber trim expected in a car in this class. The 8.0-inch configurable instrument cluster on lower-end models gets replaced by a 12-inch screen in Premium Luxury and Platinum models, which combines with the standard 10.2-inch CUE touch-screen infotainment system to give the CT6 an oh-so-modern "glass cockpit." The comfortably supportive front seats are matched by an equally accommodating rear bench that offers an "executive" option, complete with recline and massage functions.</p>, <p>Cadillac calls its current design language "Art and Science," and it's a uniquely American interpretation of universal luxury themes. The long hood implies -- correctly -- a powerful rear-wheel-drive sedan, and the crisply tailored aluminum body shows off chiseled lines and an expressive face. The Platinum model gets a unique grille, but all CT6 models get LED headlights, framed by vertical LED light blades; in back are vertical LED taillights. Beyond model-specific 18-inch, 19-inch and 20-inch alloy wheels, trim grades are largely differentiated by detail touches like front cornering lights and illuminated door handles.</p>, <p>The lowest-end 2018 Cadillac CT6 comes with an excellent 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels. It also comes with leather upholstery, wood trim, and 14-way-power front seats. The newest version of Cadillac's CUE infotainment system includes Bose audio, active noise cancellation and OnStar with 4G LTE. Move up to the Luxury/Premium Luxury models and you'll add enhancements like better leather, surround-sound audio, a wide-angle screen that replaces the rearview mirror, concierge lighting and a hands-free power trunk. The top-end Platinum models include the Bose Panaray audio system, Night Vision, digital instrumentation, quad-zone climate control, and Active Chassis with 4-wheel steering.</p>, <p>In addition to the 3.6-liter V6 engine and AWD, base CT6 buyers can order a Driver Awareness and Convenience Package with active/passive safety features, embedded navigation and a panoramic sunroof. A new Enhanced Entertainment package on Luxury/Premium Luxury models bundles the Bose Panaray audio system and rear-seat package. Other options include the Enhanced Vision and Comfort Package, which adds the rear-camera mirror, panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats/heated rear seats, and the Active Chassis Package. A Driver Assistance package for the Premium Luxury model adds adaptive cruise, front and rear auto-braking, and infrared night vision. The CT6 Platinum just gets everything.</p>, <p>If you want gasoline-only, you have three choices in the 2018 Cadillac CT6, all of which come with an 8-speed automatic transmission. There's the base 265-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder in rear-drive only, the 335-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 or the twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 with 404 horsepower. Both V6 models are available with all-wheel drive. New this year is a hybrid powertrain that uses the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder plus a pair of 100-horsepower <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motors for a peak output of 335 horsepower and 432 lb-ft of torque.

The Luxury model starts at a bit over $62,000, while the Premium Luxury comes in around $66,300; both come with the 3.6-liter V6. The top-line Platinum starts at about $85,300, or $89,300 if you want the twin-turbo V6 (pro-tip: spring for the engine). Add options and you're looking at more than $90,000 for a loaded Platinum with the twin-turbo, but we have to say, it's worth it. Check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what the CT6 goes for in your neighborhood, and note that the CT6 beats the Audi A8 L 3.0T, equals the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class, and loses to the Lexus LS at resale time.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS is the sole domestic sedan capable of going head-to-head with the best from German and Japanese luxury automakers. Yet it's not a copy of those cars. Instead, it combines their strengths -- powerful engines, sharp handling and luxurious interiors -- with a uniquely American flavor. It's a combination that outpaces the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a>, and even fills the rearview mirrors of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a>. From the base model and its 4-cylinder engine to <a href="https://www.kbb.com/cadillac/cts-v/2018/">the mighty CTS-V (reviewed separately)</a>, the CTS lineup brims with luxury and technology, offering a nice balance of features, power, fuel economy and price. The range-topping 640-horsepower CTS-V takes the super-sedan fight straight to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m5/">BMW M5</a> and Mercedes-AMG E 63, but is covered separately.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS equals -- and in some cases surpasses -- its European and Japanese rivals. If you want your luxury to be uniquely red, white and blue, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/cts/">Cadillac CTS</a> is the way to go.</p>, <p>While the CTS has narrowed the gap, it doesn't have the same cachet as sedans from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>. If you want a wagon or coupe you're out of luck, and if you're looking for a smoother ride, you might want to check out the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/es/">Lexus ES</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkz/">Lincoln MKZ</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS is largely carryover. There's a new color, a panoramic sunroof is now available on V-Sport models, and there's an available automatic heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>The Cadillac CTS is based on the much smaller ATS sedan, yet despite the added size and weight, it feels unaffected. The agile handling inspires confidence, and conveys the correct impression that the CTS weighs less than many of its competitors. Opt for <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>'s Magnetic Ride Control and you can select how smooth the ride should be, or how glue-like you want it to stick to the pavement by controlling body lean and sway. While we prefer rear-wheel drive for fun, there's no denying the available all-wheel-drive system expands the all-weather capabilities of the CTS. You'd think the base 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder would be underwhelming, but the reality is it offers surprising acceleration and slightly better economy than the standard 3.6-liter V6.</p>, <p>HIGH-TECH OFFERINGS<br>
 Cadillac doesn't skimp on technology in the 2018 CTS. In addition to the CUE infotainment system, there's Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The CTS also features a Wi-Fi hotspot, wireless phone charging, and even a system to monitor your teen's driving habits.<br>
<br>
 CTS EQUITY<br>
 Back in 2002, the then-new Cadillac CTS carried the return of GM's luxury division on its back with style, winning comparison tests between it and some of its best rivals from Europe. Cadillac has been very aware of -- and successfully nurtured -- this luxury sedan's reputation.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Cadillac’s CTS interior features premium materials, world-class assembly quality and high-tech touches. Virtually everything is soft-touch and covered in leather, although base models get Leatherette (as do base models from Europe). The inviting ambiance is also as uniquely American as the exterior. The same is true for the rear seat, but be warned: There's a shortage of legroom compared to its primary rivals. Cadillac's CUE entertainment system has improved remarkably over the years, and its quick response and seamless integration with iPhones and Android devices are second to one. Our favorite over-the-top touch: a power sliding cover for the cup holders.</p>, <p>The sharp creases, rippled hood and prominently geometric grille on the 2018 Cadillac CTS stand in sharp contrast -- literally -- to the softer curves of its European rivals. It stands out for all the right reasons, looking distinctive and luxurious, but also uniquely American. Cool exterior details include grille shutters that pragmatically close to help improve aerodynamics and fuel economy, and we particularly like the seamless aluminum trim around the side windows. At the rear, all CTS sedans feature dual-exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>There are five trim levels for the 2018 Cadillac CTS sedan: base, Luxury, Premium Luxury, V-Sport and V-Sport Premium Luxury. The base model comes standard with the 2.0-liter turbo engine connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Also standard are things that are optional on many competitors, such as keyless entry, push-button start, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a solid-sounding 11-speaker Bose audio system with three USB inputs. CUE also doubles as a screen for the rearview camera, there's dual-zone climate control, and OnStar with 4G LTE with built-in Wi-Fi, and wireless charging for phones that can use it.</p>, <p>A variety of upgrades awaits 2018 Cadillac CTS buyers. You can add navigation, leather seating with heated and ventilated fronts, adaptive cruise control, and a fully electronic instrument display to replace the standard needles-and-dials. There's also 3-zone automatic climate control, different styles of wood trim, adaptive cruise control, and a bird's-eye-view 360 monitor. Magnetic Ride Control improves handling remarkably without hurting the ride, and the Rear Camera Mirror provides a much wider view than the standard mirror. The Driver Awareness Package vibrates the seat when the car starts drifting out of a lane, or gets too close to an object when parking.</p>, <p>The base engine on the 2018 Cadillac CTS is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 268 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. That compares nicely to the mid-level engine, a 3.6-liter V6 with 335 horsepower, but 285 lb-ft of torque. Both are offered with rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD). All models use the same 8-speed automatic transmission, and it's a gem, responding quickly to the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.<br>

All-wheel drive adds about $2,000 on models where it's available.

---------http://www.kbb.com/cadillac/cts-v/2018
[<p>No American manufacturer makes anything quite like the 2018 Cadillac CTS-V. With its 640-horsepower supercharged V8 engine, rear-wheel drive, performance-tuned suspension and incredibly agile performance, there's nothing that rivals it in the U.S. That's because the CTS-V is an arrow aimed straight at the heart of high-performance European luxury sedans, like the BMW M5 and Mercedes-AMG E 63. Yet if you think this casts Cadillac as David vs. those European Goliaths, make no mistake: Caddy's got the goods. The engine outpowers both of those cars, it weighs several hundred pounds less, and the chassis is good enough to dust off the old Standard of the World badge. While it has a handful of shortcomings, it also costs tens of thousands less than the Europeans.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS-V combines the grace and agility of a premium European sports sedan with the visceral thrill of American V8 muscle, and wraps it in styling that looks like something out of a science fiction movie. There's literally nothing like it on the road.</p>, <p>This Cadillac can run with the big boys, but it doesn't yet have the cachet of an M5 or AMG E 63 (although it's getting close). It's also lacking a handful of luxury features, like active cruise control, that are available elsewhere, including the standard CTS.</p>, <p>Aside from a new exterior color and an automatic heated steering wheel, there is a new limited-edition Glacier Metallic model. It's basically a loaded CTS-V, with quantities limited to 115 units to celebrate Cadillac's 115th anniversary.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS-V barks to life, the exhaust quickly settling into a muted growl. Grab the gear selector -- a traditional PRNDL handle covered in faux suede -- and the CTS-V belies its power with a docility that's surprising and welcome. Cruise around town, and this Cadillac sports sedan remains true to its luxury-car heritage: It's poised, comfortable, quiet and refined. Yet when you need to pass that semi, or just want to open 'er up, the engine roars, the supercharger sings, and the CTS-V rockets forward like few cars can. Click the drive mode to Sport, and the gauges change to black-on-white, with the "V" logo prominently showing. The suspension firms up as well. On back roads, the CTS-V gleefully showcases its agility and (relatively) light weight. Track mode takes things even further by loosening the restrictions on the stability control, and really should be reserved for the track.</p>, <p>SUPERCHARGED V8<br>
 The engine is the star of the show here. With 640 horsepower and 630 lb-ft of torque, it's the same engine you'll find under the hood of the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and Camaro ZL1. Yet here it feels smoother and more refined, befitting its role.<br>
<br>
 CARBON BLACK PACKAGE<br>
 If you need to announce your presence even more loudly, the $6,950 Carbon Black package is the best way to do it. It adds a carbon-fiber spoiler, front splitter, hood vent, rear diffuser and interior trim, plus black wheels and a black-chrome grille. It's exceptionally sinister on black cars.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Inside the 2018 Cadillac CTS-V you'll find an interior that's much like <a href="https://www.kbb.com/cadillac/cts/2018/">the rest of the CTS lineup (reviewed here)</a>. This is a good thing, as the cabin is awash in high-end materials, soft leathers, and cool tech options. Cadillac's CUE infotainment system has been thoroughly upgraded and is now as quick, useful and responsive as it should've been when it debuted. Like the rest of the lineup, the rear seat isn't the roomiest, but it'll hold three in a pinch. Available Recaro seats hold you like a long-lost friend, but ordering them sacrifices the ventilation you get on the standard seats.</p>, <p>The 2018 CTS-V looks terrific from just about any angle. Especially with the Carbon Black package, the already-sharp lines of the standard CTS take on an intimidating aura with the CTS-V's wide fenders, big wheels and tires, and vented hood. What's surprising is the reaction the CTS-V gets from younger enthusiasts, who wholeheartedly embrace the car's mix of luxury and menace. If you want to save about $7,000 you can skip the Carbon Black package and have a more stealthy CTS-V; however, once you see it on the car, it's hard to turn it down.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac CTS-V comes with everything you'd expect in a high-end luxury-sports sedan. There's the fantastic engine, of course, driving the rear wheels through an 8-speed automatic. You get a leather interior with suede inserts on the seats, CUE with navigation, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a reconfigurable LCD instrument display. There's a Bose surround-sound audio system as well, along with a rearview camera and parking sensors in front and back. Other touches include a curb-view camera so you don't bang up those expensive wheels, behind which are standard Brembo brakes with 6-piston calipers in front, and 4-piston ones in the rear.</p>, <p>A Luxury Package adds 3-zone climate control to the CTS-V, along with sunshades for the rear and side windows, a rear camera mirror, and heated outboard rear seats. There's the Carbon Black package, and a Recaro Seating option that adds excellent driver's seats, but at the expense of seat cooling. Other options include a performance-data recorder that will record not just your lap-time data but also a video, and suede microfiber cloth on the steering wheel and shift handle. Unfortunately, active cruise control isn't available since the radar takes up valuable space in the grille needed to keep the engine cool.</p>, <p>There's only one engine available in the CTS-V: a 6.1-liter supercharged V8 monster putting out 640 horsepower and 630 lb-ft of torque. It powers the rear wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission with quick-reaction paddle shifters on the steering wheel. You can shift for yourself, or just let the car's performance algorithms do it for you with uncanny precision. Considering the horsepower under hood, the CTS-V even manages somewhat respectable fuel economy, up to 21 mpg on the highway.<br>
<br>
 6.2-liter supercharged V8<br>
 640 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br>
 630 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/21 mpg<b></b></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Cadillac CTS-V lists at about $90,600, which includes the $995 destination charge and the $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. The Glacier Metallic model has a price of about $105,000, including the same. That's not what anybody would call "cheap," but that's for a loaded version. The similarly quick Mercedes-AMG E 63 starts at about that price, and climbs skyward from there, and the upcoming 2018 BMW M5 will likely be about the same story. On the other hand, the Lexus GS-F costs about the same, but the Cadillac runs circles around the Lexus. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Cadillac CTS-V. Good news: The CTS-V is projected to beat its rivals in resale value.</p>]

[<p>A favorite of moms and moguls, the 2018 Cadillac Escalade is a full-size <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> with big style, big V8 horsepower and seating for eight passengers. Available in two sizes, the full-size Escalade and the even larger Escalade ESV, Cadillac’s largest SUV competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/navigator/">Lincoln Navigator</a>, the smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx80/">Infiniti QX80</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lx/">Lexus LX</a> and the mechanically similar <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/yukon/">GMC Yukon</a> and Chevy Tahoe and Suburban. Four trim levels are available, Base, Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum. Behind the Escalade’s distinctive grille is the largest engine in the class, a massive 6.2-liter V8 that makes 420 horsepower. This year it’s mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission, which improves highway fuel economy. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but 4-wheel drive with a low range is available. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> says the Escalade can tow up to 8,300 pounds and accelerate from 0-60 mph in 6.0 seconds.</p>, <p>Those looking for the most size in the full-size luxury SUV class can stop looking. But the big and bold 2018 Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESV don’t just offer seating for as many as eight passengers and acres of cargo space, they’re leather-lined and luxurious, with high-tech driving aids and family-friendly features including onboard Wi-Fi.</p>, <p>Some may equate the imposing size and weight of the 2018 Cadillac Escalade with safety, but the full-size luxury SUV is only rated four out of five stars for overall safety by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The smaller Mercedes GLS 550 and AMG GLS 63 offer more horsepower and handling than the Caddy.</p>, <p>For 2018, Cadillac has updated the new Escalade with a 10-speed automatic transmission, which improves the full-size SUV’s highway fuel economy. Top-of-the-line Platinum models also get a new available Maple Sugar interior with Jet Black accents.</p>, <p>It looks imposing and it intimidates other drivers like Dale Earnhardt, but from behind the wheel the 2018 Cadillac Escalade is a pussy cat. The Caddy is comfortable, easy-to-drive, sure-footed and powerful. Sure it’s big, and parking this beast or backing it up in tight parking garages can be challenging, but on the road it’s like a high-riding luxury <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> with impeccable manners and a refined ride. Cadillac’s 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V8 is a lovable brute. Power for passing and merging is never in short supply and the new 10-speed automatic transmission is responsive and smooth. GM’s Magnetic Ride Control does an admirable job managing the Escalade’s bulk, allowing it to soak up rough roads and negotiate tight turns with little fuss. The power-steering assist is appropriately proportioned. Add the optional 4-wheel drive and the Escalade becomes a winter warrior capable of tackling all kinds of road conditions.</p>, <p>AUTOMATIC PARK ASSIST<br>
 If you’re worried about parallel parking such a big truck, don’t be. Cadillac’s Automatic Park Assist feature is standard. It uses ultrasonic sensors to locate a suitable parking space and then steers the vehicle into the space while you work the pedals and the gear selection.<br>

 MASSAGE FRONT SEATS<br>
 Power-adjustable, heated-and-cooled front seats are standard on the new 2018 Cadillac Escalade, while the top Platinum-spec models add the luxury of a massage feature. Kneading, rolling and anti-fatigue settings are offered, and the intensity is adjustable. When used in combination with the heat, it feels reeeeeeeeeally good.<br>

All models offer a 2nd-row bench seat allowing seating for eight passengers or a pair of bucket seats and seating for seven. Third-row legroom is tight for tall adults in standard models, but the extended-length 2018 Cadillac ESV SUV rectifies that while also offering considerably more cargo space behind the rearmost seats. Both the 3rd - and 2nd-row seats fold flat, and open up an incredible amount of cargo space, 94.2 cubic feet in the Escalade and over 120 cubic feet in the Escalade ESV.</p>, <p>You can’t miss the new Escalade’s massive grille, but you might not see the active-aero shutters behind it, which close to improve aerodynamics on the highway and increase fuel economy. The 2018 Cadillac Escalade also benefits from full-LED headlights with four crystals in the headlights that act as the high beams, giving off radiant light. The long vertical taillights also employ LEDs, making it easier to follow the Escalade when weather conditions are less than ideal, which improves safety. Originally installed for aerodynamic purposes, the rear spoiler not only adds a sporting flair to the SUV’s derriere, it also hides the rear-windshield wiper. At 224.3 inches, the Escalade ESV model is about two-feet longer than the standard model.</p>, <p>Standard luxuries on the new Cadillac Escalade include 12-way power-adjustable seats, 20-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels, Magnetic Ride Control and hands-free power liftgate. A remote starter, tri-zone climate control, and a reconfigurable instrument cluster further the Escalade’s appeal, as do a power-folding 3rd-row seat, heated and cooled front seats, front and rear park assists, rain-sensing wipers, a surround-vision camera, Automatic Park Assist, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto-compatible 16-speaker Bose Centerpoint audio, onboard Wi-Fi, CUE with navigation and a power tilt/telescopic steering column with heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. Also standard is Automatic Park Assist, which can practically parallel park the SUV for you, and Surround Vision, which provides a bird’s-eye 360-degree view of the vehicle and its surroundings.</p>, <p>Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, adaptive cruise control, side blind-zone alert, rear camera mirror, cross-traffic alert, and 22-inch machine-finished wheels are all available on the 2018 Cadillac Escalade. For buyers seeking the most indulgence, the range-topping Platinum line comes with Nappa semi-aniline leather, suede microfiber headliner and climate-controlled 18-way-adjustable front seats complete with massaging functionality for the driver's side. A head-up display is also available, as are a sunroof, a rear-entertainment system with a 9-inch overhead screen, wireless headphones and remote control. Top Platinum models get a unique chrome grille, power-retractable side steps, a suede headliner and a leather-wrapped instrument cluster and console.</p>, <p>You have one choice when it comes to motivating the 2018 Cadillac Escalade luxury SUV, and that’s the 6.2-liter V8 engine rated at 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission for both 2-wheel and 4-wheel-drive (2WD, 4WD) models is a 10-speed automatic with driver shift control and tow/haul mode. Even with the 10-speed transmission, this engine gets parched quickly, and the EPA’s ratings of 14/23 mpg for the 2WD model and 14/21 mpg for the 4WD variant reflect that.

[<p>A favorite of moms and moguls, the 2018 Cadillac Escalade is a full-size <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> with big style, big V8 horsepower and seating for eight passengers. Available in two sizes, the full-size Escalade and the even larger Escalade ESV, Cadillac’s largest SUV competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/navigator/">Lincoln Navigator</a>, the smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx80/">Infiniti QX80</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lx/">Lexus LX</a> and the mechanically similar <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/yukon/">GMC Yukon</a> and Chevy Tahoe and Suburban. Four trim levels are available, Base, Luxury, Premium Luxury and Platinum. Behind the Escalade’s distinctive grille is the largest engine in the class, a massive 6.2-liter V8 that makes 420 horsepower. This year it’s mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission, which improves highway fuel economy. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but 4-wheel drive with a low range is available. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> says the Escalade can tow up to 8,300 pounds and accelerate from 0-60 mph in 6.0 seconds.</p>, <p>Those looking for the most size in the full-size luxury SUV class can stop looking. But the big and bold 2018 Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESV don’t just offer seating for as many as eight passengers and acres of cargo space, they’re leather-lined and luxurious, with high-tech driving aids and family-friendly features including onboard Wi-Fi.</p>, <p>Some may equate the imposing size and weight of the 2018 Cadillac Escalade with safety, but the full-size luxury SUV is only rated four out of five stars for overall safety by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The smaller Mercedes GLS 550 and AMG GLS 63 offer more horsepower and handling than the Caddy.</p>, <p>For 2018, Cadillac has updated the new Escalade with a 10-speed automatic transmission, which improves the full-size SUV’s highway fuel economy. Top-of-the-line Platinum models also get a new available Maple Sugar interior with Jet Black accents.</p>, <p>It looks imposing and it intimidates other drivers like Dale Earnhardt, but from behind the wheel the 2018 Cadillac Escalade is a pussy cat. The Caddy is comfortable, easy-to-drive, sure-footed and powerful. Sure it’s big, and parking this beast or backing it up in tight parking garages can be challenging, but on the road it’s like a high-riding luxury <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> with impeccable manners and a refined ride.

[<p>The stylish 2018 Cadillac XT5 is a posh and powerful 2-row, 5-passenger <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV. It offers extreme levels of active-safety technology and advanced in-cabin connectivity, including onboard Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Under the hood is a big 3.6-liter V6 making 310 horsepower, which makes it one of the most powerful vehicles in the midsize-luxury-SUV class, although there is no hybrid model. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available on all models. Four trim levels are available: base XT5, Luxury XT5, Premium Luxury XT5 and Platinum, with prices starting just over $40,000. A loaded XT5 will top $70,000. The new 2018 XT5 competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rx/">Lexus RX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkx/">Lincoln MKX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gle/">Mercedes-Benz GLE</a>.</p>, <p>With over 300 horsepower the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/xt5/">Cadillac XT5</a> is one of the most powerful <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> in its class. But it’s also surprisingly fuel-efficient, getting better fuel mileage than the Mercedes GLE350. The Cadillac’s big V6 also runs on regular gasoline instead of pricier premium to keep your operating costs down.<b></b></p>, <p>The new 2018 XT5 doesn’t offer a third row. Larger 7-passenger options in the class include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx60/">Infiniti QX60</a>. If high city fuel economy is important, check out the hybrid versions of the Lexus RX, Acura MDX and BMW X5. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> also offers a diesel.</p>, <p>Cadillac’s XT5 was all-new just last year, so for 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> has made a few minor improvements to the SUV. All-wheel drive is now available on all models, including the base XT5. There’s also a new automatic heated steering wheel, which turns itself on at a predetermined interior temperature.</p>, <p>Our time behind the wheel of the XT5 was split between time in city traffic and some stretches through twisty canyons. In the city the XT5 is exceedingly comfortable and visibility is excellent. The auto stop/start feature helps increase fuel efficiency, but you can feel the big V6 turning itself on and off. It would be nice to have the option to disable the system. The SUV also feels confident and well-planted in twists and turns. The XT5's <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> power steering provides decent feedback. It isn't a sports car, but you can certainly have fun in it. It's powered by a 3.6-liter, 310-horsepower V6 with a very good 8-speed automatic transmission that felt as if it were programmed for fuel economy, not performance. The XT5 is by no means slow, and it certainly has ample power; it just takes hard throttle-mashing to get the transmission to downshift.</p>, <p>CADILLAC USER EXPERIENCE<br>
 Cadillac’s User Experience infotainment system offers quick response, clean graphics and an intuitive touch screen. It comes with standard 8-inch screen, onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, voice activation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Navigation is available, but it’s standard on the top trims. Wireless phone charging is standard on all models.<br>
<br>
 FORWARD AUTOMATIC BRAKING<br>
 The 2018 Cadillac XT5 won’t drive itself, but it can help you avoid an accident by braking for you. If this system detects an imminent forward collision, and the driver has not applied the brakes, the system will apply the brakes automatically to avoid the collision or reduce its severity.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The cabin of Cadillac's XT5 is quiet and elegant. The quality of the materials -- including carbon fiber, aluminum and real open-pore wood -- and the fit and finish are excellent. That, plus the roomy, sliding second row and tasteful color schemes ensure the interior holds its own against the competition. It's also wonderfully comfortable and offers more cargo space than many of its 5-passenger rivals. The split-rear seat also folds flat for hauling larger items. Setting it apart are its standard Apple CarPlay, its excellent infotainment system, a color head-up display and the terrific gotta-try-it-to-appreciate-it Rear Camera Mirror.</p>, <p>In a sea of me-too lookalike SUVs with massive gaping grilles, the 2018 Cadillac XT5 stands out with a crisp and clean set of lines, hard-edged elegance and a hint of wedge in its shape. It’s aggressive, and it gets noticed, but the XT5 refuses to shout for attention. It’s understated, unadorned and beautifully detailed. Although it bears a family resemblance to Cadillac’s other models, the new XT5 advances the brand’s design language with jeweled headlights and tighter, stronger proportions. The XT5 with the most visual appeal is the top-of-the-line Platinum, with its unique exhaust and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>All XT5s come with cruise control, electric parking brake, power front seats, power express up/down windows, 18-inch wheels, a power liftgate, keyless entry, dual-zone climate control, a power tilt-telescopic steering column and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Internet connectivity, 4G LTE with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, comes with the XT5, as do Apple CarPlay connectivity, an 8-speaker Bose audio and a wireless smartphone charging pad. Also standard are a rearview camera and dual front, front and rear head-curtain and driver’s-knee airbags. While a navigation system isn’t standard, one year of OnStar is, which can provide turn-by-turn directions.</p>, <p>In addition to the base XT5, trim levels for Cadillac's compact-luxury midsize-crossover SUV include Luxury and Premium Luxury and Platinum. Driver-assist options include adaptive cruise control, automatic park assist, automatic front braking, forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist and a safety seat that lets the driver know when there is a potentially dangerous situation. Tri-zone climate control is available, as are an UltraView sunroof, ventilated seats, head-up display, hands-free power liftgate and DVD rear-seat entertainment. Cadillac also offers 20-inch wheels, a reconfigurable digital gauge cluster and a 14-speaker audio system. All-wheel drive is available on every trim level.</p>, <p>Unlike many of the Cadillac’s competitors, which now use smaller turbocharged engines, the new XT5 boasts a large naturally aspirated 3.6-liter V6. It makes over 300 horsepower and features such technologies as variable-valve timing, Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation, direct injection and auto stop/start technology. It also runs on regular gasoline to keep operating costs down. The V6 is backed by a smooth-shifting 8-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, and the combination provides surprising fuel economy considering its power output. The XT5 is available with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD).<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>3.6-liter V6<br>
310 horsepower @ 6,700 rpm<br>
271 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/26 mpg (FWD), 18/26 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Cadillac XT5 starts at around $41,000 with FWD. AWD costs an additional $3,000. The top-line Platinum starts at about $64,000, and with a few option packages, climbs to above $70,000. At about $56,000, the Premium Luxury model with AWD includes many standard luxuries such as navigation, 20-inch wheels and a huge sunroof. It represents a high value. That pricing falls in line with that of its competitors, but keep in mind that in many cases, those top-line models are diesels or <a alt_o_t="Hybrids" href="/hybrid/">hybrids</a>, such as the Lexus RX 450h, powertrains that aren't offered on the XT5. To get your best deal on a new XT5, take a look at KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to find out what others in your area are paying for theirs. Over time, the XT5's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> remains average, comparable to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a>, shy of the Audi Q5 and well shy of the industry-leading Lexus RX.</p>]

[<p>Slotting between the larger CT6 and the sporty CTS, the 2018 Cadillac XTS <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> fills a gap left by the aging DTS, a car that was popular with many longtime <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> customers. The XTS is a big sedan celebrating luxury and comfort over razor-sharp handling, cramped rear quarters and overly snug seats. As such, the XTS is a wonderful rival to such cars as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a>. Of course, the 2018 XTS is loaded with all of Cadillac’s best creature comforts, as well as the latest active-safety assists. Its twin-turbocharged V6 is a potent reminder not every car needs a V8, yet its front-wheel-drive (FWD) layout precludes it from keeping pace with many rear-drive competitors. Opt for all-wheel drive (AWD).</p>, <p>If you prefer your Cadillac the way you remember your father’s Cadillac, the 2018 XTS may very well be the modern embodiment of the early DeVille and Fleetwood. The XTS delivers full-size room and comfort with good road manners and plenty of power at a price thousands below most foreign challengers.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a car with dynamic styling both inside and out, you might find the 2018 Cadillac XTS a bit stodgy. It lacks the visual presence of cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v90/">Volvo V90</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/continental/">Lincoln Continental</a> and Lexus GS, and there is no plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> or diesel option.</p>, <p>For 2018, the XTS receives a new front-end design with Cadillac’s signature LED headlights, new front-seat architecture and a new CUE cloud-based infotainment setup that is vastly superior to the old system. The new XTS design actually shortens the car’s overall length by 1.1 inches.</p>, <p>Demonstrating a nice blend of ride comfort and road prowess, Cadillac’s XTS sedan for 2018 feels most settled when cruising over long stretches of open highway. Both passengers and driver will experience a quiet cabin, wide comfortable seating and sense of serenity that comes from numerous electronic driver assists. Cadillac’s Magnetic Ride Control is standard equipment and does a marvelous job instantaneously quelling road blemishes and uneven pavement. While the XTS’s standard 304-horspower V6 can get the job done, you’ll find the XTS feels more alive when equipped with the optional twin-turbocharged V6 developing 410 horsepower. This engine is standard on the V-Sport models. Stopping power is provided by a set of hefty Brembo brakes. The XTS performs well on the open road, but its size becomes more obvious once you get into smaller, city-sized confines.</p>, <p>DRIVER AWARENESS PACKAGE<br>
With all the distractions facing drivers these days, it’s nice to have a little help in the form of forward-collision alert, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and more. The XTS’s safety features include a pulsating driver’s seat that warns of a possible collision from the left, right or both directions.<br>
<br>
DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY<br>
The new, next-generation Cadillac User Experience (CUE) provides faster response times, cloud-based features allowing for better customization as well as Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, OnStar 4G LTE with Wi-Fi and wireless charging for compatible phones.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>One of the XTS's best attributes is its spacious, 5-passenger cabin. There is generous legroom in the front and back, and it's easy to get comfortable in the standard leather seats. At 18 cubic feet, the trunk is huge. If more space is needed, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/xts/">Cadillac XTS</a>'s rear seats fold in a 60/40 split. New foam in the front seats improves comfort while resisting fatigue, and the power-adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel and easy-to-grab shift lever feel terrific. However, we're not so hot on the touch-based audio, information and climate-command system that can be finicky for your fingers to operate.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadillac XTS has the angular, wedge-like profile of its CTS and ATS sedan siblings, but is longer and taller. That last trait, with the elongated window frame at the rear pillar, makes the XTS awkward to our eyes. A new front end mimics the CT6, bringing LED headlights and a one-inch reduction in length. At 201 inches, the XTS is substantially larger than would-be rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>, and is only slightly shorter than Cadillac's new flagship CT6. Platinum models bring even more bling with a chrome-accented grille.</p>, <p>The Cadillac XTS is offered in a half-dozen trims, ranging from the base model to the V-Sport Platinum. No matter the model, you'll get quite a bit for your money. Highlights include a V6 engine, magnetic-ride control, 19-inch wheels, leather interior, dual-zone climate control, universal garage remote and high-intensity headlights. The standard CUE infotainment system includes an 8-inch screen that controls climate functions and an 8-speaker Bose audio system. A rearview camera is also standard, as are parking sensors. Cadillac's fully transferable Premium Care Maintenance includes three years/36,000 miles of service.</p>, <p>Excluding the base trim, AWD is optional on XTS models with the standard V6, and is standard on V-Sport variants. Other options include heated/ventilated front seats and heated rear seats, navigation, 22-way power-adjustable front seats with massage function, rear-window and side-window sun shades, panoramic sunroof, a head-up display, and tri-zone climate control. Audio buffs will enjoy the 14-speaker Bose sound system, but if you want a CD player it's considered optional. In addition to the safety systems mentioned in "Favorite Things," there's adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking. If we could recommend only one trim, it'd be the one-rung-up Luxury model.</p>, <p>Two engine choices remain available in the Cadillac XTS luxury sedan. Base models use a 3.6-liter, direct-injected V6 that produces 304 horsepower. Those seeking more oomph should look to the AWD XTS V-Sport that boasts a twin-turbocharged V6 boosting pony count appreciably to 410 horsepower. The base engine can be had with all-wheel drive instead of the standard front-wheel drive, while turbo models come exclusively with all-wheel drive. The AWD in the XTS uses Haldex technology and a limited-slip differential to transfer power front-to-back and side-to-side. It's helpful in Snowbelt states where traction can be compromised. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The standard V6 runs on regular unleaded, while the turbo requires premium fuel.<br>

[<p>Tesla may have made the long-range electric car sexy, but GM is the first company to make one affordable. The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV features a big 60-kWh battery pack giving the Bolt an impressive 238-mile range on a single charge. As most people only commute between 30 and 50 miles a day, the Bolt could easily replace a gasoline-powered car in every area save long-distance travel. The Bolt’s on-board 7.2 kW charger allows for quick overnight charging from a 240-volt outlet, and can store up enough juice to drive about 50 miles in just two hours. The Bolt’s versatile size is on par with the new Nissan Leaf, and a bit more versatile than the more expensive BMW i3.</p>, <p>If you’ve been considering an electric vehicle, but thought both price and range were negating factors, the 2018 Chevy Bolt solves both issues. Electric advantage aside, the Bolt comes nicely equipped, is fun to drive and will likely earn heaps of praise from your eco-friendly friends.</p>, <p>While the Bolt’s range is impressive, if you need to travel further than 230 miles in a day, a gasoline hybrid is a better choice. The Chevy Volt is one option, as is the Toyota Prius, both costing less and offering more interior room than the Bolt.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV gets an automatic-heating steering wheel added to the LT’s Comfort and Convenience package and it’s made standard on the Premier trim.</p>, <p>If you’ve never driven an electric car before, make sure your first time is behind the wheel of the 2018 Chevy Bolt. Beyond its spectacular 238-mile range, the Bolt is a joy to drive. Power flows through the front wheels via a single-speed automatic transmission with sufficient intensity to send the Bolt EV sprinting from 0-60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. Top speed is electronically limited to 91 mph. The Bolt’s heavy battery pack sits beneath the floor helping to lower the car’s center of gravity, which in turn helps improves cornering and reduce lean. Once in motion the driver can move the Bolt’s shift lever from Drive to Low, thus engaging the One Pedal Driving feature that uses regenerative braking to slow the vehicle. The system is far less intrusive than systems we’ve tested in other makes. Further energy savings can be recognized via the Bolt’s Regen-on-Demand system. Operated by a steering-wheel-mounted paddle, the 4-mode system allows the driver to slow the vehicle at varying rates, all while recapturing energy that is fed back to the car’s battery pack.</p>, <p>60-KWH BATTERY PACK<br>
 The Bolt’s highly efficient battery pack, co-developed with LG Chem, features a 60-kWh capacity enabling the car to travel up to 238 miles in optimal driving conditions. With the DC Fast Charging system, the Bolt can be charged up to about 90 miles of range in just 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
ONE-PEDAL DRIVING<br>
With its two speed settings (Drive and Low) the Bolt offers varying degrees of regenerative braking. Under the right conditions, the driver can bring the car to a stop without even touching the brake pedal just by lifting off the accelerator.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Quiet, comfortable and spacious, the Bolt EV’s cabin has a contemporary design flair that helps offset its abundance of hard plastic and dearth of soft-touch surfaces. The “floating” dash is dominated by a configurable Driver Information Center and a large, 10.2-inch color touch screen, each serving up EV-specific operational data on demand. While a bit light on lumbar support, the slim-line front buckets are comfortable and team with a 60/40-split rear bench seat that will accommodate full-size adults in its outboard spots and a kid in the middle. Folding the seatbacks increases cargo capacity from 16.9 to a huge 56.6 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Cleanly styled, the Bolt EV reflects a blend of current Chevrolet design cues and more adventurous flourishes that impart greater visual distinction. A semi-wedge profile accented by both bright and black trim endows it with a quasi-crossover-SUV character. The Bolt EV’s sweeping, steeply raked windshield coupled with its large greenhouse helps give the car’s cabin a more open feel and improves sightlines, while its 102.4-inch wheelbase, relatively wide track and short overhangs add substance to its stance. Both LT and Premier variants boast full LED front/rear lighting, with the latter also adding integrated turn signals to its side-mirror caps.</p>, <p>Both Bolt EV models boast numerous power assists, a tilt/telescoping multifunction steering wheel, Keyless Open and Start, a programmable Charge Control system, Chevy MyLink Radio with OnStar 4G LTE/Wi-Fi, SiriusXM satellite radio, Android Auto/Apple CarPlay support, dual USB ports, rear heater ducts, GM’s Teen Driver technology and 10 airbags. The Premier swaps premium cloth for leather and gains a heated steering wheel and front seats, auto-dimming Rear Camera Mirror, Side Blind Zone Alert/Lane Change Alert, Rear Park Assist and Rear Cross Traffic Alert systems -- all optional on the LT -- as well as Surround Vision, Rear Park Assist and heated folding mirrors.</p>, <p>The Bolt EV’s extras list is modest, with LT up-fits largely limited to the Premier-spec standards available in the Comfort and Convenience and Driver Confidence Packages. The Premier variant also offers a Driver Confidence II Package (Low-Speed Forward Automatic Braking, Forward Collision Alert and Lane-Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, Low-Speed Forward Automatic Braking plus Front Pedestrian Braking, IntelliBeam auto high-beam assist) as well as an Infotainment Package (Bose premium audio, wireless charging, dual-charging-only rear USB ports). While both Bolt EV models offer DC Fast Charging capability, built-in navigation is limited to the Turn-by-Turn variety included in the OnStar Guidance Plan.</p>, <p>Motivation for the 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV comes from an advanced electric drivetrain that pairs a potent, extremely efficient 200-horsepower AC synchronous motor developing 266 lb-ft of instant torque with a huge 60-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that carries an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty. In addition to its standard but time-consuming 110V charging system, Bolt EV owners can opt for a 240V home-charging setup that cuts battery replenishment time to roughly nine hours or available DC Fast Charging capability that can add 90 miles of range in 30 minutes.<br>

By comparison, the most affordable “S” version of the Nissan Leaf stickers at a considerably lower $31,000 but lacks the equipment level and has just over half of the Bolt’s per-charge range. The same holds true for the Leaf SV and top-line SL at $33,365 and $37,075, respectively, which have the same 150-MPGe mileage ratings. To find out what folks are paying for the new Bolt, check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price. Kelley Blue Book has not yet established a residual value for the new Bolt EV, but its fundamental affordability and phenomenal range likely will endow this groundbreaking electric entry with a resale-value percentage that goes beyond most other comparative EVs.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/camaro/2018
[<p>Now in its 51st year of production, the Chevy Camaro is sophisticated well beyond its muscle-car heritage. More mature than its predecessors with increased refinement and a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine making 275 horsepower, the rear-wheel-drive 2018 Chevrolet Camaro shares much of its components with the Cadillac ATS. Don’t worry; the 2018 Camaro hasn’t lost its edge. Although it’s more fuel-efficient than ever, the new Camaro still packs plenty of muscle, offering optional V8s with as much as 650 horsepower. Many models are offered, including the V8-powered SS, the track-ready ILE, the supercharged ZL1 and the quickest and fastest Camaro ever made, the ZL1 ILE. Available as a coupe or convertible, the new Camaro competes with the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger.</p>, <p>If you desire a touch of retro cool in your modern muscle car, you’ll like the 2018 Chevy Camaro. Although its refinement, fuel economy and performance are way beyond anything offered by Camaros of the past, its exterior design is reminiscent of the perennially popular 1969 model.</p>, <p>If you live in a snowy climate and must have all-wheel drive, the Camaro’s option list will not satisfy. The Dodge Challenger, however, offers all-wheel drive on the V6 model, and it’s a standard feature on the Subaru WRX, the 305-horsepower WRX STI and the 350-horsepower Ford Focus RS.</p>, <p>This year Chevy pulled out all the stops and created the 2018 Camaro ZL1 ILE. It’s the fastest, quickest, best-handling, best-stopping and most powerful Camaro ever. It’s a big-winged wonder with special adjustable suspension, thinner rear glass to save weight, Brembo brakes and a 650-horsepower supercharged V8.</p>, <p>Now in its sixth generation, the 2018 Chevy Camaro is much smaller, lighter and more refined than its predecessor. It still delivers a visceral driving experience that will satisfy any enthusiast, but it doesn’t beat you or sacrifice comfort for performance like some Camaros of the past. The standard 275-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is strong enough to back up the Camaro’s sexy styling, but the 335-horsepower V6 is quicker off the line and offers a more satisfying driving experience. Step up to the V8-powered SS if you can. Its 455-horsepower 6.2-liter engine is shared with the Corvette and delivers serious performance when you want it. And its V8 rumble is intoxicating. With 650 horsepower the supercharged V8 in the Camaro ZL1 will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand tall. Although we prefer the 6-speed manual, the paddle-shift 8-speed automatic transmission is a winner.</p>, <p>CAMARO ILE<br/> Available with a 335-horsepower V6 or on the 455-horsepower V8-powered Camaro SS, the ILE’s more aggressive suspension betters the Camaro’s handling and gives it track-day capability. The package includes Brembo brakes, sticky Goodyear Eagle F1 tires and the ILE’s signature black hood. Recaro seats are also available.<br/> <br/> CHEVY MYLINK<br/> Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system is one of the best with quick response and a very intuitive interface. It comes with an optional 8-inch touch screen, onboard Wi-Fi and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. You can also connect to your Camaro with a phone app, and wireless phone charging is available.<br/> </p>, <p>This is the best Camaro interior since Chevy’s muscle car first hit the streets in 1967. Although outward visibility is still compromised by the Camaro’s high beltline, the 2018 Camaro interior is very comfortable and combines clever design, cool styling and solid ergonomics. The clever design reduces dashboard clutter by incorporating the trim rings around the center vents to control temperature and fan speed. The seats offer great support in corners, and the MyLink infotainment system features a large touch screen. Heated and ventilated front seats are standard on the 2LT trim level. The rear seat can handle adults in a pinch.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Camaro sports clean, tight lines to go with its tidy dimensions, owing a little to the classic 1969 model. Although it’s similar to the previous-generation Camaro, the 2018 model is more modern with impossibly thin headlights, bulging hindquarters and a low-slung roof. Camaro ZL1 models get a deep grille and bumper to cool its supercharged engine, and the 1LE looks equally aggressive with mesh grille inserts, a front spoiler and a satin-black hood and mirrors. The new ZL1 ILE model gets even more aggressive aerodynamics including a massive rear spoiler to increase high-speed stability.</p>, <p>The base-model 2018 Chevy Camaro is the 1LT, which comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. There's also a driver-selector mode that includes Snow and Ice, Tour and Sport. The 7-inch touch-screen audio system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual USB ports, aux input, and GM's 4GLTE Wi-Fi hotspot. Bluetooth, automatic climate control, and a color driver-information display between the gauges are all standard. Upscale features include push-button start and keyless entry, power driver and passenger seats, and a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel. Multiple airbags and advanced stability control help keep you safe.</p>, <p>On the new Camaro’s options list are an 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters, two different Brembo-brake upgrades, an upgraded audio system with a larger 8-inch touch screen, and an enhanced driver-information center similar to the Corvette’s. The Camaro SS adds available magnetic ride-control suspension, a power sunroof, in-dash navigation and a dual-mode exhaust system for more V8 rumble. A remote engine-start system is available. Optional safety technology includes blind-spot monitoring, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, Lane Change Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Alert, all of which helps minimize the Camaro’s compromised outward visibility.</p>, <p>There are four engines available in the 2018 Camaro. There's the standard 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, with a muscular 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Step up to the 3.6-liter V6 with 335 horsepower it offers more power but less torque than the 4-cylinder, and offers cylinder deactivation for better fuel economy. But a Camaro needs a V8, and in the Camaro SS there's the 6.2-liter V8, shared with the Corvette, pumping out 455 horsepower. Step up to the Camaro ZL1 and you're looking at a 650-horsepower supercharged version, making it the most powerful Camaro ever. All engines connect to a 6-speed manual that includes automatic rev matching on V8 models or an 8-speed automatic with paddle shifters; Camaro ZL1 models get an optional 10-speed automatic.<br>

The V6 engine adds about $1,500, and the 8-speed automatic transmission adds another $1,500. If you want V8 power, a 2018 Camaro SS starts just around $38,000 with a manual transmission. The all-conquering Camaro ZL1 starts above $62,000. The track-focused ZL1 1LE model starts around $71,000. Convertible models run about $7,000 higher than coupes. Thanks to a generally higher level of standard equipment, prices are pretty much on-target with its crosstown rival, the Ford Mustang, and both the Ford and Chevy cost less than the Dodge Challenger. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what others in your area paid for their new 2018 Camaro. Over the long haul, the Camaro should hold its value a little better than its Ford and Dodge rivals.<br>

[<p>Although not as sophisticated or versatile as the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> Transit Connect and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ram/promaster%20city/">Ram ProMaster City</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/chevrolet/city%20express/2018/">2018 Chevrolet City Express</a> van offers the compact size and good fuel economy required of a small, nimble urban-delivery vehicle. The City Express isn’t really a GM product but instead a rebadged <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/nv200/">Nissan NV200</a>, a fact that may serve as an enticement for those who still think foreign products are more reliable than their domestic counterparts. Unlike its Ford and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ram/">Ram</a> competitors, the Chevy City Express doesn’t offer a passenger version nor does it have as many upfitting options. However, the City Express does come with an attractive base price, a roomy cargo bay and tight turning radius, features at the top of most small-van buyer’s must-have list.</p>, <p>If you’re in need of a small, fuel-efficient vehicle that can easily carry large amounts of cargo or gear, the 2018 Chevrolet City Express van has you covered. The enclosed cargo area is more secure than carrying gear in an open-bed <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/pickup/">pickup</a>, and fleet managers will love the low maintenance costs.</p>, <p>The City Express’ small 4-cylinder engine limits its ability to haul or tow heavy loads. If you need something that can carry more than two people, the Ford Transit Connect makes a better choice.</p>, <p>For 2018, the City Express gains new standard features including a rearview camera and Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet City Express van is basically a Nissan NV200 with some Chevy styling upgrades. Because there are no mechanical changes, the two <a alt_o_t="Vans" href="/van-minivan/">vans</a> ride and drive exactly the same. That said, you’ll find the City Express delivers a comfortable ride that remains fairly composed even over rough pavement. A narrow body and tight turning circle help this little van squeeze into spots no full-size van can go, and its sliding side doors allow easy loading and unloading when parked in tight confines. While the 131-horsepower 2.0-liter engine isn’t going to impress many with its speed, it has the ability to haul even a fully loaded van up to about 60 mph, after which it’s a long wait for the speedometer needle to move any further. We should note that while both the Ford Transit Connect and Ram ProMaster City offer more powerful engines and better highway gas mileage, neither can match the City Express’ all- important 24-mpg city figure.<br/> </p>, <p>CARGO AREA<br>
 A generous 122.7 cubic feet of space is set aside for loading, capable of carrying all manner of cargo from numerous small boxes to standard wood pallets. The bay can also be modified with shelving and toolbox carriers.<br>
<br>
 TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE<br>
 Offered on the top-line 1LT trim, the Technology Package adds more connectivity features including streaming Bluetooth audio, hands-free smartphone integration, navigation with color monitor, SiriusXM and a USB port.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>“Utility” is the name of the game inside the 2018 Chevy City Express van. The interior is awash in hard plastics, which are durable and easy to clean. Likewise, the 6-way-adjustable seats give a commanding view of the road, and they're upholstered in durable and easy-to-clean vinyl. And there are storage nooks everywhere. A pencil tray and laptop storage are located in the center console, and there's a sliding drawer situated under the front-passenger seat for even more storage.</p>, <p>The biggest styling difference between Chevy’s 2018 City Express and the Nissan NV200 is the Chevy-specific nose and badging on the former. Otherwise they're very similar, sporting the stubby nose, upright windshield and high-looking roof that have come to define this class of vehicle. It's available in the usual <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> 1LS and 1LT models, with the latter offering access to more options, such as the aforementioned Technology Package. An Appearance Package available on both paints the mirrors and bumpers the same color as the rest of the van, as well as the door handles.</p>, <p>Chevrolet’s City Express is about as bare-bones as you can get these days. Power windows and door locks are standard, as are Bluetooth and a rearview monitor. Easy-to-clean vinyl lines the floor and rear-cargo area. The rear doors are solid, there's a locking glove box, and the driver-information screen on the dash shows fuel range, oil life, average speed and tire-pressure monitoring. The 1LT trim adds cruise control, two 12-volt outlets, rear parking sensors, keyless entry plus heated and power-adjustable mirrors.</p>, <p>Multiple configurations exist for the City Express, including things like glass panels on the side doors and side panels instead of solid metal. Other options include the Technology Package on 1LT models that adds navigation and a color monitor among other things. Cruise control, a rear-window defogger and rear-park assist are all optionally available on the 1LS. Note that rear seats are not available, as the City Express is a cargo-only model.</p>, <p>There's only one drivetrain configuration for the 2018 Chevrolet City Express: a 2.0-liter inline-4-cylinder engine that sends 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque to the front wheels through a continuously variable automatic transmission. This Nissan-supplied drivetrain works out to some good fuel-economy ratings, with the City Express getting a combined rating of 25 mpg from the EPA. In the real world, that 131 horsepower is put to work hauling 3,200 pounds, so it's not too surprising that it struggles at speeds higher than 70 mph. Traction control and anti-lock, front-disc/rear-drum brakes bring the City Express down to a halt in a controlled manner.<br>
<br>
 2.0-liter inline-4<br>
 131 horsepower @ 5,200 rpm<br>
 139 lb-ft of torque @ 4,900 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/26 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet City Express has a starting Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just under $24,000, including the $995 destination charge. Step up to the LT, and you're looking at a price right around the $24,700 mark. Check all the boxes and you're looking at a price somewhere in the neighborhood of $27,000. That's competitive with vehicles like the Ford Transit Connect, which has a price range that starts a tick over $24,000 and can climb over the $30,000 mark. The Ram ProMaster City also starts higher, although its loaded price stops short of the $30,000 figure. Curiously, the similar Nissan NV200 starts lower than the Chevy and tops out lower as well. Do check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the City Express. Over time, we predict that the City Express will hold its value well.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Colorado celebrates Chevy trucks’ 100 years with a special Anniversary Edition that includes a unique Blue exterior color with color-keyed grille and rear bumper. Bringing a smaller-than-full-size and larger-than-compact platform makes the Colorado a popular choice. With engine choices of gasoline inline-4 and V-6 and 4-cylinder turbodiesel, plus a maximum tow capacity of 7,700 pounds, the Colorado attracts a wide selection of drivers. The Colorado ZR2 continues to offer plenty of off-road gear that die-hard adventurers will love. New exterior paint colors and heated outside mirrors add to the 2018 Colorado feature list.</p>, <p>The 2018 Colorado is perfect for those looking to haul or tow, but don't want the hassle of parking and maneuvering a full-size truck. A major advantage to the 2018 Colorado: It is garage-able. The diesel engine’s fuel economy is remarkably good, and the ZR2 may just be the off-road enthusiast's dream.</p>, <p>The Colorado is nearly 3/4-scale of a full-size pickup, so if you tow more than 7,700 pounds, need larger interior accommodations, want more capability than a small truck can offer or don’t mind parking outside the garage, you're better off with a full-sized one.</p>, <p>The special-edition truck features special paint, color-matching grille and rear bumper plus heritage graphics. Unique chrome accents such as two hooks, door handles and outside mirrors plus a spray-in bedliner complete with “100th“ logo. The new Colorado also receives an available Active Tow system to align the truck with a trailer.</p>, <p>We love the 2.8-liter Duramax diesel available for the 2018 Chevrolet Colorado. It is quiet, smooth and refined, with excellent power delivery, and there's just enough diesel soundtrack to remind that you have something under the hood that you can't get in a Toyota. However, the gas V-6 matched to the 8-speed automatic transmission is just as satisfying. The 2018 Colorado is responsive with either engine and easily maneuverable in parking lots and through city streets. The addition of the reworked off-roader, ZR2, raises the bar on capabilities to run back-country trails strewn with rocks and gutted washes.</p>, <p>DURAMAX DIESEL<br/> The Chevrolet Colorado (and its sibling, the GMC Canyon) is the only midsize truck available with a diesel engine, and the 2.8-liter Duramax is a prize. Smooth and powerful, it offers a first-rate driving experience along with superior fuel economy. A Smart diesel exhaust brake enhances control while reducing brake wear.<br/> <br/> COLORADO ZR2<br/> Chevrolet pulled no punches with the 2018 Colorado ZR2, adding serious off-road equipment including Multimatic shocks, independently lockable front and rear differentials, and additional skidplates under valuable components.</p>, <p>The 2018 Colorado balances between its needs to appeal to those who might otherwise be interested in an SUV, so it's comfortable and quiet. Crew Cab models have a rear seat that is comfortable, too, albeit tighter than a full-size pickup. The Colorado even comes with premium features like heated seats, Apple CarPlay, and an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system. Yet it maintains the expected ruggedness of a truck, with tough-feeling plastics, durable seat upholstery, and touches like the foldable rear seat.</p>, <p>Chevy’s 2018 Colorado does everything to attract positive remarks on its midsize-pickup style, but holds back from rubbing your nose in faux-ruggedness, with curves and lines that are softened compared to the Toyota Tacoma. Even the new ZR2's visual modifications are for function rather than form, so the increased wheel arches, modified bumpers and hood scoop are all functional components. The standard CornerStep rear bumper makes it easy to get into the bed, and we suggest getting the EZ Lift-and-Lower tailgate, which lets you open and close the tailgate with one hand.</p>, <p>Sure, you can buy the base model 2018 Colorado with its 2.5-liter gasoline-burning 4-cylinder engine, and still get the utility-enhancing CornerStep rear bumper, locking tailgate and cargo-box lighting, air conditioning, a 4.2-inch touch-screen audio system with USB, and power windows. Those with young drivers will appreciate the standard Teen Driver. Most will no doubt look toward starting at the LT model, which includes an 8-inch touch-screen display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an enhanced multicolor information display between the gauges, nicer wheels and interior trim, three months of Sirius satellite radio, cruise control and OnStar.</p>, <p>There are two optional engines available for the 2018 Chevy Colorado: the 3.6-liter V6 or the Duramax diesel. Also available is 4-wheel drive with a low-speed transfer case. Like many trucks, there's your choice of extended- or crew-cab body, plus a standard-length or long bed. Available features include a spray-on bedliner, fog lights, cross rails for the cargo-box storage system and a locking rear differential. The Z71 model offers specialized suspension, differential and underbody shields for off-road capability. If that's not enough, the ZR2 exponentially expands the off-road experience.</p>, <p>The 2018 Colorado engine choices begin with the 200-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, which is fine, but you'll most likely want to spring for the 308-horsepower 3.6-liter V6, or if diesel is your flavor the 2.8-liter Duramax 4-cylinder with its 369 lb-ft of torque. The V6 also comes with the 8-speed automatic transmission. The other two engines come with a 6-speed automatic, or a 6-speed manual in the case of the base-model Colorado. Two-wheel drive (2WD) is standard, and 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optional with all engines. Fuel economy reaches up to the segment’s best 30 mpg with the diesel.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Colorado celebrates Chevy trucks’ 100 years with a special Anniversary Edition that includes a unique Blue exterior color with color-keyed grille and rear bumper. Bringing a smaller-than-full-size and larger-than-compact platform makes the Colorado a popular choice. With engine choices of gasoline inline-4 and V-6 and 4-cylinder turbodiesel, plus a maximum tow capacity of 7,700 pounds, the Colorado attracts a wide selection of drivers. The Colorado ZR2 continues to offer plenty of off-road gear that die-hard adventurers will love. New exterior paint colors and heated outside mirrors add to the 2018 Colorado feature list.</p>, <p>The 2018 Colorado is perfect for those looking to haul or tow, but don't want the hassle of parking and maneuvering a full-size truck. A major advantage to the 2018 Colorado: It is garage-able. The diesel engine’s fuel economy is remarkably good, and the ZR2 may just be the off-road enthusiast's dream.</p>, <p>The Colorado is nearly 3/4-scale of a full-size pickup, so if you tow more than 7,700 pounds, need larger interior accommodations, want more capability than a small truck can offer or don’t mind parking outside the garage, you're better off with a full-sized one.</p>, <p>The special-edition truck features special paint, color-matching grille and rear bumper plus heritage graphics. Unique chrome accents such as two hooks, door handles and outside mirrors plus a spray-in bedliner complete with “100th“ logo. The new Colorado also receives an available Active Tow system to align the truck with a trailer.</p>, <p>We love the 2.8-liter Duramax diesel available for the 2018 Chevrolet Colorado. It is quiet, smooth and refined, with excellent power delivery, and there's just enough diesel soundtrack to remind that you have something under the hood that you can't get in a Toyota. However, the gas V-6 matched to the 8-speed automatic transmission is just as satisfying. The 2018 Colorado is responsive with either engine and easily maneuverable in parking lots and through city streets. The addition of the reworked off-roader, ZR2, raises the bar on capabilities to run back-country trails strewn with rocks and gutted washes.</p>, <p>DURAMAX DIESEL<br/> The Chevrolet Colorado (and its sibling, the GMC Canyon) is the only midsize truck available with a diesel engine, and the 2.8-liter Duramax is a prize. Smooth and powerful, it offers a first-rate driving experience along with superior fuel economy. A Smart diesel exhaust brake enhances control while reducing brake wear.<br/> <br/> COLORADO ZR2<br/> Chevrolet pulled no punches with the 2018 Colorado ZR2, adding serious off-road equipment including Multimatic shocks, independently lockable front and rear differentials, and additional skidplates under valuable components.</p>, <p>The 2018 Colorado balances between its needs to appeal to those who might otherwise be interested in an SUV, so it's comfortable and quiet. Crew Cab models have a rear seat that is comfortable, too, albeit tighter than a full-size pickup. The Colorado even comes with premium features like heated seats, Apple CarPlay, and an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system.

[<p>Available as a coupe or convertible, the new 2018 Chevrolet Corvette packs big V8 power, rear-wheel drive and unexpected refinement as it competes on the world’s stage against Porsches, BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes. With supercar styling and as much as 650 horsepower, the 2018 Chevy Corvette continues its reign as America’s most popular and most powerful front-engine, 2-seat sports car, titles it has held almost continuously since the 1950s. Now in its seventh generation, the new Corvette is available in three models, the Stingray, which starts around $56,500, the sharper-handling Grand Sport and the current King of the Corvettes, the supercharged Z06. Each has been tuned on Germany’s famed Nurburgring, and represents an incredible performance value compared to its far more expensive European competition.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for bang for your buck, it’s hard to beat the V8-powered Chevy Corvette, which represents an incredible performance value. The new Corvette offers the style, performance and refinement of a world-class sports car, but it costs much less than its competitors from Germany, Japan and Italy.</p>, <p>Although the Chevy Corvette offers class-leading cargo space, it seats only two. If you need a back seat, check out the 707-horsepower <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a> Hellcat, the ageless <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/gt-r/">Nissan GT-R</a>. The <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> also offer all-wheel drive, which is not available on the Corvette.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Corvette gets significant improvements, including larger standard wheels and tires, standard HD Radio and five new wheel designs; Magnetic Ride Control is now a stand-alone option. There are also new colors and interior refinements, and carbon-ceramic brakes are now a stand-alone option on the Grand Sport.</p>, <p>Few sports cars are as fun to drive as a 2018 Chevrolet Corvette. This shouldn’t surprise anyone, as Corvette has been thrilling us since it became V8-powered way back in 1955. Sixty-three years later, Chevy’s legendary sports car is still packing a big V8, now displacing 6.2 liters, and its rock-and-roll soundtrack and tire-shredding thrust will put a smile on your face and endorphins in your bloodstream. The latest Corvette is absolutely the best yet, with steering, cornering, braking and accelerating that leave former iterations and many rivals in the dust. The Corvette’s comfort and practicality also set it apart. This is an everyday supercar. Although it seats only two, Chevy’s sports car is roomy inside and its seats are designed for your daily commute as much as the racetrack. The Corvette also rides well for a sports car with such extreme handling, and it offers class-leading cargo volume.</p>, <p>Z07 PACKAGE<br>
 When a standard Z06 isn’t enough, add the Z07 package. It includes adjustable aerodynamic bodywork for increased downforce, sticky Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires and lighter Brembo carbon-ceramic brake rotors. It’s available with the 8-speed automatic transmission, hits 60 mph in 2.9 seconds and runs a 10.9-second quarter-mile.<br>
<br>
CARBON 65 EDITION<br>
 To mark the Corvette’s 65th birthday, Chevy has created the Carbon 65 Edition, available on the Grand Sport and Z06 for $15,000. Limited to just 650 units, it includes carbon-fiber spoilers and scoops, a carbon-fiber steering wheel, special Matrix Gray paint, graphics, black wheels and blue brake calipers.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Over the years, Corvette interiors had been compared to North Korean prisons, but that’s ancient history. The interior of the 2018 Chevy Corvette is well-built, well-appointed and it’s one of the most comfortable you’ll find in a sports car. Although it seats only two, Chevy’s sports car is roomy and its seats are properly shaped for daily use. Tech includes a standard 8-inch touch screen, onboard Wi-Fi and available navigation. Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system is easy to use and is Apple CarPlay compatible. The coupe offers a generous 15 cubic feet of storage space, while the convertible offers 10 cubic feet.</p>, <p>The 7th-generation Corvette Stingray is strikingly fresh yet familiar: a long hood, low roof and glassed rear hatch, but all characteristics have been blessed and enhanced with modern flair. The headlights have been elongated, and deep creases run up the hood and sides all the way to the muscular rear haunches. Center-mounted quad exhaust outlets let the world know you mean business. Z06 and the new Grand Sport models are slightly longer and have a wider track and body than the standard Stingray. Convertible models offer a power-operated fabric roof that can be activated at speeds up to 30 mph.</p>, <p>The 2018 Corvette is available in three main versions -- Stingray, Grand Sport and Z06 as <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a> or <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a>, in 1LT, 2LT and 3LT trims. Spend the least on a Corvette coupe and you'll still get a mean machine. There is, of course, that fire-breathing 6.2-liter V8 matched to a 7-speed manual transmission, plus 19-inch wheels in front/20 rear, dual-zone climate control, power seats and power-adjustable steering wheel. Also included are a rearview camera, 9-speaker Bose audio system with Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability, a 4G LTE system with built-in Wi-Fi and two years/24,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.</p>, <p>We recommend the Z51 Performance Package for the Corvette Stingray, which upgrades the brakes, suspension, oiling system, tires and cooling system, while adding an electronic limited-slip differential and performance-exhaust system. Magnetic Ride Control lets the Corvette go from the freeway to the racetrack. If you take your Corvette to the track, check out the navigation system with data recorder, which has a windshield-mounted camera to record your laps in high-def video for later playback. Interior upgrades include suede trim, heated/ventilated seats, and upgraded audio system. The Z07 package for the GS and Z06 includes carbon-ceramic brakes and magnetic suspension.</p>, <p>Two engine options are available for the 2018 Chevy Corvette. Standard in the Stingray is a naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V8 engine, with 455 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. An optional active-exhaust system, which is standard on the Grand Sport model, bumps that power up to 460 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. The 2018 Corvette Z06 uses a supercharged version of that big V8, pumping out 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, the most of any production car ever made by General Motors. All Corvettes are rear-wheel drive and come with a 7-speed manual gearbox with a rev-matching feature that blips the throttle to mimic heel-and-toe driving for smoother transitions between gears. An 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters is optional.<br>

Grand Sport coupe and convertible models start about $10,000 higher. The current top dog is the Corvette Z06, at about $81,500 for a coupe and about $85,500 for a convertible. Options can add thousands, and a loaded Z06 can easily top $100,000. Still, the Corvette competes with -- and undercuts -- such rivals as the Porsche 911, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/r8/">Audi R8</a>, Nissan GT-R, Mercedes-AMG GT and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-type/">Jaguar F-Type</a>. The Corvette can match or better the performance of those more expensive cars emphasizing the extreme value of America's premium sports car. KBB.com Fair Purchase Price will tell you what others in your area are paying for their Corvette. Yet another benefit: The Corvette is expected to have great <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/cruze/2018
[<p>Now in its second generation, the 2018 Chevrolet Cruze is a popular, fuel-efficient compact available as a 4-door sedan or a sporty and versatile 5-door hatchback. The standard engine is a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder making 153 horsepower. Although a 6-speed manual transmission is standard, its best fuel economy is achieved with the more popular 6-speed automatic. The EPA rates that combination at 30-mpg city and 40-mpg highway. But the Cruze also offers the only diesel engine in its class. With the manual transmission, the 137-horsepower Cruze diesel sedan leads its segment with a 52-mpg highway rating. Although that number drops to 47 mpg with the optional 9-speed automatic, it’s still ahead of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a>.</p>, <p>You’ll like the Chevy Cruze if you’re looking for a quiet, comfortable and fuel-efficient compact sedan or hatchback with available safety technology like blind-spot monitoring and a forward-collision alert system. Road trippers should shop the diesel with 52 highway mpg and over 700 miles of range.<b></b></p>, <p>Every 2018 Chevy Cruze is front-wheel drive, so if you’re looking for an all-wheel-drive compact, turn your attention to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/impreza/">Subaru Impreza</a> which comes standard with AWD. If dynamic handling is your thing, the Cruze won’t satisfy, so check out the sportier Mazda3, Honda Civic and Ford Focus.</p>, <p>Last year the Chevy Cruze got a bump in available technology as well as addition of the hatchback body style and the optional diesel engine in the sedan. This year Chevy offers the Cruze hatchback diesel for the first time and adds a new available color, Satin Steel Gray Metallic.</p>, <p>Smooth, quiet and comfortable, the 2018 Chevy Cruze is satisfying to drive around town and it feels substantial on the highway with a composed ride and a confident locked-in quality. It's refreshing to find a compact sedan that's actually a really good highway cruiser. Unfortunately, despite available forward-collision mitigation, lane-keeping assist and other advanced safety features, adaptive cruise control is not offered. There may be sportier cars in this class, but driving the 2018 Chevy Cruze isn’t a snoozer. The 1.4-liter 4-cylinder is a gem, quiet and smooth, and while it won't wow you with its power, the Cruze is hardly slow. The engine also plays very nicely with the 6-speed automatic transmission that is far and away the most popular choice. With the larger 18-inch wheels the Cruze can handle twists and turns well, but its steering doesn’t offer as much feel as you’ll find in the Mazda3.</p>, <p>TEEN DRIVER TECHNOLOGY<br>
 This clever system monitors your teen’s driving habits and sends you updates and alerts. It allows you to set a speed alert, as well as a max volume limit on the Cruze’s audio system. It also disables the sound system until the front-seat occupants have buckled their seatbelts.<br>
<br>
CHEVY MYLINK<br>
Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system is one of the best with quick response, clean graphics and an intuitive touch-screen interface. It comes with a standard 7-inch screen, but an 8-inch screen is optional. The system offers onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, voice activation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Navigation is also available.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Much like its exterior, the interior of the 2018 Chevy Cruze is attractive and modern without feeling overly adorned. Control placement is excellent and the seats are comfortable and offer plenty of adjustment. Rear-seat room is tight compared to the Honda Civic, but the Cruze does seat five. At seven inches the center-mounted touch screen is large for the class, but the optional 8-inch screen, which brings more function, is well worth the upgrade. We also commend the expanded cargo space -- 18.5 cubic feet behind the rear seats, and 47.2 cubic feet with them folded -- in the Cruze hatchback.</p>, <p>Sleek and stylish, the 2018 Chevy Cruze sedan bears a striking resemblance to Chevy’s Volt plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>. Both are about the same size and share an attractive profile with a fast roofline and long and low proportions. But the looker of the Cruze lineup is the 5-door hatchback, which benefits from a touch of European flair and a muscular rear view with an integrated spoiler and an aggressively detailed rear bumper. Up front there’s an oversized grille much like the Camaro’s, and attractive daytime running lights similar to what you’ll find on an <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>. Large 18- and 19-inch wheels are available.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Cruze L model is the bargain-basement sedan, offered only with a manual transmission, but also including a 7-inch MyLink infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, rearview camera, 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat, built-in 4G LTE connectivity with subscription-based Wi-Fi, and a 4-speaker audio system with AM/FM/USB and auxiliary inputs. More buyers will gravitate to the LS model, which not only offers an automatic transmission, but adds a nicer steering wheel, floormats and armrests. Cruze Hatchback models start at the LT trim level, upgrading the audio system and adding steering-wheel-mounted audio and phone controls.</p>, <p>In <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> the 2018 Cruze LT is a higher-level model, but it's also the best value. In addition to a choice of manual or automatic transmission, there are the 24/7 Promise connectivity package, a 6-speaker audio system, cruise control, 16-inch aluminum wheels, and steering-wheel-mounted audio and phone controls. With the manual you'll get a sporty RS appearance package. In sedan or hatchback the top-tier Premier adds leather seats, visors with illuminated vanity mirrors, 17-inch wheels, and an improved rear suspension. Options include Bose audio, sunroof, navigation, wireless phone charging, and safety features like blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist and forward-collision alert.</p>, <p>The 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engine packs 153 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. That's mid-pack power output for this class, but it delivers high fuel economy. It also uses regular gasoline, which keeps costs down, and sends the power to the front wheels though a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. The big news is the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder diesel engine, which is the only diesel in the segment. It’s available in either body style and makes 137 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, all while getting outstanding fuel economy. It works with a 6-speed manual or a 9-speed automatic transmission. If you’re looking for a Cruze hybrid, check out the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid, which is similar in size and layout to the Cruze sedan.<br>

[<p>With the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox, GM has brought to market an extremely competitive compact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>. Smaller than its predecessor, the new Equinox is still similar in size to rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>, with a roomy and comfortable interior. Standard is a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that's easily competitive with the rest of the competition, and if power is your thing, a 252-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter with a fuel-smart 9-speed automatic transmission is also available. At the fuel-economy end of the spectrum, the new Equinox also offers a 1.6-liter diesel with highway fuel economy of up to 39 mpg. On the tech side, there's standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and available active safety features like lane-keeping assist and an around-view camera. Unfortunately, they're an option on the most expensive Equinox Premier, pushing the price well beyond its competitors.<br/> </p>, <p>If you're a Chevy loyalist in the market for a compact crossover SUV, then you've found your ride. Even those new to the brand should take a look though, as the Equinox is a good-looking, nice-driving, and nicely featured compact SUV. Let's not forget the fuel-smart diesel and a more powerful 4-cylinder.</p>, <p>If you demand the highest-tech safety features at the lowest possible price, then the fact that the new Equinox saves its active safety for the top-line Premier model may turn you off. Road trippers will miss the availability of active cruise control, too.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Equinox is all-new this year. Based on an all-new architecture, it's smaller than its predecessor, but still offers about the same interior space. The 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder is supplemented by a more powerful 2.0-liter turbo, and a fuel-sipping 1.6-liter diesel.</p>, <p>For now, the only engine available in the 2018 Equinox is the 1.5-liter turbo, with 170 horsepower. Good news is that it's a more than satisfactory powerplant for the Equinox. With a 6-speed automatic driving either the front wheels or all four wheels, the little turbo handily gets the Equinox going, even on the hilly roads around the border between the Carolinas. At stops, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> has practically perfected its idle-stop feature to the point that we don't mind there's no "off" switch. There's a surprising bite to the suspension around town, not uncomfortable, but enough that you're rewarded when you test the cornering ability of the Equinox. The powerful 2.0-liter engine isn't let down by the chassis, delivers strong passing torque on the highway, and is rated to tow an impressive 3,500 pounds. The new Equinox is quiet as well, making it easy to enjoy a conversation or just listen to the audio system. In parking lots, the around-view camera considerably aids maneuverability.</p>, <p>2.0-LITER TURBO<br/> Yes, we love diesels for their torque and fuel economy. And we love powerful, turbocharged 4-cylinders because...well, they're quick. While no <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/macan/">Porsche Macan</a>, the Equinox has good enough handling chops that we wanted more power than the 1.5-liter turbo offered. Luckily, there's 252-horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque available with the Equinox's new 2.0-liter four.<br/> <br/> 1.6-LITER DIESEL ENGINE<br/> We're diesel fans, and are especially glad Chevrolet has committed to small 4-cylinder diesels right as they're becoming a rarity in the marketplace. With the new 1.6-liter diesel connected to its 6-speed automatic, the new Equinox can gather as much as 39 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>Chevrolet may have shrunk the Equinox exterior by several inches, but it managed to keep the interior dimensions close enough to its larger predecessor that you're unlikely to notice the difference. What you will notice is the additional refinement. The Equinox boasts soft-touch surfaces where they matter on the doors and center console, and a textured paint that gives hard surfaces a softer veneer. The front and rear seats are admirably comfortable, and the rear seats offer heaters, unusual for the class. While the new Equinox loses a bit of cargo room, it's mitigated by the under-floor storage.</p>, <p>Like its Cruze cousin, the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox debuts as one of the best looking vehicles in its class. While not dazzling us with styling excesses, the Equinox nonetheless goes from dowdy to daring, with sharp lines, tasteful chrome accents, and spot-on proportions. We like the way the Chevy family grille has evolved over the past couple years, and it looks particularly good on the blunter face of an SUV, unlike some other family faces. The available Redline package adds black-out trim and other sporty touches, and it looks good as long as you can perfectly synchronize the red stripes on the wheels when you stop.</p>, <p>The price-leader 2018 Equinox L model comes with niceties like keyless door locks and ignition, and a rear-view camera. The 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system includes Bluetooth for streaming music and for phones, and also features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto standard. High-tech features include start-stop for the 1.5-liter turbo 4-cylinder engine, an electronic parking brake, a USB port and auxiliary input for the audio system, and even active noise cancellation and a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. Safety features include 10 airbags and stability control, and for an extra nth of fuel economy there are active shutters in the grille that close at speed for better aerodynamics.</p>, <p>Besides all-wheel drive and your choice of the more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder or diesel, most options are defined by trim level. The LT is the most mainstream model, and it adds HID headlights, a power driver's seat with lumbar, heated outside mirrors, and cargo-area-mounted rear seatback releases. The Premier adds leather seats with memory, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross traffic alert, a hands-free power liftgate, dual-zone climate control, and additional USB ports. Active safety systems like collision mitigation and lane-keeping assist are only available on the Premier as part of an option package; navigation and a panoramic sunroof are also available.</p>, <p>The base engine on the 2018 Equinox is a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 170 horsepower. It's a surprisingly stout engine in the Equinox, and even with the 6-speed automatic transmission, it offers decent acceleration in both front-wheel drive (FWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) models. If that's not enough, you can upgrade to a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 252 horsepower and a 9-speed automatic transmission, or the 1.6-liter diesel 4-cylinder with its 240 lb-ft of torque and a 6-speed automatic. Fuel economy promises to be competitive, although the front-wheel-drive diesel -- with its 39 mpg highway economy -- stands as the non-hybrid the class leader.<br>

</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The base 2018 Chevrolet Equinox L starts with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of about $24,500, including the $895 destination charge. We suggest skipping the LS ($26,400) and heading straight to the LT ($27,650, $30,090 for the 2.0-liter version) with its additional standard equipment and better options. Leather and automatic climate control are only available on the Premier ($31,700, $34,530 for the 2.0-liter), and if you want the advanced safety tech you'll have to order the Confidence &amp; Convenience II package, adding another $1,900 to the price. Navigation is part of a $3,300 package that includes a panoramic roof. Pick all-wheel drive ($1,750), and suddenly you're uncomfortably close to $40,000. That's quite a bit higher than loaded versions of the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Toyota RAV4, but at the mid-range the Equinox is more competitive price-wise. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note that <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> for the Equinox has not been a strong suit.</p>]

[<p>While every other manufacturer updated its work vans years ago, the 2018 Chevrolet Express van soldiers on in the same skin it has been wearing for the past 15 years. Unlike the Ford Transit, Ram ProMaster and Nissan NV, the Express Cargo and Passenger vans don’t offer an extended roof or a standing-room cargo bay, but they still offer a number of desirable traits including the ability to carry up to 15 passengers or tow up to 10,000 pounds. Available in two wheelbases and configured as the 2500 or 3500, the Express van’s capabilities are rarely in question. Unlike the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, there is no all-wheel-drive option, but the Express does offer a potent 6.0-liter V8. It’s also well-known to upfitters and fleet managers nationwide.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a tough work van with a proven history, the 2018 Chevrolet Express van is hard to beat. Its powerful engine lineup can handle just about any chore, and should it need repair, just about any ASE certified mechanic could handle the job.</p>, <p>If you need a van that can also serve as a rolling workshop, a tall-roofline model like the Ford Transit, Ram ProMaster or Nissan NV makes a better choice. Looking for great fuel economy and the option of all-wheel drive? A Mercedes-Benz Sprinter makes for a pricey substitute.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Chevy Express van gets a new 4.3-liter V6 as its base engine mated to a new 8-speed transmission. A rearview monitor is now standard, while side-blind-zone alert and hill-start assist are new options. A few new option packages round out the changes of note.</p>, <p>Spending time behind the wheel of a 2018 Chevrolet Express van conjures up a nostalgic feeling reminiscent of driving an older pickup truck. The ride can be bouncy at times, although it settles down when the road does the same. The Express’ turning radius isn’t as tight as rival vans from Ford and Ram, and its cornering abilities are far from confidence-inspiring. Those who drive a van for a living won’t find any of these conclusions eye-opening. What matters most is the Express van’s strong V8 and diesel-engine options, easily configurable cargo bay and standard-height roof that takes the worry out of accessing areas with low clearance. The Express Passenger van can hold up to 15 people, but its seats lack the safety-oriented head restraints and armrests commonly found on its newer, European-inspired rivals. </p>, <p>6.0-LITER V8<br>
 While the new 4.3-liter V6 can handle light chores, those with big needs will want a big engine, and the Express’ 6.0-liter V8 is about as big as they come. Be it 15 passengers or a cargo van full of tools and equipment, the Express van’s V8 has the horsepower and torque to get the job done.<br>
<br>

 This new optional safety feature comes in handy, especially on vans without side glass. A flashing icon in the sideview mirror alerts the driver to vehicles or objects that may be hiding in the van’s blind spot.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Express is a vehicle for serious work, and the interior reflects that. Cargo versions provide reasonably comfortable seats for the driver and one passenger, and the rest is a big box waiting whatever can fit inside. The Express Crew option adds seating for a total of five passengers. Many Express owners head straight to the appropriate upfitter, where the interior can be configured to suit practically any need. The Passenger version can be equipped more sumptuously, if “sumptuous” fits in the van world, with enough seating for up to 15 people across four rows, carpeting and rear air conditioning.</p>, <p>Chevy’s Express, in either Cargo or Passenger versions, has been around for years and its shape is a familiar one. It’s a box with rounded corners and is not unattractive; in fact, it looks about as good as might be reasonably expected. Even though the vast majority of Expresses on the road are white, it is actually available in several colors. Exterior differentiations are few, but include sliding or split swing-out side doors and rear doors with or without windows. Obviously, Passenger models have windows along both sides, and a passenger-side sliding door is available on both versions of the van.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Express van puts function far above frills, but at its most basic does include power windows and door locks and air conditioning. Workmen can finally enjoy some tunes thanks to a standard AM/FM stereo with auxiliary input. Like other GM vehicles, OnStar with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity are fitted standard, a boon for operators who need mobile Internet connectivity. Base Express Passenger models include seating for 12 (15 in extended length). All models have stability control, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual front airbags. Passenger vans feature side-curtain airbags covering the first three rows.</p>, <p>If you want anything beyond the 4-wheeled transportation-and-cargo module that's the basic 2018 Chevrolet Express Cargo Van, you'll have to hit the option list. Luckily, it's pretty long. You can get navigation, Bluetooth, and backup sensors and blind-zone alert, plus the most recent version of OnStar Commercial Link. There are also choices of a larger gasoline V8 or 4-cylinder turbodiesel, standard- or extended-body lengths, and various option packages. Passenger versions start with a higher equipment level than Cargo models, but otherwise the option packages are largely the same.</p>, <p>The base engine for the 2018 Chevrolet Express van is a new 4.3-liter V6 that puts out 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque. For carrying heavier cargo, or for more strenuous work, there’s the optional 6.0-liter V8 with 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. This engine can also be outfitted to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). Lastly, there is a 2.8-liter inline 4-cylinder turbodiesel generating an impressive 369 lb-ft of torque. All models are rear-wheel drive and use either a 6-speed automatic transmission (V8) or 8-speed unit (V6 and diesel). Neither of the gasoline engines is very fuel-efficient, one reason fresher, easier-to-drive cargo vans like the Mercedes-Benz Metris are drawing new customers. Then again, rival vans with smaller engines can't tow up to 10,000 pounds.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/express-3500-passenger/2018
[<p>While every other manufacturer updated its work vans years ago, the 2018 Chevrolet Express van soldiers on in the same skin it has been wearing for the past 15 years. Unlike the Ford Transit, Ram ProMaster and Nissan NV, the Express Cargo and Passenger vans don’t offer an extended roof or a standing-room cargo bay, but they still offer a number of desirable traits including the ability to carry up to 15 passengers or tow up to 10,000 pounds. Available in two wheelbases and configured as the 2500 or 3500, the Express van’s capabilities are rarely in question. Unlike the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, there is no all-wheel-drive option, but the Express does offer a potent 6.0-liter V8. It’s also well-known to upfitters and fleet managers nationwide.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a tough work van with a proven history, the 2018 Chevrolet Express van is hard to beat. Its powerful engine lineup can handle just about any chore, and should it need repair, just about any ASE certified mechanic could handle the job.</p>, <p>If you need a van that can also serve as a rolling workshop, a tall-roofline model like the Ford Transit, Ram ProMaster or Nissan NV makes a better choice. Looking for great fuel economy and the option of all-wheel drive? A Mercedes-Benz Sprinter makes for a pricey substitute.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Chevy Express van gets a new 4.3-liter V6 as its base engine mated to a new 8-speed transmission. A rearview monitor is now standard, while side-blind-zone alert and hill-start assist are new options. A few new option packages round out the changes of note.</p>, <p>Spending time behind the wheel of a 2018 Chevrolet Express van conjures up a nostalgic feeling reminiscent of driving an older pickup truck. The ride can be bouncy at times, although it settles down when the road does the same. The Express’ turning radius isn’t as tight as rival vans from Ford and Ram, and its cornering abilities are far from confidence-inspiring. Those who drive a van for a living won’t find any of these conclusions eye-opening. What matters most is the Express van’s strong V8 and diesel-engine options, easily configurable cargo bay and standard-height roof that takes the worry out of accessing areas with low clearance. The Express Passenger van can hold up to 15 people, but its seats lack the safety-oriented head restraints and armrests commonly found on its newer, European-inspired rivals. </p>, <p>6.0-LITER V8<br>
 While the new 4.3-liter V6 can handle light chores, those with big needs will want a big engine, and the Express’ 6.0-liter V8 is about as big as they come. Be it 15 passengers or a cargo van full of tools and equipment, the Express van’s V8 has the horsepower and torque to get the job done.<br>
<br>
 SIDE-BLIND-ZONE ALERT<br>
 This new optional safety feature comes in handy, especially on vans without side glass. A flashing icon in the sideview mirror alerts the driver to vehicles or objects that may be hiding in the van’s blind spot.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Express is a vehicle for serious work, and the interior reflects that. Cargo versions provide reasonably comfortable seats for the driver and one passenger, and the rest is a big box waiting whatever can fit inside. The Express Crew option adds seating for a total of five passengers. Many Express owners head straight to the appropriate upfitter, where the interior can be configured to suit practically any need. The Passenger version can be equipped more sumptuously, if “sumptuous” fits in the van world, with enough seating for up to 15 people across four rows, carpeting and rear air conditioning.</p>, <p>Chevy’s Express, in either Cargo or Passenger versions, has been around for years and its shape is a familiar one. It’s a box with rounded corners and is not unattractive; in fact, it looks about as good as might be reasonably expected. Even though the vast majority of Expresses on the road are white, it is actually available in several colors. Exterior differentiations are few, but include sliding or split swing-out side doors and rear doors with or without windows. Obviously, Passenger models have windows along both sides, and a passenger-side sliding door is available on both versions of the van.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Express van puts function far above frills, but at its most basic does include power windows and door locks and air conditioning. Workmen can finally enjoy some tunes thanks to a standard AM/FM stereo with auxiliary input. Like other GM vehicles, OnStar with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity are fitted standard, a boon for operators who need mobile Internet connectivity. Base Express Passenger models include seating for 12 (15 in extended length). All models have stability control, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual front airbags. Passenger vans feature side-curtain airbags covering the first three rows.</p>, <p>If you want anything beyond the 4-wheeled transportation-and-cargo module that's the basic 2018 Chevrolet Express Cargo Van, you'll have to hit the option list. Luckily, it's pretty long. You can get navigation, Bluetooth, and backup sensors and blind-zone alert, plus the most recent version of OnStar Commercial Link.

---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/impala/2018
[<p>Family-friendly and fuel-efficient, the 2018 Chevrolet Impala is a comfortable and spacious full-size 4-door. It’s Chevy’s largest <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>, offers class-leading trunk space and has a low starting price around $29,000. Three trim levels are offered, LS, LT and the luxurious Premier, which gets a standard 3.6-liter V6 packing 305 horsepower. A 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is standard in the LS and LT, but the V6 is optional. With 197 horsepower the 4-cylinder is powerful enough for most buyers and features start/stop, which shuts off the engine at red lights to save fuel. All Impalas are front-wheel drive. Standard luxuries include onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, keyless entry and 18-inch wheels. The new Impala competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon/">Toyota Avalon</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/maxima/">Nissan Maxima</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/cadenza/">Kia Cadenza</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/azera/">Hyundai Azera</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/taurus/">Ford Taurus</a>.</p>, <p>You’ll like this car if you’re after a comfortable full-size sedan with modern style, a large interior and a cavernous trunk. The Impala nameplate may date back to 1958, but today’s Impala features high-tech infotainment like onboard Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, Bluetooth audio and navigation.</p>, <p>If all-wheel drive is on your gotta-have-it list, the 2018 Impala isn’t for you. Only the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a> offers all-wheel drive in this class. If you were hoping for a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>, the Toyota Avalon is your only option. The Kia Cadenza and the all-new Hyundai Azera come with longer warranties.</p>, <p>This year Chevy adds new colors to the Impala’s palette along with a long list of standard features including finer upholstery, keyless entry and start, a larger 8-inch color touch screen, and a rearview camera. The LT now gets standard remote vehicle start and the Premier now comes with wireless phone charging.</p>, <p>Some still remember the V8-powered Impalas from the 1960s and 1970s and associate the nameplate with those bloated, gas hogs that handled like the <i>Andrea Doria.</i> Forget all that. Although large at over 200 inches long, the 2018 Chevy Impala is spry and easy to park. This is a luxurious, comfortable and quiet sedan with a ride that’s plush without being floaty. And its handling, thanks to its front-wheel drive and standard 18-inch wheels and tires, is more than enough for most. Visibility is excellent. The Impala’s upright seating position gives you a commanding view of the road, and its steering isn’t too heavy. Our LT test car packed<b> </b>the optional 305-horsepower V6 from the Chevy Camaro, a serious value for just $1,100, and it was properly quick. Pin the gas pedal and the Impala will screech its front tires and shoot to 60 mph in about 6.0 seconds.</p>, <p>CHEVY MYLINK<br>
 With quick response, an intuitive interface and detailed graphics, Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system is one of the best. The system comes with onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, voice activation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and a large 8-inch screen. An easily programmed navigation system is available and standard on the Premier.<br>
<br>
 ACTIVE SAFETY FEATURES<br>
 Many active safety systems are standard on the Premiere model and optional on the LT with the V6, including Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert and Rear Park Assist that warns when your bumper approaches objects. Lane Departure Warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert and Forward Collision Alert are available.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Step inside the Impala’s interior and you’re met with serious square footage, modern design and impressive fit and finish. This full-size sedan seats five comfortably and there’s a generous amount of rear seat legroom. You won’t have any problem carpooling members of the high-school basketball team, while the Impala’s massive 18.8 cubic feet of trunk space will swallow the marching band’s instruments. Well, at least the tuba. The front seats are supportive, and all of the audio and climate controls are simple and easy to use. The Impala’s standard 8-inch touch screen is large for the class and quick to respond.</p>, <p>No longer a wallflower sitting on rental lots, this latest-generation Impala full-size sedan is striking. Its taut sheet metal hides its 201.3-inch length well without looking over-the-top. Even the grille -- an element that gapes on many other cars -- is well-proportioned. The long and powerful hood leads into a nicely swept windshield and sweptback roof, while the sides gently flex with creases running just below the windows. The trunklid appears short but hides plenty of space inside. Wheel sizes range from 18 inches on base LS and mid-trim LT models, while Premier Impalas ride on 19-inchers, with 20s optional.</p>, <p>The least expensive Chevy Impala, the LS, includes 8-way-power-adjustable driver's seat, keyless entry and start, Bluetooth, a large 8-inch color touch screen, a rearview camera, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> MyLink Radio with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility and an auxiliary input. Like all GM vehicles, the Impala is equipped with a subscription-based OnStar 4G LTE connectivity and built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. For about $2,000 more, we recommend the mid-grade LT trim, which includes dual-zone climate control, remote engine start and additional USB inputs. Safety features include 10 airbags, stability/traction-control systems, and OnStar emergency assist. New Impalas include two years/24,000 miles (two visits) of complimentary maintenance.</p>, <p>The top-line Impala Premier model comes loaded with features that are optional on other trims, including the V6 engine, 19-inch wheels, leather, the suite of active safety features such as blind-spot monitoring, power passenger seat, heated front seats, navigation, and rear park assist. Other options include active cruise control, driver memory seat, ventilated front seats, 11-speaker Bose audio system and a sunroof. The Impala Premier also gets standard wireless phone charging and a 120v power outlet. The Midnight Edition Appearance package adds black wheels, black bow-tie badge, blacked-out grille, rear spoiler and other accents. Also available are 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Chevy Impala. Standard on base LS and mid-grade LT trims is a smooth 2.5-liter 4-cylinder with 197 horsepower, while the more recommendable 3.6-liter V6 is optional on those trims and standard on the 2018 Impala Premier model. The 4-cylinder engine is the fuel-sipper of the two, featuring a start/stop system that turns off the engine at red lights to save gas. The V6, which is shared with the Chevy Camaro, boasts 305 horsepower and gives the Impala significantly more thrust. With the V6 the sedan is capable of 0-60-mph acceleration in about 6.0 seconds. Both engines are connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and all Impalas are front-wheel drive.<br>

At about $31,000 the more recommendable LT mid-grade trim is still a lot of car for the money. Even when adding the V6 for roughly $1,100 more, the Impala undercuts the base price of the Toyota Avalon. At the top of the 2018 Impala lineup is the Premier model, starting around $37,000 and climbing past the $40,000 mark with options. While the Impala undercuts its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> rival along with the Kia Cadenza and Hyundai Azera, its pricing is more in line with the Dodge Charger and Ford Taurus.

[<p>Chevy’s midsize 2018 Malibu sedan has every advantage it needs to take on rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry/">Toyota Camry</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord/">Honda Accord</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fusion/">Ford Fusion</a>. A class-leading option roster that includes such must-haves as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic parking assist and adaptive cruise control, matches the Malibu’s first-class styling. The 2018 Chevrolet Malibu sedan’s interior is also a thing of beauty, with a brightly colored infotainment display and a back seat built to accommodate two adult-sized occupants. Under its sleek hood, the Malibu offers three engines, including a choice of 1.5- or 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinders or a Volt-derived <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> setup. Best of all, even with all these features, the 2018 Malibu’s price remains highly competitive.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a roomy, efficient and sporty family sedan that is also a stunning head-turner, the 2018 Chevrolet Malibu tops a very short list of choices. Pick the hybrid model, and you’ll save a bundle on gas.</p>, <p>If you’re strong on brand loyalty, prefer the power of a V6 engine or need a sedan that is more conservatively styled, you might be better off in something like a Honda Accord or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/altima/">Nissan Altima</a>. The slightly larger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a> even offers a V8.</p>, <p>Chevrolet’s Malibu midsize family sedan for 2018 sees only minor changes, most notably the addition of a Redline Edition package and a slightly larger fuel tank on the L, LS and LT trims.</p>, <p>Our 2018 Chevrolet Malibu Premium came equipped with the 2.0-liter turbo paired to a 9-speed automatic transmission, and the combination worked quite well. The Malibu moves quickly off the line, aided by a gearshift selector-mounted rocker switch that allows for manual gearshifts. Although the setup works, we’d prefer a nice pair of steering-wheel paddle shifters. The Malibu’s steering is nicely weighted and direct, delivering good feedback. Our Malibu’s big 19-inch wheel/tire setup should have made for a jarring ride, but happily this was not the case. We credit the well-sorted suspension that absorbs bumps and road distortions as easily as it tackles tight corners and rapid lane changes. While the Malibu’s driving dynamics are not quite up to the standards set by the Mazda6, it certainly feels livelier than the Nissan Altima, Honda Accord or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/sonata/">Hyundai Sonata</a>.</p>, <p>APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO<br>
 Complementing the marvelous MyLink touch-screen infotainment system in the 2018 Chevrolet Malibu is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Both programs allow a mirror image of the user’s smartphone to be operated via the audio system, which makes life on the road infinitely more enjoyable.<br>
<br>
 TEEN DRIVER<br>
 Worried your kids will drive like you did when you first got your license? Fear not. The Malibu’s Teen Driver can help you keep tabs on them by monitoring their speed and where the car has traveled. You can even mute the audio until everyone onboard buckles up.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Even if you don't use CarPlay or Android Auto, you'll appreciate the Chevy MyLink infotainment system's combination of big icons and physical knobs and buttons. It's all part of an interior design that isn't just functional, but is among the best in class from a purely esthetic point, too. The gauges are big and clear, the dash curves and swoops attractively, and it's even easy to see out. The comfortable front seats adjust to virtually any body size, and the rear seats boast enough legroom to seat tall adults, although they might find headroom a little tight.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> has managed a difficult task with its family of <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, somehow imparting a family resemblance on the 2018 Malibu that's immediately shared with the larger Impala and smaller Cruze, but without making small, medium and large versions of the same car. There are subtly sculpted, elegant-looking coves in the front and rear doors, and at the rear the taillights -- LEDs in Premier models -- tie it all together. Higher-end models also get LED daytime running lights, and super-bright HID headlights are available. Wheel sizes range from 16 inches all the way up to the 19-inchers on our test car.</p>, <p>While the base Malibu L model offers the basics -- air conditioning, cruise control and an AM/FM radio -- it's a rental-fleet special you should skip. Instead, the 2018 Chevy Malibu lineup really starts at the LS model, which adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with USB ports and Bluetooth with its 7-inch MyLink infotainment system. There are also a standard rearview camera and a 6-way-adjustable manual driver's seat. The very good 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder includes stop/start and hill-start assist. On the safety front, there are 10 airbags, plus stability control and OnStar, which automatically dials for help in an accident.</p>, <p>There are powertrain choices in the form of the Malibu Hybrid and the 2.0-liter turbo in Premier models. Beyond that, the Malibu offers ever-increasing levels of technology, including available adaptive cruise control, blind-spot warning, forward-collision alert, and rear cross-traffic alert. There's a 4G LTE-powered Wi-Fi hotspot to help you find your dinner spot, the available on-board navigation system can help you get there, and the Automatic Parking Assist can even help you park when you arrive. And of course there's available leather upholstery, with Premier models offering automatic climate control.</p>, <p>Standard on 2018 Malibu models from L through LT1 is the 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 6-speed automatic. This frugal drivetrain has little problem moving the Malibu, and returns up to 36 mpg on the highway. Premier models get the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, which gets the new Malibu moving without hesitation. With the 9-speed automatic transmission, it gets 33 mpg on the highway, easily competitive for the segment. The hybrid combines two <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motors and a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder for a combined 182 horsepower and up to 49 mpg in the city.

The Premier, with its 2.0-liter engine and 9-speed automatic, starts just below $32,000, while the Malibu Hybrid starts at about $28,750.

Prices and equipment span the gamut from a basic work truck costing less than $30,000 to a full-blown High Country with all the trimmings costing nearly twice that. While it doesn't offer a diesel, the Silverado's range of gas-powered engines keeps it competitive in fuel economy and power without sacrificing capability.</p>, <p>With an enormous range of options, features, trims, bed and cab sizes, you can order a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado in just about any configuration you can possibly imagine. If you want to drive a truck, and not make a fashion statement, the Silverado's conservative styling will likely be appealing.</p>, <p>The Chevy Silverado is resolutely mainstream, so if you're looking for advanced powertrain and construction, the F-150 and its aluminum structure and turbocharged V6 engines are more cutting-edge. The Ram 1500 and Nissan Titan offer a diesel engine. The Chevy Colorado is less expensive, surprisingly capable and offers a diesel engine.</p>, <p>A host of modest changes graces the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado. The mild-hybrid eAssist package is now available nationwide on LTZ and LT models, the tire-pressure-monitoring system includes a fill alert that tells you when you've reached the right pressure, and the rearview camera is now standard.</p>, <p>The idea of <a alt_o_t="Trucks" href="/pickup-truck/">trucks</a> being uncomfortable and noisy is as outdated as bipartisan legislation. The 2018 Chevrolet Silverado glides along the highway, quietly despite its boxy design, and smoothly despite its old-school leaf-spring rear suspension. The Silverado's suspension soaks up big dips with ease, although that same capability also means it's sometimes floaty off-road or around town. The steering on the other hand feels nicely weighted, and with enough angle that the Silverado is more maneuverable than you might think. Of the three engines available, we recommend the 5.3-liter V8. The V6 offers better fuel economy but feels sluggish, while the 6.2-liter V8's extra power isn't enough to offset its fuel-economy hit. The 8-speed automatic translates to fuel economy that's close to the EcoBoost V6 in the Ford F-150, but unfortunately throttle response feels particularly lazy.</p>, <p>12,500-POUND TRAILERING RATING<br>
 If you order a Silverado Crew Cab with the NHT max towing package, you'll get best-in-class towing capability of 12,500 pounds. That bests the Tundra, F-150, Ram...everyone.<br>
<br>
 BUILT-IN WI-FI CONNECTIVITY<br>
 Chevrolet will bill the Silverado's Wi-Fi capability as a feature for workers on the job site, and it's certainly useful there. But we know what it's really for: taking the Silverado on a road trip, and keeping the kids occupied with their tablets as you travel.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Base models of the 2018 Chevy Silverado benefit from the same sensible layout, ample storage, and nicely textured plastics as the rest of the lineup. That's not to say there aren't benefits for paying more; move up the trim ladder and you'll get even higher-end materials, and the top-of-the-line High Country lays on the luxury nice and thick. Beyond creature comforts, there are three cab sizes to choose from: traditional regular cab, a double cab with some extra space behind the front seats, or the crew cab, which can seat up to six in surprising comfort.</p>, <p>Like any modern truck, the Chevy Silverado boasts rugged and distinctive exterior styling. Yet it doesn't go overboard, instead presenting a relatively conservative face to the world compared to its sometimes garish competitors. Granted, the Silverado LTZ grille is a big chunk o' chrome, but the rest of the lineup is more tasteful and subdued. The High Country offers a more luxurious take on the full-size pickup, and it looks the part with generous -- but tasteful -- uses of chrome. Unlike the F-150, the Silverado doesn't offer a built-in stepladder, but it does offer an optional rear-bumper step.</p>, <p>Newly standard on the 2018 Chevy Silverado are a rearview camera and a tire-fill alert that honks the horn to tell you when you've reached the right inflation pressure. Otherwise things aren't much different from last year. The basic Silverado WT -- that stands for Work Truck -- comes with air conditioning, power windows, cruise control and AM/FM audio system with a new 7.0-inch display, auxiliary jack and SD card. Also standard are multiple USB inputs, Teen Driver safe-driving system, projector-beam headlights, LED accents, and the CornerStep cutout on the rear bumper to make it easier to access the truck's bed.</p>, <p>Like most full-size pickups, there is a range of engine, cab, bed and drivetrain options to choose from. Besides that are multiple trim levels. If you're looking for luxury, start with the High Country, which comes standard with the big V8, leather upholstery, navigation, Apple CarPlay, a premium audio system, and more. There are multiple other packages, such as the Midnight Edition, which comes in a cool all-black theme, or the Z71 off-road edition, which tones down the chrome grille. One option that isn't available at any price is push-button ignition, odd since it's available in the Silverado-based Tahoe SUV.</p>, <p>There are three engine selections for the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado. The base engine is a 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6, which leads in fuel economy, but seriously lags the others in horsepower; skip it. At the other end is the 6.2-liter V8, which handily out-powers everything else, but fuel economy suffers more than we prefer. The Goldilocks setup is the 5.3-liter V8, which offers more power than the V6, but better fuel economy than the bigger V8. All engines are available with 4-wheel drive (4WD) instead of the standard 2-wheel-drive (2WD) setup, and the standard 6-speed automatic gets supplanted with an 8-speed automatic with the 6.2-liter V8 and 5.3-liter V8 LTZ.

[<p>In the world of heavy-duty trucks, the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD may not claim best-in-class towing or payload, but they are still major players in this segment, with an impeccable reputation for durability, comfort and owner loyalty. Most will buy the Silverado HD with the mighty Duramax diesel, an engine dishing out an impressive 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque. And, while it’s true the Ford and Ram HD trucks can tow more weight when using a fifth wheel, the Silverado HD can still haul up to 23,300 pounds, more than enough for the needs of most customers. However, the 2018 Chevy Silverado HD trucks don’t come cheap, and a fully loaded High Country can easily push past the $70,000 mark.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for big pulling power in a full-size heavy-duty truck featuring somewhat reserved styling and a strong history of durability, the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD trucks are sure to please.</p>, <p>If you want your truck to be as expressive as it is powerful, the Ford F-Series, Ram HD and Nissan Titan XD are a bit more daring. Those needing maximum towing ability will likely find it with the Ford.</p>, <p>For 2018, Chevrolet’s Silverado HD WT (work truck) gets a MyLink 7-inch touch-screen audio system with six speakers as standard equipment. A rearview camera is also made standard, while the TPM system now includes Tire Fill Alert to warn when you’ve reached the proper tire pressure.</p>, <p>While the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado HD’s primary mission is towing, hauling and getting dirty, this big pickup also has a softer side. Traveling at highway speeds on paved roads proved surprisingly comfortable, a radical change from the heavy-duty pickups just 10 years ago. Our Silverado 3500 proved remarkably quiet, with responsive steering and a suspension that soaked up bumps and imperfections as easily as the Silverado 1500. The Duramax diesel is so refined it only reveals its oil-burner status when punching the throttle, an action that releases a simultaneous burst of power and muffled clatter. Our Chevy rep hooked us up with a 10,000-pound trailer, which our Silverado 3500 HD had no problem towing up and over a 6,000-foot mountain climb. The trailer-sway control kept wag to a minimum, while the exhaust brake and sturdy 6-speed Allison transmission aided in our safe descent.</p>, <p>ADVANCED INTERIOR<br>
As rugged as the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado HD is on the outside, its interior is designed to coddle and pamper. From the supportive seats to the 8-inch color touch screen to the wireless-charging pad and 4G LTE Wi-Fi setup, Chevy’s HD trucks have all the comforts of home.<br>
<br>
6.6-LITER DURAMAX ENGINE<br>
As big diesel engines go, the 6.6-liter Duramax engine offered in Chevy’s 2018 Silverado HD pickups is one of the best. With 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque, the Duramax diesel fears no load. It’s also B20-compatible.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As mentioned, the interior of the Silverado HD is among its highlights, at least in higher trims. At the low end, the WT (work truck) is basic but functional, with a 3-passenger 40/20/40-split bench with vinyl upholstery, rearview camera and MyLink Radio with 7-inch color display. We recommend stepping up to the LT or LTZ trim, which comes with a more advanced infotainment system and flashes of brightwork to complement cloth or leather seating. Double-cab versions can accommodate up to three passengers in back for a total of six (or five if you opt for bucket seats in front).</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Silverado 2500 and 3500 HD pickup exteriors stand out with a big, boxy front end that's even more pronounced thanks to a sleek air intake on models equipped with the Duramax. Regular-cab models are fitted with an 8-foot bed (long box), while double-cab and the roomier crew-cab models are available with the long box or a 6-foot-6 standard box.

Our Silverado 3500 proved remarkably quiet, with responsive steering and a suspension that soaked up bumps and imperfections as easily as the Silverado 1500. The Duramax diesel is so refined it only reveals its oil-burner status when punching the throttle, an action that releases a simultaneous burst of power and muffled clatter. Our Chevy rep hooked us up with a 10,000-pound trailer, which our Silverado 3500 HD had no problem towing up and over a 6,000-foot mountain climb. The trailer-sway control kept wag to a minimum, while the exhaust brake and sturdy 6-speed Allison transmission aided in our safe descent.</p>, <p>ADVANCED INTERIOR<br>
As rugged as the 2018 Chevrolet Silverado HD is on the outside, its interior is designed to coddle and pamper. From the supportive seats to the 8-inch color touch screen to the wireless-charging pad and 4G LTE Wi-Fi setup, Chevy’s HD trucks have all the comforts of home.<br>
<br>
6.6-LITER DURAMAX ENGINE<br>
As big diesel engines go, the 6.6-liter Duramax engine offered in Chevy’s 2018 Silverado HD pickups is one of the best. With 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque, the Duramax diesel fears no load. It’s also B20-compatible.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As mentioned, the interior of the Silverado HD is among its highlights, at least in higher trims. At the low end, the WT (work truck) is basic but functional, with a 3-passenger 40/20/40-split bench with vinyl upholstery, rearview camera and MyLink Radio with 7-inch color display. We recommend stepping up to the LT or LTZ trim, which comes with a more advanced infotainment system and flashes of brightwork to complement cloth or leather seating. Double-cab versions can accommodate up to three passengers in back for a total of six (or five if you opt for bucket seats in front).</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Silverado 2500 and 3500 HD pickup exteriors stand out with a big, boxy front end that's even more pronounced thanks to a sleek air intake on models equipped with the Duramax. Regular-cab models are fitted with an 8-foot bed (long box), while double-cab and the roomier crew-cab models are available with the long box or a 6-foot-6 standard box. All 2500 and 3500 Chevy trucks have the helpful CornerStep bumpers for a better foothold when loading and unloading. The Chevy Silverado 3500HD is available as a dually with two pairs of rear wheels.</p>, <p>Being that it is a work truck at its core, a base Silverado HD won’t spoil you much. It will, however, bring you a beefy V8 engine, anti-lock disc brakes, air conditioning, locking rear differential, locking tailgate and stability control. The basic audio system in the Silverado HD WT (work truck) is a MyLink infotainment system with six speakers, USB, Bluetooth connectivity, CD player and auxiliary ports. We recommend at least stepping up to the LT model, which includes an 8-inch display, GM's OnStar communications system with built-in 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity, cloth interior and power windows.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the LTZ model adds further amenities such as heated leather seats, a steering wheel that telescopes as well as tilts, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone climate control, keyless entry, rearview camera and power front seats. Top-line High Country models -- available only in crew-cab form -- include navigation, heated and ventilated front seats, Bose audio system and perforated leather seating. The Duramax diesel engine is available on all models, as is 4-wheel drive (4WD). Also available, depending on trim, are a rear-seat entertainment package, sunroof, power-adjustable pedals, and active safety features like blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning and front-collision alert.</p>, <p>Three V8 engines are offered in the 2018 Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD. Rear-wheel drive is standard, as is a 360-horsepower 6.0-liter gasoline engine. This same engine can be had for use with compressed natural gas (CNG). For bigger jobs and more towing ability, there is the 6.6-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine, a roughly $8,500 option. All three engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The gasoline engine is rated at 380 lb-ft of torque while the 6.6-liter V8 Duramax diesel churns out 910 lb-ft of twist. Maximum conventional trailering for the gasoline V8 is 14,500 pounds, or 14,800 when using a 5th-wheel/gooseneck. The Duramax V8 diesel models increase those numbers to 20,000 and 23,300 pounds, respectively, and feature an exhaust-braking system.<br>

Plan on spending a few thousand more for an LT version, or 10 grand more for an LTZ. A diesel-powered High Country Silverado 3500 HD with options can kiss $70,000 or more. Believe it or not, that price is in line with other maxed-out heavy-duty pickups. At the bottom end, a base Ram 2500 starts a couple of thousand below the Chevy, while a Ford Super Duty starts a touch below. The new Nissan Titan XD with a 5.0-liter Cummins diesel V8 is slated to start around $38,500. Check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their 2018 Silverado HD. The resale value of the Silverado HD is impressive, and springing for the diesel engine will help keep the value high.</p>]

[<p>In an age where tiny houses are all the rage, it only makes sense someone builds a tiny car to park in the driveway. The 2018 Chevrolet Sonic is just such a car, slightly larger and more powerful than the Chevy Spark, but not quite as big as the compact Cruze. In this sweet spot, the 2018 Sonic offers plenty to like, including a very low starting price, high-tech options like Apple CarPlay and a Wi-Fi hotspot, not to mention sporty styling and an available turbocharged engine. Base models lack even the most basic accommodations (you’ll have to crank open the windows), but when comparably equipped, the Sonic remains competitive against cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/rio/">Kia Rio</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/accent/">Hyundai Accent</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/yaris/">Toyota Yaris</a>.</p>, <p>If you find most small-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> too expensive and fuel thirsty, yet you need room for passengers and/or cargo, the 2018 Chevrolet Sonic can help bridge the gap. Affordable, efficient and offering the latest in infotainment and driver safety, the Sonic breaks the small-car stereotype.</p>, <p>If you regularly travel with friends, family, dogs or lots of gear, the Sonic may be too small to accommodate all your needs. You’ll find the Sonic’s optional driver-assist features standard on the Toyota Yaris, while a base <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/impreza/">Subaru Impreza</a> delivers more room, features and standard all-wheel drive for around $20,000.</p>, <p>The Chevy Sonic receives some minor tweaks for 2018, mostly centered around some package shuffling and new color options.</p>, <p>As subcompact cars go, the 2018 Chevy Sonic places an equal emphasis on efficiency and fun-to-drive dynamics. The Sonic delivers a stable and smooth ride, precise steering and a nimble suspension that can be upgraded with Chevy’s enthusiast-oriented FE3 Sport suspension package. We found the Sonic more engaging than the Toyota Yaris or Kia Rio, but not quite as lively as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a>. Then again, few of its competitors offer the option of a turbocharged engine, another factor in the Sonic’s playful demeanor. If you go with the standard 1.8-liter engine, you won’t be disappointed with the driving experience, but it doesn’t offer that added punch that makes turbocharged cars so much fun. In our short time behind the Sonic’s wheel, we came to think of it less as a subcompact commuter car and more a poor-man’s <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mini/cooper/">Mini Cooper</a>. We also appreciate the driver-seat’s built-in right-side armrest.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">CHEVROLET</a> MYLINK<br/> You’ll find some compact cars costing far more that don’t offer the standard audio setup in the 2018 Chevrolet Sonic. Every model includes a 7-inch touch screen that controls Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, Bluetooth, OnStar 4G LTE and an available Wi-Fi hotspot.<br/> <br/> BIG SAFETY FEATURES<br/> Standard safety features on every Chevy Sonic include 10 airbags, anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control. Optional are forward-collision alert (but not prevention) and lane-departure warning systems.<br/> </p>, <p>Whether sedan or hatchback, the Sonic's 5-passenger interior is eye-pleasing, roomy for its size and has an air of sophistication thanks to the standard 7-inch touch screen that dominates the center front of the cockpit. The rear seat is one of the roomiest in the segment, and the versatile and recommendable hatchback models offer 47.7 cubic feet of cargo room with rear seats folded. That's still less than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a> hatchback, but the Chevy has more space than the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a> with the rear seats up -- 19 cubic feet vs. the Fit's 16.6. We also like the handy dual-glove-box arrangement.</p>, <p>All 2018 Chevy Sonics have small footprints and tidy proportions. We favor the design of the hatchback, which reminds us of classy-yet-practical European models, featuring hidden rear-door handles in the black areas of the C-pillars that make the Sonic hatchback appear more like a 2-door. For traditionalists, the sedan offers a large trunk. Both versions benefit from an attractive face that makes the Sonic appear wider and better integrates the headlight housings. The RS package, standard on <a alt_o_t="Hatchbacks" href="/hatchback/">hatchbacks</a> and available on <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, features a unique body kit and rocker moldings, rear spoiler and other sporty bits.</p>, <p>The 2018 Sonic sedan is available as LS, LT and Premier, while the pricier Sonic hatchback is offered in LT and Premier form. The lowest priced LS Sedan includes some surprisingly sweet features but lacks others. For instance, it includes a robust 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system with CarPlay and Android Auto, rearview camera, built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity and remote keyless entry, but lacks cruise control, power windows or power-adjustable mirrors. We recommend the hatchback or stepping up to the LT sedan, which includes a standard turbocharged engine, better-quality cloth seating, 6-speaker audio and those features lacking in base models.</p>, <p>Top-line Sonic Premier models have the most robust set of features, including Leatherette upholstery with heated and power-adjustable front seats, heated steering wheel, 17-inch wheels, sport suspension, fog lights, and the RS package that bundles unique interior and exterior aesthetics. Options include a power sunroof and a lowering-suspension kit to improve handling on LT and Premier models. The option we most recommend -- and a great value at $495 -- is the Driver Confidence Package that includes forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning and rear-park assist. It, too, is available on all but base LS sedans.</p>, <p>There are two engine choices for the Sonic, each more than merely acceptable. The base 1.8-liter 4-cylinder cranks out good power and is entirely adequate, especially for younger drivers. The pricier alternative is a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that’s sportier and makes more torque, and thus goes quicker, but has as its main advantage a 2-5-mpg gain in highway fuel economy, depending on transmission. For that, the 1.8-liter is available with a 5-speed manual transmission, the turbo 1.4-liter with a 6-speed manual, and both can be matched with a 6-speed automatic. In our experience, we found no reason not to like any of the transmission choices.<br>
<br>
 1.8-liter inline-4<br>
 138 horsepower @ 6,300 rpm<br>
 125 lb-ft of torque @ 3,800 rpm<br>

 148 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500 rpm (manual)/1,850 rpm (automatic)<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 28/37 mpg (6-speed manual), 27/35 mpg (6-speed automatic)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Sonic has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $16,000 for a manual-transmission LS sedan, or $17,270 for one with an automatic transmission. Unless you don't mind cranking your own windows, rolling on steel wheels and not having cruise control, we recommend stepping up to the LT sedan or hatchback, each starting below $18,600. Loaded, even the slightly pricier Sonic 5-door hatchback checks in below $25,000. The Sonic's price is in line with the Toyota Yaris and slightly less than the Honda Fit. It's not quite as low as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a>, Kia Rio, Hyundai Accent, Ford Fiesta or the hard-to-recommend <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mitsubishi/mirage/">Mitsubishi Mirage</a>. Still, this subcompact Chevy represents a good value. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Chevy Sonic's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> is expected to be below that of leaders like the Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/spark/2018
[<p>You might think a car given the label “minicar” wouldn’t have much to offer the average American driver, but the 2018 Chevrolet Spark proves good things do come in small packages. With a larger dealer network than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mitsubishi/mirage/">Mitsubishi Mirage</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500/">Fiat 500</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/smart/fortwo/">Smart Fortwo</a>, the Spark is easy to find and service. Its 1.4-liter engine delivers impressive fuel economy and surprisingly spry bursts of acceleration, at least at lower speeds. Inside, the Spark offers many of Chevy’s best features, like a 7-inch touch-screen audio system with built-in Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, forward-collision alert (but not prevention), a rearview camera and lane-departure warning. As a big-city commuter, the Spark offers comfort, safety and economy at a rock-bottom price.</p>, <p>If you’re trying to keep your next car purchase under $15,000 but refuse to consider buying used, the 2018 Chevrolet Spark may be the logical solution. Offering the right tech and safety features, the Spark makes a great first car for kids, or second commuter car for mom and dad.</p>, <p>The Spark is truly a minicar, so if you need more room for passengers and cargo, a larger vehicle like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a> offers more interior space for about the same price. Subcompacts such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/rio/">Kia Rio</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a> offer more room and power, but cost significantly more.</p>, <p>Other than two new colors, there are no major changes to the 2018 Chevrolet Spark minicar.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Chevy Spark’s 1.4-liter engine musters only 98 horsepower, which may not seem like much unless you’re in a drag race with a car like the 3-cylinder Mitsubishi Mirage. Ask your dad how many horsepower his 1974 Mustang II had and he’ll tell you 10 less than the Spark in a car that weighed significantly more. Advances in engine and electronic technology allow 98 ponies to do a lot more today, giving the Spark snappy acceleration off the line, but still struggling to pass or merge at higher speeds. The Spark’s optional CVT automatic boosts fuel efficiency but saps power and fun at an equal ratio; go with the 5-speed manual if you want to enjoy the ride. The diminutive size and tight turning radius that make the Spark so enjoyable in city traffic make it a bit less comfortable when sharing a highway with 18-wheelers or strong wind gusts.</p>, <p>TECH-SAVVINESS<br>
 The cardinal rule of selling any product is to know your buyer, which is why Chevy wisely equips the 2018 Spark minicar with youthful features like a 7-inch touch screen, Wi-Fi hotspot and the ability to accommodate both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.<br>
<br>
 ACTIVE SAFETY FEATURES<br>
 Tech-savviness and distracted driving often go hand-in-hand, which is why it’s nice to have an extra set of electronic eyes to warn you of an impending collision, when drifting from your intended lane or showing you objects hidden out of sight behind the car.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Inside, the 2018 Chevy Spark's layout consists of seating for four and a small space for groceries and gear behind the two rear seats. Those seats can be folded to expand cargo capacity from roughly 11 cubic feet to over 27. That's more than enough to hold a few suitcases, but not quite as much as the 1st-generation Spark. Blame the lower roofline and shorter length. Rear-seat legroom has also shrunk, but other aspects, like hip and shoulder room, have grown. All Spark models include a 7-inch color touch screen in the center stack and logically arranged climate-control dials.</p>, <p>The original Spark was a nice attempt by Chevy to get into the minicar game, but it didn't do itself many favors in the style department with its tall profile and exaggerated headlights. For 2018 the Spark displays a more refined profile. While still diminutive -- at around 143 inches in length it's actually shorter than the 2015 model -- Chevy's little <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> appears more proportional thanks to a lower roof and longer wheelbase. It features a large grille and handsome headlight housings. Integrated handles high in the rear doors give the Spark a svelte, coupe-like profile.</p>, <p>The least expensive Chevy Spark for 2018, an LS with manual transmission, comes with air conditioning, a 7-inch capacitive touch screen, and a 3-month trial of GM's OnStar system with 4G LTE connectively with Wi-Fi hotspot. Audio entertainment is provided by a 4-speaker AM/FM system with USB input and Bluetooth streaming. You will have to crank your own windows on this base model, though. Safety features include 10 airbags, rearview camera and 6-month trial of OnStar Guidance with automatic crash response and roadside assistance.</p>, <p>If you can swing the higher price, we recommend stepping up to at least the mid-grade Spark LT, which adds power windows, keyless entry, cruise control, steering-wheel-mounted audio buttons, theft-deterrent system and SiriusXM satellite radio. Top-line 2LT models have a leather-wrapped steering wheel, chrome exterior trim and rear-park assist. A power sunroof is offered on mid and top trims, while the top trim offers the Driver Confidence Package that brings forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning. The ACTIV trim adds unique 15-inch wheels, rugged-looking front and rear bumpers and Leatherette heated front seats.</p>, <p>Chevrolet’s 2018 Spark minicar is powered by a 1.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine good for just under 100 horsepower. That isn't much, but neither is the Spark's weight at less than 2,300 pounds. The standard transmission is a 5-speed manual. Most buyers will want an automatic, and for that the new Chevy Spark uses a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Both return good fuel economy that reaches 41 mpg on the highway.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>1.4-liter inline-4<br>
98 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br>
94 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 31/38 mpg (automatic), 29/39 mpg (manual), 30/37 mpg (automatic, Spark ACTIV), 29/38 mpg (manual, Spark ACTIV)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Part of the 2018 Chevrolet Spark's appeal is its Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $13,925, including destination. Most buyers will spend more, though. A mid-trim, automatic-transmission Spark 1LT starts at $16,850. A fully loaded Spark 2LT still notches under $20,000. The standard Spark costs less than the Fiat 500 and Smart Fortwo microcar, and is close to that of the Mitsubishi Mirage. The least expensive <a alt_o_t="New Car" href="/new-cars/">new car</a> remains the Nissan Versa <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">Sedan</a> at under $13,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to make sure you're getting the best deal in your area. The Spark's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> isn't predicted to be strong, lagging behind the albeit larger and pricier Honda Fit and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/yaris/">Toyota Yaris</a>.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/suburban/2018
[<p>Having first been introduced in 1935, the 2018 Chevrolet Suburban carries the industry’s longest-running nameplate. Still the go-to vehicle for big families with big needs, the Suburban is hard to beat. Its only real competition comes from the all-new extended-length <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/expedition%20max/">Ford Expedition Max</a>, a vehicle that offers a higher tow rating than the big Chevy by 1,000 pounds. But, the Suburban’s ace in the hole is its upscale interior, proven 5.3-liter V8 engine and numerous high-tech infotainment and driver-assist features. Neither the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/armada/">Nissan Armada</a> nor <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sequoia/">Toyota Sequoia</a> can match the Suburban’s dimensions, although those looking for even more power and even greater creature comforts can find it in the Suburban’s twin, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/yukon%20denali/">GMC Yukon Denali</a>.</p>, <p>If you need maximum space short of driving a bus, the 2018 Chevrolet Suburban has you covered. Its sleek exterior strikes an imposing stance, and its massive interior is filled with cleaver features to keep the kids happy on long trips. A robust V8 and 8,300-pound max tow rating also come in handy.</p>, <p>You can tow up to 9,300-pounds with a Ford Expedition Max, plus you’ll get a better ride and flat loading floor as well. If you just need a roomy 3-row SUV without the added bulk, check out the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevrolet Traverse</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a> or the 2019 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a> Ascent.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Suburban gains a new RST (Rally Sport Truck) package that brings 22-inch gloss-black wheels, gloss-black trim and unique badging. LED daytime running lights are made standard on all trims, and new dealer-installed options include a Borla exhaust and Brembo brakes.</p>, <p>GM has put everything it knows about suspension and steering systems into the 2018 Chevrolet Suburban, and in doing so has created a massive SUV that rides and handles with remarkable ease. This nearly 3-ton body-on-frame family hauler rides more like a large <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> than a truck-based SUV. Agile in tight confines and stable at high speeds, the Suburban is able to round corners without instilling a sense of top heaviness one might expect of such a tall vehicle. Premier models further improve the ride with a set of magnetically adjustable shocks that adjust to road conditions in just milliseconds. The Suburban’s 5.3-liter V8 generates 355 horsepower, not the best in class but more than enough to move this mammoth Chevy with vigor, even when fully loaded. Equally impressive is the 23-mpg highway fuel-economy figure, a number thought impossible for a vehicle of this size a mere decade ago.</p>, <p>SUPERB INTERIOR<br/> Today’s Suburban bears little resemblance to the first vehicle to wear the name, with an interior that could easily grace any number of <a alt_o_t="Luxury Cars" href="/luxury-car/">luxury cars</a>. Wide comfortable seats, a sleek dash and intelligently designed controls are joined by 39.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the 3rd-row seat.<br/> <br/> REAR SEAT REMINDER<br/> By monitoring the opening of the rear doors before the engine is started, Rear Seat Reminder operates by reminding the driver to check the rear seat for valuables, pets or children before exiting the vehicle.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Suburban's upscale interior grabs your attention from the moment you step inside; its artful shapes, high-end materials and excellent fit-and-finish seem more appropriate for a luxury sedan than a full-size SUV. The 2nd-row's comfy seats recline but, unfortunately, don't slide fore and aft. The third row has enough foot- and legroom for adults, at least for shorter trips, and kids will be fine. A high cargo floor provides space for the flat-fold 3rd-row seats, but that space is not wasted -- under the floor is a handy hidden storage area.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Suburban’s exterior shares nothing of design or components with its Silverado pickup-truck counterpart. Chevy’s exterior designers had a lot of space at their disposal and used it well; this big SUV has a presence that is decidedly commanding. Long, flowing lines emphasize the Suburban's considerable length instead of hiding it, and the broad front face owns the traffic lane. Dimensionally, the 2018 Suburban is about the same size as all those versions of years past, but then, when you're talking about full-size <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, an inch here or there doesn't make much of a difference.<b></b></p>, <p>Standard on all Suburbans is the 5.3-liter V8 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission and a cavernous interior. The base-level LS trim has cloth seats, automatic climate control, rear parking sensors and the standard <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> MyLink 8-inch diagonal touch screen that includes Bluetooth streaming audio, apps and other features. The mid-range LT trim has forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning, tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and the availability of features not offered on the LS. The Premier models add rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot alerts, up-level audio, heated and cooled seats, programmable power liftgate, 20-inch wheels and a boatload of other items.</p>, <p>The Suburban’s available-equipment list is extensive. Among the choices: Order the LS trim level with the front bench seat and Chevy’s biggest can haul nine people to the movies. Any trim can be equipped with the Driver Alert Package that adds low-speed forward automatic braking, IntelliBeam automatic high beams, lane-keep assist, driver-alert seat and power-adjustable pedals. For the LT version, we like the exceptionally comprehensive Luxury Package that adds many of the Premier's luxury touches, and the Sun, Entertainment and Destinations Package that bundles navigation, a Blu-ray rear-seat entertainment system, a power sunroof and many other items.</p>, <p>Chevy’s sole powertrain for its 2018 Suburban is a fine one: the very well-proven 5.3-liter 355-horsepower V8 with a 6-speed automatic. The larger engines of years past have been dropped because very few people bought them. No loss; the 5.3 makes plenty of power, cranks out 383 lb-ft of torque, features direct fuel injection and Active Cylinder Management and, if not a fuel-economy leader, delivers efficiency which is at least reasonable, considering the big Suburban’s muscular capabilities. The smooth 6-speed automatic does a good job of keeping the engine in the best part of its power range and 4-wheel drive (4WD) is optionally available. Maximum towing capacity with 2-wheel drive (2WD) is 8,300 pounds, so the 5.3 is more than willing and able.<br>

The base LS carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $51,400 for a 2WD version, the mid-range LT starts over $56,500 and the Premier is around $66,125. Add $3,000 for 4WD. That's markedly more than a Toyota Sequoia or Nissan Armada, but the Suburban is a lot bigger. It’s now less expensive than the new Ford Expedition Max, but not as sophisticated.

Historically, Suburban resale values have been better than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/expedition/">Ford Expedition</a>, on par with the Nissan Armada and measurably below those of the Toyota Sequoia, but the 2018 Suburban looks to be closing the gap.</p>]

[<p>With acres of interior space, high-tech safety and infotainment features and V8 towing power, the stylish 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe continues to dominate the full-size category. It’s available with 2- or 4-wheel drive (2WD, 4WD) with low range, and competes with other 3-row giants including the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/expedition/">Ford Expedition</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/armada/">Nissan Armada</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sequoia/">Toyota Sequoia</a> and its mechanical twin, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/yukon/">GMC Yukon</a>. Three trim levels are offered, LS, LT and Premier, and several seating configurations are available including a front bench seat that expands capacity to nine passengers. The 8-passenger configuration is far more popular, and 2nd-row captain’s chairs, which turn the new Tahoe into a 7-seater, are also in demand. For 2018, Chevy is also introducing the Tahoe Custom, a 5-passenger model that deletes the third row for more cargo space. Pricing starts as low as $44,995 for a 2WD LS, while a fully loaded Premier can top $75,000.<br/> </p>, <p>Spacious, luxurious and V8-powered, few vehicles are better equipped to get the kids to school, the team to practice or your RV to the campsite. The family-friendly Tahoe may be the ultimate road trip device, and its optional 4-wheel drive means it can take you places other <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> can’t.  </p>, <p>There are less expensive and far more fuel-efficient 3-row SUVs available, including Chevy’s own Traverse. Some may also find the sheer size of the Tahoe to be intimidating and its girth can be hard to park in crowded lots. Although comfortable, some car-based SUVs provide a smoother ride.</p>, <p>New for 2018 is the Rally Sport Truck or RST special edition, which gives the Tahoe a street performance image with blacked-out trim, a body-color grille surround and door handles. A Borla exhaust system, larger Brembo brakes and a 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 and 10-speed automatic transmission are options. Also joining the lineup is the Tahoe Custom, a 2-row, 5-passenger variant of the base LS model.</p>, <p>Full-size SUVs like the 2018 Chevy Tahoe are still the kings of the urban jungle. Which is exactly what you feel like perched up high behind its leather-wrapped steering wheel. The big 5.3-liter V8 even roars like a lion. The days of the truck-like SUV that rides like a tractor are long gone. The new Tahoe is big, but it’s a pussycat from inside its luxurious interior. Visibility is excellent, its steering is light and its cabin is exceptionally quiet. The Tahoe also rides admirably, despite its antiquated solid-axle rear suspension. Order the 22-inch wheels and you will sacrifice some ride comfort, but with the<b> </b>available Magnetic Ride Control (MRC), which continually adjusts the shocks to the conditions, it’s a smooth ride, even in the way-back third row. The V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission work well together, and deliver acceleration and passing power that will make you smile.</p>, <p>CHEVY MYLINK<br>
 Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system is one of the easiest to use and quicker-responding systems available. With detailed graphics and an intuitive 8-inch touch-screen interface, the system offers onboard 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, voice activation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. An easily navigated Navigation system is also available.<br>
<br>
 TEEN DRIVER TECHNOLOGY<br>
 Exclusive to Chevy’s products, this clever system sends you updates on your teen’s driving habits. It also disables the SUV’s sound system until the front-seat occupants have buckled their seatbelts, and it allows you to set a speed alert and a volume limit on the Tahoe’s audio system.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Tahoe’s comfortable driver’s seat adjusts multiple ways. Combine that seat with the standard tilt steering (and telescoping in LT and Premier trims) wheel and the optional power-adjustable pedals, it’s easy to find a sweet spot. The materials are overwhelmingly upscale, and the controls are easy to find and figure out. The large 8-inch touch screen is as easy to use as any smartphone. While the column-mount gearshift lever is oddly old-school, it opens up the console for massive storage. Adults will wish the second row adjusted fore and back, not just for seatback angle. The third row can handle adults but is best for kids. In the new Tahoe Custom, the third row is removed entirely, which opens up 54 cubic feet a space -- a couple more than standard models with the third row folded.</p>, <p>You immediately know it's a Chevy, with the big bow tie on the grille, and you immediately know it's a big truck. But you'd be forgiven if you didn't realize the new Tahoe was still based on Chevy's full-size Silverado <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/pickup/">pickup</a>, as they share zero body panels. The Tahoe and GMC Yukon are also twins under the skin. We like the Tahoe’s sharp-edged styling, sculpted flanks, and new LED daytime running lights. The Tahoe looks wider than its GMC Yukon cousin thanks to the wide grille that blends into the headlights. Shorter drivers will love the available power running boards.</p>, <p>The standard engine in the 2018 Tahoe is a 5.3-liter V8 connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Opt for the basic LS and you still get a nicely equipped SUV. There are cloth seats, a 6-speaker audio system that includes Bluetooth streaming plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic climate control, a rearview camera, and rear parking sensors. There's also Teen Driver, which helps you monitor and set limits on your younger driver's activities. Along with airbags, anti-lock brakes and stability control, the Tahoe comes standard with a full suite of OnStar automatic crash response and other safety features.</p>, <p>You can snuggle with your sweetie as you drive the 2018 Tahoe LS thanks to the available front bench seat. The mid-level LT can be equipped with almost everything available on the higher-level Premier thanks to the LT's <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">Luxury</a> Package, which adds leather seating and more. The Premier comes only with seats for seven, while the LT can still seat up to eight. Tech-based active safety systems like Forward Collision Alert, Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking, Lane Keep Assist, Blind Spot Alert and Safety Alert Seat are also offered. And of course, 4-wheel drive with a low range is available.</p>, <p>Two V8 engines are available in the new 2018 Chevy Tahoe. Most are powered by a 5.3-liter 355-horsepower V8 with high-tech fuel injection that enhances both fuel economy and power; it also features GM's Active Cylinder Management, which imperceptibly shuts off half the cylinders under steady cruise to help preserve fuel. This engine works with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and while it's certainly smooth and seamless, we do wish GM would offer the excellent 8-speed automatic that's available in some Silverado pickup models. Order the RST special edition and opt for the Performance Package, and the Tahoe gets the 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 and 10-speed automatic from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/escalade/">Cadillac Escalade</a>. Two- and 4-wheel drive with a proper low range for real off-road duty are available.<br/> <br/> 5.3-liter V8<br/> 355 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br/> 383 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/23 mpg (2WD), 16/22 mpg (4WD)<br/> <br/> 6.2-liter V8<br/> 420 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br/> 460 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/22 mpg (2WD), 15/20 mpg (4WD)</p>, <p>A rear-wheel-drive 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe LS has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $48,500, including the $1,295 destination charge. If you only need two rows of seating for five passengers, you can shave $3,750 off that price with the new Custom Edition package. The midgrade <br/> LT comes in at about $53,500 and its much longer list of standard features makes it worth the additional money. For all the leather and chrome glitz you can handle this side of a Cadillac Escalade, the Premier starts at about $63,000. If you want 4WD on your Tahoe, add another $3,000. That's quite a bit more than the Nissan Armada, and even the Toyota Sequoia; however, the larger and newly redesigned Ford Expedition has a higher starting price. Resale is another consideration; the Tahoe beats the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a>, but generally isn't quite up to the Sequoia's.

---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/traverse/2018
[<p>The all-new 2018 Chevrolet Traverse manages to improve on the old Traverse's shortcomings in every way, and yet also manages to upgrade the things we thought were just fine about the old model. The new Traverse is lighter by 350 pounds, offers more power, sharper styling, modern technology, and a top-of-its-class driving experience. That's saying something because its class includes the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, Volkswagen Atlas, and more midsize 3-row crossover SUV models. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is available, depending on trim level. With seating for up to eight people, tons of cargo space even with the third row up, and better-than-respectable fuel economy, the new Traverse deserves a spot on every family-car shopper's list.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevy Traverse offers much of the comfort, roominess, cargo space, fuel efficiency, and ease of use you get from a minivan, without actually being a minivan. If you're looking for plenty of cargo room AND plenty of passenger space, without sacrificing either, then the Traverse deserves your attention.</p>, <p>While the Traverse can tow 5,000 pounds, if you need to haul more you'll want to upgrade to a traditional SUV. The Traverse also reserves things like active cruise control and active safety systems to option packages on higher-end models, unlike competitors from Honda, Toyota and others.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Traverse is all-new this year, sharing only its name with its predecessor. This midsize SUV boasts a longer wheelbase, more rear-seat room, better cargo space, choice of an updated V6 engine or new turbocharged 4-cylinder, and an excellent 9-speed automatic transmission, plus all the modern technology you could ask for.</p>, <p>There's no lack of power in the 2018 Traverse. Its 3.6-liter V6 engine smoothly puts 310 horsepower to the ground through the smooth shifting 9-speed automatic transmission. Unlike many other 8-, 9-, and 10-speed front-wheel-drive transmissions we've experienced lately, this one feels just right, downshifting quickly, getting to higher gears swiftly, and providing surprisingly good fuel economy. The turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that’s exclusive to Traverse RS models has less horsepower than the V6, but more torque. That combination, plus its forced induction, equals acceleration and passing power that feel on par with the V6, all while providing the snappy response inherent in a turbo engine. Unlike the V6, though, the 4-cylinder turbocharged Traverse only comes in front-wheel drive. Whether you choose the standard V6 or the intriguing 4-cylinder option, the Traverse’s suspension quells bumps big and small while keeping the SUV from leaning too far in corners. The sharp steering puts its electrical assist on the rack instead of the steering column, resulting in better feel, and the brakes not only provide sure stops but feel good doing it. We're not trying to oversell it, and the new Traverse isn't anybody's first choice for fun on a twisty mountain road, but neither is it intended to be. But on drives long and short, this SUV is surprisingly satisfying.</p>, <p>REARVIEW CAMERA<br>
 The rearview camera uses a wide-angle lens to give you a commanding view of the world behind you, projected onto a screen on the rearview mirror. Best of all, if you don't like it, with a flick of the switch you're back to reflective glass.<br>
<br>
 HIDDEN STORAGE<br>
 The Traverse offers a cool little hidden storage compartment behind the infotainment screen, with a twist: The screen keeps working even if it's open, and you can lock the whole thing with a PIN if you like. There's also a massive hidden compartment under the cargo floor that's the same size in front- and all-wheel-drive models.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The new Chevy Traverse interior features a big, bright infotainment screen complemented by an available full-color display between the main gauges. The front seats and 2nd-row seats offer up ample headroom and legroom, and the rear bench can accommodate three across without difficulty. The third row is tighter, but still acceptable for kids for long trips, and there's a ton of cargo space behind the third row even without using the hidden storage area under the floor. Some of the plastics lower on the dash and console feel a little cheap, and we wish there were thicker padding on the door armrest, but that's about the end of the gripe list.</p>, <p>The new Traverse is a sharp looking crossover SUV, looking something like a Chevy Tahoe that cut the carbs and hit the gym. It's actually longer than the Tahoe, with a longer wheelbase as well. The wide track and body-colored C-pillar give the Traverse an upscale but recognizably Chevy look. If you opt for the High Country you get multi-element LED headlights and more. The RS ups the aggressive factor with an all-black scheme with red backgrounds on all the badges. About the only quibble is the awkward placement of the word "Traverse" on the middle of the front doors.</p>, <p>All 2018 Chevy Traverse models come with a 3.6-liter V6 engine and 9-speed automatic (save for the RS model with its turbocharged 4-cylinder). The base L model (front-drive only) comes better equipped than you might expect, with six USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on the 7-inch Chevy MyLink touch screen, a rearview camera, Teen Driver monitoring tech, keyless ignition, and even a traction mode selection. There's also 3-zone automatic climate control, and seating for eight, including a SmartSlide 2nd-row seat that makes getting to the third row a snap. In addition to multiple airbags, standard safety equipment includes a rear-seat reminder that chimes a warning to make sure you're not leaving a little one back there.</p>, <p>Chevy Traverse LS, LT, Premier and High Country models can all be ordered with all-wheel drive. Beyond that, LS models get tinted glass and a wider color palette. LT models with a cloth interior add nicer wheels, fog lamps and roof rails. Order an LT model with leather, and you'll also get a surround-view camera, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alerts, parking assist, and an upgraded infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen. In addition to its small turbocharged engine, RS models add a power tailgate, Bose audio system and navigation. Premier and High Country models include LED headlights, memory seats, hands-free rear tailgate, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, and heated and cooled front seats. The High Country also adds a dual-clutch rear differential, adaptive cruise control, and remote start.</p>, <p>The standard engine and the one that’s suitable for most buyers in the 2018 Traverse SUV is a 3.6-liter V6 with 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. It powers the front or all four wheels through a 9-speed automatic transmission. Developed jointly with Ford, the transmission's smooth shifts and rapid downshifts embarrass the ZF-built 9-speed automatic used in the Honda Pilot and elsewhere. All-wheel drive in the High Country uses a dual-clutch system for enhanced traction, while the rest of the lineup uses a single-clutch system. The turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Traverse RS makes up for its horsepower deficit to the V6 with more torque. Available only in front-wheel drive, the turbocharged Chevy Traverse provides satisfying and at times even invigorating power delivery. Like the standard model, it uses a 9-speed automatic transmission. Its tow rating is limited to 1,500 pounds versus 5,000 for the V6. Fuel economy for the V6 is pretty solid, topping out at 27 mpg on the highway in front-wheel-drive models. The 4-cylinder Traverse is only rated up to 26 mpg on the highway, but has a slightly better combined fuel economy than the V6 -- 22 mpg vs. 21. The caveat is that pricier premium-unleaded fuel is recommended for the turbo-4, while the V6 drinks the regular stuff. According to the EPA, you’ll actually spend more on fuel in a given year for the 4-cylinder Traverse RS than you will for the standard V6. All Traverse models use an engine start/stop that shuts down the engine at idle to save fuel. Unlike others with similar systems, though, this one cannot be disabled.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 255 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 295 lb-ft of torque @ 3,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/26 mpg<br/> <br/> 3.6-liter V6<br/> 310 horsepower @ 6,800 rpm<br/> 266 lb-ft of torque @ 2,800 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/27 mpg (FWD), 17/25 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p>The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the base, front-wheel-drive-only 2018 Chevrolet Traverse L is just under $30,900 when you include the $945 destination charge. A smarter jumping off point is the better-equipped LS for just under $33,000. LT models with cloth seats start at about $35,500, the LT with leather (and a lot more) start at a bit more than $42,000, the turbo Traverse RS is around $43,000, and the Premier is a pricey-but-competitive $45,400. The High Country adds standard all-wheel drive and more, at a price that's just under an eye-watering $53,000 -- that's matched only by the similarly lavish Ford Explorer Platinum and GMC Acadia Denali. Otherwise prices are competitive with the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, and the rest of the midsize 3-row SUV market. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note that it's too early to tell how hard depreciation will hit the Traverse.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/trax/2018
[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Trax combines the fuel efficiency of a compact car with the roominess and capability of an SUV. Known in the industry as a compact-crossover SUV, this design is gaining in popularity especially with younger drivers. The Chevy Trax is made all the more alluring due to its high-tech features that include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, as well as a host of advanced driver-safety equipment. Peppy and fun to drive, the Trax doesn’t feel heavy or bloated like some larger <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, and its optional all-wheel-drive system is perfect for weekend ski trips or access to remote trailheads. The Trax’s overall ownership costs appear to be a bit higher than its rivals, however, something to keep in mind if you’re pinching pennies.</p>, <p>With more interior room than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a> and better fuel efficiency than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500x/">Fiat 500X</a>, the 2018 Chevrolet Trax hits the sweet spot for compact-crossover SUV shoppers.</p>, <p>If you’re concerned about value once it comes time to trade up, the Chevy Trax’s low resale figures might make a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/c-hr/">Toyota C-HR</a> or Mazda CX-3 seem a better bet.</p>, <p>All models gain a revised MyLink radio with 7-inch touch screen, while the Premier trim gains forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning as standard. A new Redline Edition package is added to the LT trim’s optional equipment.</p>, <p>Thanks to its small size, tight turning radius and peppy turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, the 2018 Chevrolet Trax makes a great city-commuter car that can pull double duty as a weekend escape artist. The front seats are supportive for long trips and the MyLink infotainment system is thoroughly up to date for integration with the latest smartphone applications from music to navigation. At highway speeds, the Trax’s interior isn’t whisper-quiet, but it is does weed out the most obnoxious types of road noise, making crystal-clear conversation via a Bluetooth-enabled device possible. The Trax’s steering, braking and acceleration are quite good, delivering a predictable driving experience we found quite enjoyable.</p>, <p>APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO<br>
 With the ability to mirror one’s smartphone on the 7-inch MyLink infotainment setup, the Trax allows the driver to bring along navigation, music and even text messages in a safe and easily accessible format.<br>
<br>
 4G LTE Wi-Fi<br>
 Thanks to its built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi, the 2018 Chevy Trax offers its passengers instant access to the net, allowing use of phones, tablets or laptops anywhere a signal is available.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The interior of the Trax is tasteful and modern, highlighted by an attractive dash design incorporating a combination analog-digital gauge cluster, updated infotainment screen and nice soft-touch materials. The updates have certainly increased the visual and functional appeal of the cabin, but it still lags the class leaders in richness and overall aesthetics. With a roomier back seat and more cargo room than some of its sexier competitors, however, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/trax/">Chevrolet Trax</a> offers more of what’s important to many segment shoppers.</p>, <p>Last year’s exterior update helped bring the Trax in line with the newer vehicles in the automaker’s lineup, while giving it a bolder, wider, more confident stance. Around back, the Trax features large taillights that incorporate a highly-sculpted surface. LED headlight accents are available, as are LED taillights. The entry LS model features base-level touches like black (non-body-color) mirrors and steel wheels, while top-line Premier trims are distinguished by a variety of tasteful chrome accents, big 18-inch aluminum wheels and fog lights, among other upgrades.</p>, <p>Even at its starting sticker price of under $22,000 including destination, the 2018 Chevrolet Trax offers a variety of appealing features. A new infotainment system incorporates a 7-inch touch screen, Bluetooth audio streaming, two USB ports, rearview camera, plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The OnStar suite includes five years of basic functionality, plus a 3-month trial of the good stuff like 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot capability, turn-by-turn navigation, automatic crash response and more.</p>, <p>In addition to familiar upgrades like a premium audio system, sunroof, heated Leatherette seats, and remote-sensing keyless unlock with push-button start, the list of 2018 Chevrolet Trax options includes side blind-zone alert, rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision alert, lane-departure warning and rear parking sensors. A new Redline Package for the LT brings 18-inch black-finish wheels and black-out treatment for the grilles, mirror caps, bow-tie emblems and beltline moldings.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chevrolet Trax matches a small, 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with a traditional 6-speed automatic transmission to deliver a satisfying balance of power, responsiveness and fuel economy. Like all of its subcompact-SUV cohorts, the Trax is available in front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD).<br>

Check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2018 Chevy Trax.

---------http://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/volt/2018
[<p>The 2018 Chevrolet Volt achieves a number of milestones without the usual hyperbole that sometimes accompanies manufacturer claims. Its all-electric range of 53 miles is real and more than doubles that of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius%20prime/">Toyota Prius Prime</a>. The Volt’s sleek styling shuns the radical appearance of electrics like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/leaf/">Nissan LEAF</a>, and its ride and handling are on par with non-hybrid cars like the Chevy Cruze. Inside, the Volt delights with a contemporary interior filled with high-tech features such as Apple CarPlay, yet Chevy has learned the intrinsic value of using traditional knobs and buttons over touch and swipe controls. And, while it may appear expensive, after taking the $7,500 federal tax credit the Volt’s pricing falls right in line with the Toyota Prius Prime.</p>, <p>Chevrolet’s 2018 Volt plug-in hybrid holds strong appeal to those looking for a green ride that satisfies their environmental standards, but also has the ability to travel beyond its <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> range without the need for long recharging sessions.</p>, <p>The Volt’s rear quarters are a bit cramped, and its price tag before federal credits is rather steep. While the Volt has nearly double the Toyota Prius Prime’s electric-only range, the Prime’s total range exceeds that of the Volt by nearly 220 miles.</p>, <p>The 2018 Volt LT now offers the Driver Confidence Package that adds side blind-zone alert, rear cross-traffic alert and rear park assist. The LT trim loses its leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, while the Premier trim gains a heated steering wheel that is optional on the LT.</p>, <p>Compared to the first generation, the 2018 Chevy Volt is so much better in every way. A revised engine and electric motor setup permits quicker off-the-line starts, as well as better power delivery for passing and merging. Take the Volt up a twisting mountain pass, and it reveals itself to be the car the Prius wishes it could be. The firm suspension and precise steering allow the Volt to round corners with relatively little drama, retaining a flat stance and an attitude best described as fun (yeah, we said it). Unlike so many other regenerative braking systems we’ve tested, the 2018 Volt’s setup works seamlessly with none of the weirdness between mechanical and regenerative interchange. A clever steering-wheel-mounted paddle activates the Regen On Demand feature. Hold the paddle down and the regenerative braking process is enhanced, rapidly slowing the car while simultaneously recharging the Volt’s battery pack.</p>, <p>53-MILE RANGE<br>
 We gave a collective eye-roll when Chevy told us our Volt test car could travel 53 miles solely on electric power. However, we managed to see 50 miles of EV range while pushing our car hard on a twisting mountain road, just three miles short of the estimated range.<br>
<br>
 APPLE CARPLAY<br>
 With Apple CarPlay, your car’s infotainment system can now mirror the best features of your iPhone. Simply connect the phone, hit the CarPlay icon and you’ll gain access to ITunes, Maps, Siri, text message and more.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> wisely ditched the too-high-tech capacitive buttons and <i>Star Trek</i>-inspired shiny white plastic of the original Volt for a more conventional interior. It was a smart move, and one that works beautifully, with a sensible layout that includes a great new touch-screen infotainment display. A multi-info display between the main gauges lets you use buttons on the steering wheel to monitor speed, battery use and myriad other functions. Front-seat room is fine, but the rear seat is still on the tight side for taller passengers, while the new fifth-seat position is for short trips only.</p>, <p>Apparently, someone in Chevy design decided it would be a good idea for their flagship EV to NOT look dopey. Good call, we say, as the 2018 Volt is maybe the first alternative-fuel vehicle that people will buy simply because they fell in love with its appearance. While it retains the original’s general design theme -- 5-door <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a>; metallic grille inserts; the lightning bolt through the "V" in Volt on the badge -- its execution is spot-on. The proportions look excellent, the wide stance and narrow grille and headlights giving it a distinctly sporty appearance.</p>, <p>The base-model 2018 Chevrolet Volt LT comes very nicely equipped from the get-go. There's push-button start and remote start along with keyless entry, automatic climate control, and 4G LTE OnStar with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. That 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system is standard, as is Apple CarPlay. There's a rearview camera, plus cruise control and a tilt-and-telescope steering wheel with multiple controls for the various audio and infotainment systems. Standard safety equipment counts multiple airbags, including a knee airbag to prevent sliding under the steering wheel in a collision.</p>, <p>The LT can be equipped with heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and heated mirrors, as well as leather seats and Bose audio. A Driver’s Confidence Package is available on both trims and adds blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and rear park assist. The Volt Premier adds a Bose audio system, leather seats and most of the LT’s optional features. Options for the Premier include the Driver Confidence II Package that adds auto high beams, lane-keep assist, adaptive cruise control and forward-collision warning. The Premier is the only model that offers navigation, which costs a mere $495.</p>, <p>There's only one drivetrain for the 2018 Chevrolet Volt, consisting of two parts. There's the range-extending 4-cylinder gasoline engine, which displaces 1.5 liters and puts out 101 horsepower. But it's a generator, there to supply electricity to the electric motor when the 18.4-kWh battery runs out of juice after about 53 miles. Actual motivation for the Volt is thanks to a pair of electric motors with an output of 149 horsepower. A 50-plus-mile range may not sound like much, but Chevrolet notes that about 90 percent of car trips fall within that range, plus the Volt can go up to 420 miles before refueling with regular unleaded. A full recharge takes about 4.5 hours on a 240-volt charger or roughly 13 hours on a standard 120-volt plug.<br>

[<p>Large and luxurious, the new 2018 Chrysler 300 is a full-size American family sedan with a standard 292-horsepower engine and optional all-wheel drive. Buyers can also step up to the optional 363-horsepower 5.7-liter Hemi V8, which gives the rear-wheel-drive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chrysler/300/">Chrysler 300</a> significantly more performance than its front-wheel-drive V6-powered competition like the Chevy Impala, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon/">Toyota Avalon</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/taurus/">Ford Taurus</a>. Both engines are connected to a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission. Five trim levels are available for 2018 starting with the base 300 Touring, for about $32,000. The Touring L model adds standard luxuries like polished 18-inch wheels and lighted rear cup holders, while the sporty 300S gets 300 horsepower. The 300 Limited is all about <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>, and 300C buyers get the big V8 engine standard.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a roomy family sedan with a big trunk, big style and big horsepower, you’ll like the 2018 Chrysler 300. The new 300 delivers a unique combination of full-size, 5-passenger comfort, an elegant and well-appointed interior and the latest in-cabin technology with aggressive styling and horsepower to spare.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a full-size <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> sedan, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon%20hybrid/">Toyota Avalon Hybrid</a> is the only one in the segment. Traditionally the Avalon also offers better <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> and higher crash-test safety ratings than the new Chrysler 300. Also, the very similar <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a> has a significantly lower base price.</p>, <p>For 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> has rejiggered the 300’s trim levels, adding the entry-level 300 Touring model with a cloth interior and standard 17-inch wheels as well as the Touring L. Chrysler has also made the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 standard on the top 300C while it remains optional on the 300S.</p>, <p>Chrysler’s new 300 sedan can be summed up with a few choice words: “comfortable, quiet and powerful.” The 300 offers plenty of gusto, even from its standard V6 engine. The available 363-horsepower Hemi V8 delivers heart-stopping acceleration, its 8-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission is smooth and precise, and a Sport mode that tweaks the transmission’s shift points is standard on the 300S and 300C. Straight-line performance is outstanding, but on models other than the 300S and 300C, cornering is not the big and heavy Chrysler’s most admirable quality -- although it can easily outmaneuver a Toyota Avalon or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/azera/">Hyundai Azera</a>. The additional thrust and exhaust rumble of the V8 are certainly desirable, but the best combination of performance, efficiency and price is the V6-powered 300S with a light smattering of optional equipment. And if you live in the land of snow and ice, all-wheel drive (AWD) is a worthwhile expense.</p>, <p>ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br/> Despite the growing popularity of all-wheel-drive <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, it’s still not a very common feature in the full-size-sedan segment. It is available as an option on four of the five Chrysler 300 models for an additional $2,500. It’s also offered on the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/lacrosse/">Buick LaCrosse</a>, Dodge Charger and Ford Taurus.<br/> <br/> HEMI V8 Power<br/> Also unique in its class is the new Chrysler 300’s available Hemi V8, which is optional on the 300S and standard under the hood of the top 300C model. It’s the only V8 engine in the full-size family-sedan segment, competing with a long list of smaller less-powerful V6s.<br/> </p>, <p>Inside the 2018 Chrysler 300 you’re met with a mix of modern technology, traditional craftsmanship and the kind of expansive space you expect in a full-size American family sedan. The new Chrysler 300 seats five passengers in comfort. Rear-seat legroom is ample and the Chrysler’s heated and cooled front bucket seats are pampering. At over 16 cubic feet, the trunk is also large, and the rear seats fold flat for added flexibility. We’re also fans of the 300’s unusual rotary shift knob, its traditional analog clock, which adds a touch of class, and the large 8.4-inch touch screen that’s easy to reach.</p>, <p>With its hard lines, small greenhouse and wide stance, the new Chrysler 300 defines the look of American luxury sedans. It manages to be full country club, very CEO and a little bit gangster all at the same time. It’s a distinctive design and it continues to exude an aggressive elegance as it struts down the road. The more sporting 300S model has blacked-out elements. Chrysler offers Sport Appearance and Chrome Appearance packages on the entry-level 300 Touring model, both of which include 20-inch wheels. The top Hemi-powered 300C model gets Platinum Chrome on its grille and trim.</p>, <p>The base 300 Touring model includes dual-zone climate control, 8-way-power driver's seat, keyless entry, dash-mounted analog clock, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a split fold-down rear seat and 17-inch aluminum wheels. Entertainment is provided by a 6-speaker AM/FM/satellite radio with USB input and Bluetooth streaming. Higher trims come with rearview camera, panoramic sunroof, leather interior, heated and cooled front seats, a tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, navigation and power-operated rear sunshade. In addition to the 8.4-inch touch-screen display with Chrysler's easy-to-use Uconnect information and entertainment system, all models come with a snazzy 7-inch information display between the analog tachometer and speedometer.</p>, <p>Several packages and individual options are available on the new 2018 Chrysler 300. Among them are upgraded audio systems by Beats or harman/kardon. Optional safety and driver-assist features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning and lane-departure warning. Traction-enhancing all-wheel drive (AWD) is available across trims on V6 models in place of the standard rear-wheel drive (RWD). In addition to interior features and more aggressive exterior design cues, the sportier 300S and 300C models come with paddle shifters and performance-tuned suspension. The Limited trim is loaded with quilted Nappa leather seats, hand-sanded wood accents and 20-inch wheels.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chrysler 300 comes with the highly lauded 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 as standard across all four of its five trim levels. In 300S models it has slightly more power -- 300 horsepower -- while in the 300 Touring, 300 Touring L and 300 Limited it makes 292 horsepower. AWD is optional with this engine. Available on the 300S and standard on the 300C is a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine good for 363 horsepower. Both engines are connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The V6 is rated up to 30 mpg highway, commendable for such a large car. The powerful V8 achieves a high of 25 mpg. Cars with either engine can run on regular unleaded, though mid-grade 89 octane is recommended for the V8.<br>

Adding AWD to V6 models is an additional $2,500 and the rear-drive-only Hemi V8 option is an extra $3,000 on the 300S. Fully loaded, a Chrysler 300 can hover near the $50,000 mark. At its starting price, a new Chrysler 300 costs about $1,000 more than a Ford Taurus and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/impala/">Chevrolet Impala</a>, and several thousands less than the Toyota Avalon and Hyundai Azera.

From its sleek, low-slung exterior to its ultra-luxurious dash and interior design, the Pacifica banishes all memories of the old Town &amp; Country, and even makes newer minivans like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sienna/">Toyota Sienna</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/odyssey/">Honda Odyssey</a> look outdated. Still present are Chrysler’s brilliant Stow ‘n Go stowable 2nd-row seats, joined by myriad high-tech features such as adaptive cruise control, an around-view camera and even a built-in vacuum cleaner (yeah, they stole that one from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a>). The Pacifica even tops the segment in fuel economy thanks to its class-exclusive <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a family van with the styling chops of a sleek <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica is your best bet.

Price-conscious buyers will find they get more bang for the buck from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sedona/">Kia Sedona</a>, while those needing maximum interior room should look to the Honda Odyssey.</p>, <p>For 2018, the hybrid model gains a new Touring Plus trim, while a new lower-priced L trim is added to the gasoline version. New standard equipment includes ParkSense rear-park assist, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also standard, and a host of new packages and equipment joins the option sheet.</p>, <p>With its standard 3.6-liter V6 being one of the most powerful engines in its class, the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica delivers an extremely satisfying on-road performance. The V6 is attached to an improved 9-speed automatic transmission that has been reworked to deliver maximum performance and fuel economy. On the open road, the Pacifica’s handling isn’t sporty, but it is competent, with a very comfortable ride, firm steering and excellent brakes. In sharp curves, the Pacifica will lean a bit, but not so much that it feels like a Slinky creeping down a set of stairs. The interior is remarkably quiet, not only devoid of excessive road and wind noise, but those annoying squeaks and rattles that often accompany minivan interiors. In these areas and more, Chrysler’s new Pacifica and Pacifica Plug-in Hybrid are way ahead of rivals like the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey, with the hybrid offering similar acceleration and an easily achievable 33 miles of electric-only range. Unlike the Honda and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a>, however, the Pacifica’s long-term reliability and resale have yet to be determined.</p>, <p>STOW 'N GO<br>
Unique to the minivan world are Chrysler’s Stow ‘n Go 2nd-row seats. Where other minivans require you to manually remove and store the seats, the Pacifica’s fold flush into the floor. And, unlike the seats in the old Town &amp; Country, the Pacifica’s seats are actually now comfortable on long trips.<br>
<br>
PLUG-IN HYBRID POWERTRAIN<br>
Unique to the minivan world, the Pacifica Hybrid offers 7-passenger seating and excellent fuel economy thanks to an advanced plug-in hybrid powertrain that can run up to 33 miles solely on electric power. With a combined mpg city/highway rating of 84 MPGe (32 mpg on gasoline only), it’s the most fuel-efficient minivan on the market.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Chrysler Pacifica's interior design speaks for itself, as a quick glance at the pictures shows. What you don't see is the practicality. The comfortable front, 2nd-row and even 3rd-row seats can all handle adult frames. The Stow 'n Go 2nd<sup> </sup>-row seats are finally comfortable, and a removable center seat means there's 8-passenger seating. The power hatch opens quickly to showcase an enormous cargo well. Options include a massive Uconnect infotainment screen in front, and a panoramic roof that looks cool, but eliminates the center position in the second row due to the lack of an upper-seatbelt anchor. Total cargo volume of 140.5 cubic feet is slightly less than the segment-leading Honda Odyssey’s 148.5.</p>, <p>The 2018 Chrysler Pacifica successfully borrows design cues we've seen on the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chrysler/200/">Chrysler 200</a> midsize sedan. The headlights, grille and entire front end present a distinct and handsome face to the minivan world. In a way it's a throwback to the Chrysler <a alt_o_t="Vans" href="/van-minivan/">vans</a> of the 1990s and early 2000s, which boasted sleek, smooth lines. The elegant styling continues to the sides, where you can order wheels up to 20 inches across for a more dramatic look. The Pacifica Hybrid offers a unique color palette and wheels, a different grille design and, of course, the charge port on the front-left fender.</p>, <p>While the new L trim is inexpensive, we’d recommend the LX that features a rearview camera, active grille shutters to aid fuel economy, heated outside mirrors, 17-inch aluminum wheels, 3-zone air conditioning, blind-spot monitoring, parking sensors and rear cross-traffic alert. Also standard are Stow 'n Go seating in the second row, and surprisingly, active noise cancellation. There's also a 7-inch touch-screen version of Uconnect that includes USB, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. All new Pacifica models come standard with the 3.6-liter V6 engine, 9-speed automatic, an electric parking brake, and keyless entry with push-button. The Pacifica Hybrid models start at the Touring Plus level and feature much of the same equipment as their gasoline counterparts.</p>, <p>Power sliding doors, automatic climate control, bigger and better Uconnect systems with Wi-Fi, leather seating -- Nappa leather on the Limited -- and chrome exterior trim are all available at higher trim levels on the Pacifica. Option packages include a 20-speaker harman/kardon audio system for Touring-L Plus and Limited models, an Advanced SafetyTec group that includes lane-departure warning plus, forward-collision warning plus, adaptive cruise control, and a surround-view camera system, and the kid-occupying goodness of Uconnect Theater. Pacifica Hybrid models start at the Touring Plus and move up to Limited, which is mostly analogous to the gasoline-powered Limited, with a panoramic sunroof being the only stand-alone option.</p>, <p>Standard Pacifica models get a 3.6-liter V6 engine and 9-speed automatic transmission powering the front wheels, with 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, making it one of the most powerful minivans you can buy. But fuel efficiency still matches the Honda Odyssey on the highway and in combined scores, and is just one mpg behind in the city. The engine is a gem, delivering smooth power across its rev range, and it even sounds good doing it. The 9-speed automatic shifts smoothly at cruise, going up and down hills, or at full throttle. Pacifica Hybrid models get a version of the same engine designed to run on a more fuel-friendly Atkinson-cycle engine plus two electric motors for a combined output of 260 horsepower.<br>

The LX starts about $1,800 more, however we think the Touring is a better bet, thanks to power sliding doors and other features for around $33,300. The Pacifica Touring-L (around $36,600) and Touring-L Plus (around $39,800) add equipment like leather seats, and the Pacifica Limited (around $44,800) adds even more. The Pacifica Hybrid Touring Plus starts just under $44,000 and moves up from there, but note that the federal tax break knocks $7,500 off the hybrid’s price, making it a surprisingly good deal. Even though options can push the price of a Pacifica Limited to well over the $45,000 mark, it's still competitive against the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna and Kia Sedona. Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. As far as holding its resale value goes, the Pacifica is a strong player, not quite up to the levels of the Odyssey or Sienna, but on par with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/quest/">Nissan Quest</a> and healthier than the rest of the pack.</p>]

Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. As far as holding its resale value goes, the Pacifica is a strong player, not quite up to the levels of the Odyssey or Sienna, but on par with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/quest/">Nissan Quest</a> and healthier than the rest of the pack.</p>]

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/dodge/challenger/2018/">2018 Dodge Challenger</a> is the muscle-car that can do it all. From the entry-level model with its 305-horsepower V6 and available all-wheel drive, to increasingly hairy chested V8 models ranging all the way to the supercharged <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/srt/">SRT</a> Hellcat and SRT Demon, this 5-passenger 2-door blends classic muscle car cues and performance with all the modern technology you could want. Its interior offers comfortable seating, high-tech features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a surprisingly quiet and refined ride. It even boasts 5-star crash-test ratings from the Department of Transportation. But lest you think this car is too practical, make no mistake: There's no <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/mustang/">Ford Mustang</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/camaro/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> that can match the Hellcat's 707 horsepower, much less the drag-race-ready Demon's 840 horses. This is as serious as muscle gets.</p>, <p>Whether you want to go fast or not, the 2018 Challenger is a terrific looking car, with clean lines that blend classic proportions with modern design. It offers a V6 with all-wheel drive, or if you absolutely must win the horsepower wars with your buddies, the SRT Hellcat offers 707, and the SRT Demon offers 840.</p>, <p>The Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro are both lighter than the Challenger, and notably smaller, and both offer V8 engines that are also comically powerful and better handling on the kinds of twisty roads that many enthusiasts enjoy. Plus, both are available as <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a>, while the Challenger is coupe-only.</p>, <p>The big news is the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/dodge/">Dodge</a> SRT Demon, a Challenger-based drag-race special with a supercharged V8 engine putting out a whopping 840 horsepower on 100-octane fuel. Other news includes the Hellcat Widebody, which includes wider tires for better handling, and various changes to trim and color, including the return of Plum Crazy.<b></b></p>, <p>From the base Challenger SXT to the ridiculous SRT Demon, all Challengers are satisfying to drive, albeit in different ways. The base car's 305-horsepower V6 provides plenty of day-to-day power, and you can even get the all-weather security of all-wheel drive -- unique to the class -- in the GT. Models powered by either the 5.7-liter or 6.4-liter V8 lean more toward performance. That latter engine used to be the top line, and its 485 horsepower moves the Challenger with extreme gusto. These days, the SRT Hellcat and SRT Demon occupy the top spot, with a supercharged 6.2-liter V8. The Hellcat is now available in a Widebody model that adds bigger wheels and tires for better handling, while the Demon is designed for trips to the drag strip. Yet the Challenger -- even the Hellcat -- is no challenge as a daily driver thanks to its comfortable suspension and relatively quiet interior.</p>, <p>ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
 Muscle cars are all about burnouts and youthful exuberance, but the 2018 Dodge Challenger GT adds the responsibility of all-wheel drive (AWD) to the mix. The Challenger is the only muscle car to offer AWD, meaning it'll be the first choice for skiers and buyers in snowy climates.<br>
<br>
SRT DEMON<br>
 The 2018 Dodge SRT Demon is sold out, unfortunately, but we admire the car for its sheer ridiculousness, and its power. Able to put out 840 horsepower on race gasoline, the Demon is a pure drag-racer, complete with drag radials, a deleted rear and passenger seat, and race-ready driver assists built in.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You'd never know that the Challenger was capable of shenanigans from its pleasant and comfortable interior. The touch screen in the center is an old friend, enhanced this year with Uconnect 8.4, which brings Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There's a retro feel that still looks modern, and we like the big driver info center between the main gauges. No doubt, the thick rear pillars take some getting used to, but blind-spot warning and a backup camera make the Challenger easy to drive. The rear seat can actually fit three across, unusual for this class, and the trunk is actually enormous, albeit with a high liftover.</p>, <p>The Challenger's classic long-hood/short-deck proportions and wide stance grumble performance in every single model, and with their flared fenders and other details, the Hellcat Widebody and SRT Demon shout it outright. Details like hood scoops, badging and optional stripes throw in a retro feel. It just looks cool, successfully fighting the urge to be overly old-fashioned and remains sleek and modern with a timeless appeal and the masculine swagger of an MMA champion. And if that swagger isn’t enough you can also get some of the bright colors with the fun names from back in the day, like IndiGO Blue and Plum Crazy.</p>, <p>The 2018 Dodge Challenger SXT comes with the V6 engine, a Uconnect infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touch screen that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, with Bluetooth, USB and auxiliary inputs, 2-zone automatic climate control, remote start and a host of additional convenience features. There are 16 different Challenger models, each with its own list of "standard" equipment, but generally the higher up you go the more stuff you get. Hounds-tooth cloth seats are standard on SXT, R/T, R/T Shaker and R/T Scat Pack models. An 8-speed automatic transmission is standard on V6 models and optional on V8 models.</p>, <p>The Challenger GT adds all-wheel drive to V6 models, while Challenger R/T, R/T Plus, T/A, T/A Plus, RT/Shaker, R/T Plus Shaker get the 5.7-liter V8. We recommend the Performance Handling Package for 5.7-liter models to upgrade the suspension and brakes. Challenger R/T Scat Pack, T/A 392, 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker, and SRT 392 all come with the bigger V8 and generally nicer interiors and equipment levels. The supercharged SRT Hellcat and Hellcat Widebody are basically loaded from the factory. The (sold out) SRT Demon is actually stripped of its rear and passenger seats, although both can be added for $1. We recommend the Uconnect 8.4 system, which enhances the infotainment with a bigger screen and navigation.</p>, <p>The 3.6-liter V6 in SXT and GT models sends its 305 horsepower to either the rear or all four wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 5.7-liter V8 in the R/T and T/A variants makes 375 horsepower with a 6-speed manual transmission or 372 with the 8-speed automatic. The R/T Scat Pack, 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker, T/A 392 and SRT 392 share the same 485-horsepower 6.4-liter V8. The SRT Hellcat adds a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 with 707 horsepower, which would make it the king of the hill if it weren't for the 840-horsepower (on race gas) SRT Demon. All V8-powered challengers except the Demon can be ordered with a 6-speed manual transmission, but the 8-speed automatic doesn't shortchange performance. Obviously, none of these cars are fuel-economy kings, although the V6 models aren't bad.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Dodge Charger isn’t your typical full-size family <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>. Where competitors like the front-drive (FWD) <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon/">Toyota Avalon</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/impala/">Chevrolet Impala</a> impart a sporty look, the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a> displays a rowdy, all-American bravado backed up by a team of powerful engine options, including a 707-horsepower Hemi V8 found in the Charger <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/srt/">SRT</a> Hellcat. Of course, not every family has $66,000 to drop on a car, which is why it’s nice that even the least expensive Charger still offers a potent yet fuel-efficient 292-horsepower V6 engine, great handling, a roomy interior and plenty of features. A huge number of trims means just about every base is covered, and while all-wheel drive is on the table, there is no <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> or diesel-engine option.</p>, <p>If you need a roomy, comfortable family car, but you still have a youthful side that yearns for 1960s-era styling and performance, the 2018 Dodge Charger sedan is the logical choice. A dizzying choice of models, options, colors and engines is a rarity these days, and much appreciated.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for the newest design, the most comfortable ride or the best fuel economy, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fusion/">Ford Fusion</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon%20hybrid/">Toyota Avalon hybrid</a> makes a better choice. The Impala’s standard front-wheel drive is a better choice in the snow, and the Charger’s reliability and resale history still lag behind most of its rivals.</p>, <p>New for 2018 is the GT trim with a 300-horsepower V6 engine and all-wheel drive. The SXT Plus can be equipped with upgraded performance-look styling, while new standard equipment includes Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a rearview camera and rear parking sensors. The SE trim has been dropped.</p>, <p>The Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 delivers 292 horsepower in the base 2018 Charger SXT sedan, and 300 horsepower in the new GT trim with standard all-wheel drive. The automaker’s notorious 8-speed automatic seems to work well here, delivering smooth gear changes without the annoying gear hunting we’ve experienced in other vehicles. Good as they are, the V6 cars are far less appealing than the Hemi-powered models. A 5.7-liter V8 in the R/T and Daytona delivers a tire-spinning 370 horsepower, while the R/T Scat Pack, Daytona 392 and SRT 392 trims get a 485-horsepower 6.4-liter Hemi V8. For our money, the R/T Scat Pack is the best combination of power, price and drivability. Of course, if you can lay hands on one, the 707-horsepower Charger SRT Hellcat is the one to buy, drive sparingly and then put into storage for the next 40 years. In general, the entire Charger line is smooth and responsive.</p>, <p>BEATS AUDIO<br>
The Charger’s Uconnect system is widely regarded as one of the best infotainment systems in the industry, but it gets even better when connected to the 10-speaker, 552-watt Beats Audio setup. Need more sound? There’s a 19-speaker GreenEdge harman/kardon system on upper level trims.<br>
<br>
6.2-LITER HELLCAT SUPERCHARGED V8<br>
Befitting its title as the most powerful American sedan ever built, the Charger SRT Hellcat is equipped with a 707-horsepower, 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi V8 that simply puts all other V8 engines to shame, regardless of price and pedigree.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Inviting, comfortable and functional, the interior of the 2018 the Dodge Charger is a pleasant place to spend time. Cockpit-style, the instrument panel angles all the working stuff toward the driver, the gauge cluster is configurable for individual preferences, and there are numerous controls mounted on the steering wheel. In the center is an available 8.4-inch touch screen, and it and the Uconnect infotainment system are a couple of features we recommend. Front seats are comfortable for long trips, the rear bench will handle three adults and the entire well-designed presentation is also easy on the eyes.</p>, <p>This is no wallflower. No shrinking violet. No wolf in sheep’s clothing. No cliché. The Dodge Charger for 2018 looks like what it is: a modern American sedan with plenty of horsepower. It looks tough. It looks mean. It looks you right in the eye. Despite a roofline and overall shape unmistakably linked to previous Chargers built from 1968-1970, this sedan successfully fights being old-fashioned and remains sleek and modern front to rear. Its smoothly rounded nose makes obvious aerodynamic contributions, and the attractive rear includes Dodge’s distinctive layout of the “racetrack” taillight arrangement, which certainly stands out in after-dark traffic.</p>, <p>LED daytime running lights, acoustic front glass and windshield, power windows with express front up/down, rearview camera, rear parking sensors, 7-inch touch screen with Uconnect 4, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are all standard features on the base 2018 Dodge Charger SXT. Also standard are chrome exhaust tips, auto headlights that turn themselves on and off, power mirrors, 17-inch wheels and tires and an electronic reconfigurable gauge cluster. The standard powertrain is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with a strong 292 horsepower backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Trim levels are tied closely to engine choices, with corresponding moves upward not only in performance but also in features and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>. Depending on the trim level and options chosen you can have a Charger with a base price well under $30 grand or well over $60,000, and with horsepower just under 300 or more than twice that. Major options include a power sunroof, Beats by Dr. Dre and harman/kardon sound systems, and several packages: Super Track Pak, Technology Group, Driver Confidence Group, Navigation and others. Forward emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring are available in the Premium Group.</p>, <p>The 2018 Charger sedan is available with four engine choices. Standard in the SXT and GT models is a very likable 3.6-liter V6 with 292 horsepower (300 in the SXT Plus w/Super Track Pack, GT and GT Plus) and plenty of performance for just about anybody. Next up is a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 of 370 horsepower, in R/T and Daytona versions. It’s one more step to a 6.4-liter Hemi of 485 horsepower, in R/T Scat Pack and Daytona 392 and SRT 392 trims. And, if a 485-horsepower Hemi isn’t quite enough, there’s the 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi in the SRT Hellcat, with 707 horsepower. In all cases, the transmission is an 8-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive (RWD). All-wheel drive (AWD) is standard on the GT trim.<br>

The 707-horsepower SRT Hellcat is right around $66,000, and has to be an all-time performance bargain.

[<p>With the capabilities of a full-size SUV like the Chevy Tahoe, but the smaller package of a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a>, the 2018 Dodge Durango occupies a unique spot in the modern SUV market. With V8 power -- including an all-new <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/srt/">SRT</a> model with 475 horsepower -- the Durango can tow with the big boys, up to 8,600 pounds. Yet the size and interior both target smaller <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the Honda Pilot, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevrolet Traverse</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a>. Prices span from about $31,000 for a base model, all the way up to the $65,000 for the Durango SRT. That's not cheap, but there's nothing else on the market that combines the kind of 3-row capability, family-friendly utility, and high performance at that price.</p>, <p>If you want a <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUV</a>, but you also want the power and torque of a V8 engine, the Durango is just about the only choice you have. It also looks great, offers decent passenger space for up to seven, and can tow heavy loads.</p>, <p>Fuel economy isn't among the Durango's strengths with the V6 trailing midsize-crossover SUVs, and even the V8 losing the fuel-economy race to the Chevy Tahoe. If you don't need that extra capability, crossover SUVs like the Honda Pilot, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/explorer/">Ford Explorer</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/pathfinder/">Nissan Pathfinder</a> offer better economy.</p>, <p>Big news this year is power: The 2018 Dodge Durango SRT offers up 475 horsepower, 470 lb-ft of torque, and up to 8,600 pounds of towing capacity thanks to its 6.4-liter V8 engine and all-wheel drive. All Durango models with the 8.4-inch Uconnect touch screen come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The V8 engines in the Durango get the headlines, but the reality is that the V6 is actually quite good. It can haul up to 6,400 pounds, and it offers smooth and refined performance, the 8-speed proving a good match overall despite the occasional hunt for the right gear. That said, the two V8s on offer are pretty cool. There's the 5.7-liter version, with 360 horsepower and up to 7,400 pounds of towing capacity. It sounds great, offers quick acceleration and plenty of passing power. Then there's the new-for-2018 Durango SRT, with 475 horsepower and up to 8,600 pounds of towing capability. It's even quicker, hitting 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds, and it sounds terrific while doing it. Best of all, the Durango -- even the sporty SRT model -- offers a comfortable ride and quiet interior when just cruising around, with plenty of space for its seven passengers.</p>, <p>DURANGO SRT<br/> Of course this is our favorite thing about the Durango, and why not? With 475 horsepower, 6-passenger seating, more than four tons of towing capacity, and 0-60 mph in about 4.4 seconds, the Durango SRT is the complete package.<br/> <br/> Uconnect 8.4<br/> The Uconnect system in <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/dodge/">Dodge</a> (and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jeep/">Jeep</a> vehicles) is one of the best touch-screen infotainment systems available. The latest version revamps the interface for a cleaner appearance, ups the usability, and adds Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Dodge Durango's interior feels like a higher quality place than many of its crossover-SUV competitors, especially in high-end Citadel models with their heated and ventilated front seats, and heated 2nd-row seating. Most models offer a choice between a bench or captain's chairs in the second row; the latter makes accessing the third row easier, and makes it easier to use a booster seat. Cargo space behind the third row is so-so, but the 3rd-row seats fold, and you can even fold down the front passenger seat for really long objects. Citadel and SRT models can be ordered with faux-suede headliners.</p>, <p>The Durango's exterior styling is exactly aggressive enough without going overboard, even in base models. The clean lines get dressed up with LED headlight accents, a big crosshair grille in varying trims -- chrome or body color -- and the rear end sports a tailgate-wide red LED "racetrack-taillight" design that's exceptionally distinctive at night. Chrome fans should look to the base SXT or the especially blingtastic Citadel; the monochrome look on the mid-level GT and R/T and super-quick SRT are more subtle alternatives. The SRT sports a unique hood and front end with extra vents to help cool the big V8.</p>, <p>The base model 2018 Dodge Durango SXT comes with seating for five passengers, the V6, and interestingly, a Sport mode for a better driving experience. It also comes with a 7.0-inch Uconnect touch-screen infotainment system that includes an AM/FM/CD radio, WMA/MP3 support, Bluetooth, Sirius satellite radio and auxiliary input jack. There are also a tilt/telescope steering wheel and 3-zone automatic climate control, and outside you get 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. Of course, if you work your way up the model line you get more standard equipment, such as a power liftgate and sunroof, navigation, Nappa leather seats, and more.</p>, <p>Choices facing 2018 Dodge Durango shoppers range from the number of seats (up to seven passengers with the 2nd-row bench and third row), to the engine (a V6 and two V8s) and which wheels to send power to. Beyond that there's the 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system with navigation, and an LCD multifunction display between the main gauges. Blacktop and Brass Monkey appearance packages add exterior upgrades, while a Technology Group adds active cruise control, collision warning with automatic braking, and other safety systems. For towing, get the 220-amp alternator, heavy-duty engine oil cooler, Class IV hitch receiver and load-leveling rear shocks.</p>, <p>The base 3.6-liter V6 is a surprisingly good choice for the 2018 Durango. With 295 horsepower it accelerates just fine, has decent passing power, and saves fuel compared to the V8 engines. Optional on R/T and Citadel models is the 5.7-liter V8, which offers up 360 horsepower and 7,400 pounds of towing capacity, along with a satisfying V8 roar. Of course, if you're looking for the ultimate Durango, there's the 6.4-liter V8 under the hood of the new Durango SRT. With 475 horsepower it leaves competitors in the dust. All engines come with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and the V8s deactivate four of their eight cylinders under light loads. Rear-wheel and all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD) are available, with AWD standard on the SRT.<br>

Options add up, but you can still get a reasonably priced V8-powered Durango for the low $50,000 range, which isn't bad.

The Durango will likely hold its value about as well as a Chevrolet Traverse, but likely fall short of the Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer.</p>]

[<p>It’s no secret that families today are picking midsize-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> as their primary mode of transportation, yet the <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a> still holds a place for those needing maximum cargo and flexibility. This is why the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/dodge/">Dodge</a> Grand Caravan still exists, and although its Town &amp; Country twin has been replaced by the sleek new Pacifica, the Grand Caravan lumbers on offering a powerful standard engine, unique stowable 2nd-row seats and a base price neither the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/odyssey/">Honda Odyssey</a> nor <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sienna/">Toyota Sienna</a> can touch. Of course, stylistically the Grand Caravan has all the appeal of a sardine can on wheels, but you don’t buy a minivan to impress your office mates, you buy it for its cavernous hold, numerous safety features and comfortable ride.</p>, <p>If you don’t care about image but do care about a big, roomy, powerful and safe way to move you and your family to and fro, the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan is it. A low base price and plenty of features make sealing the deal all the easier.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for cutting-edge design, advanced driver-assist features, all-wheel drive or a strong resale and reliability history, you’re going to have to shop one of the Grand Caravan’s competitors.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Dodge Grand Caravan carries over with no major changes.</p>, <p>There’s nothing thrilling or out of the ordinary about the way the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan drives, unless of course you consider the rapid straight-line acceleration produced by the 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V6. Although the Honda Odyssey and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/quest/">Nissan Quest</a> are better drivers, it’s not by much, and the Grand Caravan has a softer ride that actually is quite comfortable. The V6’s ample power is much appreciated both when passing and merging, as well as when pulling a loaded <a alt_o_t="Van" href="/van-minivan/">van</a> up steep grades. When properly equipped, the Grand Caravan can tow up to 3,600 pounds. One area the Grand Caravan isn’t so grand is maneuverability. Its massive size and wide turning radius don’t make for graceful parking-lot maneuvers, and unlike its Pacifica sibling, the Grand Caravan lacks the latest infotainment and collision-avoidance systems.</p>, <p>3.6-LITER V6 ENGINE<br>
 If you think a V6 can never match the pulling and passing power of a V8, you need to test drive the 2018 Grand Caravan. The standard Pentastar V6 offers excellent power for passing and merging, yet it manages to return an EPA highway fuel-economy rating of 25 mpg.<br>
<br>
 LOW PRICE<br>
 Slotting in just under $27,000, the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan undercuts the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna by about $3,000, yet still features a number of standard items that are optional or unavailable on the competition.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Grand Caravan offers a clever and comfortable interior for its seven passengers. One of its aces is cargo flexibility, primarily due to the Stow 'n Go 2nd-row seats, which quickly fold into the floor to maximize cargo space without removing the heavy seats. The downside is that this limits the Grand Caravan to only seven passengers, unlike most of its competitors, which can seat up to eight. Those seven have comfortable seats, two available rear video screens and plenty of other amenities. The driver gets a nicely designed instrument panel and plenty of knickknack space.</p>, <p>If you think form should follow function, you're going to love what Dodge has done with the 2018 Grand Caravan. It's not ugly by any means, but the plain wraps around a very functional and family-friendly vehicle. The two sliding doors are a godsend to anybody who's ever been trapped in a crowded parking lot, and they're available with a power sliding mechanism as well. If there's not enough cargo space behind the third row, the Stow 'n Place roof-rack system uses swiveling roof-rack crossbars that can be stowed away, out of sight, in the side rails.</p>, <p>The base Grand Caravan SE comes pretty well equipped, starting with the 283-horsepower engine, 17-inch wheel covers, remote keyless entry and air conditioning in front and in the rear. It also comes with a tilt/telescope steering wheel, rearview camera, power windows, power locks, steering-wheel-mounted controls for the 6-speaker audio system and cruise control, storage bins hidden in the floor in front of the 2nd-row seats, electronic traction and stability control, and front, front side-impact and full-length side-curtain airbags. The SXT adds a power driver’s seat, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels, power-sliding side doors and liftgate plus the Stow ‘n Place roof rack.</p>, <p>The Grand Caravan SE offers a DVD entertainment system and Uconnect hands-free package while the SXT can be equipped with the Driver’s Convenience Group that adds overhead consoles, tri-zone air conditioning, heated steering wheel and heated front seats, 2nd- and 3rd-row side-window sunshades, a garage-door opener, Uconnect voice command, overhead ambient lighting and rear swiveling reading lamps. This same package on the GT trim adds heated 2nd-row seats. All Grand Caravans can be equipped with the Safety Sphere Group that brings rear cross-traffic detection, rear parking sensors and a blind-spot monitor.</p>, <p>Only one engine is available for the 2018 Dodge Grand Caravan: a 3.6-liter V6 engine with 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Known as the Pentastar, it's an excellent V6 engine, delivering smooth power and pretty good fuel economy. The engine gets paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission that delivers smooth shift action and, unlike some other transmissions in other vehicles, doesn't have the annoying characteristic of continually "hunting" for the correct gear. Finally, the V6 is E85-compatible, so it can operate on blends of gasoline and ethanol.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/25 mpg (gasoline), 12/18 mpg (E85)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Dodge’s Grand Caravan SE for 2018 carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $27,000, including the destination charge. The SE Plus adds about $2,700 to that price, but the $32,600 SXT model offers the best blend of features and price, in our opinion. The GT starts just under $35,600 and with options can run into the $39,000 range. The Dodge's price advantage over the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna is clear: The base price on a Sienna L and Honda Odyssey LX is nearly $3,000 higher than a Grand Caravan SE. Before heading to the dealer, be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. Also, note that while the prices are lower in the beginning, the Dodge doesn't hold its value as well as its Japanese or Korean competitors.</p>]

[<p>When the topic of 7-passenger <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> arises, the 2018 Dodge Journey often gets overlooked. That’s a shame because the Journey has some very appealing qualities. The 4-cylinder SE is the lowest-priced 3-row SUV on the market, undercutting the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/santa%20fe/">Hyundai Santa Fe</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sorento/">Kia Sorento</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/flex/">Ford Flex</a> by thousands. Granted, the 4-cylinder isn’t very powerful, but you can upgrade to a 283-horsepower V6, as well as all-wheel drive and numerous features ranging from an excellent 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system to a heated steering wheel. The Crossroad trim offers light off-road possibilities, and hefty leasing rebates from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> further sweeten the Journey’s appeal. However, if you’re looking for superior reliability, advanced driver-assist systems or high resale figures, the Journey may not be the best choice.</p>, <p>Thanks to generous lease deals this year, consumers can get into a nicely equipped V6 Journey for well under $30,000. Stay with the 4-cylinder SE and the price drops to around $23,600. Standard 7-passenger seating and a roomy cargo area further the Journey’s appeal, as does Chrysler’s excellent UConnect infotainment system.</p>, <p>The Journey’s 3rd-row seat is rather small, especially when compared with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevrolet Traverse</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a>. The <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a> Sorrento offers a better warranty while the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a> comes with standard driver-assist features unavailable on the Journey. And all of these models have better reliability and resale numbers.</p>, <p>For 2018, the number of Journey trims drops to four: SE, SXT, Crossroad and GT. All Journey trims now come standard with a 3rd-row seat. The Crossroad gains new “Black Noise” 19-inch wheels, while the Blacktop Package is now offered on the SE.</p>, <p>Dimensionally, the 2018 Dodge Journey reminds us more of a big <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/wagon/">wagon</a> than it does an SUV, but no matter how you see it, Dodge’s 7-passenger <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV is as versatile as it is affordable. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/dodge/">Dodge</a> has done a good job with the Journey’s suspension, allowing it to deliver a comfortable ride with good cornering abilities. The nicely weighted steering feels good in the turns, but the Journey will lean when pushed hard. We appreciate the Journey’s upright seating position and found the front seats to be supportive and comfortable, even after driving long distances. As for power, while the 4-cylinder’s 173 horsepower can pull a fully loaded Journey, we think most people will be much happier with the 283-horsepower V6 and 6-speed transmission. Not only is the engine better suited to the Journey’s size, it actually manages fuel-economy figures nearly identical to the smaller 4-cylinder.</p>, <p>CARGO FLEXIBILITY<br>
 From the built-in 2nd-row floor storage bins to the compartment beneath the front-passenger seat, there’s no shortage of places to hide belongings from prying eyes. A flat-folding passenger seat creates a level load floor from the rear hatch right up to the glove compartment.<br>
<br>
 3.6-LITER PENTASTAR V6 ENGINE<br>
 Powerful, refined and fuel-efficient, the Journey’s optional 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 is one of the best in the business. Available on the SE, SXT and Crossroad, and standard on the GT and all-wheel-drive models, this engine is one of the Journey’s most appealing features.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Every 2018 Dodge Journey's cabin now comes standard with 3-row, 7-passenger seating. Passenger space for adults is commendable up front and good in the second row, but legroom is very tight in the third row, which is best left for kids or occasional use. One of the best features of the Journey is its available Uconnect infotainment system. In addition to a large and easy-to-use 8.4-inch touch screen centered in the dash, there are supplementary buttons for climate and audio that are simple to see and use.</p>, <p>Is it a sport-utility vehicle or the reincarnation of a station wagon? With the 2018 Journey from Dodge, its 192.4-inch length exceeds much of the competition, but Dodge's designers have given it exterior treatments such as the chrome-trimmed cross-hair grille and eye-catching aluminum-alloy wheel choices that keep it from being merely bland. If a more stylish look is important, opt for the R/T version, with its 19-inch wheels, monochromatic treatment and distinctive R/T labels. For a tougher-looking version, there's the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/journey/">Dodge Journey</a> Crossroad, which features a faux skidplate, standard roof rails and blacked-out wheels.</p>, <p>The 7-passenger Dodge Journey is available in four trims, from the base SE to the top-line GT. At its most basic, the Dodge Journey SUV includes dual-zone climate control, 4.3-inch touch-screen media center, keyless entry and push-button start, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and power windows and door locks. Entertainment is provided by a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with auxiliary and USB inputs, but Bluetooth is optional. Safety features include electronic traction and stability control, anti-lock brakes, front-seat side airbags and side-curtain airbags for all rows.</p>, <p>Plenty of options can be had on the Journey. Among the more popular are traction-enhancing all-wheel drive in lieu of the standard front-drive setup, an 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect infotainment system and navigation. Amenities that bring an upscale feel include leather seating, Premium speakers, rear-seat video entertainment system with 9-inch screen and two wireless headphones, in-car Wi-Fi hotspot, and heated front seats and heated steering wheel. A Driver Convenience Group adds a rearview camera and distance-alert function when in reverse, but more advanced safety functions like blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking are not available.</p>, <p>Two engines are available for the 2018 Dodge Journey crossover SUV. Standard on all but the GT is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that makes an only-adequate 173 horsepower. The engine we recommend is the 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 that is optional on all but the GT trim, where it is standard. The V6 is also your only choice if you require all-wheel drive (AWD) instead of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD) to deal with inclement weather and slippery roads. Both engines run on regular unleaded gasoline. All Dodge Journeys use automatic transmissions, with the 4-cylinder stuck with an older-style 4-speed and the 6-cylinder using a more modern 6-speed. The Journey's towing capacity is on the light end, limited to 1,000 pounds with the 4-cylinder and 2,500 with the V6.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/fiat/124-spider/2018
[<p>While its origins are rooted in the Japanese Mazda MX-5 Miata, the 2018 Fiat 214 Spider exudes all the style and soul expected of an Italian sports car bearing the storied 124 badge. Equipped with a Fiat-designed turbocharged engine and subtly reworked interior, the Fiat 124 Spider has a more sumptuous, inviting feel than the hard-edged Miata. That feeling extends to the areas of ride comfort, cabin quietness and overall interior quality. For lovers of open-air motoring, Fiat has created a stunning small convertible that handles as well as it looks, offering pricing in line with the Mazda MX-5 Miata, Mini Cooper Convertible and VW Beetle, but with an attitude more akin to a pricey Audi TT or Porsche Boxster.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a distinctive open-air sports car with a decidedly European flair, the 2018 Fiat 214 Spider offers plenty of Italian style and comfort and at an affordable price. The turbocharged engine gives it a different feel than the Miata upon which it’s based, as does a reworked cabin.</p>, <p>If you’re a driving purist, the lighter, more nimble Mazda MX-5 Miata trumps the Fiat 124 Spider every time. The Fiat’s 160 horsepower is nice, but not nearly as powerful as some rivals. Long-legged drivers will find the 124 Spider’s interior comes up short in the legroom department.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Fiat 124 Spider gains a new Red Top Edition, while the Lusso and Abarth trims see their option list reconfigured to allow customers better access to the exact features they want.</p>, <p>Among cars, weight is the enemy of performance and fun; and yet, despite weighing roughly 100 pounds more than the svelte Mazda Miata on which it’s based, the Fiat 124 Spider remains utterly fulfilling to drive. Light steering efforts give the Fiat Spider a relaxed feel well-suited for enchanting jaunts over the hills and past the sea. Quicken the pace and Fiat’s roadster reveals itself as a playful dance partner. Integral to the Spider’s distinctive character is a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine that produces more power than the Mazda Miata’s naturally aspirated engine. Extra power is great but the turbo’s lag-and-surge power delivery makes us pine for the precise throttle of the Miata. With the Spider’s top down, airflow around the cabin is well-controlled, ever so slightly tousling the driver’s hair. Raise the top and interior noise is hushed enough for comfortable conversations and commutes.</p>, <p>CONVERTIBLE TOP<br>
The brilliance behind the Fiat 124 Spider’s manual top is that it doesn’t need a power option. So balanced is the design that the top can be dropped or raised with just one hand, all while sitting in the driver’s seat.<br>
<br>
SOUND DEADENING<br>
Apparently the Italians found the Miata’s interior a bit too loud, so they softened the noise levels by adding additional sound insulation, thicker side glass and an acoustic windshield. The results are evident once the car reaches highway speed, making it the wiser choice for long-distance jaunts.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The base 2018 Fiat 124 Spider isn’t much different from its MX-5 counterpart, but moving to the Lusso trim brings a number of upgrades including leather seats, piano-black accents and Leatherette trim. The Spider’s cabin is snug, with tight-fitting seats and limited legroom, even on the passenger side. The seats sit low causing one’s legs to remain in a constant outstretched position that can quickly become tiring. Headroom with the top up is surprisingly generous although taller drivers may still find themselves at eye level with the windshield’s top edge. The absence of a telescopic steering wheel seems a glaring omission.</p>, <p>The 2018 Fiat 124 Spider has been meticulously sculpted to recall the classic 124 Spider of the 1960s. To achieve that look Fiat’s design team overlaid thoroughly massaged bodywork, square taillights and round headlights onto the Spider’s Mazda-derived platform, culminating in a 4-inch-longer roadster. Helping drive home the Spider’s Italian heritage are outrageously Italian paint names including Bianco Gelato (white) and Rosso Passione (red). Drivers who relish visual aggression will find plenty of it in the 124 Spider Abarth, whose unique fascias, 17-inch gunmetal wheels, and optional $1,995 black-painted hood and trunk make it look positively furious.</p>, <p>Nab a basic 124 Spider Classica and you’ll enjoy push-button engine start, cloth seats, 16-inch wheels, air conditioning, a 4-speaker audio system with Bluetooth, and four airbags. The Lusso trim adds 17-inch wheels, heated leather-trimmed seats, Leatherette dash trim, automatic climate control and keyless vehicle access. Despite being the raciest Spider in the lineup the Abarth trim only produces four horsepower more than the Classica and Lusso, but it does include a sport suspension, limited-slip differential and charmingly aggressive exterior tweaks. Missing from all trims is a spare tire. The included tire-repair kit helps maximize trunk space.</p>, <p>Optional on the least expensive Classica trim is the Technology and SiriusXM Group that adds the 7-inch infotainment screen, rearview camera, SiriusXM and keyless vehicle access. Go with the more expensive Lusso or Abarth trims and you’re free to select handy add-ons like rear parking sensors, navigation, adaptive headlights, rear cross-path detection, blind-spot warning, and a 9-speaker Bose audio system with a sub-woofer and speakers in the headrests. Reserved for Abarth buyers are optional Recaro seats shod in leather and Alcantara or high-performance Brembo brakes. The Red Top Edition adds adaptive LED headlights, navigation, Bose audio and a Bordeaux Red cloth top.</p>, <p>The biggest difference between the 2018 Fiat 124 Spider and its Mazda twin can be found under the hood. Instead of borrowing the MX-5’s engine, Fiat engineered its own 1.4-liter turbocharged MultiAir 4-cylinder powerplant. In its first use with a rear-drive platform, the Fiat engine delivers more horsepower than the Mazda’s, but more important, more torque. Power is routed to the wheels via a standard 6-speed manual; however, for an additional $1,350 owners can opt for a 6-speed automatic. With a wonderfully short shifter and the ability to slip the clutch, enabling much quicker off-the-line acceleration than the automatic, we definitely prefer the manual gearbox.<br>

 184 lb-ft of torque @ 3,200 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/35 mpg (manual), 25/36 mpg (automatic)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>View the Fiat 124 Spider as a fancied-up Mazda Miata and you might expect a premium price but that’s not the case. A manual-equipped Spider Classica glides in with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $25,990 including destination; just $290 higher than a base Miata. Meanwhile, the $28,590 Lusso trim offers leather seating at a much lower price than the Miata Grand Touring, while the performance-focused Spider Abarth slightly undercuts the similar Miata Club trim. If seating for more than two sounds like a good idea, both the Mini Cooper Convertible and Volkswagen Beetle Convertible can be had for just under $27,000 and $28,000, respectively. Before you buy, be sure to check the KBB Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for the Fiat 124 Spider in your area. It’s also worth noting that resale values for the Fiat brand have historically skewed lower than average, which could affect the 124 Spider’s long-term cost to own.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/fiat/500l/2018
[<p>In the 2018 Fiat 500L, the Italians have created a contemporary small hatchback every bit as cute and clever as the Kia Soul, Mini Countryman and Toyota CH-R. The front-drive 500L lacks the tidy proportions of the car upon which it is based, but it has a kind of awkward adorableness that can draw one in. The 500L also offers a modern and well-appointed interior, numerous options and excellent fuel economy. However, there are some important points to consider. During the 500L’s short time in this country its resale and reliability rankings have been less than stellar. For just a bit more money, one could move up to the more versatile and better-looking all-wheel-drive 500X.</p>, <p>If you’re drawn to the quirky styling of the Fiat 500, but need something with more room and more doors, the 2018 Fiat 500L should do the trick. Comfortable, easy to maneuver and great on gas, the 500L might be described as an affordable alternative to the Mini Cooper Countryman.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a unique small car offering loads of features and a better track record than the 500L, the Kia Soul certainly deserves a good look. Those who must deal with seasonal snow might prefer something with all-wheel drive, such as a Mazda CX-3 or Honda HR-V.</p>, <p>Fiat’s 500L hatchback for 2018 gets a mild exterior makeover, with new front and rear fascia and new wheels. New standard features include the ParkView rearview camera, 7-inch Uconnect infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus a TFT (thin film transistor) cluster display, revised center console and new parking brake handle.</p>, <p>Even though the 500L shares the same 160-horsepower, 1.4-liter turbocharged engine used in the sporty 500 Abarth, its additional bulk and standard 6-speed automatic transmission quickly dash any hopes of similar performance. The 500L is built for comfort, so its softer suspension isn’t as much fun in the curves. The long wheelbase and tall profile mean the 500L can’t return the kind of joy one gets behind the wheel of a Mazda CX-3 or Toyota CH-R. However, when it comes to ride comfort, the 500L does a much better job soaking up road imperfections than either of those competitors. Acceleration from a dead stop is acceptable in this class, capable of returning an 8-second zero-to-60 run with only one person onboard (expect that figure to increase by a second or so if you have a fully loaded 500L). On the open highway, we found the 500L’s interior to be well insulated from outside noise, although we did experience some annoying wind buffeting around the side mirrors.</p>, <p>UCONNECT SYSTEM<br>
 One of the perks from the Chrysler merger was the acquisition of the excellent Uconnect infotainment system. In the 2018 500L, the setup includes a bright and user-friendly 7-inch color touch screen, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto with optional navigation and BeatsAudio upgrades.<br>
<br>
 INTERIOR ACCOMMODATIONS<br>
 Fiat’s interior design brings new life to small-car design, and should be the standard by which all others are judged. From the handsome color options to features like the panoramic sunroof, the 500L offers an interior as handsome as it is versatile.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You'll immediately sense the difference in interior space between the Fiat 500 and the 500L. Where the 500 has just two tiny rear seats and a small cargo bay in the hatch area, the 2018 Fiat 500L has a 3-person rear bench that can comfortably fit two adults. Rear legroom is impressive, and the rear seats also recline, slide, flip and tumble forward for cargo/passenger versatility. Headroom in all seats is sky-high, making the Fiat 500L a surprisingly good car for tall people. Outward visibility is above average thanks to a front pillar split by glass and wraparound rear windows.</p>, <p>Although based on the Fiat 500, the 500L’s longer wheelbase, taller roof and additional two doors create a car uniquely its own beast. From the outset the 500L’s look was polarizing, to say the least, so redesigning the front and rear fascia this year is a definite improvement, albeit a minor one. The doe-eyed headlights remain, however, as do the “floating” roof painted either white or black and the big silver-winged Fiat logo prominently displayed above the grille. For a slightly tougher take, there's the 500L Trekking model with its beefier front and rear aesthetics, larger 17-inch wheels and flared wheel arches.</p>, <p>The 2018 Fiat 500L is available in three trims: Pop, Trekking and Lounge. At around $22,000, the Pop comes equipped with air conditioning, 16-inch alloy wheels, tilt/telescoping steering column, cruise control and a rearview camera. Also standard is the Uconnect 4 system with 7-inch touch screen, Bluetooth streaming audio, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player and two USB ports. Trekking models include 17-inch wheels and a 2-tone interior, heated front seats, navigation, leather seating and BeatsAudio system, while Lounge models add 17-inch wheels, chrome mirror caps, driver’s power lumbar, dual-zone automatic temperature control, a 115-volt outlet and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>The BeatsAudio system can be added to the Pop, while the Pop and Trekking offer the Popular Equipment Package that brings driver’s seat power lumbar, dual-zone automatic climate control and rear parking sensors. The Premium Group is available on the Pop and adds all the features of the Popular Equipment Package plus BeatsAudio, SiriusXM and navigation. The dual-pane panoramic sunroof is a stand-alone option on Trekking and Lounge trims.</p>, <p>All 2018 Fiat 500L models use a small and efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that drives the front wheels. The standard transmission is a traditional 6-speed automatic. The Fiat's turbocharged 1.4-liter engine can run on 87-octane gasoline, but premium 91-grade is recommended. Fun fact: The Fiat 500L is built in Serbia and classified by the EPA as a small station wagon.<br>

Even a loaded Lounge version won't break the bank for a few thousand more. Because the 500L hasn't been flying off dealer lots, there's a good chance of finding discounts and rebates. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Fiat. The Fiat 500L is less expensive than a Mini Hardtop 4-door and Countryman, but nearly a grand more than a Mazda CX-3. A Kia Soul has an even lower sticker price, as do the Nissan Versa Note and Jeep Renegade Sport with the automatic transmission. With a lower starting price, the Honda HR-V makes a strong argument as a better buy, even more so when you compare the stellar predicted resale value of the HR-V against the 500L’s rather poor one.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/fiat/500x/2018
[<p>Based on the 500 “Cinquecento” subcompact car, the 2018 Fiat 500X adds an additional two doors, standard all-wheel drive and increased ground clearance. Built to rival other subcompact-crossover SUVs like the Mazda CX-3, Chevy Trax and Honda HR-V, the 500X looks good on paper, but in reality falls far short of the reliability and resale figures of the aforementioned competitors. The 500X also isn’t nearly as much fun to drive as the CX-3 or Trax, and its 9-speed automatic transmission continues to rack up performance complaints. On the flip side, the 500X’s sub-$21,000 price tag, numerous safety features and colorful palate make it a tempting choice. Those looking for true off-road ability should look to the 500’s kissing cousin, the Jeep Renegade Trailhawk.</p>, <p>If you love the individuality and colorful expression of small European cars, but need something that can handle snow and ice, delivers good fuel economy and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, the 2018 Fiat 500X could be the little Italian for you.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small car</a> with strong reliability and resale, the Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3 are better choices. The HR-V offers more interior room while the CX-3 is a superior driver with better fuel economy. The Jeep Renegade offers a better platform for off-road adventures.</p>, <p>For 2018, the 500X gains as standard the UConnect 4 system that brings a 7-inch display, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Also standard this year is Bluetooth smartphone connectivity and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>Although the 500X’s perky exterior and inviting interior had us hoping we’d found a less pricey alternative to the Mini Countryman, our hopes were soon dashed. Unlike the Mini, a day spent driving around country roads in the 500X just isn’t very satisfying. Over modest road imperfections, the 500X is far too bouncy and unsettled, although it does glide nicely over smooth pavement. The 500X’s electrically assisted power steering brought mixed reviews from our test crew, with the majority stating the feeling was somewhat numb and unnatural. The feature that drew the most ire, however, is the 500X’s 9-speed automatic transmission. Mated exclusively to the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, the 9-speed does a poor job managing the engine’s modest power, with slow reactions to throttle input and occasional hard shifts. Ironically, the more desirable 6-speed manual is offered only on the base car and only with the less powerful 1.4-liter turbocharged engine.</p>, <p>DYNAMIC SELECTOR<br>
Little more than a gimmick in some cars, the Fiat 500X’s drive-mode selector actually produced a noticeable difference between settings. Better still, the feature is available on every model with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive.<br>
<br>
ADVANCED SAFETY SYSTEMS<br>
Safety shouldn’t be just for those who can afford it, which is why we’re glad to see Fiat offering systems like lane-keeping assist and collision mitigation on the 500X. Buyers can opt for these as well as blind-spot detection, augmenting the standard airbag and electronic stability-control systems that help keep everyone safe.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>One of the best attributes of the 2018 500X is its interior: stylish and surprisingly refined, with soft-touch points, and high-quality controls all sensibly arranged. The front seats are comfortable, and it's easy to find a good driving position. Rear headroom is pretty good, although there's not a lot of legroom. Cargo space expands quickly thanks to fold-down rear seats, and the flip-forward passenger seat helps this little SUV handle items like a surfboard. We also like the optional, configurable color display between the gauges. The space above the dash is now occupied by the well-regarded 7-inch Uconnect touch-screen infotainment system.</p>, <p>Fiat wisely chose the sporty and cute 500 as inspiration for its most mainstream vehicle, and the new 500X may very well be the best-looking Fiat you can buy in the U.S. outside of the new Fiat 124 convertible. With nice proportions and just enough hints of the smaller 500 to make it interesting, the 500X is a sharp-looking compact-crossover SUV. Of the three versions available for 2018, the Trekking models look toughest with their pronounced front fascia that looks like something you'd see on a rugged SUV.</p>, <p>For 2018, the 500X lineup consists of the Pop base model, mid-trim Trekking and top-end Lounge. The least expensive 500X Pop is pretty basic, but does have air conditioning, power windows, 6-way-manual-adjust front seats and Uconnect 4 with 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Bluetooth connectivity is also standard, but not an automatic transmission, which given the 9-speed automatic’s shortcomings might not be a bad thing. The Trekking is better equipped, bringing 3-mode Dynamic Selector, the 2.4-liter engine and 17-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the Trekking model opens the door to more options, as well as the Urbana Edition package that includes black exterior accents, black cloth seats and black aluminum wheels with copper accents. Top-line Lounge models include the 7-inch touch-screen Uconnect system with navigation, heated and power-operated front seats and heated steering wheel, and 8-speaker audio system. Other options vary by trim and include leather interior and the BeatsAudio system. Available safety features are blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning with lane-keep assist, rearview camera and forward-collision warning with automatic brake assistance.</p>, <p>The base Fiat 500X Pop model comes standard with a 160-horsepower 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. It's the only way to get a manual-transmission 500X, and unlike the Jeep Renegade, you can't get an all-wheel-drive (AWD) model with a manual transmission, only front-wheel drive (FWD). Optional on the Pop, and standard on all other models, is a 180-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that comes with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Available in front- and all-wheel drive, the engine puts out plenty of horsepower, but the 9-speed automatic suffers from unrefined shifts and is ultimately hard to recommend. On the plus side, the part-time AWD system fully disengages the rear-drive portion when the SUV doesn't need it, helping fuel economy.<br>

That's certainly alluring, but the better-equipped Honda HR-V actually begins at a slightly lower price. Moving up trims, the Fiat's value proposition doesn't get any better. Mid-trim Trekking models start at $24,680, while the top-line 500X Lounge goes for $26,510. Go all-in for a top-line all-wheel-drive model, and you'll be in the $30,000 range. Style indeed has its price. You can do far better in the aforementioned Honda HR-V or a Mazda CX-3, Chevrolet Trax, Subaru Crosstrek or the Buick Encore. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Fiat 500X's resale value is another black mark against this vehicle, with residuals far lower than the HR-V and Crosstrek.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/ford/c-max-hybrid/2018
[<p>Ford’s C-Max gas-electric hybrid for 2018 delivers great fuel economy in a roomy and fun-to-drive package that is both green and good-looking. While it faces tough competition from the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius/">Toyota Prius</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Ioniq and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/niro/">Kia Niro</a>, the C-Max still has a few advantages, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility plus cool upscale features like an available hands-free foot-activated power liftgate. There’s also a plug-in hybrid called the C-Max Energi that can run up to 19 miles solely on <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> power. The C-Max has a more athletic feel than the Prius or Ionic, but its 42-mpg/city-fuel-economy rating can’t touch the Toyota’s 58 mpg, the Ioniq’s 57 mpg or the Niro’s 52 mpg.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a modern hybrid with a domestic angle, the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> C-Max has much to offer. Its large interior belies the car’s diminutive size, and its suspension delivers a sportier ride than a Prius or an Ioniq. The C-Max Energi seats five, something the Prius Prime can’t do.</p>, <p>The C-Max’s aging design can’t keep pace with the new Prius, which is not only more efficient, it comes with more safety features like automatic emergency braking. Both the Ioniq and Niro offer a sleek design and lower price.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford C-Max carries over unchanged.</p>, <p>In spite of its tall roof and small size, the 2018 Ford C-Max feels remarkably planted. The 2.0-liter gasoline engine and electric motor combo deliver fairly quick response and passing power, although the electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (eCVT) returns an irritating droning hum under hard acceleration. To be fair, other hybrid CVTs possess similar characteristics. This fuel-efficient eco-warrior is more than just miserly; it is actually quite fun to toss around winding roads and tight curves. In less aggressive settings, the C-Max rolls along smoothly and quietly, even more so when the Energi’s electric-only mode is engaged. In fact, the C-Max Energi’s electric mode delivers immediate acceleration that can only come from a torque-heavy electric motor. And, while the C-Max’s fuel economy is in the mid-40 range, both the Toyota Prius and Hyundai Ioniq handily out-distance it.</p>, <p>HANDS-FREE LIFTGATE<br>
 A swipe of one’s foot below the rear bumper is all it takes to make the C-Max’s power rear liftgate automatically open. Handy for when your arms are full, this clever feature makes loading the C-Max’s ample cargo bay all the easier.<br>
<br>
 SMARTGAUGE WITH ECOGUIDE<br>
 Efficient driving (also known as hypermiling) is rewarded by an electronic bouquet of glowing, growing “efficiency leaves” displayed across the C-Max’s customizable dual-LCD instrument cluster. It’s a cute and clever way to help drivers be more mindful when pressing the accelerator.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Ford C-Max <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> has a 5-passenger interior, as does its plug-in hybrid sibling the C-Max Energi, an aspect that distinguishes it from the 4-passenger Prius Prime plug-in hybrid. This Ford hybrid's voluptuous exterior design pays off inside, where headroom is generous for front- and rear-seat passengers. At 24.5 cubic feet, cargo room behind the 2nd-row seats is commendable and just shy of the Prius' roominess. The C-Max Energi, however, has roughly five cubic feet less and an awkward hump that hides its larger battery pack. Both have folding rear seats for added cargo versatility. Up front are comfortable, well-bolstered seats.</p>, <p>Design-wise the bulbous C-Max is more conservative than the space-oddity Prius, but we must admit that to our eyes the Hyundai Ioniq line of hybrid and all-electric models is far easier on the eyes than both the Ford and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> <a alt_o_t="Hybrids" href="/hybrid/">hybrids</a>. As for the C-Max, its rounded and mounded exterior pays off on the inside, where there is ample headroom and space for taller people and objects. Apart from badging and what looks like a fuel-cap door on the front left that hides the AC plug-in port, the 2018 C-Max Energi looks nearly identical to the standard C-Max hybrid.</p>, <p>In base SE form, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/ford/c-max%20hybrid/2018/">2018 Ford C-Max Hybrid</a> and C-Max Energi include dual-zone climate control, rearview camera, 10-way power-adjust driver's seat, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player with USB and auxiliary inputs, and a Sync system with 4.2-inch center display that connects to smartphones via Bluetooth. The Titanium C-Max models include leather interior with 10-way-power passenger seat, the Sync3 infotainment system with 8-inch touch screen, heated front seats, 9-speaker premium Sony audio system, reverse-sensing system, auto-dimming rearview mirror, push-button start and universal garage-door opener.</p>, <p>If you're buying a base 2018 C-Max, we recommend the SE Driver Assist Package, which bundles power liftgate, Sync3 and the reverse-sensing system for added safety when in reverse. The Titanium Driver Assist Package, meanwhile, adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, Active Park Assist to help with parallel parking, and the hands-free tailgate. Other options available on both models include navigation and a panoramic moonroof. Unlike the Prius, the 2018 C-Max doesn't offer the advanced safety systems and driving aids such as the pre-collision system with pedestrian detection and radar cruise control that come standard on the Toyota.</p>, <p>Every <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/c-max%20hybrid/">Ford C-Max Hybrid</a> features a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine, a gearless continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and an electric motor to produce a combined 188 horsepower. The Energi boasts a larger lithium-ion battery pack for an all-electric range of approximately 19 miles. The standard C-Max Hybrid doesn't need to be plugged in, as its hybrid system works behind the scenes. Just fill the car with gasoline and you're good to go. You could do the same with the C-Max Energi, but you wouldn't get the vehicle's ability to travel all those miles on electricity only. For that you'll need to plug it into an electrical outlet. Ford pegs approximate recharge times at 2.5 hours on a 240-volt outlet or seven on a standard 120-volt outlet.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter inline-4 + electric motor <br/> 188 net hybrid system horsepower<br/> 129 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 42/38 mpg (Hybrid), 39 mpg combined/95 MPGe (Energi)</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford C-Max Hybrid has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just shy of $25,000 when factoring in the destination charge. Titanium models begin about $3,000 more. The C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid starts just under $28,000, and the Titanium model is also $3,000 beyond that. Note that the C-Max Energi, however, may be eligible for around $4,000 in federal tax credits. Further incentives from Ford can take thousands more off the price, so be sure to check with your dealer. With options, these prices can increase a few thousand dollars. At its starting price, Ford's hybrid hatchback is just slightly lower than the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/toyota/prius/2018/">2018 Toyota Prius</a>, while the C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid is priced nearly identically to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius%20prime/">Toyota Prius Prime</a>. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new hybrid. The Ford C-Max has traditionally had poor resale value.</p>]

[<p>Slotting beneath the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a> compact SUV in size and price, the new 2018 Ford EcoSport (echo-sport) is the latest entry in the fast-growing subcompact SUV segment that includes the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/trax/">Chevrolet Trax</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a>, top-selling <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a> and others. We gave it a thorough inspection at its official unveiling, and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> has released enough specs, features and prices for us to provide this “preview review” ahead of our first drive. </p>, <p>Subcompact <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> are the most affordable way to get the elevated seating position, cargo versatility and available all-wheel drive that are pushing SUV popularity to unprecedented heights. </p>, <p>For only a few thousand dollars more, today’s compact SUVs typically offer much more room and refinement than their subcompact SUV stablemates. </p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/ecosport/">Ford EcoSport</a> is an all-new addition to the Ford lineup for 2018.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford EcoSport is one of the few subcompact SUVs to offer a choice of engines. Based on power-to-weight ratios, it’s a safe bet EcoSport models with the smaller, 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine will be among the slower entries in the segment. And those fitted with the 166-horsepower 4-cylinder engine should be among the quicker entries. Fuel economy for the smaller engine is about average at 28 mpg combined, while the larger engine’s 25 mpg combined places it in the bottom half of the segment. Power always has its price.</p>, <p>SYNC 3 INFOTAINMENT<br>
 Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are staff favorites, and they’re integrated here into Ford's latest Sync infotainment system with an 8-inch touchscreen featuring swipe and pinch-to-zoom control.<br>
<br>
 SYNC CONNECT AND FORDPASS<br>
 Lock, unlock or start your vehicle remotely, right from your smartphone. You can also track it down in a parking lot or check your fuel level.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Even in subcompact form, cargo flexibility is among an SUV’s key strengths. The Honda HR-V is among the segment's roomiest entries, the Mazda CX-3 is among the smallest, and the Ford falls closer to the middle, offering about as much passenger and cargo volume as the Chevy Trax. These vehicles are all appreciably smaller than their compact SUV counterparts, so consider all your cargo and passenger needs when weighing your options.</p>, <p>Unmistakable as the little brother of the Ford Escape, the 2018 Ford EcoSport has one of the segment’s smallest footprints, measuring just over 161 inches in length. Outward-facing notables include a capless fuel filler and a swinging tailgate that’s hinged on the side instead of opening upward. Practically speaking the unique tailgate’s shortcomings will likely outweigh the advantages for most owners in most situations, but the novelty factor holds some appeal.</p>, <p>The entry-level 2018 Ford EcoSport S starts at $20,990 (including destination charges) and includes a 123-horsepower 3-cylinder engine, 6-speed automatic transmission, front-wheel drive, rearview camera, auto headlights, 2 USB ports and a lower-tier Sync infotainment system.</p>, <p>A fully loaded 2018 Ford EcoSport can stretch into the high-$20,000 range with features like a moonroof, leather seats, Sync 3 infotainment system, remote-sensing keyless entry and pushbutton start, reverse sensing, 8-inch touchscreen, navigation system, blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, premium audio and built-in Wi-Fi.</p>, <p><br>
The 2018 Ford EcoSport’s base engine is matched with front-wheel drive, while the upgraded powertrain is all-wheel drive exclusively. Opt for the larger engine and you'll have one of the quickest subcompact SUVs on the road. Towing capacity tops out at 2,000 pounds.<br>

[<p>As more midsize-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> morph into larger 7-passenger SUVs, it’s nice to know the 2018 Ford Edge remains a roomy, 5-passenger offering brimming with style, power and features. Ford’s 2018 Edge <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV delivers car-like ride and handling plus the ability to tackle deep snow and light off-road trails. Although softer than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/grand%20cherokee/">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a>, the Edge nevertheless offers a number of sporty trims that can run circles around the Outback. Towing is another area where the Edge has a leg up on the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a>. The Edge’s premium look and feel don’t come cheap, however, and you can save thousands buying an entry-level (but less well-equipped) SUV from Subaru, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re shopping for a roomy, versatile crossover SUV that is more Sport than Utility, the 2018 Ford Edge should hold strong appeal. Loaded with the latest tech and safety features, the Edge misses nothing when it comes to driver comfort and protection.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for best-in-class fuel economy, a Subaru Outback or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander%20hybrid/">Toyota Highlander Hybrid</a> makes a better choice. Those looking to take their SUVs into rugged areas may be better off with a Jeep Grand Cherokee, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery%20sport/">Land Rover Discovery Sport</a>.</p>, <p>Changes to Ford’s 2018 Edge crossover SUV are mostly cosmetic. A new SEL Sport Package is offered this year with blacked-out headlight bezels and Magnetic Metallic paint covering the grille, mirror caps, 10-spoke 19-inch wheels and rear spoiler. Inside, unique cloth seats with suede inserts augment Copper Sands appliques.</p>, <p>With an impressive balance of ride comfort, fuel efficiency and ample power, the 2018 Ford Edge is one well-rounded SUV. The base 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine is unique in both its potency and fuel economy, churning out 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, nearly equal to some competitors’ optional 6-cylinder engines. Although a naturally aspirated V6 is available, we really don’t see the need. Those looking for truly top-end performance should opt for the 315-horsepower twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 exclusive to the Edge Sport. The Sport includes a sport-tuned suspension for improved handling, but also comes with a noticeably stiffer ride. Fuel-economy fans will note that the front-drive Edge with the 2.0-liter engine comes with start/stop technology, a feature as annoying to some as it is welcome by others.</p>, <p>2.7-LITER ECOBOOST V6 ENGINE<br/> Available only in the 2018 Ford Edge Sport, the 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 turns the Edge into a performance hottie, with a stiffened suspension to better hug corners and standard all-wheel drive for improved grip and reduced torque steer.<br/> <br/> SYNC 3 INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM<br/> After years of nightmarish complaints about its Sync infotainment system, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> has finally gotten it right with Sync 3. Faster and more intuitive, the system in Ford’s 2018 Edge now includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Sync 3 is standard on Sport and Titanium trims and optional on the SEL.</p>, <p>Ford’s Edge crossover SUV for 2018 offers a 2-row, 5-passenger layout that has generous space for both people and cargo. The Edge's large exterior and form-fitting seats yield impressive legroom for both front and rear passengers, with the rear seats offering a commendable 40.6 inches. Cargo capacity is 39.2 cubic feet with the rear seats up and 73.4 with them folded. The cabin has a fresh, premium design. Ford has moved away from adaptive-touch controls, equipping the Edge with hard buttons for audio and climate controls. As mentioned, the revamped Sync 3 is a vast improvement over the past MyFord Touch.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Edge crossover SUV has a wide, squat profile. That translates to a roomy interior, but beware this Ford's wide dimensions when pulling into a one-car garage. <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/edge/">Ford Edge</a> styling is conservative yet strong, starting with a large trapezoidal grille and ending with a sloped rear and wraparound lights that bring cohesion. Sport models stand apart with their piano-black grille treatment, unique headlights, body-color front and rear fascias, and body-color lower cladding. They can also be spotted from behind by their pair of trapezoidal exhaust housings instead of the circular bright tips of those on the other trims.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Edge comes in four trims: SE, SEL, Titanium and Sport. Spend the least on a base SE and you'll still get a high-tech turbocharged engine, keyless entry and push-button start, rearview camera, cloth seats with 6-way-manual driver's adjustment, and 18-inch wheels. Infotainment is brought to you by a basic Sync system with 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity. If your budget can budge another $3,000, you're better off with an SEL model that adds power driver and passenger seats, reverse-parking aid, dual-zone climate control, EasyFold remote rear-seat release and satellite radio.</p>, <p>Options abound, running the gamut from pragmatic to the entertaining. Of the former, all-wheel drive can be had for better traction. Other features include navigation, a forward-facing camera to aid in parking, blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision and lane-keeping warning systems, and inflatable rear safety belts. A parking-assist system is also available. The high-end, leather-clad Titanium and Sport models offer Ford's adaptive steering system, which varies response based on speed, and the hands-free liftgate feature that you'll appreciate every time your hands are lugging groceries. Other amenities include heated/ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, panoramic roof and a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>, <p>You have a choice of three engines in the 2018 Ford Edge. Standard on SE, SEL and Titanium models is a 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder. In addition to powering the standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) models, the small but potent powerplant is offered with all-wheel drive (AWD). Optional on SEL and Titanium models is a 3.5-liter V6. Top-line Sport models come with the most powerful engine, a 315-horsepower 2.7-liter EcoBoost turbocharged V6 with standard AWD. All models continue to use Ford's well-integrated 6-speed automatic transmission. All also have a Sport mode for quicker acceleration, and paddle shifters replace the former awkward manual-shift buttons. With the max-towing package, all models of the Edge except the Sport are rated to pull 3,500 pounds, with the Sport rated for 2,000 pounds.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/ford/escape/2018
[<p>The 2018 Ford Escape is a competent, popular player in the crowded compact-SUV class. In addition to facing similarly well-known rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a>, the Escape competes with fresher nameplates such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>. The Escape keeps pace on both tech and safety fronts with seamless smartphone integration and a suite of driver-assistance features. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a>'s compact-crossover SUV also benefits from a trio of engine choices, including one that packs 245 horsepower. A new trim for 2018, the SEL, fills the white space and price gap between the mid-tier SE and range-topping Titanium. With athletic driving manners and a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds, the Escape remains a well-rounded choice in the ever-competitive compact-crossover-SUV arena.</p>, <p>Ford’s 2018 Escape is versatile in both its general character and its newly enlarged lineup. It offers everything from a simple yet stylish and easy-to-drive base model to a sophisticated and powerful Titanium edition. The Escape's 3,500-pound tow rating is among the highest in this segment.</p>, <p>If you need the maximum amount of cargo room in your <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUV</a>, turn to the roomier Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4. The Mazda CX-5 is arguably the most stylish in this segment, is a bit more fun to drive, and is set to offer a diesel compact SUV variant.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a> SUV is updated for 2018 with a new trim level, the SEL that brings amenities including leather seats, power tailgate and 8-inch infotainment system that works with CarPlay and Android Auto. SE models get heated front seats, while the Titanium now comes exclusively with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine.</p>, <p>The 2018 Escape is among the nimbler, fun-to-drive compact <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, splitting the difference between the athletic Mazda CX-5 and the more comfort-oriented Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. A high nose, prominent A-pillars and relatively large turning circle do impact its abilities in super-tight confines but have little effect on busy city streets and freeways. A full roster of available driving aids, from blind-spot monitoring to lane-keeping assist to adaptive cruise control makes the act of driving safer and less fatiguing. The Escape's trio of powerplants spans from the adequate 2.5-liter 4-cylinder in base models to the 245-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo that makes the Escape capable of very quick escapes. If you go with that most powerful engine, we recommend all-wheel drive, which helps put the power down better. Most buyers will be more than happy with the 1.5-liter turbo that splits the power difference between the base and range-topping engine.</p>, <p>SYNC 3 INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM<br>
 Ford keeps improving its Sync touch-screen infotainment system, making it easier to see, easier to use and more responsive. The latest version, Sync 3 -- standard on SEL and Titanium models and optional on the SE -- has an 8-inch screen and is CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.<br>
<br>
 TOWING CAPACITY<br>
 The Ford Escape handily beats the towing-capacity rivals, including the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. While those are limited to 1,500 pounds -- what a base Escape pulls -- models with the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter turbo engines offer Class II tow packages rated to tow 2,000 and 3,500 pounds, respectively.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Escape SUV benefited from a wide-ranging remake last year. Virtually every touch surface was revised to create a more premium look and feel, a move that should keep this 2-row/5-passenger compact-crossover SUV fresh in the years ahead. The Escape’s electronic parking brake and repositioned shift lever ease access to the climate controls and center-stack media bin with USB port and 12V power point. Other improvements included a more user-friendly multifunction steering wheel, re-contoured front buckets, a larger center armrest and bigger covered console bin. Dropping the 60/40 fold-flat rear seat doubles the usable storage area from 34.0 to 68.0 cubic feet.</p>, <p>Also updated just last year, the Escape’s exterior remains fresh thanks to a recast nose that portrays an edgier character defined by a soft cap, prominent hexagonal grille – which conceals active grille shutters to improve efficiency -- sleeker LED-infused headlights and larger outboard air intakes along with a redrawn aluminum hood. A Sport Appearance Package, available on SE models, aims to bring an edgier vibe with blackout-trim accents, halogen headlights and 19-inch Ebony Black alloy wheels. For 2018, the Escape gains new colors: Blue Metallic and Cinnamon Glaze.</p>, <p>The 2018 Escape is available in four trims: S, SE, SEL and Titanium. The least expensive Ford Escape is a pretty basic small SUV with cruise control, rearview camera, 6-way-adjustable driver's seat and automatic headlights. The basic infotainment system includes 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio with USB input, 4.2-inch screen and Ford's basic Sync system with Bluetooth connectivity and voice recognition. You're better off with at least an SE model, which adds a turbo engine, dual-zone climate control, privacy glass, 10-way-power driver's seat and heated front seats. It also opens the door for all-wheel drive and options like Sync 3 with CarPlay and more.</p>, <p>The new SEL nicely slots between the SE and Titanium with standard power tailgate, leather interior, Sync 3 and its 8-inch touch screen and even the Sync Connect system with built-in Wi-Fi and the ability to lock, unlock and start the car from a phone. Top-line Titanium models add the most powerful engine in the lineup, hands-free tailgate, push-button start, heated steering wheel, power passenger seat, navigation and 10-speaker Sony premium audio with HD Radio. Optional starting on SE trims are blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control with forward-collision warning, lane-keep assist and a parking system that aids with parallel and reverse parking.</p>, <p>Three engines remain available in the Escape, though this year each is tied to specific trims. All are 4-cylinder powerplants connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Base Ford Escape S models use a 2.5-liter, in front-wheel drive (FWD) only. Ford Escape SE and the new SEL use a 1.5-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine with FWD standard and all-wheel drive (AWD) optional. Though smaller than the 2.5-liter, it has greater horsepower (179 vs. 168) thanks to the forced induction of turbocharging. Now exclusive to the Titanium model is the 2.0-liter, which packs 245 horsepower and can tow 3,500 pounds. It too is FWD or AWD, and we recommend the latter to prevent torque steer. Both EcoBoost engines use a start/stop system that shuts off the engine at idle.<br>

At its starting price, the Escape slightly undercuts the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, while other rivals like the Chevy Equinox, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/tucson/">Hyundai Tucson</a> start a little lower.

---------http://www.kbb.com/ford/expedition/2018
[<p>The 2018 Ford Expedition is about as all-new as a new vehicle can get. Sharing virtually nothing with its predecessor, the new Expedition advances the state of the art in full-size SUVs in the same way its cousin, the Ford F-150, did for pickup trucks: extensive use of aluminum. The benefits are tangible. The new Expedition offers excellent towing and hauling capabilities with its 3.5-liter EcoBoost twin-turbo V6 engine, yet manages to return fuel economy more commonly associated with smaller, car-based midsize SUVs. It does all this while still offering what we've come to expect from the full-size Expedition: tons of interior space, great cargo room, and the kind of smooth ride you can only get from an independent rear suspension...and can't get in a solid-axle Chevrolet Tahoe or GMC Yukon.</p>, <p>If you're a Ford die-hard and have been wishing the F-150's aluminum goodness were available in a closed body, your prayers have been answered. If you're brand agnostic and just want the best full-size SUV you can get, look no further.</p>, <p>The Chevrolet and GMC folks probably haven't even read this far, as brand loyalty will keep them away. Otherwise, it's possible you just don't need this much SUV. In that case, a smaller midsize SUV like the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, or VW Atlas may serve you better...and save you money.</p>, <p>From where the tires meet the road to the roof rack, everything on the 2018 Ford Expedition is new this year. Still available in two lengths, note that the new long-wheelbase version is now called the Expedition Max.</p>, <p>Driving the 2018 Ford Expedition reminds us in some ways -- all of them good -- of how we felt when we first drove the aluminum-bodied Ford F-150. The lighter material makes the entire vehicle feel less bulky and massive, quite a feat considering that this is, without doubt, still a massive and bulky vehicle. Yet with the twin-turbo V6 and 10-speed automatic, the Expedition feels almost sprightly, with plenty of power in reserve for passing at highway speeds. The steering and suspension likewise feel sharper than you might expect in a vehicle this big. It's by no means a sporty drive, but there's more of a spring in its step than you may imagine. For parking-lot maneuvering, we highly recommend the around-view camera, since sightlines aren't exactly a strong suit of big vehicles like this, and even though the rearview camera is standard, you'll want all the help you can get.</p>, <p>INDEPENDENT REAR SUSPENSION<br>
Some things just don't change, and thankfully, Ford didn't change the Expedition's independent rear suspension. Not only does it smooth out bumps -- especially compared to the Chevy Tahoe -- the fancy suspension helps increase cargo and rear-seat area, giving the Expedition a distinct advantage there, too.<br>
<br>
ALUMINUM CONSTRUCTION<br>
Similar to the Ford F-150 pickup, the new Expedition uses aluminum extensively in its construction, helping to shave about 300 pounds, compared to its predecessor. That helps drivability and fuel economy, and provides a host of other benefits.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Expedition's control layout is instantly familiar to anyone who's driven a Ford lately, but with a twist. For example, the volume-control, drive-mode selector and temperature-control knobs all feature a knurled surface that looks and feels premium. The gear selector for the 10-speed automatic is a similarly knurled knob that's easy to use, with manual-control buttons below. There's no shortage of features, especially in the high-end Platinum model. Second-row passengers get an equally delightful experience, with comfortable seats that adjust fully; 3rd-row passengers get plenty of room, especially in long-wheelbase Max versions. There's good cargo room, and if you need more, power-folding 3rd-row seatbacks are available, albeit with a slightly confusing interface.</p>, <p>Sensibly, the 2018 Ford Expedition hews more closely to the company's lineup of crossover SUVs than the F-150 pickup truck upon which it's based. The headlights, taillights, general profile, and trim all look like larger versions of what you'd find on a Ford Explorer or Flex. Yet that's no bad thing, as the Expedition is a good-looking SUV, with just the right blend of boldness and sophistication. Platinum models ladle on the chrome a bit too heavily for some tastes, we're sure, but there's enough sheer acreage of sheetmetal that it's mostly lost. Expedition Max models boast even more, with a longer wheelbase and additional cargo space.</p>, <p>The base-model 2018 Ford Expedition XLT comes standard with a 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 engine with start/stop connected to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Air conditioning with rear controls, an audio system with AM/FM, MP3, CD, SiriusXM and nine speakers, plus audio, Bluetooth and USB inputs. That's all pretty expected, but we were surprised to see power-folding 3rd-row seatbacks, push-button start and keyless entry on the standard features list as well. On the safety front, the 2018 Expedition comes with a rearview camera with backup grid lines and a washer, multiple airbags, a post-crash alert system for emergency help, and trailer-sway control.</p>, <p>Many options are added as you go up the model ladder, with leather seating, multi-zone automatic climate control, dual-headrest rear-seat entertainment, heated and ventilated seats, 10-way-power driver's seat with memory and more available on the options menu, or higher trims. Limited models get Ford's Sync 3 system which includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. Additional safety systems such as adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, automatic high beams, lane-keeping assist and alert, and collision warning and mitigation are also available. Platinum models load up the luxury, with even nicer leather, an available panoramic sunroof, retractable running boards, and active noise cancellation.</p>, <p>The only engine available in the 2018 Ford Expedition is the 3.5-liter EcoBoost twin-turbo V6 engine that we've come to love in other Ford products. Here it's producing 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, or in Platinum models, 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. That's a lot of grunt, even for a full-size SUV, and thanks to the 10-speed automatic the Expedition makes good use of it all. Of course 4-wheel drive (4x4) is available in addition to 2-wheel drive (4x2), with a terrain-select system to maximize traction on different surfaces. Fuel economy is pretty good, considering the size of the vehicle, with economy averaging up to 24 mpg on the highway.<br>
<br>
3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6<br>

That price actually gets you a pretty decently equipped full-size SUV, but if you want more, you'll likely move up to the Limited or Platinum trims. The standard-length Limited starts at about $63,800, while the Max is about $66,650. If you want all the trimmings, the Expedition Platinum starts at about $74,000, or $76,600 for the Max. Four-wheel drive will add about $3,000 to the total. Obvious competitors are the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, and the Expedition Platinum exceeds those prices, but it is in line with the other competitor, the GMC Yukon Denali. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. Resale values for the Expedition have traditionally trailed its GM competitors.<br>

Plus, it seats seven and offers a wide range of trim and engine options, so there’s an Explorer for almost any lifestyle and budget.</p>, <p>Although the new Explorer is available with all-wheel drive and it looks like a Land Rover, it’s not as off-road capable as that brand’s many SUVs. If you plan to tackle anything beyond the gravel parking lot at an Eagle’s concert, shop the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery/">Land Rover Discovery</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/grand%20cherokee/">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018 Ford has updated the new Explorer with five new wheel options, including four 20-inch designs. There’s also an available onboard Wi-Fi hotspot, and Ford has created the Safe and Smart Package that includes all of the available tech-based safety systems like Adaptive Cruise Control and Cross Traffic Alert.</p>, <p>When it comes to horsepower, the 7-passenger 2018 Ford Explorer SUV delivers at every level. The standard 290-horsepower V6 is strong enough for most buyers, and the 280-horsepower turbo 4-cylinder is powerful but also impressively fuel-efficient. Need more “oomph”? Try out the Sport and Platinum trims’ 365-horsepower 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6. All three engines give the Explorer excellent passing and pulling power, while its heavily weighted steering and taut suspension give this big SUV impressive cornering ability, especially the Sport and Platinum models with their 20-inch wheels. Although its high beltline and massive front bumper make maneuvers in tight quarters a bit harrowing, Ford has done an excellent job keeping road, engine and wind noise out of the cabin, and seating is both comfortable and supportive. The Explorer’s adaptive cruise control works well, but we wish it offered fully autonomous braking like the Honda Pilot, not just collision warning.</p>, <p>ENHANCED ACTIVE PARK ASSIST<br>
 This clever system allows the Explorer to practically park itself. It uses ultrasonic sensors to help parallel-park the SUV and park-out assist to help drivers pull out of parallel-parking spots. The system controls the steering wheel, while the driver operates the accelerator and brake pedals.<br>
<br>
 HANDSFREE POWER LIFTGATE<br>
 Standard on the Limited, Sport and Platinum trim levels, this feature allows you to open the Explorer’s tailgate without dropping your Costco purchase and pulling the key fob from your pocket or purse. Just a wave of your foot under the SUV’s rear bumper opens or closes its hatch.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/explorer/">Ford Explorer</a> SUV for 2018 seats up to seven in its three rows, and the third row offers room for adults. The second row comes as either a 3-person bench, or it can be had with two bucket seats to ease 3rd-row access. Cargo space is generous. We're happy Ford has moved to using actual buttons for most controls, and also like the digital screen integrated into the gauges. The infotainment touch screen is a large 8-inch unit, and Ford’s Sync 3 is easier to use than before and has become one of the more capable systems available.</p>, <p>At first glance, the 2018 Ford Explorer bears a strong resemblance to a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover/">Land Rover Range Rover</a>, pretty good company we'd say. Its standard LED low-beam headlights, grille and bumper give this mainstream SUV an upscale presence. It looks more expensive than it is. And its bulging hood, sculpted sides and flared wheelwells add musculature to the mix. No one will ever confuse the Explorer for a <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a>. The Sport trim level is the most aggressively detailed with blacked out trim and grille and standard 20-inch wheels, while the Limited and Platinum trim levels dial up the chrome.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Explorer SUV comes in five models: base, XLT, Limited, Sport and Platinum. Base models come standard with the 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, LED low-beam headlights and LED taillights, 18-inch wheels, and a rearview camera that incorporates a washer to keep the lens clean. Other standard features include cruise control, air conditioning, a 6-speaker audio system, and Ford's Sync infotainment system. Ford's MyKey allows drivers to program top speed and other parameters to help prevent young drivers from behaving recklessly. Other safety features include trailer Sway Control for easier towing.</p>, <p>Moving up through the model lineup is the best way to get more on your new 2018 Explorer. The mid-level XLT is a good value, offering leather seats, navigation, blind-spot detection, inflatable rear seatbelts, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a dual-panel moonroof. Base and XLT models can substitute a more fuel-efficient 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, which is standard on the Limited model. AWD is available across the board, regardless of your engine choice. The Sport and Platinum models come with the twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 and all-wheel drive plus high-end leather, a premium audio system, leather-covered dash and other <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> items.</p>, <p>The standard 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 on the Ford Explorer is fine for most people, offering plenty of power and acceptable fuel economy. However, the turbocharged EcoBoost 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine is popular because it offers notably more torque and more miles per gallon. Standard on the Sport and Platinum models is the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, bumping power up to a more-than-adequate 365 horsepower. With this engine, the Explorer is just plain fast. Sport and Platinum models also get standard all-wheel drive, but Ford’s AWD system and its Terrain Management System with settings for sand, mud, grass and gravel are available on all models. Additionally, all models use a 6-speed automatic transmission complete with paddle shifters on the steering wheel.<br>
<br>
 3.5-liter V6 (base, XLT)<br>
 290 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm<br>
 255 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br>

The 2.3-liter turbo 4-cylinder adds about $500 to that total, while the all-wheel-drive system tacks on $2,200. We think the better equipped XLT is a better entry point, at its base price of about $35,000. If you're looking for more power, the twin-turbocharged AWD Sport and Platinum models start around $46,000 and $54,000, respectively. That's competitive with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/pathfinder/">Nissan Pathfinder</a>, Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Hyundai Santa Fe. The KBB.com Fair Purchase Price helps you get a good deal by telling you what other Explorer buyers in your area paid. Note that the Explorer's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> holds up better than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/durango/">Dodge Durango</a>, and is right in line with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevrolet Traverse</a> and Pilot, even if it's less than the Highlander.</p>]

[<p>When it comes to the battle for truck supremacy, it's down to Ford, Chevy and Ram, which are also the three top-selling vehicles in America. Ford stays at the top of the heap thanks to constant innovation that makes it easier to get work done while increasing luxury and comfort. With the F-150, Ford has the advanced design of a full-size truck beyond what its competitors are doing, including use of an aluminum body, a 10-speed transmission and tech features that make it easier to tow a trailer. For the 2018 Ford F-150, there are plenty of engine choices: a traditional V8, a new base V6, and three EcoBoost engines that deliver plenty of power for towing and hauling as well as respectable fuel economy. A forthcoming a turbodiesel V6 will round out the power offerings.</p>, <p>The Ford F-150's best-in-class towing capacity is now up to 13,200 pounds. With the F-150, variety is the name of the game: three cabs and beds, a variety of engines (including a diesel coming later in the model year), and trims that run the gamut from a simple work truck to the luxurious Limited to the off-road-ready Raptor.</p>, <p>Cool options make it easier to tow or go off-road, and make the F-150 downright luxurious. But they come at a price, and the F-150 can have a sticker price over $65,000. If you only need light towing and hauling capability, a midsize truck may be a better value.</p>, <p>For 2018, the F-150 receives a more powerful, more efficient base engine; a turbodiesel option; new exterior styling; more power and more efficiency; expanded availability of a 10-speed automatic transmission; new safety features; and an increased towing capacity (now 13,200 pounds), still the highest in its class.</p>, <p>The new 3.3-liter base engine is lighter than the 3.5-liter it replaces, has more horsepower and torque -- and better fuel economy, too. It's a good base engine with enough get-up-and-go for the daily drive and carrying payload. It's not blazing fast, but it's easy to get to and stay at freeway speeds. The 2nd-gen 2.7-liter turbocharged EcoBoost V6 has 25 lb-ft more torque, so it's even quicker off the line. Its combination of speed, efficiency and capability makes it our favorite of the lineup. With the 5.0-liter V8, acceleration is natural and linear. The 3.5-liter makes the F-150 fast when unloaded and a capable, stout hard worker. Towing is effortless. The F-150's SuperCrew cabin is roomy, offering excellent legroom and a comfortable ride. Suspension and brakes were designed so that whether the truck is loaded or unloaded, the ride doesn't suffer and brakes feel confident and strong.</p>, <p>2.7-LITER ECOBOOST ENGINE<br>
 The 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 engine has as much torque as the available 5.0-liter V8, has the best fuel economy of the gas engines, and has the power to tow up to 8,500 pounds, plenty for a boat or RV. It's the sweet spot in the lineup and the best-selling engine.<br>
<br>
 TOWING-ASSIST SYSTEMS<br>
 When parking a trailer, Pro Trailer Backup Assist allows the driver to input left or right commands via a knob, watching on a screen as the F-150 handles steering and braking. The Blind Spot Information System covers truck and trailer. The 360-degree camera eases the task of connecting a trailer.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 F-150's interior is rugged and attractive, but above all, it's easy to use. There are new interior colors for 2018, and plenty of available cool features like 3-prong power outlets, adaptive cruise control that can bring the truck to a full stop, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, active park assist, and the ability to have the Sync 3 infotainment system read text messages to you while you drive. The SuperCrew (crew cab) is extremely roomy, with rear-seat legroom that bests some full-size sedans. Because the F-150's floor is flat, even the dreaded middle rear seat is comfortable.</p>, <p>Ford's full-size pickup continues to use a military-grade aluminum body, but for 2018 that body has been restyled to emulate the looks of the big-brother Super Duty lineup. New grilles, headlights and wheel designs help differentiate the different trim levels. Aside from the truck's new look, much about the design was born from necessity. The tailgate is available with a pull-out step that makes it much easier to get into the bed to manage payload. There are also pop-out steps on the sides that help with the same purpose.</p>, <p>The base-model F-150 is a regular-cab, 2-wheel-drive (2WD) XL, which comes with enough standard equipment that makes it possible to buy a decent truck to get work done at a reasonable price. Even trucks equipped with the new 3.3-liter base engine and 6-speed automatic transmission come standard with auto start/stop, and all F-150s get the same ultra-strong hydroformed, fully boxed frame. Hill-start assist and Trailer Sway Control are standard, as are Curve Control, 17-inch wheels and air conditioning.<b></b></p>, <p>There are plenty of appealing upscale trim levels, including the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Available options make the interior luxury plush, such as heated leather front and rear seats (10-way-power, cooled and massaging front seats), Sync 3 and Bang &amp; Olufsen Play or Sony audio systems. A variety of towing assist and safety systems are offered, as are adaptive cruise control and side steps that deploy when a door is opened and retract when the door closes. On the safety front, the 2018 Ford F-150 is offered with inflatable rear seatbelts and a blind-spot information system. Four-wheel drive (4WD) is available.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford F-150 will be available with six engines, one of which is a new 3.0-liter turbodiesel set for release later in the model year. The new base engine is a 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V6 -- more powerful and more efficient than the engine it replaces -- and the only one in the line with a 6-speed automatic. The rest use a 10-speed automatic, including the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6, now with 25 lb-ft more torque than last year and the best fuel economy of all the gas engines. The 5.0-liter V8 gains horsepower and torque, and both versions of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost remain unchanged. However, thanks to a new towing package and other changes, you can now tow up to 13,200 pounds with a 3.5-liter-equipped F-150.<br>

XLT pricing begins at $34,265. The Lariat starts at nearly $42,000, which sounds like a bigger price jump than it actually is, because every model above the XLT comes as a SuperCab (extended cab) or larger, while the XL and XLT prices are for regular cabs. The Raptor begins at $51,080, the King Ranch at nearly $53,000 and the Platinum is $55,450. Pricing is comparable to trucks like the Ram 1500 and Chevrolet Silverado, but as is the case with many full-size trucks, F-150s can get pricey. The top-line Limited starts at $61,815 and with every option it can cost around $67,000. To see what people in your area are paying for their new trucks, check out the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price. As far as resale value goes, the 2018 Ford F-150 holds its own among its competitors, with the Toyota Tundra being the standard bearer of the bunch.<br>

[<p>When it comes to the battle for truck supremacy, it's down to Ford, Chevy and Ram, which are also the three top-selling vehicles in America. Ford stays at the top of the heap thanks to constant innovation that makes it easier to get work done while increasing luxury and comfort. With the F-150, Ford has the advanced design of a full-size truck beyond what its competitors are doing, including use of an aluminum body, a 10-speed transmission and tech features that make it easier to tow a trailer. For the 2018 Ford F-150, there are plenty of engine choices: a traditional V8, a new base V6, and three EcoBoost engines that deliver plenty of power for towing and hauling as well as respectable fuel economy. A forthcoming a turbodiesel V6 will round out the power offerings.</p>, <p>The Ford F-150's best-in-class towing capacity is now up to 13,200 pounds. With the F-150, variety is the name of the game: three cabs and beds, a variety of engines (including a diesel coming later in the model year), and trims that run the gamut from a simple work truck to the luxurious Limited to the off-road-ready Raptor.</p>, <p>Cool options make it easier to tow or go off-road, and make the F-150 downright luxurious. But they come at a price, and the F-150 can have a sticker price over $65,000. If you only need light towing and hauling capability, a midsize truck may be a better value.</p>, <p>For 2018, the F-150 receives a more powerful, more efficient base engine; a turbodiesel option; new exterior styling; more power and more efficiency; expanded availability of a 10-speed automatic transmission; new safety features; and an increased towing capacity (now 13,200 pounds), still the highest in its class.</p>, <p>The new 3.3-liter base engine is lighter than the 3.5-liter it replaces, has more horsepower and torque -- and better fuel economy, too. It's a good base engine with enough get-up-and-go for the daily drive and carrying payload. It's not blazing fast, but it's easy to get to and stay at freeway speeds. The 2nd-gen 2.7-liter turbocharged EcoBoost V6 has 25 lb-ft more torque, so it's even quicker off the line. Its combination of speed, efficiency and capability makes it our favorite of the lineup. With the 5.0-liter V8, acceleration is natural and linear. The 3.5-liter makes the F-150 fast when unloaded and a capable, stout hard worker. Towing is effortless. The F-150's SuperCrew cabin is roomy, offering excellent legroom and a comfortable ride. Suspension and brakes were designed so that whether the truck is loaded or unloaded, the ride doesn't suffer and brakes feel confident and strong.</p>, <p>2.7-LITER ECOBOOST ENGINE<br>
 The 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 engine has as much torque as the available 5.0-liter V8, has the best fuel economy of the gas engines, and has the power to tow up to 8,500 pounds, plenty for a boat or RV. It's the sweet spot in the lineup and the best-selling engine.<br>
<br>
 TOWING-ASSIST SYSTEMS<br>
 When parking a trailer, Pro Trailer Backup Assist allows the driver to input left or right commands via a knob, watching on a screen as the F-150 handles steering and braking. The Blind Spot Information System covers truck and trailer. The 360-degree camera eases the task of connecting a trailer.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 F-150's interior is rugged and attractive, but above all, it's easy to use. There are new interior colors for 2018, and plenty of available cool features like 3-prong power outlets, adaptive cruise control that can bring the truck to a full stop, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, active park assist, and the ability to have the Sync 3 infotainment system read text messages to you while you drive. The SuperCrew (crew cab) is extremely roomy, with rear-seat legroom that bests some full-size sedans. Because the F-150's floor is flat, even the dreaded middle rear seat is comfortable.</p>, <p>Ford's full-size pickup continues to use a military-grade aluminum body, but for 2018 that body has been restyled to emulate the looks of the big-brother Super Duty lineup. New grilles, headlights and wheel designs help differentiate the different trim levels. Aside from the truck's new look, much about the design was born from necessity. The tailgate is available with a pull-out step that makes it much easier to get into the bed to manage payload. There are also pop-out steps on the sides that help with the same purpose.</p>, <p>The base-model F-150 is a regular-cab, 2-wheel-drive (2WD) XL, which comes with enough standard equipment that makes it possible to buy a decent truck to get work done at a reasonable price. Even trucks equipped with the new 3.3-liter base engine and 6-speed automatic transmission come standard with auto start/stop, and all F-150s get the same ultra-strong hydroformed, fully boxed frame. Hill-start assist and Trailer Sway Control are standard, as are Curve Control, 17-inch wheels and air conditioning.<b></b></p>, <p>There are plenty of appealing upscale trim levels, including the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Available options make the interior luxury plush, such as heated leather front and rear seats (10-way-power, cooled and massaging front seats), Sync 3 and Bang &amp; Olufsen Play or Sony audio systems. A variety of towing assist and safety systems are offered, as are adaptive cruise control and side steps that deploy when a door is opened and retract when the door closes. On the safety front, the 2018 Ford F-150 is offered with inflatable rear seatbelts and a blind-spot information system. Four-wheel drive (4WD) is available.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford F-150 will be available with six engines, one of which is a new 3.0-liter turbodiesel set for release later in the model year. The new base engine is a 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V6 -- more powerful and more efficient than the engine it replaces -- and the only one in the line with a 6-speed automatic. The rest use a 10-speed automatic, including the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6, now with 25 lb-ft more torque than last year and the best fuel economy of all the gas engines. The 5.0-liter V8 gains horsepower and torque, and both versions of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost remain unchanged. However, thanks to a new towing package and other changes, you can now tow up to 13,200 pounds with a 3.5-liter-equipped F-150.<br>

XLT pricing begins at $34,265. The Lariat starts at nearly $42,000, which sounds like a bigger price jump than it actually is, because every model above the XLT comes as a SuperCab (extended cab) or larger, while the XL and XLT prices are for regular cabs. The Raptor begins at $51,080, the King Ranch at nearly $53,000 and the Platinum is $55,450. Pricing is comparable to trucks like the Ram 1500 and Chevrolet Silverado, but as is the case with many full-size trucks, F-150s can get pricey. The top-line Limited starts at $61,815 and with every option it can cost around $67,000.

As far as resale value goes, the 2018 Ford F-150 holds its own among its competitors, with the Toyota Tundra being the standard bearer of the bunch.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Ford F-Series Super Duty caters to those who need more than what a half-ton truck can accomplish, making the Super Duty a favorite for such heavy industries as logging, construction and oil exploration. Ford’s F-250, F-350 and F-450 are also popular with those needing to tow a large luxury trailer or an oversized powerboat. And, while competitors like the Ram 2500/3500 Heavy-Duty, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra HD, and Nissan Titan XD offer considerable towing ability, the Ford Super Duty remains king of the hill at a maximum 34,000 pounds when equipped with a gooseneck hitch. Along with its lightweight aluminum body, the 2018 Super Duty also offers one of the plushest cabins ever put into a full-size pickup.</p>, <p>If the 2018 Super Duty’s best-in-class towing and payload figures don’t win you over, its stylish cabin, rigid aluminum body and powerful diesel-engine option certainly will.</p>, <p>If price is a major concern, a loaded Super Duty may not be your best choice. The aluminum body is still relatively new, so any drawbacks have yet to be revealed.</p>, <p>Fresh from its introduction last year, the 2018 Ford Super Duty heavy-duty pickup sees only one major change of note, that being a new Limited trim. When fully loaded, the Limited pushes the Super Duty’s price tag close to 6-digit territory.</p>, <p>Regardless if the 2018 Ford Super Duty pickup is equipped with the 6.2-liter gasoline V8 or 6.7-liter turbodiesel, torque is never in short supply. Acceleration is swift by full-size truck standards, as is passing and pulling power. The diesel’s 925 lb-ft of torque serves up an impressive 34,000-pound max tow rating, although most models in the Super Duty lineup range between 15,000 and 18,000 pounds when using conventional towing methods. Inside the roomy cabin there’s a feeling of familiarity, which is to be expected as the Super Duty now shares its dash and seats with the half-ton Ford F-150. On the road, the Super Duty’s cabin is surprisingly well isolated from the outside world, with a compliant suspension and available Adaptive Steering that can adjust steering effort depending on vehicle speed.</p>, <p>ADAPTIVE STEERING<br>
 Ford’s Adaptive Steering system assists in tight parking-lot maneuvers as well as when towing a trailer. For a mere $685, Adaptive Steering delivers the variable-ratio assist of an electric unit but the feel and fluidity commonly associated with a hydraulic setup.<br>
<br>
 DRIVER ASSIST TECH<br>
 Seven electronic eyes assist with everything from connecting a trailer to revealing objects outside the driver’s line of sight. The numerous camera lenses can show a 360-degree view around the truck, as well as a 180-degree forward view. Blind-spot monitors take into account the trailer’s blind spot, and the tire-pressure monitor keeps tabs on both the truck and trailer.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>All three cabs are roomy and built for comfort, as the Super Duty’s cab now strongly resembles that of the F-150. While you can get a basic cabin, there is no shortage of luxury options. The highfalutin cowboy-themed King Ranch, Platinum and the top-of-the-line Limited all coddle you in yards of leather and offer all the power-operated equipment you want. The front seats boast options such as heating and cooling, 10-way-power adjustment and seat massagers. Sync 3 serves as an intuitive hub for multimedia (including Apple CarPlay) and navigation, and is surrounded by plenty of easy-to-use controls.</p>, <p>The Super Duty's latest redesign sharpened up the style of the grille, headlights, mirrors, doors and even the shape of the fender flares. However, more significant than that is what's underneath. The body and bed are made from high-strength military-grade aluminum. This move reduces weight without sacrificing toughness, and even though Ford reinvested some of that weight in a stronger frame, axles and brakes, the truck is still lighter than the last-generation Super Duty. Notable features include the next-generation tailgate step, LED lighting, power running boards, storable loading ramps, and a power-locking tailgate you can open with the remote.</p>, <p>The F-Series Super Duty comes standard with a 4-speaker AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, black vinyl floor covering, 2.3-inch productivity screen within the instrument cluster, and two power points and an aux jack. Standard with the regular-cab F-250 Super Duty is the 8-foot bed, manually telescoping trailer mirrors, 17-inch wheels, damped tailgate, tie-down hooks and tow hooks. On the safety side, all Super Dutys come with 4-wheel power disc brakes, AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control, and Trailer Sway Control. Power door locks and windows are optional.</p>, <p>You can make an F-Series Super Duty as posh as you like, as functional as you like, or anywhere in between. If you so choose, adorn the cabin with buttery leather, 10-way-power heated/cooled massaging front seats, adaptive cruise control, Sync 3, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto and a 2-panel moonroof. Available features make it easier to attach a snowplow or camper, a 5th-wheel or gooseneck trailer, or make the truck more off-road capable. The 7-camera trailer-tow camera system includes a handy 360-degree camera. Other options include a front camera washer, a vehicle safe and a 48-gallon fuel tank.</p>, <p>The gasoline V8 has 430 lb-ft of torque, plus it's backed by a lightweight and efficient 6-speed automatic transmission. The Power Stroke turbodiesel V8 puts out 440 horsepower, and torque is an impressive 925 lb-ft. There should be no concern about range anxiety, as there's a 48-gallon fuel tank available. Trucks in this size category are not rated for fuel economy. As is the case with nearly all diesel engines, the Power Stroke requires the use of Diesel Exhaust Fluid.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>6.2-liter V8<br>
 385 horsepower @ 5,750 rpm<br>
 430 lb-ft of torque @ 3,800 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>6.7-liter turbocharged diesel V8<br>
 440 horsepower @ 2,800 rpm<br>
 925 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The F-Series Super Duty is offered as a regular cab, SuperCab and Crew Cab, with multiple bed lengths and 2- or 4-wheel drive. There are seven trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. It's easy for a truck in this segment to get expensive, and the F-Series Super Duty is no exception. You can get a regular cab F-250 XL with the 6.2-liter V8 for a relatively fleet-friendly Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just shy of $33,700. However, move up to the F-350 Crew Cab Limited with dual rear wheels and order options, and it's possible to pay $85,000 or more. Base pricing is similar to the Chevy Silverado HD2500/3500, Ram 2500/3500 Heavy-Duty, and GMC Sierra HD2500 or HD3500, but Silverado and Sierra HDs top out at lower prices.

Available features make it easier to attach a snowplow or camper, a 5th-wheel or gooseneck trailer, or make the truck more off-road capable. The 7-camera trailer-tow camera system includes a handy 360-degree camera. Other options include a front camera washer, a vehicle safe and a 48-gallon fuel tank.</p>, <p>The gasoline V8 has 430 lb-ft of torque, plus it's backed by a lightweight and efficient 6-speed automatic transmission. The Power Stroke turbodiesel V8 puts out 440 horsepower, and torque is an impressive 925 lb-ft. There should be no concern about range anxiety, as there's a 48-gallon fuel tank available. Trucks in this size category are not rated for fuel economy. As is the case with nearly all diesel engines, the Power Stroke requires the use of Diesel Exhaust Fluid.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Ford F-Series Super Duty caters to those who need more than what a half-ton truck can accomplish, making the Super Duty a favorite for such heavy industries as logging, construction and oil exploration. Ford’s F-250, F-350 and F-450 are also popular with those needing to tow a large luxury trailer or an oversized powerboat. And, while competitors like the Ram 2500/3500 Heavy-Duty, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra HD, and Nissan Titan XD offer considerable towing ability, the Ford Super Duty remains king of the hill at a maximum 34,000 pounds when equipped with a gooseneck hitch.

Inside the roomy cabin there’s a feeling of familiarity, which is to be expected as the Super Duty now shares its dash and seats with the half-ton Ford F-150.

[<p>In a world of cheap gas and plentiful SUVs, the subcompact car is having a hard time finding an audience. However, for those who do prefer a small, fuel-efficient commuter car that is also smartly styled and loads of fun to drive, Ford builds the 2018 Fiesta subcompact. Offered in four trims and two body styles (sedan and hatchback), the Fiesta has a leg up on most of it competitors, although its aging design means you won’t find cutting-edge features like the Toyota Yaris’ forward-collision warning or the Honda Fit’s adaptive cruise control. Then again, none of the Fiesta’s rivals have anything to match the taut suspension and 197-horsepower accompanying the sporty Fiesta ST.</p>, <p>If you’re searching for a fun, affordable and fuel-efficient small car that’s also tech savvy, the 2018 Ford Fiesta deserves a test drive. Those with a need for speed will love the ST trim, one of the few performance-minded subcompacts available.</p>, <p>If you need lots of rear-seat space, the latest in accident avoidance and driver-assist features or best-in-class resale figures, you might be happier in a Honda Fit, Hyundai Accent or Kia Rio, the last two offering a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Fiesta drops the 3-cylinder, 1.0-liter engine option, but gains a larger infotainment screen and standard rearview monitor.</p>, <p>Confident, comfortable and easily controlled, the 2018 Ford Fiesta remains a favorite. Yes, an aging design means it’s missing some key safety features, and there are foreign competitors out there that offer more content at a better price (not to mention a better warranty), but after a few minutes behind the Fiesta’s wheel, all of those trivialities melt into the rearview mirror. Run the Fiesta through a winding single-lane road, and you’ll be amazed at the car’s poised balance, nimble reflexes and communicative steering. Power from the 1.6-liter engine isn’t robust, but it’s sufficient, especially when paired with the slick 5-speed manual (a 6-speed automatic is optional). For those willing to spend a bit more, the 197-horsepower ST trim is the ultimate “little rocket man,” offering both performance and economy in a versatile hatchback body. Standard equipment includes 17-inch wheels and performance tires, a sport suspension and available Recaro sport seats.</p>, <p>SYNC 3<br>
 The Fiesta’s Sync 3 infotainment system isn’t some watered-down version of the system found on larger Ford cars, it’s a fully-functioning setup displayed through a big 6.5-inch touch screen. Voice commands can summon most features, and there’s even an available Sync AppLink that allows for voice control of some smartphone mobile apps.<br>
<br>
ST TRIM’S 1.6-LITER ECOBOOST ENGINE<br>
 The turbocharged EcoBoost 1.6-liter engine in the ST trim is a wonderful powerplant, delivering excellent low-end torque, ample power for passing and a melodious song as the rpms climb high into the rev band. An estimated 33 mpg highway fuel-economy rating is just icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As a sedan or hatchback, the 2018 Ford Fiesta seats five; however, rear-seat legroom is a bit cramped even for a subcompact. Cargo volume is generous. All sedans have 60/40-folding rear seats for larger items, and the hatchback offers over 25 cubic feet of space with its rear seats folded. Lower-trim models are Spartan with basic but easy-to-use controls. Comfort is high and the materials feel good to the touch. It’s also nicely put together. There’s an overall feeling of quality. If you're willing to spend, things can get fancy with leather seats, ambient lighting and push-button start.</p>, <p>In a world where “affordable subcompact” too often means “dowdy and unattractive,” the 2018 Ford Fiesta wears a stylish and distinctive suit. Attractive and modern as a 4-door sedan or more practical 5-door hatchback, the new Fiesta never turns heads for the wrong reasons. In addition to swallowing more cargo, the hatchback is particularly attractive, offering better proportions and a sportier physique. The Fiesta ST is endowed with a more aggressive style befitting its high-performance intentions, including larger wheels and tires, a deeper front spoiler, ST badging and two chrome exhaust pipes right out of your hot-rodding high school dreams.</p>, <p>The least expensive Fiesta is the S sedan, but even it is nicely equipped. Standard fare includes a 4.2-inch display screen, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/MP3 radio with auxiliary input, rearview monitor, air conditioning, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, power door locks, Hill Start Assist, dual USB inputs and keyless entry. You will, however, still have to crank your own windows. SE models add cruise control, power windows and the MyKey system. Top-line Titanium trims include the reverse-sensing system, Sony premium audio, leather seating (heated in front), automatic climate control and the latest Sync system.</p>, <p>Popular options for the 2018 Fiesta include the Sync infotainment system, which now has a larger 6.5-inch touch screen with smartphone gestures like swipe and pinch to zoom, navigation, power moonroof, heated front seats, keyless entry pad, satellite radio, and an automatic transmission. The potent Fiesta ST hatchback can be made racier with hood stripes and race-car-ready, height-adjustable Recaro seats with cool leather and cloth upholstery. Strangely no automatic transmission is available on the ST.</p>, <p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Ford Fiesta. The standard powerplant, and the best choice for the majority of buyers, is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 120 horsepower. It’s available with a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission and delivers impressive fuel economy. If saving gasoline is less of a concern and you just want to have more fun, a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and 6-speed manual gearbox await you in the 197-horsepower Fiesta ST. All Fiestas are front-wheel drive (FWD).<br>
<br>

 120 horsepower @ 6,350 rpm<br>
 112 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/33 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Fiesta S sedan has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just a hair over $15,000 with a manual transmission. Unless the lowest price is of highest concern, we recommend at least stepping up to the mid-trim Fiesta SE, which begins around $16,300. A top-line Fiesta Titanium costs right around $20,000. Opting for the hatchback version of any of these three trims is about $300 more. The hatchback-only Fiesta ST begins at $22,160. Stuff a 2018 Fiesta with options, and you're looking at a low- to mid-$20,000 subcompact. This is in line with competitors such as the Chevrolet Sonic and Honda Fit. Undercutting the Fiesta's starting price are the Nissan Versa Note, Kia Rio and Mitsubishi Mirage. Before buying, check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Fiesta's residual value has traditionally been about average, but lagged the leading Honda Fit.</p>]

[<p>Part SUV, part station <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/wagon/">wagon</a>, part <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/ford/flex/2018/">2018 Ford Flex</a> could truly be called a “crossover” SUV. And to get the inventible pun out of the way early, it really is flexible. This 3-row utility vehicle can be configured to seat six or seven passengers, and even those in the last row enjoy decent room. As with potential rivals such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a> and its own sibling the Explorer, the Flex has plenty of amenities to keep families occupied and comfortable, and is available with all-wheel drive to better contend with inclement weather. What really separates the Flex is its design. Boxy and lower-riding than other <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, it has laudable room inside while making its own statement outside.</p>, <p>If you want the roominess and ease of entry of a minivan and the utility of an SUV -- but seek an alternative to both -- the 2018 Flex deftly splits the difference. While standing out with its style, the Flex can also be a sleeper with the optional, potent twin-turbo V6.</p>, <p>The Flex's long and boxy shape isn't for everyone, and your eyes will tell you which camp you fall in. The Flex doesn't offer the more advanced active-safety features like lane-keep assistance or automatic emergency braking, and it lags rivals in fuel efficiency.</p>, <p>Aside from a minor exterior color change ("Blue" is added, "Blue Jeans" is gone), the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/flex/">Ford Flex</a> carries over mostly unchanged for 2018. Filed under notable recent improvement, however, is the updated Sync 3 infotainment system that's compatible with phones running Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The Ford Flex <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV has a plush ride that belies its car-as-rectangle appearance. It’s quite maneuverable in the city, though you'll definitely want to use the mirrors, standard rearview camera and good sense when backing up. We found the steering precise and the suspension supple in both higher-speed cornering and highway cruising. The Flex is at its best in the latter thanks to its plush ride, but road noise can intrude with the larger wheel-and-tire packages. The standard, 287-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 is more than adequate for most tasks, but the real honey is the optional 3.5-liter EcoBoost twin-turbo. With 365 horsepower and standard all-wheel drive, the turbocharged Flex is surprisingly fast. With either engine, the Ford Flex can tow up to 4,500 pounds with the Class III tow package. The Flex offers some driver-assist features like adaptive cruise control, but lacks more sophisticated features like lane-keep assist and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>MULTIPANEL VISTA ROOF<br/> With this option, everyone in the Flex gets a sky view and prevents even rear passengers from feeling closed-in. The glass panels consist of a moonroof in front, twin skylights over the second row, and a large single skylight over the third row.<b><br/> <br/> </b>SYNC 3<br/> <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a>'s audio and information system keeps improving, and Sync 3 is its best yet. Along with being easier to see and use, this touch-screen system is now compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, systems that seamlessly link with your smartphone. Sync 3 is standard on SEL and Limited trims.</p>, <p>All 2018 Flex crossover SUVs have three rows and standard seating for seven. In SEL or Limited trims, you can swap the 2nd-row bench for a pair of bucket seats. This reduces total passenger count to six, but provides premium accommodations for those in the second row, along with easy pass-through access to the third row. Among the Flex's biggest appeal is the ease of getting in and out, making it convenient for kids and adults alike. Additionally, the rear rows fold flat, as does the front passenger seat, enabling you to haul gear like a long board or 8-foot ladder.</p>, <p>The Flex continues to stand out from almost every other vehicle on the road. Blocky and slab-sided, this box-on-wheels has a charisma all its own. As with any other unique design, some folks will love it, others won't. Less subjective is the Flex's ride height, which nicely splits the different between <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> and SUV. This provides good visibility while not making you feel like you need a ladder to get in and out. A power tailgate is optional on SEL models and standard on the Limited, but it doesn't offer the snazzy foot-gesture opening that you can get on a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/explorer/">Ford Explorer</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Flex comes in three trims: SE, SEL and Limited. The least expensive Ford Flex comes with cloth seats, 6-way power-adjustable driver's seat, rearview camera with reverse-sensing system, and climate control with rear auxiliary system. Standard audio/infotainment is an AM/FM/CD player with Bluetooth phone connectivity, USB/aux inputs and a basic version of Sync, Ford's hub that connects it all. For $2,700 more, we recommend the Flex SEL, which adds dual-zone climate control, universal garage-door opener, heated front seats, push-button start, 10-way-power driver's seat and -- importantly -- the Sync 3 infotainment system that's ready for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>The top-line Flex Limited model comes with a power tailgate, leather seats, blind-spot monitoring, navigation and Sony premium audio system. Except on base models, all-wheel drive (AWD) can be had in lieu of the standard front-wheel drive (FWD), while Ford's inflatable rear seatbelts are available on all trims. SEL and Limited trims offer options like power-folding rear seats, the Multipanel Vista Roof, heated steering wheel and ventilated front seats. The Limited model is also your only choice if you want the powerful 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine or the active park-assist feature to assist with parallel parking.</p>, <p>Two V6 engines are offered in the 2018 Flex. Standard across all trims is a naturally aspirated (non-turbo) 3.5-liter that is perfectly adequate for most tasks. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. Limited trims have the option of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6, which has twin turbochargers, standard all-wheel drive and a noticeably more powerful attitude. All Flex models use a 6-speed automatic transmission with manual shift mode, and the Flex Limited with the turbo engine also has steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. With the optional Class III trailering package, the Ford Flex can tow up to 4,500 pounds. The Flex can run on regular unleaded gasoline with either engine, but fuel economy lags rival crossover SUVs like the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot.<br>

A better proposition is the SEL model, which starts at $33,905 and includes more features and allows for options like all-wheel drive. The top-line Flex Limited starts several thousands higher, at $39,405. Loaded up with the turbo engine and other features, the Flex can pass the $48,000 mark. At these prices, the Flex starts just below its Explorer SUV brother and is in line with other traditional 3-row crossover SUVs like the Highlander and Honda Pilot. Competitors such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sorento/">Kia Sorento</a> can be had for less.

[<p>A perennial best-seller in the compact class, the fun-to-drive 2018 Ford Focus is available as an affordable sedan or as a versatile hatchback. High-tech features and high fuel economy help the Focus compete with the Chevy Cruze, Mazda3, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/accent/">Hyundai Accent</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/forte/">Kia Forte</a>. Four trim levels are available, as well as several powertrains including an extremely fuel-efficient 123-horsepower 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine in the Focus SE Sedan. For enthusiasts, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> offers two high-performance turbocharged versions of the 2018 Focus Hatchback, the 297-horsepower Focus ST and the 350-horsepower all-wheel-drive Focus RS. They compete with the VW Golf GTI and Golf R and the Honda Civic Si and Type R. There’s also an all-electric Focus that challenges the Chevy Bolt, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/leaf/">Nissan Leaf</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/e-golf/">Volkswagen e-Golf</a> and offers about 80 miles of range.</p>, <p>Sure it’s affordable, fuel efficient and attractively styled, but the best part about the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a> is its sporty dynamics. Few cars in the compact class are as fun to drive as the Focus. It handles well and its steering is quick and responsive with plenty of feel. If you like to drive you’ll like the 2018 Ford Focus.</p>, <p>Ford offers the Focus as a sedan or a 5-door hatchback. If you were hoping for a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> in this class, check out the Honda Civic coupe. <a alt_o_t="Wagons" href="/wagon/">Wagons</a> in this class are also unicorns. The only one is the VW Golf SportWagen. The Civic is also a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, while the Ford Focus is not.</p>, <p>There are no changes to the Ford Focus for 2018.</p>, <p>Few cars in the compact class are as fun to drive as the 2018 Ford Focus. It handles well, its steering is quick and responsive with plenty of feel and its stopping power is impressive. The standard 160-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder in the S and SEL models is strong. If horsepower is less important than fuel economy consider the SE Sedan, which is powered by a turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder. It makes only 123 horsepower, but gets considerably better mileage than the 2.0-liter, including 40 mpg on the highway. Most will also like the ride delivered by the SE trim, which can be nicely loaded up and still remain well below $25,000. The SEL and Titanium bring even more bells and whistles, including larger tires and a sport suspension. The 252-horsepower Focus ST is an impressive piece of work: fast, fun and comfortable. While the 350-horsepower all-wheel-drive Focus RS is nothing short of the new benchmark in the high-performance small-car market.</p>, <p>ACTIVE PARK ASSIST<br>
 An optional feature for just $395, this clever system will practically parallel park your Ford Focus for you. After the system identifies an appropriate space, it will do all the steering for you as well as instruct you when to work the pedals and change gears.<br>
<br>
 TITANIUM TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE<br>
 For $795, this optional package is a strong value. It adds automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring and cross-traffic alert, which warns the driver of cars approaching from the side when backing out of a parking space. This package also adds Lane-Keeping Alert, which lets you know when you’re drifting out of your lane.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Front-seat accommodations are spacious, and the Ford’s front seats are well-shaped and supportive. The new 2018 Ford Focus can seat five; unfortunately, the Focus’ rear-seat head- and legroom are now surpassed by a number of competitors. The climate controls and steering-wheel buttons are easy to use, and the blue backlighting is both stylish and easy on the eyes. Interior storage is also well-thought-out, with well-placed cup holders and a small cubby ahead of the shifter that’s perfect for your phone. It even includes a USB port for easy phone charging. The Titanium trim level adds luxuries including a sunroof, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>With a sleek, raked windshield and tastefully flared fenders the well-proportioned Ford Focus sedan is attractive and sporty. But the Focus hatchback is the runway model of the two, with European style and unique taillights that accentuate the width of its rear view. SE and up models all get attractive alloy wheels, with large 17-inch rims on Titanium models. The hot ST model and red-hot RS, also <a alt_o_t="Hatchbacks" href="/hatchback/">hatchbacks</a>, both wear aerodynamic enhancements that announce their intentions but don’t break out the bullhorn. They look racy but not ridiculous. The Focus <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">Electric</a> is identified by its charge-port door on it left front fender and its lack of a tailpipe.</p>, <p>All new 2018 Ford Focus models come standard with MyKey, a feature that allows owners to limit maximum speed and other settings for young drivers. Other standard features for the Focus S include air conditioning, a tilt/telescoping steering column, keyless remote entry and an AM/FM/CD/MP3 radio. SE models get standard Sync with MyFord Driver Connect, cruise control, a folding rear seat, rearview camera and 16-inch tires on alloy wheels. Titanium models add leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, 10-speaker Sony audio, push-button starting, and Sync 3 with MyFord Touch; Focus Electric models get eco-fabric seat covers and voice-activated navigation.</p>, <p>Ford’s new Focus benefits from several option packages. SE models can be equipped with the Sport Package, which adds exterior styling enhancements, paddle shifters for the automatic transmission, revised suspension settings and 17-inch wheels. Also available are a blind-spot-warning system, a lane-keeping alert system and rear cross-traffic alert. Additionally, Ford's Sync AppLink is available, allowing Focus drivers to interact with more than 60 AppLink-enabled apps on their phones through the car's Sync technology. Active Park Assist, which can practically parallel park the car for you, handling and winter packages, and navigation are also available. The Titanium trim level adds desirable amenities including rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>Most new Ford Focus models use a 160-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic. On the SE with Sport Package and Titanium models, the automated-manual transmission adds SelectShift paddles. To take fuel economy to the next level, the 2018 Ford Focus SE Sedan is equipped with a turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine. That model is rated at 40 mpg in highway driving. Focus Electric models get a 143-horsepower permanent-magnet motor and a range of about 75 miles. The 2018 Focus ST uses a 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine that makes 252 horsepower and is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, while the RS gets a 350-horsepower 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine and standard all-wheel drive.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Ford Fusion is practically an entire car line on its own. There's a little something for anybody looking for a comfortable and nicely equipped <a alt_o_t="Midsize Sedan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-sedans/2000009275/">midsize sedan</a>. The low-end Fusion S comes with enough standard equipment that bargain hunters won't feel like they've compromised, while the higher-end Fusion Platinum comes with enough features to pass as the <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a> the Fusion's sweeping exterior styling suggests.

Fuel misers will appreciate the Fusion Hybrid and plug-in Fusion Hybrid Energi, spendthrifts the generous level of standard equipment in base models, and the features-and-tech crowd will like the Platinum models or the speedy Fusion Sport.</p>, <p>The rear seat is a little upright, and there's no diesel option available (although the <a alt_o_t="Hybrids" href="/hybrid/">hybrids</a> do extremely well on fuel economy). About the only argument against midsize-sedan buyers shopping the Fusion is brand loyalty.</p>, <p>The Fusion got quite a few changes last year to its exterior appearance, features and tech.

It's one of the few midsize <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> available in all-wheel drive, for starters, and all models benefit from a sporty-feeling suspension and sharp steering. The base-model's 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine isn't very inspiring, but it's not much of a step up to the mid-level models with their 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, and available 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 240 horsepower. But if power is really your thing, the 2018 Fusion Sport offers a twin-turbo 2.7-liter V6 with 325 horsepower and standard all-wheel drive. On the other end of the fuel-consumption scale are two hybrid models, the Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid Energi plug-in model, which like the standard sedan both come in a hedonistic Platinum model. The easier-to-use Sync system improves the driving experience of any Fusion model that has it.</p>, <p>PLUG-IN HYBRID VERSION<br/> Even with new plug-in hybrids like the Prius Prime and Chevy Volt in the fray, the 2018 Ford Fusion Hybrid Energi holds its own with 21 miles of electric-only driving range. When that runs out, you still have a gasoline engine and a 610-mile range.<br/> <br/> V6 POWER<br/> On the other hand, we're suckers for horsepower, and we're down with the 2018 Ford Fusion Sport and its 325-horsepower 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6. Along with AWD and an even better suspension, the Fusion Sport promises <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> performance on, well, a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> budget.<br/> </p>, <p>What MKZ?

Across the line are other high-tech-feeling touches, like the rotary shifter and electronic parking brake. But along with all the high tech -- such as an updated Sync system that's now compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto -- Ford remains focused on the basics. The roomy interior can comfortably seat four adults, or three kids in back, and there's a huge trunk. Hybrids have a smaller trunk, but augment cargo space with a pass-through for long items.</p>, <p>Even after last year's updates, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fusion/">Ford Fusion</a>'s styling bears a favorable resemblance to something <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/aston%20martin/">Aston Martin</a> might make. The Platinum models, with their extra chrome and unique wheels, look the part of a luxury sedan, while the Fusion Sport models get sporty fog lights, a mesh grille and charcoal-colored wheels. Ford's EasyFuel capless gas-filler system eliminates the possibility of losing the gas cap, or not screwing it on properly. For EV aficionados, the Fusion Energi models use a lighted ring around the charge port to indicate charge levels, with a fully lit ring meaning a fully charged battery.</p>, <p>The base-model 2018 Fusion S comes with a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic transmission, along with manual climate control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, audio system with USB and auxiliary inputs, a rearview camera, and Ford's Sync wireless communication system with voice control. The mid-level Fusion SE is where it's at, though, with its 10-way-power driver's seat, rear air vents, a 6-speaker audio system and 17-inch wheels. Higher-end Titanium models come standard with the more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, upgraded audio systems, Sync 3 with greatly improved usability, and niceties like dual-zone auto climate control, leather seating and 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Despite the good standard equipment, there is room for plenty of options on the 2018 Ford Fusion. The Fusion SE is your best bet, with a wide range of options available, including blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control with collision warning to help expand driver awareness and make the Fusion an excellent road-trip sedan. There's a reverse-sensing system to warn you of obstacles, and an Active Park Assist system will actually parallel-park the car for you. As one of the few midsize sedans with available all-wheel drive, the Fusion is ready for foul-weather driving in Snowbelt states.</p>, <p>The base front-wheel-drive (FWD) 2018 Ford Fusion S gets a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, but skip it and get the SE and its available 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Alternatively, you could upgrade the SE to the 2.0-liter turbo-4-, or get a Titanium or Platinum model where it comes standard; all-wheel drive is available with the 2.0-liter. The Ford Fusion Sport, new last year, also comes with AWD, connected to its 325-horsepower 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6. A 6-speed automatic is standard across the board. The Fusion Hybrid and Hybrid Energi both come with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor; coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission, it provides excellent fuel economy. The Hybrid Energi plug-in has a bigger battery and 21 miles of EV-only range.<br>

But we suggest skipping that for the better-equipped Fusion SE at about $25,000, especially with the 1.5-liter 4-cylinder. If you want a Fusion Titanium you'll need about $31,000; the new V6 Fusion Sport is about $34,500, and the luxurious Fusion Platinum comes in around $37,600. AWD adds about $2,000 where it's available. Hybrids start at about $26,000 for the base S model, spanning up to the $42,000 Hybrid Energi Platinum. The 2018 Fusion's price spread checks out against the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/altima/">Nissan Altima</a> and Chevy Malibu. The KBB.com Fair Purchase Price will tell you what others in your area paid for their 2018 Fusion. Resale value is near the top of the class, close to the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.</p>]

The Fusion SE is your best bet, with a wide range of options available, including blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assistance and adaptive cruise control with collision warning to help expand driver awareness and make the Fusion an excellent road-trip sedan. There's a reverse-sensing system to warn you of obstacles, and an Active Park Assist system will actually parallel-park the car for you. As one of the few midsize sedans with available all-wheel drive, the Fusion is ready for foul-weather driving in Snowbelt states.</p>, <p>The base front-wheel-drive (FWD) 2018 Ford Fusion S gets a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, but skip it and get the SE and its available 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Alternatively, you could upgrade the SE to the 2.0-liter turbo-4-, or get a Titanium or Platinum model where it comes standard; all-wheel drive is available with the 2.0-liter. The Ford Fusion Sport, new last year, also comes with AWD, connected to its 325-horsepower 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6. A 6-speed automatic is standard across the board. The Fusion Hybrid and Hybrid Energi both come with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and electric motor; coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission, it provides excellent fuel economy. The Hybrid Energi plug-in has a bigger battery and 21 miles of EV-only range.<br>

[<p>Available as a coupe or convertible, the 2018 Ford Mustang remains true to the original formula that has made the Mustang so successful for over 50 years: Make it sexy, fast, fun and affordable. Now a sophisticated modern muscle car, the new Mustang delivers power, style and performance at a price almost anybody can afford. Three trim levels are offered: base, the V8-powered GT with the legendary 5.0-liter V8, and the tire-smoking, fire-breathing Shelby GT350 that’s armed with 526 horsepower. All Mustangs are rear-wheel drive, and the standard turbocharged engine packs 310 horsepower, but it’s capable of 30 mpg on the highway. Updates for 2018 include a new look and a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rivals include the Chevy Camaro, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a>.</p>, <p>There isn’t a person on Earth who needs a Mustang. There never has been. For over 50 years the Mustang has been about desire. It’s for people who want to see it and be seen in it. Passionate people who want to feel its power and bathe in its beauty.<b></b></p>, <p>If you’re looking for the most horsepower available, you’re barking up the wrong horse. The Dodge Challenger Hellcat is packing 707 horsepower while the Chevy Camaro ZL1 has 650 horsepower under its bulging hood. Also, the Mustang does not offer all-wheel drive. It is available on the Dodge Challenger.</p>, <p>Improvements for 2018 include a lower, more aggressive grille, a new 10-speed automatic transmission and a retuned suspension. The V6 engine is no longer available, and there’s a new customizable 12-inch digital instrument cluster. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> has also increased the 5.0-liter V8’s output to 460 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque.</p>, <p>Drive a 2018 Mustang with the new 10-speed automatic transmission back-to-back with the older car's 6-speed auto, and the differences couldn't be more stark. With the revised V8's higher redline, the 10-speed keeps the peaky engine singing, with revs dropping ever so slightly, reminding one more of a <a alt_o_t="Motorcycle" href="/motorcycles/">motorcycle</a> than muscle car. The same holds true for the standard EcoBoost 2.3-liter 4-cylinder: Not only does it produce a satisfying growl from underhood, but its 310 horsepower gives it a 0-60 mph time of less than 5 seconds -- performance that rivals many of the V8 engines from the Mustang’s past. That’s quick enough to leave Mr. McQueen and his Highland Green fastback in your dust. The GT is even quicker with its 5.0-liter V8, which now makes 460 horsepower. Ford claims it sprints to 60 mph in less than four seconds. That was exotic supercar speed just a few years ago, and the V8’s rumble and roar are pure Americana. The retuned suspension, especially with MagnaRide adjustable shocks, produce a no-compromises combination of comfortable ride and nimble handling. </p>, <p>SYNC 3<br>
 Premium, GT and Shelby models are equipped with the latest version of Ford’s Sync infotainment system. It’s easier to operate than past systems, has a large 8.0-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and the FordPass app allows you to start, lock and locate your Mustang with your smartphone.<br>
<br>
 5.0-LITER V8 ENGINE<br>
 There’s no denying the power and efficiency of the standard 310-horsepower EcoBoost 4-cylinder. But the Mustang GT’s 460-horsepower 5.0-liter is one of the greatest V8 engines of all time. If you want your Mustang to sound and act like Steve McQueen’s in <i>Bullitt</i>, it’s the only engine to consider.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Coupe or convertible, Ford's modern muscle car seats four passengers but the rear seats are extremely tight -- and in the hard-core Shelby GT350R, nonexistent. Up front, room is decent for driver and passenger. The front seats are comfortable, and the sturdy audio/climate-control switches are easy to reach. Beware the rear blind spots in <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a> created by the raked roof. The Mustang's trunk is bigger than you might expect -- 13.5 cubic feet in coupes, 11.4 in <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a> -- and the rear seats fold flat to accommodate longer items. The Mustang convertible uses a one-hand release latch for the power-operated soft top. We're especially fond of the available digital dash, which reconfigures depending on the drive mode, and offers seemingly infinite customizability.</p>, <p>With its long hood, short trunk, sloping rear glass and tri-bar taillights, the 2018 Ford Mustang could never be mistaken for anything other than Ford's pony car. Yet this is no retro-wannabe. A new lower, more aggressive grille, reshaped LED headlights and LED taillights also make the latest Mustang totally relevant today. There’s a new hood with revamped twin scoops and a dozen new wheel designs. Convertibles look best with the lined and insulated fabric top folded, but even when up it's still unmistakably Mustang. Active grille shutters on EcoBoost models can close to redirect airflow, improving aerodynamics.</p>, <p>The least expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/mustang/">Ford Mustang</a> EcoBoost Fastback comes equipped with a rearview camera, push-button start, Track Apps showing performance metrics like g-forces, selectable-effort steering (Normal/Sport/Comfort), 4-way manual-adjust driver's seat, high-intensity headlights and 17-inch aluminum wheels. Standard audio is an AM/FM/CD system with two USB inputs and Sync Bluetooth connectivity. Safety features include traction and stability control and front, side and knee airbags. The Premium trim adds Sync 3, dual-zone climate control, 18-inch wheels and a rear spoiler. GT Mustangs have the iconic 5.0-liter V8, larger brakes and the line-lock feature for burnouts -- for track use only, wink wink.</p>, <p>From ventilated front seats to a Shaker audio system, there’s a slew of options to suit your taste and budget. At $1,545, the new 10-speed automatic transmission will be popular. Also, check out the $4,000 Performance Package for the GT, which adds sticky Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires, 19-inch wheels, larger Brembo brakes, unique suspension tuning, a larger radiator, a larger rear spoiler, additional instrumentation and chassis reinforcements. It’s also available on the EcoBoost model for $2,500. For $1,700 Ford also offers new MagneRide dampers on either model, which are similar to the units used on the Shelby GT350.</p>, <p>Three engines are now available for the 2018 Mustang, with even the least making over 300 ponies. EcoBoost models have a turbocharged 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine that gets a welcome boost in torque this year. If you gotta have a V8, the GT is your ride. It's ready to roll with a 5.0-liter that gains significant power and torque for 2018. For buyers who plan to track their Mustang or simply desire a real screamer, there are the Shelby GT350 models, which use a 5.2-liter V8 that spits out 526 horsepower in both the standard and GT350R derivative. All Mustangs are rear-wheel drive and come with a 6-speed manual transmission. A new 10-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters is optional on all except the Shelby variants.<b><br>

[<p>Full-size and family-friendly, the 2018 Ford Taurus is the largest and most expensive sedan in Ford’s expansive lineup. Now in its sixth generation, the Taurus is comfortable, quiet and luxurious. It seats five passengers, has a very large trunk and all-wheel drive is available. It’s also packs power with a standard 288-horsepower V6. Four trim levels are available, SE, SEL, Limited and the SHO performance model which gets a 365-horsepower twin-turbocharged V6. The new Taurus competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon/">Toyota Avalon</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/impala/">Chevrolet Impala</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a>, and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/cadenza/">Kia Cadenza</a>, as well as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/lacrosse/">Buick LaCrosse</a>. Although it’s a bit behind much of that competition in overall interior volume, the new Taurus offers families a wide range of trims and features at a starting price below $30,000.</p>, <p>With a starting price below $30,000 the full-size 2018 Ford Taurus offers a comfortable interior, a massive trunk and a large, powerful V6 engine. All-wheel drive is also available for all-weather traction. The new Taurus also offers Ford’s excellent Sync 3 infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> sedan, turn your attention to the Toyota Avalon, which is the only hybrid in the full-size sedan segment. If you’re looking for the most power, the 707-horsepower supercharged Dodge Charger Hellcat gives you nearly twice as much as the turbocharged 2018 Taurus SHO. </p>, <p>For 2018 the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/taurus/">Ford Taurus</a> is no longer available with the turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, which was its most fuel-efficient engine. Power-adjustable pedals are also no longer available on the SEL trim level. There are two new colors offered, Blue Metallic and Burgundy Velvet Metallic.</p>, <p>With its standard 288-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, the 2018 Ford Taurus has plenty of power to get you up that hill or merged onto the Interstate. It’s no sports sedan and it won’t slay a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a> in the curves but getting up to speed is never a concern despite its antiquated 6-speed automatic transmission. The all-wheel-drive 365-horsepower Taurus SHO is quick for the class, sprinting to 60 mph in about 5.2 seconds. It also handles better than the other models with its sport-tuned suspension and 20-inch wheels and tires, but it doesn’t ride quite as smoothly. Although it’s nearly 17-feet long, the full-size Taurus doesn’t feel too big in the city, and it cruises beautifully on the highway, but its thick pillars reduce visibility more than we would like. Overall the Taurus offers full-size comfort and performance in an attractive, quiet and smooth-riding package.</p>, <p>SYNC 3 INFOTAINMENT<br/> Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system is standard on the 2018 Taurus Limited and SHO models. The system includes a large 8-inch touch screen with smartphone-style navigation gestures like pinch to zoom and swipe, plus voice recognition. The system features HD radio as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.<br/> <br/> ECOBOOST V6 ENGINE<br/> Although the Taurus’ standard 288-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 is strong enough for most buyers, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> also offers a 365-horsepower twin-turbocharged EcoBoost 3.5-liter V6. It’s standard in the all-wheel-drive SHO performance model. Zero to 60 takes about 5.2 seconds, which is quicker than a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> 530i.<br/> </p>, <p>Although attractive, the interior of the 2018 Ford Taurus sedan feels a bit dated and it isn’t as roomy as you might expect. While equipped with five seatbelts, the Taurus is definitely more suitable for four adults over long distances, and the sedan’s thick pillars and high beltline can make the interior feel smaller than it really is. Front-seat comfort is high, however, with optional massage to ease back fatigue on long drives, and those seats can be heated and cooled as well. The multifunction steering wheel and voice-command system control many of the audio and navigation controls.</p>, <p>This is big car. The new Ford Taurus nearly equals some full-size <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> when it comes to sheer length, but it looks smaller than it is thanks to taut body lines, an athletic short-deck/long-hood profile and a high beltline. It’s a tough-looking 4-door, especially in SHO trim that adds 20-inch wheels and tires, as well as unique exterior trim and a tasteful rear spoiler. The overall height gives drivers a commanding view of the road, but the sedan’s low roof and wide stance combine with the steeply sloping windshield and rear window to give the Taurus a sleek look.</p>, <p>Even the base Ford Taurus SE sedan for 2018 comes well equipped, including a rearview camera and Ford's Sync integrated music and telephone system. Also standard are 18-inch alloy wheels, 60/40-split folding rear seat, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power driver's seat, steering-wheel controls for audio and cruise control, power windows with one-touch up/down functions for the driver, and Ford's programmable MyKey system. The standard 6-speaker audio system has a CD player and an auxiliary audio input jack. Standard safety features include electronic traction and stability control, dual front airbags, front-seat-mounted side airbags and side-curtain airbags protecting the front and rear passengers.</p>, <p>Ford’s new Taurus offers a number of packages and stand-alone features. For example, Limited sedan models can get a power moonroof. You can get Ford's keyless-entry and push-button ignition system on mid-level SEL <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, as well as the Sync 3 infotainment system with its large 8-inch touch screen. Other packages include luxuries like massaging front seats, a heated steering wheel, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and adaptive cruise control with collision warning. There's also a 12-speaker premium Sony audio system. An available Blind Spot Information System and Cross-Traffic Alert warn of traffic you may not notice without the extra help.</p>, <p>The standard engine on all 2018 Ford Taurus sedans is a 288-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. The top-line Taurus SHO performance model offers 77 more horsepower and 96 additional lb-ft of torque than the standard Taurus V6, thanks to direct-fuel-injection technology and twin turbochargers. With the exception of the SE trim, all Taurus models also feature steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, providing manual control of the automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, while all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on both SEL and Limited trims and standard on the Taurus SHO.<br>

The mid-level SEL is about $30,500, while the Limited model, which adds quite a bit of <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> and features, is a little more than $37,000. If you want AWD on the SEL and Limited it adds about $1,900. Those prices are right in line with full-size-sedan competitors such as the Chevrolet Impala, Kia Cadenza and Dodge Charger. The high-performance Taurus SHO comes in just over $43,000, which is higher than the more lightly equipped V8-powered Dodge Charger R/T. Check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what people are paying for a Taurus in your area. The 2018 Taurus won't hold its value quite as well as the new Chevrolet Impala and Dodge Charger, and trails far behind the Toyota Avalon.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/ford/transit-150-van/2018
[<p>Ford offers the 2018 Transit van as either a versatile and modern cargo van, or a passenger-friendly transport that can comfortably seat up to 15 passengers. The European-derived Transit features a high roof for improved interior accommodations, as well as a number of trims and configurations. Engine choices include a turbocharged V6, 5-cylinder turbodiesel and even a 3.7-liter V6 than can run on compressed natural gas (CNG). Ford knows it faces stiff competition from Ram’s ProMaster and the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, so it equips the Transit with a lengthy options roster designed around customization and flexibility. From its available power running boards to its detailed cargo-bay treatments and numerous upfitter options, the 2018 Transit has almost every base covered.</p>, <p>If you run any type of business that requires a roomy, flexible and technologically advanced van, Ford’s Transit for 2018 needs to be in your fleet. Be it a shuttle service for passengers, or a rolling shop with room to stand and work, there’s a Transit that can get the job done.</p>, <p>The Ram ProMaster and Nissan NV cost less than the Transit, only the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter offers all-wheel drive and only the aging Chevrolet Express can tow 10,000 pounds. A smaller van such as the Nissan NV200 costs less and is easier to maneuver and operate in restricted city streets.</p>, <p>Changes for the 2018 Ford Transit include the addition of a high-mount rearview camera on cargo and passenger vans. New options included expanded Bluetooth availability, a dual rear-wheel forged-alloy wheel package and leather seating. Cargo vans gain rear cargo-door exit handles and a cargo LED light switch.</p>, <p>Driving the 2018 Ford Transit van is easier than its massive appearance might suggest. Despite its tall roof and long, downward sloping windshield, most configurations occupy the same footprint as a full-size F-150 pickup. You’ll need to remember that a tall roof is overhead when negotiating tree-lined routes where low-hanging branches might pose a problem. The same goes for low-entrance parking garages and drive-thrus. Driving the Transit is a pleasant experience far removed from the old work vans that rode rough and offered zero driver feedback. The Transit’s steering is accurate and easy to work, the suspension is taut without being harsh, and we were amazed at the lack of rattles and squeaks in our test vehicle. Those most concerned with fuel economy will want the 5-cylinder turbodiesel, but if power is your most pressing need, a Transit equipped with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 is the best option (and the most fun to drive).</p>, <p>FORD TELEMATICS<br>
 As a fleet manager, it’s your job to monitor your employees’ driving habits, know when a vehicle is due for service and monitor fuel usage. Thanks to advanced Ford Telematics, most of these jobs are done for you, making quick work of what used to be a time-consuming chore.<br>
<br>
 3.5-LITER V6 ECOBOOST ENGINE<br>
 Anyone driving a fully loaded van in fast-moving traffic knows the importance of having power to pass and merge. With the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 under the hood, the Transit has no issues getting up to speed and its fuel economy is surprisingly good.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Despite its work status, the Ford Transit is not a penalty box for the driver. There's an amazing amount of storage space; you can have a couple of Big Gulps and water bottles, your phone, your laptop, your tablet, and tons of other stuff stowed in various nooks and crannies in the dash and doors. The comfortable and supportive seats are good for long and short hauls, and can be covered in cloth or leather. Ford’s Sync 3 audio upgrade is available, as is navigation. The steering wheel tilts and telescopes, giving the driver added flexibility in finding the right position.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Transit's aggressively utilitarian form is defined by function. The three roof heights range from 83.6 inches to 110.1 inches, and the six body lengths from 217.8 inches to 263.9 inches. Whether it's a panel van painted with your company's logo or a multi-passenger airport shuttle, the Transit gets 16-inch steel wheels with color-keyed hubcaps, and a black surround on the Aston Martin-inspired grille; wagons get tinted side glass. The Wagon XLT comes standard with an Exterior Upgrade Package that adds full wheel covers, a chrome grille and grille surround, and headlight trim. Available retracting running boards make entry and exit easier.</p>, <p>The most basic Transit work truck features a 4-speaker AM/FM stereo, 16-inch wheels and hubcaps, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and power windows and locks. You also get industrial-black front and rear bumpers with front lower valance and a rear step, and short-arm, dual power-side mirrors. Wagon models get tinted side windows. Step up to the Wagon XL passenger van and you get 6-speaker audio and rain-sensing windshield wipers, while the top-line Wagon XLT gets a chrome grille surround, automatic headlights and an upgraded 8-speaker sound system.</p>, <p>We'll sidestep the thousands of different ways the Ford Transit can be upfitted for custom work duty. Instead, Ford will sell you a 10-way-power driver's seat, an engine-block heater and rear parking-aid sensors (get these) for your 2018 Transit. Other options include extendable heated mirrors, Ford Telematics, dual sliding-side doors, cruise control, keyless entry, and Sync 3 with a 6-inch touch screen and navigation. There's also lane-keeping assist plus other safety upgrades available. A CNG/LPG (liquid petroleum gas) engine-prep package is available for models equipped with the 3.7-liter V6 engine.</p>, <p>There are three engine choices available for the Ford Transit. Standard issue is a 3.7-liter V6 putting out 275 horsepower, and which can be configured to run on compressed natural gas. Power-hungry customers can opt for the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6, a twin-turbocharged engine that produces 310 horsepower. Then there's the 3.2-liter 5-cylinder Power Stroke turbodiesel, aimed at those who need low-end torque and good fuel economy, although the EPA does not rate the diesel. All engines drive the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.<br>

[<p>Ford offers the 2018 Transit van as either a versatile and modern cargo van, or a passenger-friendly transport that can comfortably seat up to 15 passengers. The European-derived Transit features a high roof for improved interior accommodations, as well as a number of trims and configurations. Engine choices include a turbocharged V6, 5-cylinder turbodiesel and even a 3.7-liter V6 than can run on compressed natural gas (CNG). Ford knows it faces stiff competition from Ram’s ProMaster and the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, so it equips the Transit with a lengthy options roster designed around customization and flexibility. From its available power running boards to its detailed cargo-bay treatments and numerous upfitter options, the 2018 Transit has almost every base covered.</p>, <p>If you run any type of business that requires a roomy, flexible and technologically advanced van, Ford’s Transit for 2018 needs to be in your fleet. Be it a shuttle service for passengers, or a rolling shop with room to stand and work, there’s a Transit that can get the job done.</p>, <p>The Ram ProMaster and Nissan NV cost less than the Transit, only the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter offers all-wheel drive and only the aging Chevrolet Express can tow 10,000 pounds.

The same goes for low-entrance parking garages and drive-thrus. Driving the Transit is a pleasant experience far removed from the old work vans that rode rough and offered zero driver feedback. The Transit’s steering is accurate and easy to work, the suspension is taut without being harsh, and we were amazed at the lack of rattles and squeaks in our test vehicle.

 3.5-LITER V6 ECOBOOST ENGINE<br>

Whether it's a panel van painted with your company's logo or a multi-passenger airport shuttle, the Transit gets 16-inch steel wheels with color-keyed hubcaps, and a black surround on the Aston Martin-inspired grille; wagons get tinted side glass. The Wagon XLT comes standard with an Exterior Upgrade Package that adds full wheel covers, a chrome grille and grille surround, and headlight trim. Available retracting running boards make entry and exit easier.</p>, <p>The most basic Transit work truck features a 4-speaker AM/FM stereo, 16-inch wheels and hubcaps, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and power windows and locks.

[<p>The 2018 Ford Transit Connect is a mini <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a>. A very capable mini minivan. Available as a cargo van or a comfortable people-mover, the Transit Connect is smaller and less expensive than minivans like the Honda Odyssey and full-size commercial vans like the Ford Transit and Nissan NV, plus the Ford is more maneuverable and it gets better fuel economy. It’s also plenty capable with up to 149 cubic feet of cargo space or seating for seven. Unlike the Ram ProMaster City and Nissan NV200, the 2018 Ford Transit Connect is available in two sizes, and the long-wheelbase model can still fit in the average residential garage. The Cargo Van is available in two trim levels, XL and XLT, while the Passenger Wagon gets three, XL, XLT and Titanium. They’re all front-wheel drive and powered by a 169-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>If you want a small vehicle that can hold seven people or one that is specifically designed for business or commercial purposes, you’ll like the 2018 Ford Transit Connect Ford. Because of its maneuverability, fuel efficiency and affordability, not to mention it garageability, it’s an excellent alternative to a big bulky van.</p>, <p>For some business owners and families, the 2018 Ford Transit Connect may be too small, even the long-wheelbase model and its 169 horsepower may just not be enough. The Mercedes-Benz Metris offers more power as well as higher towing and payload capacity, and the larger Ford Transit is about twice the size.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Ford Transit Connect gets available Premium Packages on XLT and the Titanium Passenger Wagon. Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system with a 6.5-inch touch screen and rearview camera are now available on the XLT Cargo Van and Passenger Wagon while those models get standard automatic headlights with configurable daytime-running lights.</p>, <p>Two compelling reasons to buy a small van are for easier maneuverability and higher fuel economy, and the 2018 Ford Transit Connect delivers both. If your commercial fleet is transitioning out of or complementing its older, full-size cargo vans with the Transit Connect, this compact Ford will feel far easier to drive. With its unibody chassis and front-wheel-drive configuration, the Transit Connect is more akin to a higher-riding sedan than a traditional body-on-frame cargo van. We also like this Ford's tight turning radius -- especially helpful in city settings. The naturally aspirated 2.5-liter engine is adequate for its duties and pairs well with the 6-speed automatic transmission, although some rivals like the Mercedes Metris offer more horsepower and payload. As a family vehicle, it brings similar nimble traits but doesn't feel as substantial as larger passenger vans like the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna and Chrysler Pacifica, which also offer more family-friendly features and significantly more power.</p>, <p>FORD TELEMATICS<br>

SYNC 3<br>
Ford consistently improves its Sync infotainment system and the 2018 Transit Connect offers the latest and greatest version, which is also now one of the easiest to use on the market. The system’s 6.5-inch touch screen even allows for phone-style navigation gestures like pinch and swipe and offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With a dashboard and door panels similar to Ford’s Escape SUV, the interior of the new 2018 Transit Connect is more carlike than you might expect. Cargo vans have two seats up front, with 128.6 cubic feet of rear storage for long-wheelbase (LWB) models and 103.9 for short-wheelbase (SWB) versions. With rear seats that can fold, flip or be removed, even a passenger version can swallow a lot of gear. SWB wagon versions of the 2018 Transit Connect seat five passengers across two rows, while LWB models hold seven across three rows. Second-row captain's chairs are standard in the top-line Titanium Wagon and optional on the XLT but reduce passenger count to six.</p>, <p>Now in its second generation, the 2018 Ford Transit Connect has gained a little style over the years. Sure, it’s still boxy and slab-sided, but the front end is similar to many Ford passenger cars with a Ford Fusion-esque grille and headlights that look lifted from a Ford Fiesta subcompact. The new Transit Connect is one of the few small vans offering the choice of a traditional liftgate or split cargo doors that open up to 180 degrees. A short-wheelbase Transit Connect is 173.9 inches in length, while a long-wheelbase model is over a foot longer at 189.7 inches.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Transit Connect is available in XL, XLT and -- in Passenger Wagon form -- Titanium trims. The least expensive Transit Connect, an XL cargo model, has just the basics like vinyl seats, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with audio input jack, 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat, tilt/telescoping steering wheel and rear cargo lights. Base XL passenger versions also come with cruise control and rear-window defroster. You'll have to pay extra or step up to the more recommendable XLT version to get better amenities like cloth seats and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>Helpful features on the 2018 Ford Transit Connect include front and rear parking sensors, rearview camera and choice of swing-out rear doors. Ford's Sync infotainment systems with Bluetooth wireless connectivity are now easier to recommend, especially the new Sync 3 system that offers a 6.5-inch touch screen, navigation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. A top-line Titanium Transit Connect passenger wagon includes leather seating (heated up front), dual-zone climate control and auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Titanium model can also be had with blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and panoramic glass roof. Cargo models can be configured to accommodate a variety of commercial and delivery needs.</p>, <p>The Transit Connect is a rare Ford model that does not offer a turbocharged EcoBoost engine. For 2018, all Ford Transit Connects use a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder with 169 horsepower. The engine is connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and all Transit Connects are front-wheel drive. The 2.5-liter can be specified for compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, aka propane). The Transit Connect is rated to tow up to 2,000 pounds, but that figure can't match the 5,000-pound tow rating of the more powerful Mercedes-Benz Metris van. Nor can the Ford’s commercial payload capacity of 1,620 pounds match the Metris figures of 2,502 pounds (cargo) or 1,874 pounds (passenger model).<br>

Passenger Wagon models begin around $27,000 for both 5- or 7-passenger models, which is several thousand below larger mainstream minivans like the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey. A loaded, 7-passenger Ford Transit Connect Titanium wagon can reach the low-$30,000 range. At its starting price, the Transit Connect begins above the Nissan NV200 cargo van and is in line with the Ram ProMaster City. The larger Mercedes-Benz Metris Worker base model is fetching with 208 horsepower and a starting price just under $27,000. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Transit Connect.

Cargo models can be configured to accommodate a variety of commercial and delivery needs.</p>, <p>The Transit Connect is a rare Ford model that does not offer a turbocharged EcoBoost engine. For 2018, all Ford Transit Connects use a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder with 169 horsepower. The engine is connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and all Transit Connects are front-wheel drive. The 2.5-liter can be specified for compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, aka propane). The Transit Connect is rated to tow up to 2,000 pounds, but that figure can't match the 5,000-pound tow rating of the more powerful Mercedes-Benz Metris van. Nor can the Ford’s commercial payload capacity of 1,620 pounds match the Metris figures of 2,502 pounds (cargo) or 1,874 pounds (passenger model).<br>

 171 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (cargo van), 19/27 mpg (passenger wagon)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Ford Transit Connect has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $24,000, including the $1,120 destination charge, for a short-wheelbase cargo van. Passenger Wagon models begin around $27,000 for both 5- or 7-passenger models, which is several thousand below larger mainstream minivans like the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey. A loaded, 7-passenger Ford Transit Connect Titanium wagon can reach the low-$30,000 range. At its starting price, the Transit Connect begins above the Nissan NV200 cargo van and is in line with the Ram ProMaster City. The larger Mercedes-Benz Metris Worker base model is fetching with 208 horsepower and a starting price just under $27,000. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Transit Connect. In the years ahead, the Transit Connect's resale value is expected to hold up fairly well.</p>]

[<p>Once known as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/genesis/">Hyundai Genesis</a>, the 2018 Genesis G80 luxury sedan is now the anchor vehicle for Hyundai’s new luxury division. As a luxury sedan, the G80 checks all the right boxes. The styling is solid, if not a bit Audi-esque, the interior is loaded with features, and the engine choices challenge the best designs from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>. While the driving characteristics are not yet up to the standards set by these competitors, neither is the price tag. Along with its newly available twin-turbocharged V6 and optional all-wheel drive, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/genesis/g80/">Genesis G80</a> luxury performance sedan for 2018 offers one of the longest standard warranties of any luxury brand.</p>, <p>If you’re more impressed by bang for the buck than the logo on your key fob, the 2018 Genesis G80 may seem like the perfect luxury sedan. Powerful, handsome and loaded with safety and comfort features, it undercuts pricier traditional luxury cars by thousands of dollars.</p>, <p>The 2018 Genesis G80 luxury sedan lacks the long-established bloodline of cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a>, making it a tough sell as a status symbol. Enthusiasts will likely find the ride and handling a bit too soft.</p>, <p>For 2018, a new Sport trim joins the G80 lineup and features a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, sport-tuned 8-speed transmission and an adaptive sport suspension. All G80s receive revised styling inside and out and a new analog fuel gauge. New standard safety features include Pedestrian Detection and Driver Attention Alert.</p>, <p>Unlike some manufacturers who jump head first into a new niche, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> has been steadily building its reputation as a quality builder of cars and <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>. So when it first challenged more established luxury brands with its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/genesis/">Genesis</a> sedan, critics were roundly proved wrong when buyers took to the car like flies to honey. The logical next step was the creation of its own luxury division, which has spawned the 2018 Genesis G80 luxury sedan. With a ride more Lexus GS than BMW 5 Series, the G80 appeals to those who seek comfort, power and all the latest bells and whistles in a vehicle that is also safe, attractive and reasonably priced. From the base V6 and potent V8 versions, to the new twin-turbocharged Sport, the Genesis G80 sedan for 2018 provides everything you’ll find in an <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> or Lexus GS at a price neither of them can match.</p>, <p>ACTIVE SAFETY FEATURES<br>
Ever-increasing distractions while driving necessitate more driver assists to help keep us safe. Reassuringly, every 2018 Genesis G80 luxury sedan includes as standard automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist and even a system to help keep the driver from dozing off at the wheel.<br>
<br>
IN-CABIN CO2 SENSOR<br>
The dangers of CO2 build-up inside the cabin are well known. Colorless and odorless, CO2 can quickly cause drowsiness and confusion. The Genesis G80 remedies this concern with the industry’s first built-in CO2 detector that floods the cabin with fresh air when CO2 levels become elevated.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Genesis G80 for 2018 includes a leather-lined, 5-passenger interior among the roomiest in its class, making it a pleasurable place for all occupants. In addition to its sheer space, we appreciate the Genesis' layout. Though it offers all the trappings of a luxury car -- climate-controlled seats, power-rear window shade, and center-mounted touch-screen display that is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphones -- controls are remarkably easy to use. The G80 also offers buttons and knobs that are a snap to use. The front seats rate high in overall comfort, and the driving position offers a good view out.</p>, <p>As with its interior, the 2018 Genesis G80's body lines are clean and elegant. Up front, the G80 gets a new, more imposing front-end treatment. From there, this luxury sedan has long, attractive lines that convey a sense of quality and refinement. The trunk line finishes in an aerodynamic sloping design reminiscent of an <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a7/">Audi A7</a> fastback. Genesis G80 models with the 5.0-liter V8 can be distinguished from the rear via their quad exhaust outlets. And, of course, all models wear the new Genesis winged badge on the rear of the automatically opening trunk.</p>, <p>The 2018 Genesis G80 sedan comes in three main trims: Standard, Premium and Ultimate. In base Standard form, it certainly isn't lacking for features. You'll get all the active safety and driving features described in "Favorite Things," plus leather interior, power-operated and heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers, HomeLink garage-door opener, rearview camera and auto-dimming rearview mirror. Infotainment includes a navigation system with 8-inch touch-screen display and 7-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio with Bluetooth connectivity and USB and auxiliary ports. All Genesis G80s include a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance, valet and concierge services, and roadside assistance.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the Premium variant adds an excellent 14-speaker Lexicon audio system, panoramic sunroof, 7-inch color instrument cluster, wireless charging pad, ventilated front seats, power rear sunshade, and front and rear parking sensors. All-wheel drive (AWD) can be had in lieu of the standard rear-wheel drive (RWD) on all versions of the G80, and that option also adds heated rear seats/steering wheel/headlight washers. The Ultimate package features higher-grade leather, a 17-speaker Lexicon system, wood and aluminum interior trim, 9.2-inch touch-screen display, power-operated trunk, and head-up display. To get a V8 G80, you'll have to opt for the Ultimate package.</p>, <p>Three engine choices are available in the Genesis G80 for 2018: a standard V6, twin-turbo V6 and a potent V8. All use direct-injection technology with a strong focus on drivability, low-end torque and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. Off-the-line response is impressive with all three engines, and fuel economy is decent, more so with the smaller V6s. A smooth and refined 8-speed automatic transmission backs all three engines, with a unique sport-tuned version fitted to the turbocharged Sport trim. As is fitting a luxury sedan, the G80 is rear-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive offered as an option.<br>
<br>
 3.8-liter V6<br>
 311 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 293 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/27 mpg (RWD), 18/25 mpg (AWD)<br>
<br>
 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (Sport)<br>
 365 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 376 lb-ft of torque at 1,300-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/25 mpg (RWD), 17/24 mpg (AWD)<br>

<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Genesis G80 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $43,000. The Sport trim starts just under $56,300, while the V8 Ultimate trim begins right around $58,000. HTRAC AWD is optional on all three models and adds another $2,500 to the bottom line. The G80's starting price is thousands less than those of the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6, Lexus GS, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/cts/">Cadillac CTS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a>. Even the base G80 has a V6 vs. the turbo-4s of some rivals. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price before buying. Under the relatively new brand, the G80's resale value is still something of a question mark, but early returns show it holding its value better than the Audi A6, but still far behind the Lexus GS.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/genesis/g90/2018
[<p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/genesis/">Genesis</a> is the new luxury division from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a>, and the full-size 2018 Genesis G90 sedan is its flagship. Despite the dominance of SUVs in the marketplace these days, there's still something to be said for a full-size luxury sedan, and the one Genesis has built is exceedingly comfortable, quiet, luxurious and surprisingly agile. Does it beat the newest <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/7%20series/">BMW 7 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/s-class/">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a>, or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/ls/">Lexus LS</a> at their own game? Well, no. But it's a solid bet against older sedans like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q70/">Infiniti Q70</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a8/">Audi A8</a>, with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/genesis/g90/">Genesis G90</a> making a good case for itself, especially when price is a factor. It will take a while for the Genesis brand to match the prestige of its more established competitors, but if it keeps making cars as fundamentally good as the G90, it's on the right track.</p>, <p>If you're living champagne dreams on a beer budget, the 2018 Genesis G90 is just what you're looking for. That's not a backhanded compliment, either, as the G90 offers all of the premium features you could hope for, just without a budget-busting price tag.</p>, <p>We all know that there's more to luxury than just "more stuff," and while the G90 offers up lots of stuff, Genesis isn't yet the kind of aspirational badge that can rival Lexus, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> and Mercedes-Benz.</p>, <p>Both the Genesis brand and the G90 were all-new last year, so changes are kept to a minimum this year. Dynamic LED headlights are standard, the V8-powered Ultimate gets a rear-seat entertainment system, and every model gets a CD/DVD player.</p>, <p>If your luxury sedan must be big, comfortable and quiet, the 2018 Genesis G90 is unquestionably on target. In traffic, in its most luxurious ride setting, the G90 stays smooth and quiet, with the cushy ride stopping just short of being too soft. You could drive the G90 for hours on end and still arrive relaxed and refreshed. But there's a Sport mode, and if you turn it on, the suspension stiffens and suddenly the G90's demeanor changes. There's just enough bite to the suspension that you'll think, "Hey, what if I cook it through that onramp?" And the G90 responds pleasantly, with suspension motions well controlled, steering that's nicely communicative, and eye-opening grip. All while you're ensconced in an organically luxurious interior filled with all the right textures, appearances and even smells.</p>, <p>STANDARD SAFETY SUITE<br>
 Active-safety systems are nothing new, but even on the luxury end of the spectrum things like lane-keeping assist, driver-attention monitor, active cruise control with full stop and start, emergency braking with pedestrian detection, and a head-up display are options. Not so the Genesis G90, where they’re all standard.<br>
<br>
 REAR SEAT<br>
 The V8-powered G90 5.0 Ultimate is more than just an engine upgrade. There's also a significant enhancement to the rear seat, including independently adjustable outboard positions with seat memory, to keep your rear-seat passenger's favorite spot just the way he or she likes it.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Genesis G90 interior is a master class in how a luxury-car interior should look. The materials used, how they're assembled, and how they look are exactly right. There's soft and supple Nappa leather on the seats, echoed on the soft-touch door panels, dash, center console, and just about everything else. The wood trim is from real trees, the stainless-steel speaker grilles look expensive, and it all combines with the metallic-look switchgear for a high-class appearance, evocative of Mercedes-Benz. The same goes for the knob-based infotainment interface. Our only complaint: We've seen the same basic layout, info display and ergonomics in too many down-market Hyundai models.</p>, <p>The Genesis G90 is a conservatively handsome car. There's a distinctive grille, and it's big, but comes just short of the mega-grille trend on luxury cars that we've seen in recent years. There's a subtle nod to power on the hood, with a bulge that extends the width and then continues down the side of the car as a strong character line, eventually blending with the taillights. A chrome strip accentuates the length of the doors, and wraps around the back of the car, dividing the bumper. It's not a head-turner, but Genesis is still developing its design language, and the G90 looks expensive, and the style will likely wear well over time.</p>, <p>The so-called "base-model” 2018 Genesis G90 is loaded from the factory. The G90 3.3T Premium comes with a 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 powering the rear wheels. It also includes the safety suite, adding automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, active cruise control, and even a driver-attention alert. Premium Nappa leather covers the seating surfaces, there's a full-color head-up display, and a multi-view camera that includes around-view. The 22-way-adjustable driver's seat is complemented by a 16-way passenger seat. The 17-speaker Lexicon audio system is part of the 12.3-inch infotainment system. There are even power sunshades for the rear <i>and</i> rear side windows. Like we said. Loaded.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is the only stand-alone option for the 2018 Genesis G90, and it is available on both V6 and V8 models. That said, upgrade to the V8-powered Genesis G90 5.0 Ultimate and you get a few other niceties as well. The G90 Ultimate adds power-adjustable rear-outboard seating positions, including an integrated memory system to save your settings. The rear seats also get a power head restraint, and rear-seat illuminated vanity mirrors. It's a first-class seating accommodation by any measure. This year, there's also a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>, <p>Neither engine for the Genesis G90 is a slouch. The 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 in the Premium model puts out 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. If that's somehow not enough, the Ultimate comes with a 5.0-liter V8 with 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. That's a significant horsepower advantage, but only 7 lb-ft of torque better than the V6. Both engines connect to an 8-speed automatic transmission, with either rear- or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). Both Genesis models require premium fuel, and neither is shy about drinking it down, with its EPA-estimated 24-mpg highway rating lagging other full-size luxury sedans like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ct6/">Cadillac CT6</a>, BMW 740i and Mercedes-Benz S550.<br/> <br/> 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6<br/> 365 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 376 lb-ft of torque @ 1,300-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/24 mpg<br/> <b><br/> </b>5.0-liter V8<br/> 420 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 383 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/24 mpg (RWD), 15/23 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p>The 2018 Genesis G90 3.3T Premium has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just below the $70,000 mark, when you include the $975 destination charge. If you want V8 power, the G90 5.0 Ultimate starts at just below $72,000, and that's a bargain considering the noteworthy rear-seat upgrades. If you want all-wheel drive, you'll add $2,500 to the price of either car. That's not cheap, but start comparing it to other full-size luxury sedans and suddenly it's a bargain. The twin-turbo V6 Lexus LS 500 starts at about $75,000, and all the European competitors start at more than $80,000. The KBB.com Fair Purchase Price tells you what others in your area paid for their Genesis G90, and resale value should be about average for the class, but trailing the Lexus.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/gmc/acadia/2018
[<p>Although not as large or roomy as the first generation, the 2018 GMC Acadia crossover SUV is a better fit in today’s world, with a smaller body that is easier to maneuver and interior accommodations displaying a premium look and feel. The 2018 Acadia wears the same bold GMC styling seen on the Yukon and Canyon pickups, but with a lower, more urban appearance. Unlike its truck-ish siblings, however, the Acadia has a softer side with a taut suspension for better handling and a number of technological must-haves, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Buyers can choose between 4- or 6-cylinder engines, front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), an off-road All-Terrain trim and 5-, 6- or 7-passenger seating.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a midsize-crossover SUV with distinctive good looks, a choice of engines and seating configurations plus the latest in driver-assist and infotainment technology, the 2018 GMC Acadia is a perfect fit.</p>, <p>If your next 7-passenger SUV needs a hybrid powertrain or the ability to tow more than 4,000 pounds, the Toyota Highlander Hybrid or Ford Explorer offers what the Acadia cannot. Those needing maximum cargo space and 8-passenger seating might be better off in a full-size GMC Yukon.</p>, <p>GMC’s Acadia crossover SUV for 2018 gets some new features, such as an available automatic heated steering wheel, new 20-inch wheels and Tire Fill Alert. The 3.6-liter V6 is now available on the SLE-1 AWD trim, while the All-Terrain now offers 5-, 6- or 7-passenger seating.</p>, <p>GMC’s 2018 Acadia SUV may not be the largest midsize-crossover sport/utility on the market, but its trim proportions and lighter weight make it one of the segment’s more enjoyable SUVs to drive. A small turning radius allows better maneuverability in tight parking lots, while the Acadia’s rigid platform and Cadillac CT6-derived suspension give the Acadia a leg up over the Honda Pilot and Nissan Pathfinder. Denali models offer GM’s Continuously Variable Ride Control, which further improves the Acadia’s handling on twisting roads and its ride comfort when traversing long stretches of open highway. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is fuel-efficient, but not very powerful. Those who regularly carry a full crew or seek the all-wheel-drive system’s full potential are better off with the 3.6-liter V6, which offers more horsepower and torque with a minimal impact on fuel economy.</p>, <p>DRIVE MODE SELECTOR<br>
 Allowing the driver more say in how the engine and suspension behave, the 2018 GMC Acadia’s Drive Mode Selector includes a dedicated Trailer/Tow mode. The All-Terrain trim replaces the off-road mode with a more aggressive setting, while AWD models save fuel with a 2x4 mode that disconnects the rear-drive when not needed.<br>
<br>
 ALL-TERRAIN MODEL<br>
 Think of it as an Outback that can carry more people. The 2018 GMC Acadia All-Terrain features an Active Clutch all-wheel-drive setup for improved traction both on- and off-road. All-Terrain trims include Hill Descent Control to help keep descent speeds from getting out of control</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Although its absolute scale isn’t as large as the first-generation SUV, the 2018 Acadia’s cabin boasts an even more upscale character helped by a modern design that includes soft-touch surfaces, upgraded trim and active noise cancellation. Despite a wheelbase that now matches the compact 5-passenger GMC Terrain, the Acadia’s architecture still allows for three adult-accommodating rows of seats. The second tier -- 60-40 bench or captain’s chairs -- features an upgraded Smart Slide system for easier access to the 50/50 third row, and both fold flat to expand the 12.8 cubic feet of base cargo space to a quite usable 79.0-cubic-foot maximum.</p>, <p>The recent 2018 GMC Acadia remake introduces a more sophisticated but still substantial look that’s skewed more towards contemporary crossover SUV than conventional SUV. Subtle evolutions of established GMC design cues carry over in its grille, fascia treatments, fender arches and other details, but the Acadia’s bodywork now features rounder and more aerodynamic contours and the windshield has an even steeper rake. The primo Denali amps up its curb appeal with distinctive lighting treatments, shiny 20-inch alloy wheels and an extra dose of brightwork, while the new All-Terrain signifies its adventurous character with black chrome accenting and dark-tint 18-inch or 20-inch rims.</p>, <p>Even the base Acadia SL comes with tri-zone auto climate control, numerous power assists, a 7.0-inch Color Touch Screen, Keyless Open and Start, 5-year OnStar Basic Plan, support for Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, five USB ports and the industry’s first rear-seat reminder safety-alert system to prevent kids or other valuables from being left behind. Moving up through the SLE/SLT ranks introduces everything from a power liftgate, 8.0-inch touch screen with IntelliLink and SiriusXM Satellite Radio to leather upholstery, Bose audio and Navigation. The Denali and All-Terrain add distinctive cosmetic/convenience touches plus a full range of new driver assists.</p>, <p>The Acadia’s extras roster relates to its trim grade, with no AWD available on the entry-level SL. But the SLE-1 can be had with that, a V6 and a rear-seat entertainment system while the SLE-2 offers Bose sound, upgraded infotainment and the Dual SkyScape 2-panel panoramic sunroof. It offers a new Driver Alert Package I that brings Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert and Rear Park Assist, all of which are found in the Denali’s more comprehensive -- and standard -- Driver Alert Package II that adds Pedestrian Detection and Forward Collision Alert with Low-Speed Automatic Braking.</p>, <p>Two naturally aspirated engines are offered, both backed by a smooth-shifting 6-speed automatic. Sole motivator in the base FWD-only SL and standard in the SLE-1/SLE-2/SLT-1 models, the new 2.5-liter 4-cylinder makes 194 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. The first GMC engine to feature Start/Stop technology, it earns GM-estimated 21/26-mpg EPA City/Highway marks in FWD Acadia models and 21/25 in AWD variants. The 3.6-liter V6, optional on SLE and SLT-1 and standard on SLT-2 and Denali, makes a considerably stouter 310 horses and 271 lb-ft of torque but features Active Fuel Management that turns it into a V4 under light loads. It nets GM-estimated 18/25 mpg EPA numbers in both FWD and AWD while raising the Acadia’s max tow rating from 1,000 to a still-modest 4,000 pounds.<br>
<br>
 2.5-liter inline-4 <br>
 194 horsepower @ 6,300 rpm<br>
 190 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/26 mpg (FWD), 21/25 mpg (AWD)<br>
<br>
 3.6-liter V6 <br>
 310 horsepower @ 6,600 rpm<br>
 271 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (FWD), 17/25 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Part of the 2018 Acadia’s downsizing involved a commensurate trimming of its overall pricing. That leaves a base Acadia SL opening at $30,000. This Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) undercuts starting figures for 2018 versions of the Explorer, Pilot and Highlander. SLE Acadias commence closer to $33,500 and SLTs start nearer $39,500. An AWD upgrade adds about $2,000. Topping the range, the Acadia Denali starts at just under $46,000 (FWD) or $48,000 (AWD) with a loaded AWD topping out near $52,000. Kelley Blue Book has determined the 2018 GMC Acadia will hold strong 5-year residual values, better than the Ford Explorer but a few percentage points behind the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.

[<p>Comfortable, capable and fuel-efficient, the ruggedly handsome 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a> Canyon is a standout in the resurgent midsize-pickup-truck segment. The new Canyon is available with a choice of 5- or 6-foot beds and Extended or Crew Cab configurations. Prices start around $22,000 with a 200-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder. A 2.8-liter turbodiesel and a strong 3.6-liter V6 making 308 horsepower are also offered as is 4-wheel drive with low range. The diesel is unique in the sparsely populated class, which includes the popular <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> Tacoma, the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> Frontier and the similar Chevy Colorado. There are also six trim levels to choose from: SL, Canyon, SLE, the off-road-ready All Terrain, SLT and the top-of-the-line Denali, which doubles down on the chrome trim.</p>, <p>If you just don’t need the size, thirst and expense of a full-size <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/pickup/">pickup</a> you’ll like the 2018 GMC Canyon. The new Canyon offers the power, features and the majority of a full-size truck’s capability but it’s more fuel-efficient and a heck of a lot easier to park.</p>, <p>The GMC Canyon All Terrain is quite capable off-road, but if you’re looking to tackle the deserts of Baja the Chevy Colorado ZR2 and Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro offer far more extreme off-road-ready suspensions, differentials and other hardware. Toyota’s Tacoma also delivers class-leading resale values.</p>, <p>For 2018 the GMC Canyon is essentially unchanged. GMC has spruced up the interior of the All Terrain model with available Jet Black leather front seats with Cobalt Red stitching. Also, a washer-fluid-level sensor is now standard on all models.</p>, <p>From the driver’s seat, visibility is excellent, with tall comfortable seating and big windows all around. The Canyon provides an exceptionally civilized ride, with handling that far exceeds what one might expect of a high-riding pickup truck. The steering is direct and responsive, and the suspension is able to absorb most road imperfections while still remaining stiff enough to deal with off-road adventures. The base model’s reliable 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is adequate, but the 308-horsepower V6 is much better, and the torque-happy, high-mileage 2.8-liter diesel is desirable but it’s an expensive option. With the V6 and the 8-speed automatic transmission this is a fast truck with plenty of passing and hauling power. It’s also tow-rated up to 7,700 pounds, a feat made easier by such features as trailer-brake control. The 4-wheel-drive system has a low range for proper off-roading, and an automatically locking rear differential, which works exceedingly well.</p>, <p>FIRST-IN-SEGMENT SAFETY<br>
Rare in this segment, GMC offers forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning. Standard is GM’s clever Teen Driver system, which sends you updates and alerts about your teen’s driving habits. It also allows you to set a speed alert and a max volume limit on the truck’s audio system.<br>

</br></b>DURAMAX TURBODIESEL ENGINE<br>
A first in the midsize-pickup segment, the 2018 GMC Canyon’s Duramax turbodiesel makes a modest 181 horsepower but a stump-pulling 369 lb-ft of torque. With all that torque, a Duramax-equipped Canyon can tow up to 7,700 pounds and is rated at 30-mpg highway and 22 mpg in the city.<br>
</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 GMC Canyon’s interior is a fine blend of modern style with truck practicality. The wide seats are big-body friendly and most of the functions are in a big center stack, with large knobs that should be easily operated by gloved hands. There’s ample center-console storage, and the Crew Cab handles four adults comfortably and five in a pinch. Upholstery materials include vinyl, cloth and leather, and the available infotainment upgrade with the larger 8-inch touch screen is worth the additional cost. The system is simple to operate, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible and it offers onboard Wi-Fi.</p>, <p>GMC calls the Canyon the only premium-midsize pickup. Marking mumbo jumbo maybe, but the Canyon certainly looks the part. Up front is a large, squared-off, big-rig-style grille that looks just right and makes an unmistakable linkage to the full-size GMC Sierra <a alt_o_t="Trucks" href="/pickup-truck/">trucks</a>. LED running lights and projector-beam headlights give a look of class and its largely flared fenders add purpose and muscle tone. Each end of the rear bumper includes what GMC calls the CornerStep, providing an easy way to step up and reach into the cargo bed. The SLT and Denali models get chrome door handles and mirrors.</p>, <p>Even the base 2018 GMC Canyon is surprisingly well-equipped, with standard features including a 4.2-inch screen, 6-speaker audio, power windows and door locks, power driver seat and rearview camera, plus the CornerStep rear bumper, cargo-box lighting and a locking tailgate. The SLE trim level adds an 8-inch touch screen for the infotainment system, cruise control, rear defogger, remote keyless entry, steering-wheel audio controls, fog lights, 17-inch tires and wheels and additional trim and convenience items. The SLT and Denali add even more, including automatic climate control, remote start, heated front seats (ventilated on Denali), rear sliding window and 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>The GMC Canyon’s options list is a long one. In addition to the various upgrades associated with the trim levels, GMC’s Canyon midsize pickup for 2018 is available with numerous packages, among them a Convenience Package, SLE Convenience Package, All Terrain Package (on SLE only) and one we strongly recommend for its safety benefits, the Driver Alert Package. The Autotrac automatic 4-wheel drive simplifies 2-wheel (2WD) or 4-wheel (4WD) operation. Other options include a Bose premium 7-speaker audio system, choices of wheels and tires and several items geared to off-roading adventures and/or extra storage racks for canoes or surfboards and the like.</p>, <p>The base engine in the 2018 GMC Canyon is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder with 200 horsepower and either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic; it’s ideal for work-truck applications. Next is a 3.6-liter V6 with 308 horsepower, available only with the 8-speed automatic and with all the power you could reasonably want. Both engines offer excellent combinations of power and economy. The 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel delivers 369 lb-ft of torque, a maximum towing capacity of 7,700 pounds and as much as 30 mpg on the EPA highway rating. We are tempted to recommend the turbodiesel except that, with a price premium of almost $4,000 over the V6, you’d drive a long time to make up the difference in fuel savings. Our pick has to be the V6.<br>

[<p>Comfortable, capable and fuel-efficient, the ruggedly handsome 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a> Canyon is a standout in the resurgent midsize-pickup-truck segment.

Toyota’s Tacoma also delivers class-leading resale values.</p>, <p>For 2018 the GMC Canyon is essentially unchanged.

---------http://www.kbb.com/gmc/savana-2500-cargo/2018
[<p>GMC’s 2018 Savana van is well known to both consumers and fleet managers, having been around in its present form for over 20 years. While the Savana’s longevity is great for those seeking a long service history and plentiful replacement parts, it’s not so good when talking about competing with newer, safer and more technologically advanced vans like the Ford Transit, Ram ProMaster and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and Metris. On the plus side, the Savana Passenger van can carry up to 15 people and the Cargo van can tow up to 10,000 pounds. Though lacking the option of front-wheel or all-wheel drive, the Savana does offer a number of impressive engine options including a 4-cylinder turbodiesel and a powerful 6.0-liter V8.</p>, <p>If you require a work van with a long history of reliable service, the 2018 GMC Savana is that van. Capable of towing up to 10,000 pounds, the Savana van makes an excellent choice for construction or delivery companies, as well as shuttle services. </p>, <p>The Savana doesn’t offer an extended roof, all-wheel drive or the latest in safety and technology systems. The lack of head restraints on the passenger model’s bench seats is an antiquated design some might not care for.</p>, <p>The 2018 GMC Savana drops its standard 4.8-liter V8 in favor of a 4.3-liter V6 engine mated to a new 8-speed transmission. A rearview monitor is now standard, while side-blind-zone alert and hill-start assist are now available. <b></b></p>, <p>Fans of 1970s’ vans will appreciate that the 2018 Savana’s overall shape and utility largely resemble the groovy vans of that era. Of course, the Savana has more modern features such as available blind-zone alert and a rearview camera, but little else has changed. The design has both advantages and drawbacks, the positives being the Savana’s powerful engine lineup, 12- or 15-passenger capability and 10,000-pound tow rating. However, unlike the Ford Transit or Ram ProMaster, the Savana doesn’t offer the extended-roof height that permits someone to work in the cargo bay without having to stoop over. The passenger model lacks the modern seating setup of its rivals, omitting both head restraints and center armrests, and when driving in snow or ice, the Savana’s rear-drive layout isn’t as capable as a front-drive van. On the road, the Savana’s high seating and ample glass make maneuverability quite easy, although a rather large turning radius somewhat hampers it in tight confines. The 2.8-liter turbodiesel offers good power and fuel economy, while the 6.0-liter V8 is the most powerful engine you can get in a work van.</p>, <p>EASY ACCESS<br>
 If there’s one attribute with the Savana that won’t present a problem, it is access. From its traditional sliding-side door to the available hinged split-doors for the side and rear, the Savana is all about flexibility.<br>
<br>
 CAPABILITY<br>
 With a 10,000-pound tow rating, the Savana is one of the most capable work vans on the market. Its 284-cubic-foot cargo bay can be used to store vast numbers of boxes, provide space for a mobile workshop, or seat up to 15 passengers.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Function is the priority over form in the 2018 Savana. As either a cargo van doing commercial duty or passenger hauler acting as a shuttle for a hotel or large family, the Savana boasts loads of interior space. Unlike competitors, only one roof height is available, but there is an extended-length model that provides even more space. Sturdy plastics and vinyl seats are the cabin materials of choice. Cargo models can seat two up front, while a Crew Cargo version seats five and still offers plenty of space in back. Passenger models seat 12 in standard form, 15 for extended-length models.</p>, <p>If you have a bunch of things to carry, you put them in a box, right? That's the philosophy behind the GMC Savana's design. The shape hasn't evolved much in 30 years, but you could argue that it hasn't needed to. Of course, there are some distinctions, such as the rounded corners, flush headlights and high taillights. Available door configurations include sliding or split swing-out passenger-side doors and numerous add-ons like the swing-out ladder rack. The van can also be customized to accommodate wheelchairs and assist with entry, and buyers can even receive financial reimbursement through the GM Mobility Program.</p>, <p>It's not surprising that a work van like the base Savana cargo has the barest essentials. There is a standard 4.3-liter V6, air conditioning, power windows and door locks, manual exterior mirrors, rearview camera, vinyl seats and an AM/FM radio with auxiliary input. It is also equipped with GM’s subscription-based OnStar 4G LTE connectivity service. Passenger-van models feature cloth seat fabric and 12- or 15-passenger seating. Safety features include 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, StabiliTrak electronic stability control and dual front airbags (plus head/side-curtain airbags for the first three rows in the Passenger Van).</p>, <p>The Savana's noteworthy extras include a 6.0-liter V8 or 2.8-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder engine, a towing package, locking rear differential, cruise control, upgraded audio systems and blind-spot monitor. Also available is an integrated 6.5-inch touch-screen navigation system with traffic information. Passenger models can get rear air conditioning, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and other comfort/convenience amenities, while cargo vans offer a spray-in floor liner. On the more industrial side, there's an enormous upfitter market for tool racks, work benches, special-needs mobility provisions and whatever else you can imagine. GM actively cooperates with these manufacturers.</p>, <p>The 2018 Savana full-size van offers a choice of three engines. Standard is a new 4.3-liter V6 that puts out 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque. This engine is teamed with an 8-speed automatic for improved fuel economy. Optional is a 2.8-liter inline-4 turbodiesel also teamed with the 8-speed transmission. Lastly, there’s the workhorse 6.0-liter V8 good for 342 horsepower and mated to a 6-speed automatic. All Savana vans are powered by their rear wheels, so if you require an all-wheel-drive commercial van, you’ll need to look to the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.<br>

The basic chassis for a cutaway van will run about $31,000 before upfitting. The 2.8-liter diesel adds a cool $4,000 to the bottom line. That's competitive with the Nissan NV, which lacks the Savana's towing capacity. The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter costs more, though the new Sprinter Worker model appeals with its mid-$30,000 price and standard diesel engine. Also alluring are the smaller, nimbler Mercedes-Benz Metris that starts under $30,000 and the newer Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. The Savana's resale value is expected to be on par with the Transit and Nissan NV and better than the Ram ProMaster.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/gmc/sierra-1500-crew-cab/2018
[<p>The 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a> Sierra half-ton pickup’s rugged abilities are never in doubt. What may surprise some, however, is just how versatile this big <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/pickup/">pickup</a> can be. With trims ranging from from basic work truck to the luxurious Denali, the 2018 Sierra 1500 pickup satisfies a broad spectrum of needs and price points. The Sierra does share its platform with the Chevy Silverado, but we think there’s enough visual distinction to justify the two platforms. However, models without the big 6.2-liter V8 lag behind the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> F-150 and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ram/">Ram</a> 1500 in the areas of conventional towing and payload. On the flip side, GMC’s 2018 Sierra will likely hold its value better than the Ram, and it performs better in IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) crash tests.</p>, <p>Opt for the big 6.2-liter V8 and the right configuration and you’ll get a class-leading 12,500-pound tow rating. The <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> Tundra can’t match the Sierra’s horsepower and doesn’t offer upscale features like ventilated front seats or adaptive suspension.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a diesel or turbocharged engine in your next half-ton pickup, the 2018 GMC Sierra is off the list. You can get a diesel in the smaller GMC Canyon, a less expensive option that nearly matches some of the Sierra’s bed and payload figures.</p>, <p>For 2018, the GMC Sierra 1500 pickup gains a 7-inch touch-screen audio system with six speakers as standard equipment. A rearview camera is also made standard, while the TPM system now includes Tire Fill Alert to warn when you’ve reached the proper tire pressure.</p>, <p>GMC’s Sierra 1500 pickup for 2018 is really two <a alt_o_t="Trucks" href="/pickup-truck/">trucks</a> in one. At first glance, the Sierra is a tough, hard-working full-size pickup posting all the right numbers in the areas of payload, towing and horsepower. But, dig deeper and you’ll find a rather passenger-car-like interior with upper trims bordering on Cadillac-levels of comfort and amenities. The Sierra’s available 5.3-liter V8 fits this truck like a glove, offering excellent power and decent fuel economy. Those who need more can step up to the 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8, but they’ll pay a price both at the dealership and the pump. On the open road the Sierra’s cabin filters out most noise and vibration, and when fitted with the Magnetic Ride Control suspension, GMC’s 2018 Sierra rides and handles like no other truck on the road.</p>, <p>CONNECTED INFOTAINMENT<br>
GMC’s 2018 Sierra pickup comes standard with a 7-inch audio screen and optional 8-inch version, both equipped with IntelliLink. With up to five USB ports, available 4G LTE Wi-Fi and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, everything stored in your smartphone can now be part of your truck’s infotainment system.<br>
<br>
DRIVER-ALERT SEAT<br>
Part of the Sierra’s optional lane-departure and forward-collision warning systems, the Driver-Alert Seat sends a slight vibration through either the left- or right-side driver’s seat cushion to warn when the truck is drifting from its intended lane.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With big buttons and knobs coated in rubber for easy grip even when wearing gloves, GMC’s 2018 Sierra's roomy interior is built with work in mind. Yet it also can be luxurious, with features such as ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and communication ports that will outnumber most drivers' devices. Cab configurations include regular with a 3-passenger bench, double cab with seating for five or six, and crew cab with the most room for five or six. As should be expected in a big truck, the front seats are massive. Flip-up rear seats offer more cargo versatility.</p>, <p>We dub GMC’s latest styling experiment "contemporary macho." Like previous GMC trucks, this full-size pickup features blocky styling highlighted by swollen fender flares and a grille that would do a semi-truck proud. With the bold styling come practical innovations like corner steps built into the rear bumper. These provide a foothold for bed access, and by design are covered to mitigate slipping in wet environments. Handgrips and available bed-mounted LED lights are other features we like. Bed lengths range from 5-feet-8 inches to eight feet. Double-cab models have standard front-hinged rear doors for easier access.</p>, <p>Even the most basic 2018 GMC Sierra includes features like air conditioning, cruise control, cloth seats and a 6-speaker, 7-inch touch screen with AM/FM radio with USB/SD inputs, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a rearview camera but no CD player. Step up to an SLE trim and you'll get an 8-inch touch screen, cruise control, 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and more features. SLT trims bring features like the 5.3-liter V8 engine, dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable pedals and leather-appointed seats. Foremen will appreciate the Sierra Denali's 20-inch chrome wheels, navigation system, Bose audio and leather-clad front bucket seats.</p>, <p>Add-ons are available across the 2018 Sierra pickup line. All Sierras can be ordered as 2-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel (4WD), while those seeking the most power and towing capability should look to the 6.2-liter V8 available on Sierra SLT and Denali models. Options include the Driver Alert Package with low-speed automatic braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, IntelliBeam headlights and forward-collision alert, plus front and rear park-assist. The All-Terrain Package features off-road suspension with Rancho shocks, an underbody shield and 18-inch wheels. Interior comforts include heated and cooled front seats, navigation, a power sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>, <p>Three engine choices are available for the 2018 GMC Sierra: a 4.3-liter V6, 5.3-liter V8 and the top-dog 6.2-liter V8 available for SLT and Denali models. The V6 is linked to a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter employ an 8-speed automatic, but only when ordered with the SLE and Denali trim. All three engines have laudable towing capacity, including the V6's max of 7,600 pounds. The 6.2-liter V8 can pull up to 12,500 pounds. With the ability to tow 11,100 pounds and a highway rating of 23 mpg, the 5.3-liter V8 is the middle child in GMC's engine lineup.

[<p>The 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a> Sierra half-ton pickup’s rugged abilities are never in doubt. What may surprise some, however, is just how versatile this big <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/pickup/">pickup</a> can be. With trims ranging from from basic work truck to the luxurious Denali, the 2018 Sierra 1500 pickup satisfies a broad spectrum of needs and price points. The Sierra does share its platform with the Chevy Silverado, but we think there’s enough visual distinction to justify the two platforms. However, models without the big 6.2-liter V8 lag behind the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> F-150 and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ram/">Ram</a> 1500 in the areas of conventional towing and payload. On the flip side, GMC’s 2018 Sierra will likely hold its value better than the Ram, and it performs better in IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) crash tests.</p>, <p>Opt for the big 6.2-liter V8 and the right configuration and you’ll get a class-leading 12,500-pound tow rating. The <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> Tundra can’t match the Sierra’s horsepower and doesn’t offer upscale features like ventilated front seats or adaptive suspension.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a diesel or turbocharged engine in your next half-ton pickup, the 2018 GMC Sierra is off the list. You can get a diesel in the smaller GMC Canyon, a less expensive option that nearly matches some of the Sierra’s bed and payload figures.</p>, <p>For 2018, the GMC Sierra 1500 pickup gains a 7-inch touch-screen audio system with six speakers as standard equipment. A rearview camera is also made standard, while the TPM system now includes Tire Fill Alert to warn when you’ve reached the proper tire pressure.</p>, <p>GMC’s Sierra 1500 pickup for 2018 is really two <a alt_o_t="Trucks" href="/pickup-truck/">trucks</a> in one. At first glance, the Sierra is a tough, hard-working full-size pickup posting all the right numbers in the areas of payload, towing and horsepower. But, dig deeper and you’ll find a rather passenger-car-like interior with upper trims bordering on Cadillac-levels of comfort and amenities. The Sierra’s available 5.3-liter V8 fits this truck like a glove, offering excellent power and decent fuel economy. Those who need more can step up to the 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8, but they’ll pay a price both at the dealership and the pump. On the open road the Sierra’s cabin filters out most noise and vibration, and when fitted with the Magnetic Ride Control suspension, GMC’s 2018 Sierra rides and handles like no other truck on the road.</p>, <p>CONNECTED INFOTAINMENT<br>
GMC’s 2018 Sierra pickup comes standard with a 7-inch audio screen and optional 8-inch version, both equipped with IntelliLink. With up to five USB ports, available 4G LTE Wi-Fi and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, everything stored in your smartphone can now be part of your truck’s infotainment system.<br>
<br>
DRIVER-ALERT SEAT<br>
Part of the Sierra’s optional lane-departure and forward-collision warning systems, the Driver-Alert Seat sends a slight vibration through either the left- or right-side driver’s seat cushion to warn when the truck is drifting from its intended lane.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With big buttons and knobs coated in rubber for easy grip even when wearing gloves, GMC’s 2018 Sierra's roomy interior is built with work in mind. Yet it also can be luxurious, with features such as ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, and communication ports that will outnumber most drivers' devices. Cab configurations include regular with a 3-passenger bench, double cab with seating for five or six, and crew cab with the most room for five or six. As should be expected in a big truck, the front seats are massive. Flip-up rear seats offer more cargo versatility.</p>, <p>We dub GMC’s latest styling experiment "contemporary macho." Like previous GMC trucks, this full-size pickup features blocky styling highlighted by swollen fender flares and a grille that would do a semi-truck proud. With the bold styling come practical innovations like corner steps built into the rear bumper. These provide a foothold for bed access, and by design are covered to mitigate slipping in wet environments. Handgrips and available bed-mounted LED lights are other features we like. Bed lengths range from 5-feet-8 inches to eight feet. Double-cab models have standard front-hinged rear doors for easier access.</p>, <p>Even the most basic 2018 GMC Sierra includes features like air conditioning, cruise control, cloth seats and a 6-speaker, 7-inch touch screen with AM/FM radio with USB/SD inputs, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a rearview camera but no CD player. Step up to an SLE trim and you'll get an 8-inch touch screen, cruise control, 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and more features. SLT trims bring features like the 5.3-liter V8 engine, dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable pedals and leather-appointed seats. Foremen will appreciate the Sierra Denali's 20-inch chrome wheels, navigation system, Bose audio and leather-clad front bucket seats.</p>, <p>Add-ons are available across the 2018 Sierra pickup line. All Sierras can be ordered as 2-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel (4WD), while those seeking the most power and towing capability should look to the 6.2-liter V8 available on Sierra SLT and Denali models. Options include the Driver Alert Package with low-speed automatic braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, IntelliBeam headlights and forward-collision alert, plus front and rear park-assist. The All-Terrain Package features off-road suspension with Rancho shocks, an underbody shield and 18-inch wheels. Interior comforts include heated and cooled front seats, navigation, a power sunroof and a rear-seat entertainment system.</p>, <p>Three engine choices are available for the 2018 GMC Sierra: a 4.3-liter V6, 5.3-liter V8 and the top-dog 6.2-liter V8 available for SLT and Denali models. The V6 is linked to a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter employ an 8-speed automatic, but only when ordered with the SLE and Denali trim. All three engines have laudable towing capacity, including the V6's max of 7,600 pounds. The 6.2-liter V8 can pull up to 12,500 pounds. With the ability to tow 11,100 pounds and a highway rating of 23 mpg, the 5.3-liter V8 is the middle child in GMC's engine lineup.

[<p>What do you call a heavy-duty pickup that can pull, haul and work like there’s no tomorrow, yet offers its passengers a level of comfort and refinement on par with some luxury SUVs? You call it the 2018 GMC Sierra 2500 or 3500 HD. With its available Duramax diesel and 910 lb-ft of torque, the Sierra HD can handle the heaviest loads, although its max tow rating does fall short of trucks from Ford and Ram. Off-road adventurers will love the All Terrain X model, but even the most basic Sierra base trim is easy to love. While it shares much with the Chevy Silverado, the 2018 GMC Sierra HD feels a bit more polished.<b></b></p>, <p>If your next heavy-duty pickup needs to be as sophisticated as it is competent, the 2018 GMC Sierra HD has the power and technology to tow and haul like a champ. Denali models offer unsurpassed levels of luxury, while the All Terrain X model is the most off-road-capable Sierra to date.<b></b></p>, <p>A number of half-tons now offer an oil-burner under the hood, including the Ram 1500 and Nissan Titan XD. The midsize Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon are also options. If you need maximum towing, you’ll find better numbers from the heavy-duty F-Series and Ram trucks.</p>, <p>For 2018, the GMC Sierra HD base trim gets a MyLink 7-inch touch-screen audio system with six speakers as standard equipment. A rearview camera is also made standard, while the TPM system now includes Tire Fill Alert to warn when you’ve reached the proper tire pressure.</p>, <p>It will surprise no one that the 2018 GMC Sierra HD is a workhorse, but this big truck also has a softer side, one we discovered while cruising over long stretches of highway. Despite its obvious bulk, our Sierra Denali HD was impressively comfortable and easy to drive, with a hushed cabin filled with just about every imaginable luxury and tech feature. The Sierra HD’s Duramax diesel pulled without hesitation, and although the muffled clatter beneath the massive hood still betrays it, GMC’s diesel engine is far quieter and refined than past iterations. During our test time, we did get to do some towing, in this case pulling a 10,000-pound trailer up and over a 6,000-foot elevation, a feat that proved mere child’s play for the Sierra HD. Trailer-sway control kept wag to a minimum, and the diesel-exhaust brake and trusty 6-speed Allison transmission insured a drama-free descent.</p>, <p>INTERIOR<br>
 Once bare-bone boxes, today’s heavy-duty pickup cabs are as comfortable as they are functional, and the 2018 GMC Sierra HD is no exception. Comfortable, wide seats complement large visible gauges, and the rubberized switchgear is designed with the working individual’s needs front and center.<br>
<br>
 6.6-LITER DURAMAX ENGINE<br>
 After receiving a new air-induction system and electronically controlled turbocharging system last year, GMC’s Sierra HD for 2018 now offers one of the best diesel engines in the industry. With 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque, power is never in question. The Duramax is even B20-compatible.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Major styling points go to GMC’s 2018 Sierra HD pickup’s interior. The base model brings basic amenities like a front split-bench seat, rearview camera, 7-inch MyLink touch-screen audio, air conditioning, and power windows and locks. Move up to the SLE and you'll get even more features. The top-tier SLT trim offers everything mentioned plus dual-zone climate control, a high-capacity air cleaner, and a suspension package. Then there’s the Denali trim, which is GMC’s halo trim across the board. It brings things like contrast stitching, perforated leather seats, a heated steering wheel and aluminum trim on the instrument panel.</p>, <p>Besides the interior, GMC’s 2018 Sierra HD’s exterior styling is a major game-changer, especially its massive chrome grille and prominent hood scoop. Like the interior, the exterior styling of the Sierra HD closely reflects that of its light-duty offering. HID headlights with LED running lights, a CornerStep rear bumper, and a raised power-dome hood further distinguish the Sierra HD. Regular-cab 2500 and 3500 models are affixed to an 8-foot bed, as is the 3500 crew cab. The double-cab models can be optioned with an 8-foot or a 6-foot 6-inch bed. Dual rear wheels are exclusive to the 3500.</p>, <p>With the base Sierra HD truck, you get a robust V8 engine, anti-lock disc brakes, air conditioning and stability control. An automatic locking rear differential is also standard on all Sierra HD trucks with the exception of the 2500 HD base model. Climbing up the trim ladder brings you leather seats, steering-wheel-mounted controls and Bluetooth. Both Sierra 2500 and 3500 HD models equipped with a Duramax engine also get an electric-assist heater, which helps to warm the cabin quickly. The All Terrain X adds 18-inch black-painted wheels, Z71 off-road suspension, skidplates and an Eaton automatic locking rear differential.</p>, <p>The 6.6-liter V8 Duramax turbodiesel engine is, without question, the option to get when outfitting your 2018 Sierra 2500 or 3500 HD. Choosing the Duramax engine and 4-wheel drive automatically grants an extra measure of confidence when towing, especially on unpaved roads. Other notable options for the 2500 and 3500 trucks include a touch-screen navigation system, an EZ-Lift tailgate, and a snowplow-prep package. Certain double-cab and crew-cab trims can be equipped with GMC’s Digital Power Assist power steering. The DPA system improves stability and steering feel, helping to make hauling and trailering less stressful.</p>, <p>A 6.0-liter V8 gasoline engine or a 6.6-liter Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine provides power to the 2018 GMC Sierra HD. A 6.0-liter V8 powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) is also available, if that's how you roll. Rated at 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, the gasoline engine is stout in its own right, but the Duramax diesel is the real star of the show. Power numbers for the 6.6-liter Duramax turbodiesel V8 check in at 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of twist. The Duramax engine also brings an exhaust-braking system that helps keep the Sierra HD’s speed in check going downhill. A 6-speed automatic transmission reports for duty with either engine, but the Duramax gets the added shift-technology benefits of an Allison 6-speed automatic. The choice of 2-wheel drive (2WD) and 4-wheel drive (4WD) is available throughout the Sierra HD line.<br>

At the other end of the spectrum, if you’re looking to drop some serious coin, a Sierra Denali 3500 HD crew cab can clear the $65,000 mark. That number may bring a little sticker shock at first, but it does fall in line with the most plush, full-size truck offerings from Ford and Ram. Before buying, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for a 2018 Sierra HD. The resale value of the Sierra HD is also in line with the competition, but opting to go with the Duramax diesel engine will help keep the resale value up.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 GMC Terrain is about as all-new as a vehicle can be. Sharing virtually nothing but its name with its predecessor, the new Terrain is leaner, lighter, a little smaller, and far more competitive against the likes of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue/">Nissan Rogue</a> and other class leaders. Under the hood you'll find one of three turbocharged engines, including a diesel, front- or all-wheel drive and of course a more luxurious Denali model with a Lots-O-Chrome grille and other upscale touches. It's also available with all the modern extras, like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic braking and collision alert, lane-keep assist, and an around-view camera. Strangely absent is active cruise control, but overall the 2018 GMC Terrain makes a solid case for itself against tough competition.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a sharply styled, comfortable, cleverly outfitted and surprisingly powerful compact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/terrain/">GMC Terrain</a> might be just the ticket. It's packed with cool features like a huge underfloor storage area and lots of storage space, all in a package that looks ruggedly cool, without being a caricature.</p>, <p>While the Denali is certainly nice inside, the GMC Terrain's refinement doesn't quite match its competition, with a plethora of hard plastics throughout the interior. It's also lacking active cruise control, something that's sure to make road-trippers reconsider.</p>, <p>The 2018 GMC Terrain is all-new this year, sharing its underpinnings with the similarly new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/equinox/">Chevrolet Equinox</a>. With three engine choices and front- or all-wheel drive, it's slightly smaller than its predecessor, but right on target with the rest of the class.</p>, <p>The 2018 GMC Terrain shares most of its underpinnings with the also-new Chevrolet Equinox. Like its Chevy brother, GMC Terrain buyers can choose among three different turbocharged 4-cylinder engines: a 1.5-liter, a more powerful 2.0-liter, or a diesel-burning 1.6-liter. All three engines offer their charms, with the base being the least expensive, the diesel offering excellent fuel economy, and the 2.0-liter bringing surprisingly good acceleration to the party. All come standard with automatic transmissions -- the diesel comes with a 6-speed, the other two with a 9-speed -- and the transmissions use a button-type gear selector on the lower dash. It looks unusual and takes a while to get used to, but in practice we found it to be simple to operate and intuitive enough to use without looking. Around town the Terrain offers a similar driving experience to the Chevy Equinox: comfortable, quiet, and with enough agility in corners that driving it in the mountains isn't a chore.</p>, <p>DIESEL POWER<br>
 The diesel available in the 2018 GMC Terrain results in a combined fuel-economy score of 32 mpg, whether you choose front- or all-wheel drive. That's solid fuel economy without any compromises in performance, cargo area, or anything else. Plus, the diesel is remarkably smooth.<br>
<br>
 FLEXIBLE CARGO<br>
 Not only does the GMC Terrain offer excellent cargo capacity behind the second row of seats, there's an exceptionally generous storage area under the floor as well for storing items you want to keep out of sight. Additionally, the front-passenger seat folds forward, making it simple to carry long objects.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 GMC Terrain interior is functional and comfortable, but like most of its competition it's not what we'd call “luxurious.” Even in the upscale Denali trim, hard plastics dominate the lower portions of the dash and doors, and while we like the embroidered Denali headrests and stitched dash cover, the Denali doesn't feel as posh inside as the extra price and upscale badge would suggest. The front seats are plenty comfortable though, as are the rears, and we appreciate the excellent cargo space and flexibility. The Terrain was also plenty quiet around town and on the highway.</p>, <p>There's no dispute that the 2018 Terrain is a good-looking <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV. The sharp lines, LED accents in the headlights, and stylized headlights all keep the Terrain in the GMC-family-design aesthetic, but with a modern and fresh twist. We like the "floating" effect of the roof, with the rearmost pillar painted black. Standard Terrain models get a grille with three crossbars; step up to the Terrain Denali and the grille gets a giant cheese-grater-type chrome mesh that, in fairness, looks pretty good. Denali models also get additional chrome work on the outside mirrors and lower rocker panels.</p>, <p>The base 2018 GMC Terrain SL comes standard with the 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. There's also a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system, push-button start and keyless entry, a rearview camera, and four USB ports, two of which can be used for data. The audio system includes Bluetooth for audio and phone, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard as well. There's standard leather on the steering wheel, although the seats are covered in cloth, and manually adjustable. Safety equipment includes <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a>'s Rear Seat Reminder, a chime and dash message that reminds you not to forget whoever's sitting back there.</p>, <p>GMC’s new Terrain comes with a long list of options, most of which come at various trim levels. Most notable is the choice of diesel or more powerful gasoline engines, with the diesel available in SLE and SLT models, and the turbo optional in SLE and SLT, and standard on Denali models. All-wheel drive is also available across the board, except for base SL models. As you work your way up the trim ladder you'll find an 8-inch touch-screen navigation system with an upgraded Bose audio system, heated and cooled leather seats, heated rear seats, and upgraded safety systems that include collision avoidance, blind spot and rear cross-traffic alert, an around-view camera, and lane-departure warning. Not available at any price is active cruise control, an oversight in our opinion.</p>, <p>GMC Terrain buyers have a choice of three different powerplants. Standard is a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 170 horsepower, a solidly competitive engine within its class that delivers good fuel economy and decent acceleration. The upgrade from that is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 252 horsepower that turns the Terrain into something just short of a hot rod. In between the two is a 1.6-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder with 137 horsepower but 240 lb-ft of torque, nearly as much as the 2.0-liter gasoline turbo. All three engines can be paired with front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD). The two gasoline engines come with a 9-speed automatic, while the diesel comes with a 6-speed. Fuel economy ranges from adequate in the 2.0-liter, to good with the 1.5-liter, to excellent with the diesel.<br>

[<p>Built in Texas and now in its fourth generation, the 2018 GMC Yukon and its longer sibling, the Yukon XL, are great choices for large active families and those who need to tow a boat or RV. The new Yukon is a full-size SUV with seating for as many as eight passengers and offers a plethora of tech-based active safety systems. The SLE and SLT trim levels are powered by a 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8, while the more luxurious Denali models are equipped with a 420-horsepower 6.2-liter V8 and a 10-speed automatic transmission from Cadillac’s Escalade.

[<p>One of the best-selling sedans in America just got a major overhaul and wow, does it look good. The 2018 Honda Accord banishes the cautious styling of previous generations in favor of a racy coupe-like silhouette, which is good because Honda just killed off the Accord Coupe. A new set of turbocharged 4-cylinder engines replace the previous 4- and 6-cylinder engines, allowing Honda engineers to give the Accord a lower, wider stance. The new Accord’s longer wheelbase improves rear-seat space, so much so that a rear-facing child seat can now fit securely without hitting the front seatback. Honda Sensing brings more standard driver-assist features than are offered with the Toyota Camry, giving the Ohio-built Accord a slight advantage over its longtime nemesis.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a reasonably priced midsize family sedan with the latest in driver safety, suspension and infotainment technology, the new 2018 Honda Accord leads the pack. Dynamic styling, class-leading fuel economy, a massive rear seat, and Honda’s reputation for excellence are also along for the ride. There are even Accord Hybrid variants for those seeking superior fuel economy.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for 6-cylinder power, all-wheel drive, or something with a really long standard warranty, you’re better off shopping a Subaru Legacy, Kia Optima, new Toyota Camry, or a Volkswagen Passat.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Accord is new from the ground up, with two new turbocharged engine choices and standard Honda Sensing on every model. The Accord Touring features a new adaptive suspension, while other trims offer the latest in infotainment and smartphone integration. The Accord Hybrid expands from three trims to five and has a lower starting price than the previous version.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Accord expresses itself differently depending upon trim level. The standard 192-horsepower 1.5-liter engine offers strong off-the-line performance and acceptable levels of power for passing and merging, but the biggest advantage is its class-leading 33-mpg combined fuel-economy figure. Moving up to the 2.0-liter turbo brings a more robust response, with 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque available as low as 2,200 rpm. We spent a good deal of time in the Touring trim outfitted with the 2.0-liter and the Adaptive Damper System. This engine is mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission, which we generally liked, but did notice a bit of hesitation in some passing maneuvers, followed by a slight shudder. The adaptive dampers did a good a job helping the Accord round corners with confidence, but also rendered the big Honda more susceptible to road distortion and freeway expansion joints. The Touring’s 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires didn’t help matters much, either.</p>, <p>HONDA SENSING<br>
Standard on every Accord, the Honda Sensing suite offers more standard safety features than any sedan in this class. The package includes adaptive cruise control, auto high beams, collision-mitigation braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, traffic-sign recognition, and low-speed follow.<br>
<br>
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION<br>
We know manual transmissions are not long for this world, but if your trim name is Sport, then a good manual transmission definitely belongs in the mix. Available with both the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter turbo engines, the Accord Sport’s 6-speed manual transmission is rarity on a sedan of this size, but it definitely improves the fun factor.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Accord touts an all-new interior that is both roomier and more sophisticated than the 2017 model. Front and center is an available 8-inch infotainment screen with large, colorful tiles, and pinch, swipe and zoom functions. The cavernous rear seat offers plenty of legroom and can be equipped with seat heaters, but sadly no USB or additional power ports. Up front, there’s more room in all directions and the controls are logically arranged and easy to operate. One oddity is the push-button gear selector located right next to the cup holders. We’ve all experienced drink spillage while in motion, making us question the wisdom of placing a flat panel push-button controller so close to potential liquid disaster.</p>, <p>The new Accord is slightly shorter but lower and wider than the previous car. The low hood improves aerodynamics, aided by an underbody aerodynamic kit and, on 1.5 EX trims, active grille shutters. The 2018 Accord’s wheelbase is also longer and the track wider. The result is a very seductive looking Accord that only gets better looking as you move up the trims. The Sport wears 19-inch black-and-chrome alloy wheels, LED fog lights and a rear spoiler, while Touring trims get full-LED headlights, adaptive dampers, and front and rear parking sensors. Thanks to some clever repackaging, the Accord Hybrid now offers the same 16.7 cubic feet of trunk space and folding rear seats as found in the Accord sedan.</p>, <p>The 2018 Accord comes in five trims: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring. The most basic Accord LX features the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), Honda Sensing (see Favorite Features), push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED low-beam headlights, multi-view rear backup camera, 7-inch display audio with Bluetooth connectivity and auto on/off headlights. Moving up to the Sport trim brings the option of the 2.0-liter engine and manual transmission as well as standard 8-inch display audio, Sport combi seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a 12-way power driver’s seat, 60/40 split rear seat, and more.<b></b></p>, <p>In typical Honda fashion, options are allotted by trim. Moving up to the EX trim brings blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, a power moonroof, remote start, heated front seats and rear-seat air vents. The EX-L includes leather seats, a 450-watt audio system, and a 4-way power passenger seat. The Touring trim adds navigation (optional on the EX-L), full-LED headlights, head-up display, wireless phone charging, HondaLink Assist, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rain-sensing wipers, and front and rear parking sensors. Hybrid models pretty much match their non-hybrid counterparts, although there is no Sport trim.</p>, <p>Honda’s Accord sedan for 2018 offers a choice of two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. Standard is the 1.5-liter turbo good for 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, a 7-horsepower improvement over last year’s 2.4-liter engine. Optional on the Sport, EX and Touring is a 2.0-liter turbo pumping out 252 horsepower, a noticeable loss of 26 horsepower over the previous 3.5-liter V6. However, the 2.0-liter brings an additional 21 lb-ft of torque to the table, all of which is available at a much lower rpm. All trims with the 1.5-liter engine are mated to a CVT automatic transmission, with the exception of the Sport which offers a 6-speed manual option. The 2.0-liter is paired with Honda’s new 10-speed automatic, again the only exception being the Sport 2.0’s 6-speed manual gearbox. The 2018 Accord Hybrid employs the previous generation’s 2.0-liter gasoline engine and electric-motor setup, as well as the CVT transmission.<br>

The Sport 1.5 starts at $26,655 with either the manual or CVT transmission. The EX bumps the sticker to $28,345, while the Touring with the 1.5-liter engine tops out at $34,675. Add the 2.0-liter engine to the mix and the Sport jumps to $31,185, the EX-L to $32,845, and the Touring to $36,675. The new Honda Accord Hybrid also spans five trims, opening at $25,990 for a base model and rising to $35,600 for a Touring version. The Accord’s pricing is right in line with a comparably equipped Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Kia Optima and Chevrolet Malibu, and about $2,000 less than a comparably equipped all-wheel drive Subaru Legacy with EyeSight driver assist. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. As for resale, it’s too soon to give accurate figures, but it's safe to say the new Accord will likely retain its excellent 5-year values on par with the Toyota Camry and ahead of just about every other midsize sedan.<br>

There are even Accord Hybrid variants for those seeking superior fuel economy.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for 6-cylinder power, all-wheel drive, or something with a really long standard warranty, you’re better off shopping a Subaru Legacy, Kia Optima, new Toyota Camry, or a Volkswagen Passat.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Accord is new from the ground up, with two new turbocharged engine choices and standard Honda Sensing on every model. The Accord Touring features a new adaptive suspension, while other trims offer the latest in infotainment and smartphone integration. The Accord Hybrid expands from three trims to five and has a lower starting price than the previous version.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Accord expresses itself differently depending upon trim level. The standard 192-horsepower 1.5-liter engine offers strong off-the-line performance and acceptable levels of power for passing and merging, but the biggest advantage is its class-leading 33-mpg combined fuel-economy figure. Moving up to the 2.0-liter turbo brings a more robust response, with 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque available as low as 2,200 rpm. We spent a good deal of time in the Touring trim outfitted with the 2.0-liter and the Adaptive Damper System. This engine is mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission, which we generally liked, but did notice a bit of hesitation in some passing maneuvers, followed by a slight shudder. The adaptive dampers did a good a job helping the Accord round corners with confidence, but also rendered the big Honda more susceptible to road distortion and freeway expansion joints. The Touring’s 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires didn’t help matters much, either.</p>, <p>HONDA SENSING<br>
Standard on every Accord, the Honda Sensing suite offers more standard safety features than any sedan in this class. The package includes adaptive cruise control, auto high beams, collision-mitigation braking, lane-departure warning and mitigation, traffic-sign recognition, and low-speed follow.<br>
<br>
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION<br>
We know manual transmissions are not long for this world, but if your trim name is Sport, then a good manual transmission definitely belongs in the mix. Available with both the 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter turbo engines, the Accord Sport’s 6-speed manual transmission is rarity on a sedan of this size, but it definitely improves the fun factor.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Accord touts an all-new interior that is both roomier and more sophisticated than the 2017 model. Front and center is an available 8-inch infotainment screen with large, colorful tiles, and pinch, swipe and zoom functions. The cavernous rear seat offers plenty of legroom and can be equipped with seat heaters, but sadly no USB or additional power ports. Up front, there’s more room in all directions and the controls are logically arranged and easy to operate. One oddity is the push-button gear selector located right next to the cup holders. We’ve all experienced drink spillage while in motion, making us question the wisdom of placing a flat panel push-button controller so close to potential liquid disaster.</p>, <p>The new Accord is slightly shorter but lower and wider than the previous car. The low hood improves aerodynamics, aided by an underbody aerodynamic kit and, on 1.5 EX trims, active grille shutters. The 2018 Accord’s wheelbase is also longer and the track wider. The result is a very seductive looking Accord that only gets better looking as you move up the trims. The Sport wears 19-inch black-and-chrome alloy wheels, LED fog lights and a rear spoiler, while Touring trims get full-LED headlights, adaptive dampers, and front and rear parking sensors. Thanks to some clever repackaging, the Accord Hybrid now offers the same 16.7 cubic feet of trunk space and folding rear seats as found in the Accord sedan.</p>, <p>The 2018 Accord comes in five trims: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring. The most basic Accord LX features the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), Honda Sensing (see Favorite Features), push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED low-beam headlights, multi-view rear backup camera, 7-inch display audio with Bluetooth connectivity and auto on/off headlights. Moving up to the Sport trim brings the option of the 2.0-liter engine and manual transmission as well as standard 8-inch display audio, Sport combi seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a 12-way power driver’s seat, 60/40 split rear seat, and more.<b></b></p>, <p>In typical Honda fashion, options are allotted by trim. Moving up to the EX trim brings blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, a power moonroof, remote start, heated front seats and rear-seat air vents. The EX-L includes leather seats, a 450-watt audio system, and a 4-way power passenger seat. The Touring trim adds navigation (optional on the EX-L), full-LED headlights, head-up display, wireless phone charging, HondaLink Assist, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rain-sensing wipers, and front and rear parking sensors. Hybrid models pretty much match their non-hybrid counterparts, although there is no Sport trim.</p>, <p>Honda’s Accord sedan for 2018 offers a choice of two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. Standard is the 1.5-liter turbo good for 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, a 7-horsepower improvement over last year’s 2.4-liter engine. Optional on the Sport, EX and Touring is a 2.0-liter turbo pumping out 252 horsepower, a noticeable loss of 26 horsepower over the previous 3.5-liter V6. However, the 2.0-liter brings an additional 21 lb-ft of torque to the table, all of which is available at a much lower rpm. All trims with the 1.5-liter engine are mated to a CVT automatic transmission, with the exception of the Sport which offers a 6-speed manual option. The 2.0-liter is paired with Honda’s new 10-speed automatic, again the only exception being the Sport 2.0’s 6-speed manual gearbox. The 2018 Accord Hybrid employs the previous generation’s 2.0-liter gasoline engine and electric-motor setup, as well as the CVT transmission.<br>

The Sport 1.5 starts at $26,655 with either the manual or CVT transmission. The EX bumps the sticker to $28,345, while the Touring with the 1.5-liter engine tops out at $34,675. Add the 2.0-liter engine to the mix and the Sport jumps to $31,185, the EX-L to $32,845, and the Touring to $36,675. The new Honda Accord Hybrid also spans five trims, opening at $25,990 for a base model and rising to $35,600 for a Touring version. The Accord’s pricing is right in line with a comparably equipped Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Kia Optima and Chevrolet Malibu, and about $2,000 less than a comparably equipped all-wheel drive Subaru Legacy with EyeSight driver assist. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. As for resale, it’s too soon to give accurate figures, but it's safe to say the new Accord will likely retain its excellent 5-year values on par with the Toyota Camry and ahead of just about every other midsize sedan.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/honda/civic/2018
[<p>A perennial best-seller,<b> </b>the roomy and fuel-efficient 2018 Honda Civic has become the benchmark for the compact class, which includes the Toyota Corolla, Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, VW Golf and Jetta, Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. The new Civic is offered as a sedan, coupe or hatchback, and its available turbocharged engines produce as much as 306 horsepower. It’s also rated a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The new Honda Civic is offered in seven trim levels including the base Civic LX, which starts around $21,000 for a hatchback, the Civic Si performance model and the legendary Civic Type R (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/honda/civic-type-r/2018/">reviewed here</a>), which battles the Ford Focus RS and Volkswagen Golf R for hot-hatch supremacy. With its variety of models, excellent-yet-efficient driving manners, and an enviable history of reliability and resale value, it's little wonder the Civic was crowned KBB.com's <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/best-buy-awards/2100000577/">2017 Best Buy Award overall winner</a>.</p>, <p>Stylish and filled with the latest tech and safety features, the 2018 Honda Civic is perfect for anyone looking for a spacious, fuel-efficient and reliable commuter car that’s fun to drive. Enthusiasts will like the 205-horsepower Civic Si Coupe or Sedan, and the 306-horsepower Civic Type R Hatchback is destined to become a legend.</p>, <p>Despite its numerous body styles and powertrains, the Civic does not serve all. If you need all-wheel drive, look to a Subaru Impreza. For a diesel sedan or hatchback, turn to the Chevy Cruze. And if a hybrid is what you’re looking for, check out the Toyota Prius, Kia Niro and Hyundai Ionic.</p>, <p>Last year Honda added the hatchback body style as well as the 306-horsepower high-performance Type R to the Civic’s extensive lineup. There are no changes or updates for 2018.</p>, <p>Honda says its vast and longtime involvement in auto racing improves its street cars. Although it’s hard to draw a direct line from the Honda that won the 2017 Indy 500 to the new Civic, although both cars are turbocharged, a big part of the Civic's winning formula is the way it combines practicality, efficiency and everyday comfort with modest to maximum dashes of sportiness. The Civic is highly satisfying to drive, even a base model with the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed manual transmission. The smaller but more powerful turbocharged 1.5-liter offers good if not blistering acceleration and nary a hint of turbo lag. Most buyers will choose the automatic transmission, and the Civic's CVT (continuously variable transmission) is among the best at mimicking a traditional one. A standard Civic can't quite match a Mazda3 in cornering dynamics, but it's still among the best in its class, as is its steering feel.</p>, <p>HONDA SENSING<br>
 This comprehensive suite of optional safety features and driving aids costs only $1,000. It’s an incredible value. The package includes adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, road-departure mitigation, forward-collision warning, lane-keeping assist and the Collision Mitigation Braking System, which can automatically apply the brakes if a frontal collision appears imminent.<br>
<br>
 HONDA LANEWATCH<br>
 Standard on EX, EX-L and the top Sport Touring trim levels, this clever system adds a camera to the passenger-side mirror to eliminate your blind spot. Every time you turn on the Civic’s right turn signal, the camera provides a live shot of the Civic’s flank on the interior touch screen.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Civic’s interior is full of premium materials and top-notch plastics. Ergonomics is a volume knob shy of perfection, as using the new Honda Civic’s touch screen to crank up the Taylor Swift can be frustrating and distracting. This is a problem Honda has already addressed in other models. The large, easy-to-read screen also serves as the control center for audio, Apple CarPlay and the optional navigation system. The Civic boasts some of the best interior volume among compact cars. Rear-seat legroom is impressive in the sedan, but beware of the wide sills when entering and exiting. At 15.1 cubic feet, the Civic sedan's trunk is huge. Hatchback Civics boast 25.7 cubic feet of space with the rear seats up and some 20 additional cubic feet with them down.</p>, <p>Honda took chances with the design of the 2018 Honda Civic and they have paid off. The Civic’s shape is daring and innovative, with an aggressive front end, a long, low and wide stance and unique C-shaped taillights. The Civic Sedan and Coupe feature elegant sloping rooflines, while the Civic hatchback stands out with its bulbous rear end, high-mounted spoiler and the gaping fake vents on either side of its rear bumper. Sport and Sport Touring hatchbacks can be spied via their center-mounted dual-exhaust outlets, while the new Si boasts its own edgier exterior cosmetics. The Type R gets a hood scoop, three exhaust pipes and a gargantuan rear spoiler.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Civic is offered in an array of trims that range from base LX to top Touring variants as well as the enthusiast-oriented Si and Type R halo models. The least expensive Civic LX sedan includes automatic climate control, rearview camera, folding rear seat, and a 4-speaker AM/FM audio system with USB port, Bluetooth connectivity and 5-inch screen. We think most buyers will prefer stepping up to at least an EX model, which includes an automatic transmission (optional on LX models), remote engine start, moonroof, 60/40-split folding rear seat and upgraded infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen that is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.</p>, <p>Climbing to the Civic EX-T in the sedan or coupe, or any Civic hatchback, brings the smaller but more powerful turbocharged engine as standard. Other features vary with trim level, including leather interior, heated front and rear seats, navigation system, Honda's LaneWatch camera-based blind-spot monitoring system, power driver's seat, and dual-zone automatic climate control. One package we recommend for any Civic (as long as it has the required automatic transmission) is the Honda Sensing system. This suite of active safety features and driving aids described in "Favorite Things" is well worth the extra $1,000.</p>, <p>Two engines and two transmissions are used in the high-volume members of the 2018 Honda Civic. Base sedans and coupes use a 158-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder available with a 6-speed manual transmission or an excellent continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims and all 2018 Civic hatchbacks employ a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that is more powerful and efficient. This engine can also be connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. Sport and Sport Touring Hatchbacks get a power bump. The Civic Si pairs its 205-horsepower/1.5-liter turbo engine with a 6-speed manual as does the Type R with its 306-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. All 2018 Civics remain front-wheel drive, but while the baseline models burn regular unleaded gasoline, the Si and Type R require premium to exploit their full performance potential.<br>

Including destination charge, it arrives with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $19,500. Civic coupes cost a few hundred dollars more, and the new hatchback Civic starts under $21,000. Top-line Civic models can reach the upper $20K range. While the Civic's starting prices aren't the lowest (the Ford Focus, Kia Forte, Hyundai Elantra and Mazda3 start less), they are in line with the Toyota Corolla. Both the Civic Si coupe and sedan share a $23,900 MSRP, with their sole option being a $200 set of “summer” performance tires (a fantastic value) and a wheel upgrade. The Type R starts around $35,000. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Honda Civic. As for the Civic's resale value, Hondas in general hold their value exceptionally well, and the Civic is no exception.<br>

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/honda/civic%20type%20r/2018/">2018 Honda Civic Type R</a> is the best driver's car <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a> has built since the S2000. Much more than just a Civic with a powerful engine, Honda reengineered the car -- already the <a alt_o_t="Best Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/awards-best-cars-and-top-10-lists/2000006743/">best car</a> in its class -- turning it into a performance thoroughbred. The turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder puts out 306 horsepower, and it's connected only to a slick-shifting rev-matching 6-speed manual transmission. The Civic's <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> body gets reinforced with structural adhesives for better rigidity, and the torque-steer-reducing front suspension is unique to the Type R. Sure, it looks crazy, but Honda insists all that wild bodywork helps increase downforce. Other cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a> RS are quicker in a straight line and boast all-wheel drive, but the 2018 Civic Type R beats them on price, and day-to-day comfort.</p>, <p>Previously only available in Japan and Europe, the 2018 Honda Civic Type R is the fulfillment of every "tuner" magazine reader's dreams. But it's not just for enthusiasts: If you're looking for a great-handling, quick, and fun car that won't beat you up on your daily commute, the Civic Type R is just right.</p>, <p>Functional or not, the wings and vents adorning the Civic Type R look aggressively goofy to some. The Type R isn't the quickest hot hatch in a straight line, and owners should avoid drag racing the Focus RS and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/wrx/">Subaru WRX</a> STI.</p>, <p>All-new last year, the 2018 Honda Civic Type R features no changes this year.</p>, <p>All too often, "hot-rod" versions of good compact cars wind up compromising the things we liked about the compact in the first place. Not so the 2018 Honda Civic Type R. Yes, it's quick: The 306-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder puts down power to the front wheels smoothly and, remarkably, without torque steer. Take it to a racetrack, flip the drive mode to +R, and it's as rewarding to drive as just about anything you could care to mention, practically egging you on to push its limits, and quicker than many of its all-wheel-drive competitors. Yet away from the track, on the daily commute, Honda hasn't forgotten that this is a Civic. The powerful engine also pours out plentiful torque, making it easy to drive in traffic. When the drive mode is in its Comfort setting, the ride is perfectly acceptable. In fact, maybe it's a little too civilized, as we'd like a bit more engine noise to filter through the triple-pipe exhaust system.</p>, <p>ADJUSTABLE DRIVING MODES<br>
 Driving modes are becoming commonplace, but driving modes that make a real difference are still a rarity. The Civic Type R's three modes are as distinct as they could be. Comfort is great for commuting, save +R for the track (or smooth surface streets), and Sport neatly splits the difference.<br>
<br>
 IT'S HERE<br>
 This is the first Civic Type R ever sold on these shores (the Integra Type R from 20 years ago doesn't count), and even among other Type R models, this is the best one ever. Thank the one-world, 10th-generation Civic platform for the honor.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>On one hand, the 2018 Civic Type R is still a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>. That means there's ample cargo space, a roomy rear seat, ergonomic near-perfection (volume knob, please!), and all the comfort and thoughtful design that's landed the 10th-generation Civic on our Best Buy winners’ list three years running. But the Civic Type R adds red-stitched Alcantara trim on the center console and doors, and red trim surrounding the vents and other areas. The bright red "H" on the steering wheel and key fob and the aluminum shifter are signature Type R touches. The unique manually adjusted sport seats offer up stiff side bolsters, but we wish there was more lumbar support.</p>, <p>We know, we know: There's a lot going on here. Honda claims the roofline nubs, deep front and side extensions, the gigantic wing, and the other wild-looking styling elements on the Civic Type R actually improve aerodynamics and/or downforce. That wing, for example, is supposed to create downforce at speed, helping with cornering. The winglets at the edge of the front bumper and side skirts help route air around the wheels to reduce drag. The vents on the front bumper help cool the brakes, and the vent on the hood cools the turbo. It's certainly eye-catching, but pretty? Well...</p>, <p>The 2018 Civic Type R starts at the Touring level of equipment, which means very little is left off the car. There's a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system with navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 12-speaker premium audio system, USB input and Bluetooth phone and audio compatibility. There's also "power everything," plus cruise control and dual-zone automatic climate control. Of course there are unique touches, like the heavily bolstered front seats, the drive-mode control that includes the track-ready +R mode, and a gauge-cluster that changes with the drive mode, and includes cool touches like a lap timer and racing-style redline-warning light.</p>, <p>You can pick your color and a few dealer-installed accessories, and that's about it for options on the Type R. As for colors, we recommend Championship White. Not only does it really show off the various black panels and other styling elements (go big or go home), this off-white color is a nod to Honda's racing history, the same color on its first Formula 1 effort from the 1960s. Interestingly, Honda's excellent HondaSensing suite of safety features -- lane-keeping assist, active cruise control, collision mitigation and so on -- isn't available on any manual-transmission Civic, including the Type R.</p>, <p>There's only one drivetrain for the 2018 Honda Civic Type R: a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. It sends all that power to the front wheels through a helical limited-slip differential. The engine's 306 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque are enough to make torque steer a concern. Torque steer, if you're unaware, is the tendency for a powerful front-wheel-drive car's front wheels to turn left or right when under a load; it's annoying and not very fun. Honda has somehow controlled it with a unique front-suspension setup that incorporates a special steering linkage. It's different from the rest of the Civic lineup, and helps virtually eliminate the effect of torque steer.<br>
<br>
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 306 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm<br>
 295 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/28 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Honda Civic Type R is just under $35,000, including the $890 destination charge. With options...well, there are none, so that's what you'll pay. As for competition, the Civic Type R doesn't have a direct competitor since its primary rivals -- the Ford Focus RS and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/golf%20r/">Volkswagen Golf R</a> -- are both all-wheel drive, quicker, more powerful, and considerably more expensive, with starting prices closer to the $40,000 mark. Whether that makes the Type R a bargain is up to your priorities. Whatever you decide, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area for the Civic Type R, and note that there's a good chance the dealer won't budge much on the price due to demand. As for resale, expect it to be solid, like the rest of the Civic lineup.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a> Clarity isn’t just one car model, but the name for a trio of ultra-efficient <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, each powered in a different way. Honda’s Clarity lineup launched last year with a hydrogen fuel-cell model only available for lease in California, then an all-electric model for lease to California and Oregon residents. The last variant to arrive is the Clarity with the broadest appeal – a gasoline-electric plug-in hybrid that is sold or leased nationwide. Boasting one of the most efficient powertrains available, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/clarity%20plug-in%20hybrid/">Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid</a> was named the Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award winner among <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> and hybrid vehicles, bettering rivals such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/volt/">Chevrolet Volt</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius%20prime/">Toyota Prius Prime</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Ioniq.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an ultra-efficient sedan that’s easy to drive, packs commendable value and features a slew of technology and safety features, the 2018 Honda Clarity Plug-in is at the top of the pack. For a small niche of eco-conscious drivers, the Clarity Electric and Clarity Fuel Cell can also make sense.</p>, <p>Marks against the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid are few, but one of the biggest nits we’re aware of is its exterior design. Those rear-wheel skirts may help this Honda sedan’s efficiency, but they do no favors to its style. The Clarity Fuel Cell battles a limited hydrogen infrastructure issue, while the all-electric Clarity’s 89-mile range pales against the 238-mile range of the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> Bolt.</p>, <p>The Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid is all-new for 2018, completing the lineup’s trio that started with the hydrogen fuel-cell and all-electric models. The Clarity Plug-in Hybrid features both a gasoline engine and an electric motor, making it the best choice for a majority of shoppers and the easiest to live with.</p>, <p>The Clarity’s propulsion systems are certainly advanced, but the beauty of this Honda is that it’s so easy to drive. Whether it’s running on hydrogen, electricity or a powertrain that has both a gasoline engine and an electric motor, the experience is seamless. If you didn’t know better, you’d think you were in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord/">Honda Accord</a> sedan. Giveaways that you’re not is often in what you don’t experience, namely noise. The Clarity Fuel Cell and Clarity all-electric sedan glide along in near silence since there’s no internal-combustion engine. The Clarity Plug-in, the model most buyers will choose, grants up to 47 miles in all-electric driving before the gasoline engine switches on to act as a generator or power the wheels directly. Transition between the gasoline and electric powertrain is seamless. While none of these vehicles have the blazing acceleration of a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/tesla/">Tesla</a>, you needn’t fear being the slowest on the freeway. Acceleration is acceptable, and the Clarity’s dynamics are more than respectable for a car so focused on efficiency.</p>, <p>PLUG-IN HYBRID<br>
 The beauty of this system is it offers the best of both worlds: the ability to drive on electricity alone, or via a gasoline engine like a traditional car. That means none of the “range anxiety” that can come with an all-electric car, nor the wait times required for recharging.<br>

 STANDARD SAFETY FEATURES<br>
 No matter which flavor of Clarity you go with, you'll get the Honda Sensing roster of safety and driver-assistance features that include lane-departure warning and lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control and Collision Mitigation Braking.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>One big trait that sets the Honda Clarity apart from rivals like the Toyota Prius Prime plug-in and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/mirai/">Toyota Mirai</a> fuel cell is seat count: All Clarity models have room for five passengers instead of the four in those rivals. We don’t suggest long trips with three passengers in back, but it’s possible when needed. The rest of the Clarity’s cabin is also quite practical yet futuristic, with excellent fit and finish. Instead of a traditional gear lever, there are a series of buttons for Drive, Reverse, Neutral, etc., running in a spine down the center. Above is an 8-inch touch-screen display and infotainment system that is CarPlay and Android Auto compatible. The Clarity Plug-in and Clarity all-electric have sizable, 14.3-cubic-foot trunks, but the fuel-cell model’s is more limited at 11.8 cubic feet to accommodate the hydrogen tank housing.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Clarity lineup of green vehicles definitely has a futuristic element going for it. This sleek 4-door sedan is a bevy of angles, curves and unique aesthetics, some of which work better than others. We like the sloped roof that almost appears to float, while the rear reminds of the sleek, latest-gen Civic. Up front, it's hard to miss the massive boomerang-shaped light treatments. While it may bring better aerodynamics, we aren't fans of the body panels that drip beyond the top of the rear wheels.</p>, <p>The new Clarity Plug-in Hybrid, the most widely available model in the lineup by far, comes in two main trims: standard and Touring. Even the standard trim brings a strong stable of features that includes 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, LED headlights and taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers and LaneWatch, which provides real-time video of the right-side blind spot. Like more and more new Honda cars, the Clarity comes with HondaSensing, a commendable suite of safety and driver-assistance features. It bundles lane-departure warning and lane-keeping systems, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning, and automatic emergency braking. The limited Clarity Fuel Cell and Clarity Electric are mono-spec models that are also well-equipped with these features and more, including navigation and power driver’s seat.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the Honda Clarity Plug-in Touring model adds navigation, power front seats (with 2-position memory for the driver’s seat), leather-trimmed seats and steering wheel, and Ultrasuede interior. From there, options are mostly limited to dealer accessories.</p>, <p>Though all electrified, each 2018 Honda Clarity sedan is powered in its own way. The Plug-in Hybrid model uses the combination of a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a battery-fed electric motor. The pair works seamlessly and intuitively. And while there are selectable drive modes -- Normal, Econ, Sport and HV to maintain the battery’s state of charge -- we think the simplest way to operate is just get in and drive. With a full charge and tank full of gasoline, the Clarity Plug-in has a range of 340 miles. The Clarity Electric is powered solely by an electric motor fed by a lithium-ion battery that can be recharged in roughly three hours on a 240-volt line. Its range is rated at only 89 miles. The Clarity Fuel Cell uses hydrogen gas, and through a chemical reaction creates electricity on demand. It's a futuristic application, but ultimately feels familiar. Similar to filling a car with gasoline, you use a nozzle, fill the tank in three to five minutes, then go on your way. It also benefits from a longer range -- up to 366 miles.<br>

[<p>Fresh from its complete overhaul last year, the 2018 Honda CR-V compact-crossover SUV continues to offer the size, features, fuel economy and excellent reliability buyers have come to expect from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a>. In a market where small <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> are now crushing sales of small and midsize <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, the CR-V offers 5-passenger seating, a roomy and versatile cargo bay plus more ground clearance than the average car with the option of all-wheel drive. While not as off-road-ready as a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a>, the CR-V nevertheless can be somewhat adventurous. It has more interior room than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a>, more power than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue/">Nissan Rogue</a> and better <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda CR-V continues to be the go-to <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV for those seeking dependability, affordability, safety and simplicity. Prepackaged trim levels remove the complication of picking and choosing numerous features, and EX and higher trims offer advanced safety features like collision-mitigation braking and lane-keeping assist.</p>, <p>If you’re looking to venture off-road or tow more than 1,500 pounds, you’re better off in a V6-powered Jeep Cherokee. If you’re looking for impressive handling, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a> or Ford Escape is a better choice, while the Toyota RAV4 offers its suite of driver-assist features as standard equipment on every trim.</p>, <p>After a complete overhaul last year, Honda’s compact CR-V crossover SUV for 2018 returns with no changes of note.</p>, <p>Honda now offers two engine options for the 2018 CR-V. The 2.4-liter engine continues to be offered in the base LX trim, while all others now feature a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine. Before you get all excited by the “turbo” word, this isn’t a high-performance engine like the one found in the Ford Escape. Instead, the CR-V’s turbocharged engine delivers better low-end torque for quicker passing and merging maneuvers, while improving fuel economy by a few mpg. The turbo delivers a smooth, linear performance that belies its diminutive displacement, with no lag or sudden rush of power when you hammer the accelerator. Both engines are mated to one of the best CVT automatics in the industry, one that even simulates traditional gear changes when pressed hard. The CR-V’s handling is good but not exceptional, the ride comfortable without being too soft and the interior devoid of obnoxious exterior noise or maddening squeaks and rattles.</p>, <p>HONDA SENSING SAFETY SUITE<br/> Standard on EX and higher trims, the CR-V’s suite of standard driver-assist and safety features includes such vital accident-avoidance systems as collision-mitigation braking, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and lane-keeping assist.<br/> <br/> INTERIOR SPACE<br/> Although the latest CR-V isn’t all that much bigger than the generation it replaced, interior space is noticeably improved. With 40 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat, the CR-V trumps the Ford Escape, Toyota RAV4 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/tucson/">Hyundai Tucson</a>. Rear legroom is equally impressive at a whopping 40.4 inches.<br/> </p>, <p>As noted, the 2018 CR-V's 2-row, 5-passenger interior space has only improved -- an impressive feat given that the previous generation was already among the most spacious in its class. In addition to its growth, this Honda SUV's space is easier to utilize. The 60/40-split rear seats fold with a simple pull of a lever, and the rear cargo area has a 2-tier setup in which the floor can be flat or set lower to keep objects secure. EX and above models have a pair of useful rear USB ports to keep mobile devices juiced. Up front is the CR-V's familiar and enviable seating position that is comfortable and provides a good view out.</p>, <p>Though still unmistakably a CR-V, the latest version of Honda's <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUV</a> looks like it has hit the gym, with a long, wide stance and more aggressive wheel designs. Ground clearance is a respectable 7.8 inches for front-wheel-drive (FWD) models and 8.2 inches for all-wheel drive (AWD). This is especially good news for CR-V owners who will contend with snow and other foul weather. To our eyes, the latest design is just what the CR-V needed, making it appear less bulbous in the rear, and more substantial and slightly tougher in general.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda CR-V comes in four flavors: LX, EX, EX-L and Touring. The least expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a> LX includes single-zone automatic climate control, rearview camera, 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat, cruise control, and a 4-speaker, 160-watt audio system with 5-inch color screen and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The LX is the only CR-V with the carryover 2.4-liter engine. Most buyers will (and should) opt for the EX, which includes the turbo engine, power driver's seat, dual-zone climate control, moonroof, push-button start, heated front seats and 7-inch-display audio/infotainment system that's Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatible. Significantly, EX models include the Honda Sensing safety suite (see Favorite Features).</p>, <p>Major options come by climbing trims. Step up to the EX-L and you gain leather seating, a power tailgate, 4-way power-adjustable passenger seat, HomeLink universal garage-door opener, auto-dimming rearview mirror and 8-speaker audio system. Top-line Touring models add a hands-free tailgate, navigation (optional in EX-L models), LED headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, roof rails, dual chrome exhaust outlets, and a 330-watt/9-speaker premium audio system. All-wheel drive is optional on all trims of the 2018 CR-V.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda CR-V offers two engine choices, though both are tied to trim level. The well-regarded 2.4-liter 4-cylinder that powered the last-gen CR-V carries over, but only in LX models. All other CR-Vs get a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Both have nearly the same power output, but the turbo has a few more horsepower and earns higher fuel economy. Unlike some turbo engines, this one is happy drinking regular unleaded gasoline. Both engines are tied to a CVT automatic transmission that has a Sport mode for added responsiveness. Front-wheel drive is the standard setup, with all-wheel drive optional on both. Both engines in the CR-V are rated to tow 1,500 pounds -- on the low end of the SUV spectrum.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>2.4-liter inline-4<br>
 184 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br>
 180 lb-ft of torque @ 3,900 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/32 mpg (FWD), 25/31 mpg (AWD)<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 190 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br>
 179 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-5,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 28/34 mpg (FWD), 27/33 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Honda CR-V crossover SUV has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting right around $25,000 for the base LX model. With its impressive amenities and advanced safety features, the EX model that starts just under $28,000 is far more recommendable. Adding leather and the other features in the EX-L model will cost around $30,000, while a top-line CR-V Touring edition begins over $33,000. Adding AWD is an extra $1,300. At these prices, the new CR-V is nearly in step with its archrival the Toyota RAV4, yet still manages to undercut it slightly. Others in this hot segment, such as the Nissan Rogue and Ford Escape, start slightly lower. Subaru’s Forester is similarly priced but comes standard with AWD and offers a manual-transmission option. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. Another aspect the CR-V has going for it is high resale value. It has traditionally held its value very well, and we expect the same of this new model.</p>]

[<p>Improved with a retuned suspension, a quieter interior and new safety and in-cabin technology -- including available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto -- the 2018 Honda Fit is a fun, fuel-efficient and affordable subcompact with class-leading versatility. Honda calls it the 5-door car with attitude. We call it the yardstick against which all other subcompacts are measured, including the Toyota Yaris, Hyundai Accent, Ford Fiesta, Nissan Versa and Chevy Sonic. Four trim levels are offered, LX, Sport, EX and EX-L. Each is equipped with the Fit’s famous so-called Magic Seat, which maximized cargo space but allows for a generous rear seat. All Fits are powered by a high-revving 130-horsepower 4-cylinder engine. A 6-speed manual transmission and a CVT automatic transmission with paddle shifters are available.</p>, <p>With its impressive cargo capacity, seating space and in-car connectivity, the 2018 Honda Fit is a great choice for those looking for an inexpensive, fuel-efficient hatchback that doesn’t feel like a rental car. The Fit also handles better than the competition and has a history of above-average reliability.<b></b></p>, <p>The new 2018 Honda Fit represents a solid value, but there are less expensive options in the subcompact class. Price-sensitive shoppers may want to investigate the Nissan Versa and Kia Rio. Four-door sedan buyers should know the Fit is only available as a hatchback, unlike many of its competitors.</p>, <p>New for 2018 are a retuned suspension for improved handling, more insulation for a quieter interior and a full suite of active safety technology including Adaptive Cruise Control, Forward Collision Warning and Lane Keep Assist. The new Sport trim adds more aggressive styling, black 16-inch wheels and a chrome exhaust tip.<b></b></p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Fit is fun to drive, but not because it has gobs of horsepower. It’s responsive and quick for a car in this class, but it’s the Honda’s agility that makes it a standout. The Fit’s suspension offers up the kind of predictable handling you'd expect, but with a sharpness you don't, and it combines with the hatchback’s above-average steering feel to make this subcompact genuinely entertaining in sharp corners. While all four models -- LX, Sport, EX and EX-L -- offer the same engine and transmissions, the Sport, EX and EX-L models handle better than the base LX thanks to their 16-inch wheels and lower-profile tires. The Fit rides well, and it’s comfortable out on the highway, but its short wheelbase can cause some chop on rough patches of Interstate. This year Honda has added insulation and acoustic-laminated glass, and the Fit’s interior is noticeably quieter.</p>, <p>CONNECTIVITY<br>
 Also new for 2018 is a large 7-inch touch screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. It’s standard on Fit Sport, EX and EX-L trims. Honda has also replaced the audio system’s infuriating volume buttons with a conventional knob, which is much easier to use. Navigation is available.<br>
<br>
 HONDA SENSING SUITE<br>
 New to the Fit is a full complement of active safety systems rarely seen in the subcompact class. The Honda Sensing Suite is available on all Fit models, but it’s standard on EX and EX-L. It includes Adaptive Cruise Control, Collision Mitigation, Forward Collision Warning and Lane Keeping Assist.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Inside, the Fit’s generous people accommodation and cargo space are its greatest selling points. This is roomy little car with a clever back-seat design Honda calls the Magic Seat. Split 60/40, the Fit’s back seat doesn’t just fold flat, you can also flip up the seat bottoms to carry tall objects, like a mountain bike. The new Fit seats five and there’s room in back for tall adults. Soft-touch materials and silver accent trim definitely make it feel more expensive than its price. The front bucket seats are comfortable and there are myriad storage cubbies and cup holders.</p>, <p>Now in its third generation the 2018 Honda Fit has shed it frumpy slab-sided styling and little-minivan look for a lower, leaner design with a more muscular and chiseled shape. Up front its squinted headlights and laid-back windshield look modern and aerodynamic, while its rooftop spoiler and intricate taillights give it some sporting attitude. Fit EX and EX-L models get fog lights, aluminum-alloy wheels, and extra chrome on the grille and liftgate, while the new Sport model adds some sports-car flair with black wheels, a more aggressive front spoiler, a rear diffuser, orange pin-striping and a chrome exhaust tip.</p>, <p>The base Fit LX offers a generous amount of standard equipment, one reason it's a little more expensive than its rivals. Standard features include a 6-speed manual transmission, rearview camera, automatic headlights, LED taillights, a 5-inch audio-display screen, cruise control, remote keyless entry, power windows and locks, and one-touch up/down driver’s window. Also standard are air conditioning, the Magic Seat, audio controls on the steering wheel, a trip computer, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth, and a 160-watt AM/FM/CD/MP3 sound system with a USB port and auxiliary audio input jack. Safety features include side-curtain airbags, and electronic traction and stability control.</p>, <p>Honda’s advanced active safety systems including Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Keep Assist are available on the LX and Sport. Step up to the Honda Fit EX and they’re standard, along with 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, fog lights, push-button ignition, paddle shifters if you choose the CVT, a 7-inch touch screen, and a sunroof. It also gets Honda's clever Lane Watch camera; push a button or activate the right-turn signal, and you get an unobstructed view of the right side of the car on the infotainment display. The Fit EX-L model adds leather, heated front seats and available navigation.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Honda Fit is powered by a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder with 130 horsepower. The engine makes good noises and likes to rev to its 6,700-rpm redline. It’s one of the reasons the Fit is sportier than many of its competitors. The 4-cylinder uses Honda's i-VTEC and Variable Timing Control (VTC), which makes more power at high engine speeds for best acceleration, but at low speeds, like when you're cruising down the highway, it retunes itself for better fuel economy. And fuel economy is excellent, with a CVT-equipped LX getting up to 40 mpg on the highway. The engine powers the hatchback’s front wheels through either a slick 6-speed manual or a smooth continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), which is standard on the EX-L trim.<br>

The new Fit Sport starts around $18,500, while the EX with the manual starts around $19,000. Add $800 more if you want an automatic in a Fit LX, Sport or EX and $1,000 for Honda Sensing. The automatic-only Fit EX-L starts at just over $21,000; add $1,000 if you want navigation. Those prices come in higher than many of its competitors, but the Fit also starts off with more standard equipment so it's competitive with the Ford Fiesta, Toyota Yaris and Kia Rio. Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what consumers in your area paid for their Fit. No matter what, it’ll be money well spent, as the Fit historically trounces its competitors in resale value.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/honda/hr-v/2018
[<p>If we could assign a slogan to the 2018 Honda HR-V subcompact-crossover SUV, it would have to be “smaller is better.” Comparable in size to the original <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, the HR-V displays Honda’s talent for packaging a lot of vehicle into a very compact space. Case in point, the HR-V’s flip-up Magic Seat that allows tall or bulky items to be easily stowed behind the front seats. In fact, the HR-V provides more interior room than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/juke/">Nissan Juke</a>, and delivers better fuel economy than either the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/trax/">Chevrolet Trax</a>. HR-V buyers can choose between front-wheel or all-wheel drive and a choice of manual or automatic transmissions, although the lack of a collision-avoidance system seems a glaring omission.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a vehicle with more interior room, ground clearance and all-weather capability than a traditional <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small car</a>, the 2018 Honda HR-V subcompact SUV has you covered. A low price and great fuel economy serve to sweeten the deal, as does the option of a manual transmission.</p>, <p>Those planning off-road adventures might be better off in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> or Jeep Renegade, while those seeking a more powerful ride should check out the Nissan Juke. And while adaptive cruise control and pre-collision warning come standard on the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/c-hr/">Toyota C-HR</a>, the 2018 Honda HR-V doesn’t even offer them.</p>, <p>For 2018, the subcompact <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a> gains a new color this year, Aegean Blue Metallic, plus new wheel designs for the EX and higher trims.</p>, <p>Honda’s 2018 HR-V subcompact-crossover SUV isn’t fast by any means, but it is fun to drive. The HR-V’s 141-horsepower 1.8-liter engine has no problem delivering acceptable levels of acceleration and passing power for the 2,900-pound SUV, but a few more ponies would be nice. Delivering its peak power around 6,500 rpm, the HR-V’s engine can get rather loud when laying on the gas, and you’ll find yourself laying on the gas quite often. Honda’s slick 6-speed manual is the preferred choice for enthusiast drivers, but it’s not offered on models equipped with all-wheel drive. In all likelihood, the vast majority of HR-Vs will come with Honda’s excellent CVT automatic that features a Sport mode for faster response times. We found the HR-V’s nicely weighted steering and stiff suspension make it a blast to push through twisting curves, yet the overall ride is comfortable without feeling too soft.</p>, <p>INTERIOR FLEXIBILITY<br/> With nearly 60 cubic feet inside, the 2018 Honda HR-V is one of the roomiest and most accommodating subcompact <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> on the market. The Magic Seat rear-seat cushions flip up to create more cargo space behind the front seats, while the flat-folding front-passenger seat creates a longer cargo floor.<br/> <br/> <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">HONDA</a> LANEWATCH<br/> Using a camera built into the passenger-side mirror, the 2018 Honda HR-V displays a live video of vehicles approaching on the right side when the right-turn signal is activated. The system reveals an area four times greater than the passenger-side mirror alone.<br/> </p>, <p>Honda’s 2018 HR-V features quality materials and an upscale layout. Tan leather seating is available in top-line versions, and all models have an LCD interface in the center dash for infotainment. Base LX models have easy-to-use audio and climate systems with traditional buttons and knobs, while EX and EX-L models have touch-based systems. The latter systems look sophisticated, but their touch controls can be frustrating, especially when you have to take your eyes off the road. The front-passenger seat can be folded back to form the HR-V's "Long Mode." In this setup, Honda's smallest SUV can carry items like surfboards or lumber.</p>, <p>The HR-V doesn't look like a lifted car or a shrunken CR-V. In size and shape, Honda's newest <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV again splits the difference. Honda's diminutive hauler is most its own when viewed from the side, where it sports a coupe-like profile thanks to a sloping roof, a rear-window treatment that slopes further still, and rear-door handles that sit flush where the window forms its arrow. All HR-Vs ride on 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and EX and EX-L models include a power moonroof. Roof rails, standard on the EX-L, add versatility and rugged appeal.</p>, <p>Spend the least on a base Honda HR-V LX for 2018 and you'll still get features like a rearview camera, cruise control and Honda's Bluetooth HandsFreeLink system. Audio is via a 4-speaker/160-watt AM/FM/CD system with USB/auxiliary inputs and 5-inch color display. If you can swing the extra cost, the EX feels like a significant step up with its inclusion of Honda's helpful LaneWatch side-view monitor, power moonroof, heated front seats, push-button start and SMS text-message functioning. The HR-V EX also gets an upgraded 180-watt/6-speaker audio system with a larger 7-inch touch screen and touch-sensitive climate system.</p>, <p>Major options for the 2018 Honda HR-V are had by climbing trims, and the big kahuna here is the EX-L Navi model. That "L" is indicative of this little crossover SUV's leather interior, and Navi is short for its included navigation system. This top-of-line HR-V also comes with an automatic transmission (optional on other models), SiriusXM satellite and HD Radio, and paddle shifters with Sport mode. Honda's Real-Time AWD all-wheel-drive system is available on any model with an automatic transmission. Accessories for the HR-V include front and rear skidplate garnishes for a tougher look, and attachments to carry skis, snowboards or bikes.</p>, <p>The 2018 HR-V is powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 141 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, similar figures to the engine used in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>. The HR-V uses either a crisp-shifting 6-speed manual transmission or a refined CVT automatic. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is its native setup, and the only layout you can have with a manual transmission. All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on automatic-transmission models. Like most unibody, car-based crossover SUVs, the HR-V isn't meant for serious off-roading, but AWD can help it maintain traction in snow or on dusty trails. At up to 34 mpg, the HR-V is among the most fuel-efficient SUVs available. Furthermore, the HR-V sips good ol' regular unleaded.<br/> <b><br/> </b>1.8-liter inline-4<br/> 141 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm<br/> 127 lb-ft of torque @ 4,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/33 mpg (manual), 28/34 mpg (FWD, automatic), 27/31 mpg (AWD, automatic)</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda HR-V carries a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $20,500 for a base model. At the top end, an EX-L with navigation and AWD can reach the $27,000 range. At these prices, Honda's newest family member slightly undercuts the Chevrolet Trax, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500x/">Fiat 500X</a> and Nissan Juke, is in line with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mitsubishi/outlander%20sport/">Mitsubishi Outlander Sport</a>, and slightly above the starting price of a comparably equipped Jeep Renegade. While not necessarily an SUV, the funky and versatile <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/soul/">Kia Soul</a> remains the bargain among small, city-centric haulers with its starting price of just over $16,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new HR-V. We expect the 2018 Honda HR-V to hold better resale values than the Fiat 500X, Jeep Renegade and Chevrolet Trax, but to be on par with the Mazda CX-3.</p>]

[<p>Even in its seventh model year the outgoing <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/odyssey/">Honda Odyssey</a> remained a top pick in the segment. And now that it’s been completely redesigned, Honda’s <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a> is once again the very best minivan money can buy. It’s enjoyably easy to drive, nicely appointed inside, and boasts a long list of clever new features and tech that take family transportation to a new level. The best minivan on the road? Let’s call it the best family car ever.</p>, <p>Do you tend to seek out the <a alt_o_t="Best Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/awards-best-cars-and-top-10-lists/2000006743/">best car</a> in a segment, or are you typically drawn to what’s new? Do you lean toward the most practical or the tech-savviest? Whatever your nature, you’re going to like the 2018 Honda Odyssey.</p>, <p>If you want an all-wheel-drive minivan, you’ll have to go with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sienna/">Toyota Sienna</a>. If you want a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> minivan, you’ll have to choose the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chrysler/pacifica%20hybrid/">Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid</a> (a plug-in hybrid, no less). Otherwise you’ll want to do plenty of research before deciding the new Odyssey isn’t the right minivan for you.</p>, <p>The Honda Odyssey has been completely redesigned for 2018.</p>, <p>Good steering and pedal feel aren’t must-haves for many minivan shoppers, but responsive manners improve the day-to-day driving experience of any vehicle. And they help make the 2018 Honda Odyssey the best-driving minivan we’ve ever driven. The all-new Odyssey is smooth off the line and glides through gears. On city streets and in parking lots it changes direction with the ease and willingness of a smaller vehicle, and stops in the same manner. On the highway it is quiet, comfortable and confidently controlled. Granted, we’ve only driven the top-line Odyssey Elite with its all-new 10-speed transmission, but versions with the 9-speed (the same transmission found in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, among others) shouldn’t give up too much in the way of smart, silky power management.</p>, <p>MAGIC SLIDE SEATS<br>
 The Odyssey’s new Magic Slide seating system features outboard 2nd-row seats that move up and back and side to side. Two friends can sit shoulder to shoulder without either having to sit on the middle hump, seats can slide to either side, or mom can bring baby within easier reach.<br>
<br>
 HONDAVAC<br>
 Minivans and vacuum cleaners are both about as far from sexy as it gets, but put them together and you have one of the coolest car features on the planet. With the Odyssey’s built-in vacuum you can clean up spilled Goldfish crackers or accumulated debris whenever and wherever the need arises.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Odyssey’s cavernous cabin isn’t just packed with practicality-enhancing features and technologies, it boasts a degree of fit and finish that transcends the typical soccer shuttle. All the requisite cup holders and cubbies are in place, but so are high-quality materials and smart, pleasing design. Featuring a digital gauge cluster and a big 8-inch touch screen that’s standard on all but the entry-level LX trim, the Odyssey’s digitally enhanced forward panel makes Honda’s minivan look and feel more like what we were hoping to be driving in 2018.</p>, <p>The 5th-generation Odyssey has a lighter look than the outgoing model, and we suspect it will prove a bit less polarizing without the previous model’s distinctive “lightning-bolt” design element. The top-line Odyssey Elite boasts 19-inch alloy wheels, power-folding exterior mirrors, LED headlights and more, while even the base LX model gets 18-inch alloy wheels, multi-reflector halogen headlights and rear privacy glass.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Odyssey lineup starts at $30,930 (including destination) with the 7-passenger Odyssey LX. But <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a> says the LX will account for less than five percent of sales, and we’d steer you toward the $34,800 Odyssey EX that includes many more safety and convenience features. In addition to the Bluetooth and USB phone connectivity, push-button start and rearview camera found on the LX, the EX features room for eight, Magic Slide 2nd-row seats, 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system, the Honda Sensing suite of driver-assist and safety technologies, power sliding doors, remote-sensing keyless entry and heated front seats.</p>, <p>Stepping up to Odyssey EX-L (for Leather) will reward you with a power tailgate, moonroof and leather seats, while the EX-L with Navigation and Rear Entertainment adds, er, navigation and rear entertainment, plus the neat new CabinTalk interior PA system. The Odyssey Touring nets you the brilliant new 10-speed automatic transmission, hands-free tailgate, built-in 4G LTE wireless capability, clever new CabinWatch interior camera, the always popular -- and useful -- HondaVac built-in vacuum cleaner and more. For $47,610, the 2018 Honda Odyssey Elite adds a 550-watt, 11-speaker audio system, wireless phone charging and ventilated front seats, among other upgrades.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Honda Odyssey is powered by the same 280-horsepower V6 engine, and most manage that power with the help of a new-to-Odyssey 9-speed automatic transmission. Touring and Elite trims, however, offer a smart and smooth new 10-speed automatic transmission. In addition to improved drivability, the 10-speed auto bumps towing capacity from 3,000 pounds in the 9-speed models to 3,500 pounds in the Touring and Elite trims.<br>
  <br>
 3.5-liter V6<br>
 280 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 262 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway/combined fuel economy: 19/28/22 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The base 2018 Honda Odyssey has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price of $30,930 including destination, and climbs to $47,610 for all the bells and whistles of the Odyssey Elite. As the new version of a historically popular model, we don’t expect Honda to offer significant discounts for quite a while. But thanks to historically strong resale values and class-leading features and qualities, even at full sticker price the new Odyssey would be a terrific value. As always, be sure to check the Odyssey’s Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price before signing on any dotted lines.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Honda Pilot remains a formidable 3-row <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, but competition both domestically and abroad is giving Honda’s full-size family hauler a run for its money. The Pilot’s recent restyling already looks a bit tame when compared to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/pathfinder/">Nissan Pathfinder</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-9/">Mazda CX-9</a>, and those more concerned with maximum interior room will find more to like in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevrolet Traverse</a>. The 8-passenger Pilot has remained current with the latest driver-safety-assist features including adaptive cruise control and crash-detection and -mitigation systems, but its infotainment system isn’t as user-friendly as those found on GM, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/dodge/">Dodge</a> brands. The Pilot is also primarily an on-road SUV, with a comfortable ride, agile handling and respectable highway fuel economy, but no off-road chops.</p>, <p>If you need room for a growing family in a vehicle as worry-free as possible, the 8-passenger 2018 Honda Pilot is as good a bet as any. With handsome styling, excellent driving characteristics and proven V6, the Pilot can tackle almost any challenge.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a 3-row SUV with massive cargo space, a tow rating greater than 5,000 pounds or <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> fuel economy, there are better choices than the Pilot. Budget-conscious buyers will note Toyota’s base Highlander LE comes standard with advanced driver-safety systems unavailable on the entry-level Pilot LX.</p>, <p>There are no major changes to the 2018 Honda Pilot.</p>, <p>It only takes a few minutes behind the Pilot’s wheel to understand just how good this big SUV has become. From its comfortable ride to its responsive steering to its ability to run through tight curves with surprising agility, the Pilot never falters. Despite its size, the 2018 Honda Pilot feels nimble and easily maneuverable, the latter trait amplified by the Pilot’s tight turning radius. Sure, the Mazda CX-9 is probably a better-handling SUV, but it seats only seven and offers only a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. For our tastes, the ample low-end torque and powerful pulling power of the Pilot’s 280-horsepower V6 is more fitting for this type of vehicle. Inside, the Pilot features wide, comfortable front seats, logically arranged switchgear and instrumentation and commendably low levels of wind and tire noise. The cabin’s styling is a bit austere compared to new competitors, but it’s not unattractive by any measure.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">HONDA</a> SENSING<br/> Honda’s suite of driver-safety assists includes lane-keeping assist, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, collision-mitigation and braking and road-departure mitigation. They’re all part of the Honda Sensing system that is optional on EX trims and standard on Touring and Elite.<br/> <br/> UNDER-FLOOR STORAGE<br/> Storage space is always at a premium in an SUV filled with kids, pets and luggage, which is why we think you’ll appreciate the hidden cargo hold behind the Pilot’s 3rd-row seat. Adding about three cubic feet of storage with the seat up, the space includes a reversible carpeted cargo cover that can be stored at the bottom of the well when not in use.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Pilot interior boasts soft-touch surfaces on the dash and doors, which combine with on-road quiet and comfortable seats for a sophisticated feel. The comfort combines with practicality with a generous cargo area, and a huge center console bin with plenty of storage space. Thankfully, Honda has upgraded its navigation system for one from Garmin, although not everyone will like the cartoonish colors. The 2nd-row seats are comfortable, and the one-touch folding mechanism borrowed from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> eases 3rd-row access. We also like the multiple USB ports (up to five), and the available HD rear-entertainment system.</p>, <p>For 2018 the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a> shuns the first two generations’ boxy styling in favor of sleek lines that are clearly designed to evoke a family resemblance to the smaller CR-V and HR-V. While it no longer stands out in a parking lot, the current Pilot SUV looks better overall. We particularly like the LED accents in the headlights, and a taillight design that reflects the same pattern. However, some may find the cargo floor is a couple inches higher than need be, while others will lament that the glass on the rear hatch no longer opens independently of the hatch itself.</p>, <p>The basic front-wheel-drive (FWD) 2018 Honda Pilot LX comes standard with a multi-angle rearview camera and a tire-pressure-monitoring system that flashes the lights when you've filled a tire to its proper pressure. Cruise control, audio and phone controls are all located on the steering wheel, and all Pilots come with Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch information screen between the gauges, push-button start, and an Eco mode to help fuel economy. Still, it's worth upgrading to at least the EX model, which adds Intelligent Traction Management system, an upgraded audio system that includes HondaLink, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Honda's clever LaneWatch right-side-view camera.</p>, <p>The 2018 Honda Pilot breaks most of its options into different trim levels. For example, if you want things like dynamic guidelines on your rearview camera, you'll have to step up to the EX model. If you want leather, you're in EX-L territory. The 9-speed automatic is standard once you get to Touring and Elite models. All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on all models, except for the Elite, where it's standard. Also available on all new Honda Pilot models (besides the LX) is the Honda Sensing suite of collision and road-departure mitigation and warning, lane-departure warning, active cruise and lane-keeping assist.</p>, <p>There's only one engine available for the 2018 Honda Pilot: a 3.5-liter V6 putting out 280 horsepower. This engine is offered with either a 6-speed automatic or, in Touring and Elite models, a 9-speed automatic. We were impressed by the 9-speed transmission’s operation, particularly because this ZF-supplied transmission has received mixed reviews in other manufacturers’ cars. All models offer AWD, and the sophisticated system is standard on Elite models. Interestingly, a traction-management system that optimizes the AWD and FWD function for snow, mud or other surfaces is standard on all but LX models. The engine offers an Eco mode that shuts off half the cylinders under light throttle to help improve fuel economy.<br>
<br>
 3.5-liter V6<br>
 280 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 262 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/27 mpg (6-speed automatic, FWD), 18/26 mpg (6-speed automatic, AWD), 20/27 mpg (9-speed automatic, FWD), 19/26 mpg (9-speed automatic, AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p style="text-align: center;">A base FWD 2018 Pilot LX carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just under $32,000 including destination charge. The much nicer EX and EX-L grades start a few thousand higher, at $34,305 and $37,735, respectively. Touring models start at $44,845. Adding the Honda Sensing system to any model increases the cost by a $1,000. Add $1,800 if you want AWD. The top-line 2018 Honda Pilot Elite model tops out at about $48,445.

[<p>The 2018 Honda Ridgeline targets truck buyers who need to haul, sometimes tow, but don't want to give up the refinement they've grown accustomed to in their SUV. The specs work in the Ridgeline's favor, with 1,500 pounds of payload capacity and 5,000 pounds of towing ability, along with available all-wheel drive. But it goes a step further than traditional midsize pickups like the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier, with clever features like the In-Bed Trunk, and luxurious and tech-savvy interior refinements. It also looks worlds better than the original Ridgeline. Fine, those competitors offer models with better towing or off-road ability, but for light-duty truck owners, the Ridgeline makes a compelling alternative.</p>, <p>If you need a vehicle with a truck bed, but don't want to drive something that, well, drives like a truck, then the 2018 Honda Ridgeline should be on your list. Its interior is far more refined than other midsize trucks, it offers excellent payload capacity, and it drives like an SUV.</p>, <p>Unlike traditional trucks, there's only one cab, one bed length, one engine and not a lot of variability. If you're looking for true 4-wheel-drive capability, want a diesel engine for towing big loads, or something with a lower bed for easier access, a traditional truck may be a better choice.</p>, <p>Since it was completely redesigned last year, changes to the 2018 Honda Ridgeline are limited to new available colors on the Sport model.</p>, <p>Based on a version of Honda's Global Light Truck platform that underpins the Honda Pilot, the Ridgeline offers a lot of the same ride quality and comfort of that flagship SUV. The accurate steering, cornering ability and interior quiet are all right in line with the best crossover SUVs. Ride comfort is a key advantage, as the independent rear suspension means there's none of the "bed hop" one gets in a traditional truck with its solid rear axle. Since the Ridgeline is lighter than the Pilot, the 280-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine makes for brisk acceleration. If you don't plan on off-road excursions the front-wheel-drive model should serve you well and offers better fuel economy. Alternatively, Intelligent Traction Management system on all-wheel-drive models offers various driving modes to help tackle difficult terrain like sand and mud, making the Ridgeline more capable off-road than you might think.</p>, <p>TAILGATE PARTY!<br>
 The Ridgeline's In-Bed Trunk comes with a drain, meaning it's also an In-Bed Cooler. Combine that with the 2-way tailgate that either flips down or swings open, in-bed audio, and a 2-pronged AC outlet in the bed, and the Ridgeline is a tailgate party looking for a place to happen.<br>
<br>
 INTELLIGENT TRACTION MANAGEMENT<br>
 Honda's Intelligent Traction Management lets Ridgeline drivers customize the truck's power and traction systems to different kinds of terrain. With the push of a button the Ridgeline is ready to tackle snow, mud and sand, adjusting the throttle, transmission, torque distribution and more to best suit the conditions.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>It's easy to mistake the 2018 Ridgeline interior for the Honda Pilot, and that's a good thing. The dash design is essentially the same as the Pilot, featuring the same climate control, infotainment system, gauges, buttons, switches, and so on. It boasts Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, heated seats and a generously sized storage bin between the front seats. It's also quiet and refined, offering up comfortable seating for all five passengers. In back, the rear seats flip up for extra cargo space, opening up enough room for a bicycle or a 55-inch flat-screen TV.</p>, <p>More advanced construction techniques have let Honda remove the odd buttress-like structure from the previous Ridgeline's bed, giving it a more traditionally truck-like appearance, and significantly improving the aesthetics. By removing the odd-styling talking point, it allows us to appreciate things like the In-Bed Trunk, the standard composite bed, and the 2-way tailgate without distraction. The tailgate is particularly clever, either folding down like a traditional gate, or opening to the side to make it easier to access that in-bed trunk. One styling note: The seam between the bed and the cab is purely for show, since the two are actually connected.</p>, <p>The base Honda Ridgeline RT's list of standard equipment reads more like an SUV. There's the drivetrain, of course, a 3.5-liter V6 connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. But there's also active noise cancellation, hill-start assist, a rearview camera, power windows with (front) auto-up/down, push-button start, cruise control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, air conditioning with filtration, and a 200-watt audio system with Bluetooth for phone and music streaming, a USB port and a subwoofer. On the truck end of things are the useful dual-action tailgate, eight tie-down cleats, truck bed lights, an in-bed trunk, and Intelligent Traction Management.</p>, <p>Every Ridgeline model except the base RT can be ordered with all-wheel drive, and it's standard on RTL-E and Black Edition models. Beyond that, Honda tends to group equipment by model, rather than as stand-alone packages. Leather is available on RTL models, as is an acoustic windshield. RTL-T models add Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but it's the RTL-E and Black Edition that are most lavishly equipped, with navigation, truck-bed audio, a 400-watt truck-bed outlet, and the Honda Sensing suite of active-safety features that adds collision-mitigation braking, active cruise control, blind-spot assist, road-departure mitigation, forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist.</p>, <p>The only drivetrain choice you have with the 2018 Honda Ridgeline is whether you want front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD). That's because each Ridgeline comes with the same 3.5-liter V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. The V6 features direct injection and cylinder deactivation to improve fuel efficiency. FWD is standard on everything but the RTL-E and Black Edition, which get AWD as standard. AWD is available on all models except the base truck. Opt for FWD and you get very good fuel economy -- 19-mpg city, 26 highway -- but your towing capacity gets limited to 3,500 pounds. All-wheel drive docks the new Ridgeline's fuel economy by one mpg -- to 18-mpg city and 25 on the highway -- but towing capacity goes up to 5,000 pounds.<br>

 262 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/26 mpg (FWD), 18/25 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The base-model 2018 Honda Ridgeline RT has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just under $30,600. A Sport starts at a little more than $34,100, and add $1,900 if you want all-wheel drive with that. On the other end of the spectrum is the Black Edition, which starts at just over $44,000 and includes all-wheel drive. If you want pure truck stuff, the RTL offers the basics plus leather, and with all-wheel drive it's just under $36,800. However, for V6 crew-cab competitors, it's right in the ballpark: The Chevrolet Colorado ranges from $27,000-$38,000, the Toyota Tacoma ranges from about $30,000-$39,000, and the GMC Canyon from $28,000-$44,000. Be sure to check the KBB Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their Ridgeline before buying yours, knowing that with resale prices in line with the benchmark Toyota Tacoma, the Ridgeline makes a good investment.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Accent is Hyundai’s least expensive car, a subcompact that competes with rivals like the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic. The Hyundai Accent is all-new for 2018, and for its 5th-generation revamp gains upscale looks, key technology like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, more safety features and slightly improved fuel economy. What it loses is the availability of a hatchback model, as this new Accent is offered only as a sedan. Like its cousin the Kia Rio, the Hyundai Accent boasts an exceptional warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. As with other economy cars, the Accent is best suited for in-town duties, making it a great choice for students and others on a budget and with shorter commutes.</p>, <p>If you want a small, fuel-efficient sedan with an excellent warranty and stylish looks that belie its roughly $16,000 starting price, the 2018 Hyundai Accent checks the right boxes. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, standard in the two higher trims, will appeal to just about anyone with a smartphone.</p>, <p>If you want a more versatile hatchback instead of a sedan, you’ll have to step up a class to the Hyundai Elantra GT, or go with a subcompact hatch like the Kia Rio, Honda Fit, Nissan Versa Note or another rival. The Accent offers automatic emergency braking, but only on the top trim, while the Toyota Yaris has it standard.</p>, <p>The Accent is all-new for 2018. Available only as a subcompact sedan, it brings the stylish and upscale looks of its larger siblings, and now offers more efficiency, automatic emergency braking, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.</p>, <p>The new Hyundai Accent certainly shares the nicely dressed style of its Elantra and Sonata sedan siblings, but not quite their ride quality. This is a reality of cars in this subcompact class. Like others in this segment, the 2018 Accent has a short wheelbase and smaller dimensions, and is powered by an engine that favors fuel efficiency over gusto. As such, the Accent is more than adequate for in-town driving. It’s best for shorter commutes and easily slotting into parking spots where larger vehicles would be squeezed. On the open highway, the Accent can hold its own, but the engine tends to drone when pushed, and the ride quality isn’t as supple at higher speeds as that of a larger car, though neither is it jittery unless pushed past legal limits. The rear suspension, though still a basic torsion beam, has been reworked for smoothness. Likewise, the 6-speed automatic transmission goes about its business with certainty and is eager to kick down when needed. There’s a button to engage Sport mode, but even when activated can’t magically make the Accent dynamic.</p>, <p>ANDROID AUTO AND APPLE CARPLAY<br/> These two smartphone systems are quickly moving from “nice to have” to “must have” in cars, and once you experience their seamless integration it’s hard to go back. While other automakers are still implementing them even in larger and more expensive models, Hyundai makes it readily available in its least expensive car.<br/> <br/> AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING<br/> Here’s another system becoming more common in cars, and it has the ability to prevent accidents and even save lives. Through the use of radar, it can warn a driver if a collision appears likely. If the driver doesn’t take action, the car can ultimately apply the brakes to lessen or prevent a collision.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Accent’s 5-passenger cabin is nicely laid out and, like its exterior, appears nicer than its price implies. It’s not until you start sitting in the seats and feeling the material that you’ll realize this is still a value-oriented car. There is plenty of hard plastic, and if we had a couple of requests it would be for more bolstering of the front seats and an armrest for rear passengers. Those nits aside, we appreciate the central touch screen that controls audio and phone functions, and the easy-to-reach dials for climate. We suggest skipping the base SE model for several reasons, among them that the steering wheel only tilts on that model and doesn’t telescope like it does in the SEL and Limited variants. Not surprisingly, rear legroom is at a premium. At 13.7 cubic feet, trunk capacity is better than expected, and the rear seats fold in a 60/40-split for added cargo-carrying versatility.</p>, <p>Here’s one of the best parts of Hyundai’s new Accent. Look at that large (but not obtrusive) grille, crisp lines and taut metal. If this were solely a beauty contest, we think the Accent is at the top of the class. As we mentioned, this all-new Accent is only available as a sedan, and not with a hatchback variant as before. By default, the Accent is longer than hatch-only rivals like the Honda Fit. Opt for the top-line Limited trim, and you’ll get an even more dapper-looking Accent that has turn signals integrated into the side mirrors, chrome grille surround and door handles, and 17-inch alloy wheels. The Limited model also features a hands-free trunk that automatically unlatches if you approach with the key.</p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Accent is offered in three trims: SE, SEL and Limited. Other than an automatic transmission on base SE models, there are no major options or packages. This makes it blessedly simple for choosing the right Accent for you: Just look at what each has and determine if that’s what you want and can afford. The least expensive Accent includes the basics like air conditioning, power windows and door locks, plus cruise control and a rearview camera. Its infotainment system features a 5-inch touch screen and a 4-speaker AM/FM radio with Bluetooth connectivity and USB/auxiliary ports. Like all new Hyundais, the Accent has an excellent warranty: a 5-year/60,000-mile transferable new-vehicle warranty, plus a powertrain that’s guaranteed for 10 years or 100,000 miles.</p>, <p>Unless your budget has you tied to the base model or you really want a manual transmission, we suggest skipping the Accent SE and stepping up to the SEL or Limited. Mid-trim SEL models gain important features like an upgraded 7-inch infotainment system with CarPlay/Android Auto and voice recognition, rear disc brakes, automatic headlights, alloy wheels, heated side mirrors, and a steering wheel that tilts and telescopes. The top-line Accent Limited adds a sunroof, LED daytime running lights and taillights, automatic climate control, heated front seats, proximity key with push-button start, and leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. If you want the forward-collision warning system with automatic braking, the Limited trim is the only way to get it. The Limited model is also the only trim to offer the Blue Link smartphone-enabled connected-services system (3-year subscription is standard).</p>, <p>All 2018 Hyundai Accents use a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine. For this latest generation, it makes slightly less power than that of the outgoing model, but conversely is slightly more efficient. Base SE models use a 6-speed manual transmission. Most buyers, however, will opt for the 6-speed automatic that is optional on SE trims and standard on the SEL and Limited.<br>

 119 lb-ft of torque @ 4,850 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 28/37 mpg (manual), 28/38 mpg (automatic)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $15,880 including destination, the 2018 Accent is Hyundai’s least expensive vehicle. In reality, expect to pay at least $1,000 more, as you’ll probably want an automatic transmission. Most buyers will want to step up to the SEL or Limited model, with prices of $18,180 and $19,780, respectively. In an age where the average new car retails for well over $30,000, the Accent’s price remains on the very desirable end of the spectrum. Even among rivals, the Accent is still quite a value. Rivals like the Toyota Yaris and Chevy Sonic begin near the same price, while the Honda Fit hatchback has a higher starting price. The Accent’s cousin, the Kia Rio, starts a little lower but is less well-equipped in base trim. The same holds for the Nissan Versa sedan, which still claims the spot of the least expensive new car. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Hyundai Accent’s resale value has traditionally trailed leaders like the Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris iA.</p>]

[<p>Hyundai’s 6th-generation Elantra compact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> and hatchback add more available safety and technology features for 2018, continuing its move to conquest best-selling rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/sentra/">Nissan Sentra</a>. The Elantra boasts stylish looks, premium amenities and a class-leading warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. The standard 2018 Hyundai Elantra continues with a blend of refinement, eager driving manners, and efficiency. The Eco sedan achieves noticeable fuel economy of EPA ratings of 35 mpg combined, outfitted with a compact 1.4-liter turbocharged engine. At the other end of the spectrum, the Elantra Sport model, outfitted with a 201 horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder, puts a bit more zip into driving, as does the new Elantra GT which adds the driving dynamics and features of a compact hatchback.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a stylish, value-oriented <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">compact car</a> with an excellent warranty, you'll find it in the Elantra. The 2018 Elantra covers buyer’s needs from value sedan to <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> features and sporty attributes to hatchback versatility.</p>, <p>The Elantra can't match the roominess or <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> of a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, nor can it match the pure, fun-to-drive feel of a Mazda3.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/elantra/">Hyundai Elantra</a> saw a redesign for 2017, yet sees added features to keep it contemporary for 2018. The SEL Elantra receives popular equipment which includes Blind Spot Detection with Rear Cross-traffic Alert and Lane Change Assist, a 7-inch in-dash display, and heated outside mirrors. The Eco model concentrates on value and efficiency, while the Sport and GT hatchback models aim at active and enthusiast drivers.</p>, <p>The 2018 Elantra impresses, blending comfort, efficiency and even some sportiness. The standard Elantra's new 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine feels peppier than its 147 horsepower indicates, and its available 6-speed automatic transmission with Drive Mode Select is a willing partner. Whether romping around mountain 2-lanes enjoying the Sport mode's responsive steering and sportier shift patterns, or darting through city avenues where Normal mode provides smooth shifts and throttle response, we were impressed with Elantra. For Green Party members, the Elantra Eco's gas-sipping 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder achieves a combined city/highway EPA figure of 35 mpg. And for party animals, the Elantra Sport rocks a 1.6-liter turbo delivering 201 horsepower and mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While the Elantra sedan and GT hatchback continue to use a torsion beam rear suspension the Elantra Sport and GT Sport models raise the sport coefficient thanks in part to a multi-link rear suspension.</p>, <p>POWER TRUNK, WITH A TRICK<br>
 The 2018 Elantra offers a power-operated trunk, a feature made even more convenient thanks to its hands-free operation. With the key fob in your pocket or purse, all you have to do is walk behind the car, wait a few seconds, and the trunk will open.<br>
<br>
 DUAL-CLUTCH TRANSMISSION<br>
 With the Elantra Sport and GT Sport offering a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, it injects a whole new driving dynamic to the Elantra lineup. And on the gas-saving side of the ledger, the Elantra Eco model uses that dual-clutch transmission for improved fuel economy.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> is proud to point out that the Elantra's interior is a size higher than its class. So while this is a compact car, its 110.2 cubic feet of interior room qualifies it as a midsize vehicle, according to the EPA. It may not be quite as roomy as the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, but it's still a testament to modern engineering that no longer means a small car has to be a "penalty box." We especially appreciate the driver-centric dash layout, and the fact that controls for audio, climate and the like are actually buttons and knobs vs. multi-step touch-based systems.</p>, <p>Hyundai's emphasis on design is just as important as its fantastic warranty. The Elantra looks more sophisticated than its price tag suggests. It's not gaudy, either, though we admit the large hexagonal grille is borderline gaping. The Elantra further stands out with an athletic stance, front-wheel air curtains, and an integrated rear spoiler built into the trunk lid. The Elantra feels larger from the passenger compartment, yet is easy to navigate in tight spaces at just 179.9 inches long and 70.9 inches wide.</p>, <p>Even the most basic 2018 Elantra includes air conditioning, power windows and door locks, a 6-way driver's seat with height adjustment, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and AM/FM/CD audio with USB and auxiliary jacks. For 2018, the Elantra SE with the Popular Equipment package is replaced by the SEL model, which includes a 7-inch touch-screen display, backup camera, Bluetooth, cruise control, hood insulation for a quieter ride, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. All new Elantras come with a generous 10-year/100,000-mile warranty for the powertrain and five years of roadside assistance.</p>, <p>Aside from the automatic transmission ($1,000), most major options for the 2018 Elantra are bundled into packages. When you select the high-line Limited trim, your Elantra includes a leather interior, power driver's seat with lumbar support, hands-free power trunk, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, and push-button start. Adding the Tech package to that trim includes navigation with an 8-inch screen, Infinity audio, heated rear seats, and a power sunroof. The 2018 Elantra Value Edition adds plenty of up-level features for about 21 grand. The list includes hands-free trunk release, heated front seats, outside door handle approach lights, and dual-zone automatic temperature control. Go for the Ultimate package, and you'll get automatic emergency braking, smart cruise control, lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist, the driver's seat memory system and high-intensity headlights that turn in the direction of the steering.</p>, <p>The 2018 Elantra offers a choice of 4-cylinder engines. The standard powerplant is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. In the Elantra SE and Elantra GT, that engine is mated to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, while the SEL, Limited and Value Edition models all come exclusively with the automatic. The 2018 Elantra Sport and Elantra GT Sport are equipped with a more powerful 1.6-liter turbo engine and the choice of a standard 6-speed manual or optional 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The frugal might look toward the Eco model offering a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine with a 7-speed automatic transmission, and achieves an estimated 40 mpg.<br>

The Eco model concentrates on value and efficiency, while the Sport and GT hatchback models aim at active and enthusiast drivers.</p>, <p>The 2018 Elantra impresses, blending comfort, efficiency and even some sportiness. The standard Elantra's new 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine feels peppier than its 147 horsepower indicates, and its available 6-speed automatic transmission with Drive Mode Select is a willing partner. Whether romping around mountain 2-lanes enjoying the Sport mode's responsive steering and sportier shift patterns, or darting through city avenues where Normal mode provides smooth shifts and throttle response, we were impressed with Elantra. For Green Party members, the Elantra Eco's gas-sipping 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder achieves a combined city/highway EPA figure of 35 mpg. And for party animals, the Elantra Sport rocks a 1.6-liter turbo delivering 201 horsepower and mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While the Elantra sedan and GT hatchback continue to use a torsion beam rear suspension the Elantra Sport and GT Sport models raise the sport coefficient thanks in part to a multi-link rear suspension.</p>, <p>POWER TRUNK, WITH A TRICK<br>
 The 2018 Elantra offers a power-operated trunk, a feature made even more convenient thanks to its hands-free operation. With the key fob in your pocket or purse, all you have to do is walk behind the car, wait a few seconds, and the trunk will open.<br>
<br>
 DUAL-CLUTCH TRANSMISSION<br>
 With the Elantra Sport and GT Sport offering a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, it injects a whole new driving dynamic to the Elantra lineup. And on the gas-saving side of the ledger, the Elantra Eco model uses that dual-clutch transmission for improved fuel economy.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> is proud to point out that the Elantra's interior is a size higher than its class. So while this is a compact car, its 110.2 cubic feet of interior room qualifies it as a midsize vehicle, according to the EPA. It may not be quite as roomy as the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, but it's still a testament to modern engineering that no longer means a small car has to be a "penalty box." We especially appreciate the driver-centric dash layout, and the fact that controls for audio, climate and the like are actually buttons and knobs vs. multi-step touch-based systems.</p>, <p>Hyundai's emphasis on design is just as important as its fantastic warranty. The Elantra looks more sophisticated than its price tag suggests. It's not gaudy, either, though we admit the large hexagonal grille is borderline gaping. The Elantra further stands out with an athletic stance, front-wheel air curtains, and an integrated rear spoiler built into the trunk lid. The Elantra feels larger from the passenger compartment, yet is easy to navigate in tight spaces at just 179.9 inches long and 70.9 inches wide.</p>, <p>Even the most basic 2018 Elantra includes air conditioning, power windows and door locks, a 6-way driver's seat with height adjustment, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and AM/FM/CD audio with USB and auxiliary jacks. For 2018, the Elantra SE with the Popular Equipment package is replaced by the SEL model, which includes a 7-inch touch-screen display, backup camera, Bluetooth, cruise control, hood insulation for a quieter ride, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. All new Elantras come with a generous 10-year/100,000-mile warranty for the powertrain and five years of roadside assistance.</p>, <p>Aside from the automatic transmission ($1,000), most major options for the 2018 Elantra are bundled into packages. When you select the high-line Limited trim, your Elantra includes a leather interior, power driver's seat with lumbar support, hands-free power trunk, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, and push-button start. Adding the Tech package to that trim includes navigation with an 8-inch screen, Infinity audio, heated rear seats, and a power sunroof. The 2018 Elantra Value Edition adds plenty of up-level features for about 21 grand. The list includes hands-free trunk release, heated front seats, outside door handle approach lights, and dual-zone automatic temperature control. Go for the Ultimate package, and you'll get automatic emergency braking, smart cruise control, lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist, the driver's seat memory system and high-intensity headlights that turn in the direction of the steering.</p>, <p>The 2018 Elantra offers a choice of 4-cylinder engines. The standard powerplant is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder. In the Elantra SE and Elantra GT, that engine is mated to a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, while the SEL, Limited and Value Edition models all come exclusively with the automatic. The 2018 Elantra Sport and Elantra GT Sport are equipped with a more powerful 1.6-liter turbo engine and the choice of a standard 6-speed manual or optional 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The frugal might look toward the Eco model offering a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine with a 7-speed automatic transmission, and achieves an estimated 40 mpg.<br>

[<p>A smart and sporty 4-door hatchback, the 2018 Hyundai Ioniq gives environmentally conscious shoppers a choice among three affordable models: a hybrid, a plug-in hybrid and a pure electric vehicle. It takes on the popular Toyota Prius, as well as the Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt and the similar Kia Niro in the growing market for electrified fuel-efficient <a alt_o_t="Compact Cars" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small cars</a> that offer real-world practicality. Three trim levels are available, Blue, SEL and Limited, with prices starting around $23,000 for the Hybrid Blue, rated at an impressive 57 mpg in the city and 59 mpg on the highway. Hyundai says it has a fuel range of 690 miles. The best-selling Toyota Prius is a few hundred dollars more and it’s rated 58-mpg city and 53-mpg highway. The Ioniq Electric, offered in Base and Limited trims, starts around $30,000 and offers 124 miles of range. </p>, <p>Stylish, comfortable and refined, the 2018 Hyundai Ioniq is a true alternative to the Toyota Prius, which invented the hybrid segment. With its reasonable base price and laundry list of standard and available features, the sporty Ioniq feels like a premium-compact car, and it’s a bit cheaper and more fuel-efficient than the popular Toyota. Hyundai also offers a better warranty with lifetime battery coverage. <b></b></p>, <p>If ultimate electric range is what you’re after, the Chevy Bolt is still your best choice in this class. It offers 238 miles of range, which is over 100 miles more than the 2018 Hyundai Ioniq. It also packs 200 horsepower and is more fun to drive than the 118-horsepower Ioniq Electric. </p>, <p>For 2018 Hyundai has added the new Ioniq Plug-in Hybrid to the lineup. This model works much like a Toyota Prius Prime or Chevy Volt. It can be driven up to 27 miles on pure electric power before a 1.6-liter gasoline engine turns on to drive the vehicle and charge the batteries. Total range is about 590 miles. Plug into a 240v source and battery charging time is just 2.5 hours. </p>, <p>From behind the wheel, the 2018 Ioniq Hybrid is refined and comfortable with few indications that its complex powertrain is using both an electric motor and a gasoline-powered internal-combustion engine to get you down the road. Basically, it feels like a regular compact car, and that’s a good thing. The Hybrid even uses a normal-looking shifter for the 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and there are paddle shifters if you want to get sporty and choose gears for yourself. There's ample power for daily driving, engine-to-motor transitions are smooth, and brake response is nicely linear, but there is some tire noise. Throttle response, transmission shifts and steering response feel livelier in Sport mode, although fuel economy takes a hit. Use Sport mode habitually and mileage in the city will dip to about 40 mpg. The Ioniq Electric has a nice punch off the line, but overall it too has a relaxed, easygoing nature. </p>, <p>AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
 Available as part of an optional and expansive package on the Ioniq’s Limited trim level, this clever system uses a camera mounted behind the rearview mirror along with a radar sensor mounted on the front bumper to detect vehicles or pedestrians in your path and warn you of a potential collision. If you don’t take action to avoid the impact, the system will apply the brakes for you.<br>
<br>
 PLUG-IN HYBRID<br>
 Of the three powertrains offered in the Ioniq, the new Plug-in Hybrid model is our favorite. Although it’s a bit more expensive than the Hybrid, it’s significantly more affordable than the Electric and it offers the best of both worlds and is basically two cars in one. Fully charge the batteries and it’s an EV for the first 27 miles, then it becomes an extremely efficient hybrid with 600-plus miles of range.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Ioniq Hyundai proves that an environmentally friendly car doesn’t have to be far-out and futuristic on the inside. Hyundai's interior design is attractive and well-laid out, and the new Ioniq's cabin has the space, feel and appearance of a premium-compact car. Controls are easy to reach, and it doesn’t take long to figure out how to get to data such as range, fuel economy, etc. There are also plenty of conveniences, such as Apple CarPlay, adaptive cruise control, and wireless smartphone charging. Materials used are eco-friendly -- sugar cane is used in the soft-touch materials and fabric, and there's recycled plastic with wood and volcanic stone. Seat comfort is high, and the driving position is perfect. </p>, <p>Thankfully Hyundai decided to make the Ioniq attractive and not freakishly fantastic like some cars in this class. Some aspects of the Ioniq's design have been defined by aerodynamics, such as the smooth roofline that ends in a flat rear, which pays off in the best aerodynamics of any car in the U.S. Rear visibility comes through two rear windows. Unfortunately, where those windows split can fall right in the center of view, depending on seating position. The Ioniq uses LED accents and LED taillights, and the hood and liftgate are made of aluminum to reduce weight. Want to quickly tell the Hybrid from the Electric? The Electric has a closed front grille and different wheels.</p>, <p>With the new Ioniq's three-cars-in-one scenario, not even an engine is standard equipment (there's no engine in the Electric). However, there are plenty of features that are standard on the Hybrid, Electric and Plug-in hybrid models. All three come with a 7-inch touch screen, tilt/telescoping steering wheel with redundant stereo and phone controls, power windows, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. All three offer 5-passenger seating. Safety features include hill-start assist control and seven airbags (including a driver’s knee bag). Dual-zone climate control is standard on the Hybrid and Plug-in, but not available in the Electric.<u></u></p>, <p>Heated front seats are standard in the new Hyundai Ioniq Plug-in and Electric, optional in the Hybrid. Leather seating is available in all three. You can get a power driver's seat, but a power seat isn't available for the front passenger. Other options include adaptive cruise control, Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, a cargo cover, Qi wireless charging, a navigation system, and heated side mirrors. A rear center armrest with cup holders is standard in the Electric and the Plug-in hybrid, but optional in the Hybrid.</p>, <p>While all three members of the new Ioniq family use an interior-permanent magnet synchronous motor, the horsepower and torque combination is different for each car. All three also use a lithium-ion polymer battery. You can recharge 80 percent of the Electric's battery in only 23 minutes. Fuel economy for the Hybrid Blue model -- 57 mpg city and 59 highway -- is best in its class, and the fuel-economy equivalent for the Electric is the best in the country.<br>

It tops out near $37,000. The Ultimate Subscription Model for the Electric requires $2,500 at lease signing, and you pay a predetermined monthly amount for 36 months based on the model and features.

The Hybrid even uses a normal-looking shifter for the 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and there are paddle shifters if you want to get sporty and choose gears for yourself. There's ample power for daily driving, engine-to-motor transitions are smooth, and brake response is nicely linear, but there is some tire noise. Throttle response, transmission shifts and steering response feel livelier in Sport mode, although fuel economy takes a hit. Use Sport mode habitually and mileage in the city will dip to about 40 mpg. The Ioniq Electric has a nice punch off the line, but overall it too has a relaxed, easygoing nature. </p>, <p>AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
 Available as part of an optional and expansive package on the Ioniq’s Limited trim level, this clever system uses a camera mounted behind the rearview mirror along with a radar sensor mounted on the front bumper to detect vehicles or pedestrians in your path and warn you of a potential collision. If you don’t take action to avoid the impact, the system will apply the brakes for you.<br>
<br>
 PLUG-IN HYBRID<br>
 Of the three powertrains offered in the Ioniq, the new Plug-in Hybrid model is our favorite. Although it’s a bit more expensive than the Hybrid, it’s significantly more affordable than the Electric and it offers the best of both worlds and is basically two cars in one. Fully charge the batteries and it’s an EV for the first 27 miles, then it becomes an extremely efficient hybrid with 600-plus miles of range.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Ioniq Hyundai proves that an environmentally friendly car doesn’t have to be far-out and futuristic on the inside. Hyundai's interior design is attractive and well-laid out, and the new Ioniq's cabin has the space, feel and appearance of a premium-compact car. Controls are easy to reach, and it doesn’t take long to figure out how to get to data such as range, fuel economy, etc. There are also plenty of conveniences, such as Apple CarPlay, adaptive cruise control, and wireless smartphone charging. Materials used are eco-friendly -- sugar cane is used in the soft-touch materials and fabric, and there's recycled plastic with wood and volcanic stone. Seat comfort is high, and the driving position is perfect. </p>, <p>Thankfully Hyundai decided to make the Ioniq attractive and not freakishly fantastic like some cars in this class. Some aspects of the Ioniq's design have been defined by aerodynamics, such as the smooth roofline that ends in a flat rear, which pays off in the best aerodynamics of any car in the U.S. Rear visibility comes through two rear windows. Unfortunately, where those windows split can fall right in the center of view, depending on seating position. The Ioniq uses LED accents and LED taillights, and the hood and liftgate are made of aluminum to reduce weight. Want to quickly tell the Hybrid from the Electric? The Electric has a closed front grille and different wheels.</p>, <p>With the new Ioniq's three-cars-in-one scenario, not even an engine is standard equipment (there's no engine in the Electric). However, there are plenty of features that are standard on the Hybrid, Electric and Plug-in hybrid models. All three come with a 7-inch touch screen, tilt/telescoping steering wheel with redundant stereo and phone controls, power windows, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. All three offer 5-passenger seating. Safety features include hill-start assist control and seven airbags (including a driver’s knee bag). Dual-zone climate control is standard on the Hybrid and Plug-in, but not available in the Electric.<u></u></p>, <p>Heated front seats are standard in the new Hyundai Ioniq Plug-in and Electric, optional in the Hybrid. Leather seating is available in all three. You can get a power driver's seat, but a power seat isn't available for the front passenger. Other options include adaptive cruise control, Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keep Assist, a cargo cover, Qi wireless charging, a navigation system, and heated side mirrors. A rear center armrest with cup holders is standard in the Electric and the Plug-in hybrid, but optional in the Hybrid.</p>, <p>While all three members of the new Ioniq family use an interior-permanent magnet synchronous motor, the horsepower and torque combination is different for each car. All three also use a lithium-ion polymer battery. You can recharge 80 percent of the Electric's battery in only 23 minutes. Fuel economy for the Hybrid Blue model -- 57 mpg city and 59 highway -- is best in its class, and the fuel-economy equivalent for the Electric is the best in the country.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Hyundai Kona is the Korean manufacturer's entry into the newest and most competitive part of the crossover-SUV market: small crossovers. Going head-to-head against the Honda HR-V, Toyota CH-R, Mazda CX-3, Chevrolet Trax and many others, the Hyundai Kona offers up a compelling formula. There's high-tech safety equipment like automatic emergency braking and a driver-alert system. There's a full-color head-up display available as well. Turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines are both available, and both can be had with all-wheel drive. While smaller than many of its rivals, Hyundai has managed surprisingly good interior packaging, so except for rear-seat legroom, there's more space than you might expect. Wrapped in standout styling, the new Hyundai Kona makes a compelling case against ever-tougher competition.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a uniquely styled, space-efficient, fuel-efficient and high-tech small-crossover SUV, the Kona has you covered. It even offers a turbocharged engine, helping it avoid the pokey-acceleration critique leveled at so many of its competitors.</p>, <p>With the well-established relationship between beauty and the beholder's eye, it's safe to say the Kona won't be everyone's styling forte. If you frequently use the rear seat, the Kona's tight rear quarters earn it a pass as well.</p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Kona is all-new this year, on a new chassis developed specifically for the small-crossover-SUV market.</p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Kona is comfortable, reasonably quiet on the road, quick-ish with the turbocharged engine, and all-around, nicely executed. The independent rear suspension in all-wheel-drive models like the one we drove does a respectable job of smoothing out bumps; we'd expect the torsion-beam axle in front-wheel-drive models to be more jittery on broken pavement. Around corners the Kona feels planted but not sporty, despite the best efforts of the Sport driving mode and torque-vectoring system. This is a small-crossover SUV after all, not a sports car, and within that definition it's entertaining enough. The Sport mode quickens throttle response and transmission shifts, but it also firms up the steering to an unreasonable degree, making it feel syrupy without adding any meaningful feedback. As for the turbocharged engine, it keeps the Kona from being slow, but it's not what we'd call fast, either. The transmission takes part of the blame here: The 7-speed dual-clutch is surprisingly slow to shift on its own, and suffers from an odd shudder from 0-5 mph that's not a deal-killer, but is noticeable.</p>, <p>ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
That the 2018 Kona features all-wheel drive (AWD) in addition to front-wheel drive (FWD) may seem obvious, but it's not. Many of its competitors, such as the Toyota CH-R, Nissan Kicks and Kia Soul, don't offer it. The Kona even features a center differential lock, in case you decide to tackle a slightly tougher trail.<br>
<br>
HEAD-UP DISPLAY<br>
We like the head-up display in the new Hyundai Kona for two reasons. First, it's a rarity in the class and nice to have. But beyond that, it's exceptionally bright, to the point that it's even bright enough to overcome polarized sunglasses.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While not as dramatically styled as the exterior, the 2018 Kona features an interior that's still cool and interesting. We like the big round vents on the sides, the dash-mounted infotainment screen that manages to avoid looking tacked on, and the clever pocket above the available Qi wireless charging pad that's perfectly sized for a smartphone. The driver's seat is perfectly comfortable, as is the front passenger's, and there's even good cargo space behind the rear seats. That includes an adjustable floor and hidden storage. The rear seats are not quite as roomy, though. There's not a lot of legroom, headroom is only adequate, and adults can forget about the center position. If you opt for the Lime Twist green paint, you get body-colored accents inside. It adds a much-needed splash of color to the charcoal decor, and we wish Hyundai would do it with its red and blue exterior colors.</p>, <p>There's a lot going on with the Kona's styling, but despite the multiple textures, lines and surfaces, it all works surprisingly well. We like the narrow LED running lights mounted atop the fenders, and the taper at the bottom of Hyundai's grille refreshes the look without redefining it. There's gray plastic around the fenders, but rather than reduce it to a thin stripe Hyundai owns it with the Kona, wrapping it thickly around the wheelwells and into the front bumper. In back things aren't quite as tidy, but it still hangs together, and out on the road the new Kona looks surprisingly fetching. We liked it in red, but if you want to tone it down, you can get silver, gray or black. If you like red or blue, you can also get a black contrast roof.</p>, <p>The base 2018 Hyundai Kona SE comes with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. Standard equipment includes a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, and USB and AUX inputs. Cruise control is standard as well, as is a tire-pressure-monitoring system that monitors each tire individually. The manually adjusted seats are covered in cloth, and there are automatic headlights and keyless entry. There's a rearview camera, standard with dynamic guidelines that curve as you turn the steering wheel.</p>, <p>Beyond the turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive, there are multiple models, each adding its own unique blend of features. The Kona SEL gets larger 17-inch alloy wheels, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alert, a proximity key with push-button start, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and a hidden cargo compartment. You can also get the Technology Package, which adds a power driver's seat, sunroof, fog lights, and a suite of safety systems that includes forward-collision warning and prevention, lane-keeping assist, and driver-attention warning. Step up to the Limited and you get the turbo engine, leather seats, automatic climate control, and a power driver's seat. The top-line Kona Ultimate includes all that, plus the safety technology, a larger 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with navigation, a head-up display, automatic high beams, parking sensors, and a color multi-information display between the main gauges. Interestingly, active cruise control is not available.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kona SE and SEL both come with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, routed through a 6-speed automatic transmission. This is about what many of its competitors offer, and it's sure to be a good choice for those who keep their acceleration ambitions modest. Limited and Ultimate models come with a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder connected to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While notably quicker than many other vehicles in its class, the turbocharged engine doesn't exactly make the Kona fast, and the transmission's slow shifts and unrefined character leave a lot to be desired. It offers up plenty of torque though, and at very low engine speeds. All-wheel drive is available with both engines, inflicting a fuel-economy hit in favor of better traction. Note that with all-wheel drive, you also get an independent rear suspension.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter inline-4<br>
147 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br>
132 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/33 mpg (FWD), 25/30 mpg (AWD)<br>

195 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-4,500 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 28/32 mpg (FWD), 26/29 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Prices for the 2018 Hyundai Kona almost perfectly bracket the $20,000 range. The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the Kona SE starts at $20,450, including the $950 destination charge; all-wheel drive adds $1,300 to the price of any Kona model. On the other end, the AWD Kona Ultimate will run you $29,650. For us, a nice compromise is right in the middle, with the Kona SEL with the Technology Package. For about $23,600 ($24,900 with AWD) you get a nice-driving, nicely equipped small-crossover SUV that's easily competitive with the Honda HR-V, Toyota CH-R, Subaru Crosstrek, and many others. While the Ultimate's near-$30,000 price tag may sound like a lot, it's right between the price for a loaded Mazda CX-3 Grand Touring, and a Subaru Crosstrek Limited. To see what others in your area are paying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. Also note that because it's so new, it's hard to estimate what the future resale value of the Kona will be.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/hyundai/santa-fe/2018
[<p>A midsize 7-passenger SUV, the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe is popular with families because it offers plenty of space, impressive features and a standard 290-horsepower 3.3-liter engine, which is the most powerful naturally aspirated V6 in its class. With a starting price just over $31,000, three rows of seats and the highest possible safety ratings, the new 2018 Santa Fe competes in the crowded midsize SUV segment. Its rivals include the Kia Sorento, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Nissan Pathfinder, GMC Acadia, Ford Explorer, Volkswagen Atlas and Chevy Traverse. Four trim levels are available, SE, Limited, SE Ultimate and the top-of-the-line Limited Ultimate, which sounds properly aspirational. All-wheel drive is available on all models for an additional $1,750, and Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty is standard.</p>, <p>Your family’s space, safety and security should not come at the expense of an enjoyable drive, and the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe manages to check all the boxes on that wish list. It’s roomy, well-appointed and offers a class-leading safety rating, but it’s also powerful and it handles well.</p>, <p>If you want the most power in the class, the Ford Explorer offers models with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 with 385 horsepower. It’ll smoke the Hyundai Santa Fe. Also, there isn’t a hybrid version of the Santa Fe. Those seeking electrification in this class should shop the Toyota Highlander Hybrid.</p>, <p>Fresh off an extensive refresh both inside and out just last year, the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe gets an upgrade to a premium wood interior trim on models with leather seats. Otherwise the 2018 Santa Fe is unchanged.</p>, <p>While Mazda’s CX-9 may have set a new standard for 7-passenger SUV handling, the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV isn’t far from this benchmark. The Santa Fe offers more horsepower than the Mazda and features Drive Mode Select, a 3-position setting that permits the driver to change steering feel and transmission shift points ranging from Economy to Comfort to Sport mode. The Santa Fe’s suspension settings permit confident cornering devoid of excessive sway while simultaneously avoiding too harsh a ride. Interior sound levels are more than acceptable, although we think the Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer do a better job. As for power, the 2018 Santa Fe’s 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 delivers when it counts most, with excellent off-the-line acceleration and ample power for low-speed passing maneuvers. All-wheel drive (AWD) does add more weight and thus a very slight reduction in acceleration times over the front-wheel-drive (FWD) models.</p>, <p>AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING WITH PEDESTRIAN DETECTION<br/> When equipped with this system, the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe is rated a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Within certain parameters, if the system determines a crash is imminent and the driver does not react, it will apply the full force of the SUV’s brakes.<br/> <br/> MULTI-VIEW CAMERA SYSTEM<br/> This is a rearview camera on steroids. It uses four cameras mounted all around the Santa Fe’s exterior and provides multiple views around the vehicle including front and side views displayed on the nav screen. There’s even a 360-degree overhead bird’s-eye view of the SUV and its surroundings.<br/> </p>, <p>Two seating configurations are offered in the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe. The standard 2nd-row bench not only reclines, but it’s split 40/20/40 and slides forward to maximize legroom back in the third row. In this configuration the new Santa Fe seats seven. If that’s one too many, two 2nd-row captain’s chairs are available, which are not only more comfortable but they ease access to the Hyundai’s third row. Front-seat comfort is high, and the base model’s stain-resistant cloth fabric feels good. All materials are impressive down to the rubber that lines the inside of the door pulls.</p>, <p>Last year Hyundai nipped and tucked the exterior of the Santa Fe and the surgery was a success. The SUV rolled out of the design studio with a new 5-bar grille, a more aggressive front end and a shapelier backside. It’s contemporary with strong shoulders, flared fenders and an aggressively canted backlight. Squint and its three-quarter rear view, with its oversized angular tailpipes, is reminiscent of the BMW X5. The base SE model gets the integrated rear spoiler and very attractive 18-inch wheels, while the Limited versions are dressed up with integrated fog lights, roof rails and 19-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Santa Fe SE drivers with a long journey ahead will appreciate the multi-adjustable front bucket seats with power-adjustable lumbar support. Passengers farther back will give thanks to the 3rd-row controls for air conditioning and heating. Stepping up to the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited includes luxuries like leather seating -- power-adjustable and heated for the driver and front passenger -- push-button starting and an electroluminescent gauge cluster. The Limited Ultimate adds heated 2nd-row seats, an 8-inch-color navigation touch-screen monitor and Multi-View Monitor. Sweet as ever, Hyundai's confidence-inspiring 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranties cover the new Santa Fe.</p>, <p>Beyond a laundry list of features bundled into trim levels like a heated steering wheel, navigation, Infinity premium audio and 3rd-row USB ports, Hyundai also offers a couple of option packages that contain its tech-based safety systems. For the new Santa Fe SE, the $3,650 Premium package brings blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, a hands-free Smart liftgate and more. The $2,100 Tech package for the SE Ultimate and Limited Ultimate includes Smart Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking, lane-departure warning and HID Dynamic Bending Headlights with high-beam assist. All-wheel drive is a stand-alone option on all models for $1,750.</p>, <p>Hyundai makes it simple to shop for a 7-passenger 2018 Santa Fe SUV by offering only one engine and one transmission. In front-wheel-drive models, the SUV's 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 feels exceedingly powerful, but with good throttle response, smooth pickup and strong acceleration. The heavier all-wheel-drive Santa Fe models, however, could do with some more low-end grunt to get moving. The Hyundai’s 6-speed automatic transmission isn’t exactly state-of-the-art. Most of the Santa Fe’s competitors have transmissions with more gears. Still, it works well enough, providing clean, easy gear changes and prompt downshifts when you need them. . All that said, Hyundai’s 2018 Santa Fe is comfortable towing up to 5,000 pounds of trailer, boat or anything else you'd like to haul.<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.3-liter V6<br/> 290 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br/> 252 lb-ft of torque @ 5,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (FWD), 18/24 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p>A 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe SE comes out of the gate with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of around $32,000 -- a number that is slightly higher than the 2018 Nissan Pathfinder SUV, but slightly less than a similarly equipped Honda Pilot EX. The 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited starts near $36,000. If you load up an AWD Santa Fe Ultimate Limited with every option, you'll still find yourself spending less than $45,000. Check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price for what shoppers are actually paying for the Santa Fe in your area. It's still a little early to predict the 2018 Santa Fe's resale outlook, but Hyundai SUVs consistently rank well versus their competition, on par with the Nissan Pathfinder and Ford Explorer, better than the GMC Acadia but behind the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.</p>]

[<p>Although the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/hyundai/santa%20fe%20sport/2018/">2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</a> SUV remains an attractive proposition, its aging design has prompted <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> to rely on a proven sales tactic: add more features for less money. Even with these upgrades, however, the 2018 Santa Fe Sport compact-crossover SUV must still compete with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, VW Tiguan and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/equinox/">Chevrolet Equinox</a>, all offering newer designs, better tech and, in the case of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>, a diesel-engine option. Fuel economy is also an area where the 2018 Santa Fe Sport is falling behind the pack. To its credit, the Santa Fe Sport offers one of the most powerful engines in the segment, loads of standard equipment plus such high-end options as ventilated front seats, Infinity audio and a panoramic moonroof.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">compact SUV</a> that offers a bit more size, power and features than a run-of-the-mill <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> SUV, the 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport compact-crossover SUV is nothing but good news. Did we mention the standard 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty?</p>, <p>If your shopping list includes a low price, bold styling, great fuel economy or rugged off-road ability, you might be better off in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a>, VW Tiguan or Mazda CX-5. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a> Trailhawk offers a V6 engine, better tow ratings and wears a Trail Rated badge.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/santa%20fe%20sport/">Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</a> crossover SUV gains a new Value Package featuring heated front seats and side mirrors, proximity key with push-button start, automatic climate control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Models with Blue Link include all services for a full three years.</p>, <p>Hyundai’s 2018 Santa Fe Sport SUV blends a fun-to-drive attitude with mature styling and a sophisticated interior. The base 2.4-liter engine puts out a respectable 185 horsepower, but the Santa Fe Sport’s substantial weight really calls for the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter. This engine delivers excellent performance with only a marginal difference in fuel economy. The Santa Fe Sport’s ride is firm but not harsh, remaining smooth so long as the surface below is too. Handling is also good, but the Santa Fe Sport’s steering feel isn’t as precise as in a Mazda CX-5 or VW Tiguan. All-wheel-drive-equipped models have the added advantage of improved handling in both wet and dry conditions, a benefit of the Active Cornering Control that routes torque to the wheels with the best grip. Standard Drive Mode Select alters power steering and throttle response for Normal, Eco and Sport settings.</p>, <p>2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED ENGINE<br>
 With 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, the 2018 Santa Fe Sport’s 2.0-liter turbocharged engine delivers the kind of performance uncommon in the world of compact SUVs. Best of all, fuel economy is nearly identical to the base 2.4-liter engine.<br>
<br>
 HANDS-FREE SMART LIFTGATE WITH AUTO OPEN<br>
 Where some power liftgates require pressing a button on a fob or furiously waving one’s foot below the bumper, the 2018 Santa Fe Sport’s power liftgate opens upon approach when sensing the proximity of the remote fob in your pocket.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport crossover SUV proves that you don't have to sacrifice user friendliness to have a contemporary interior design. All the controls inside are easy to reach and understand, and everything is constructed with care and high-quality materials. It's also practical, with stain-resistant Yes Essentials fabric or available leather, and a rear bench seat that folds in a 40/20/40 split and is also available with 5.2 inches of fore-and-aft travel and a recline function as part of an option package. Behind the seats is a good-sized cargo space, making the Santa Fe Sport exceptionally flexible.</p>, <p>Last year, Hyundai gave the compact Santa Fe Sport SUV a new grille with brush-look inserts, emphasizing the "Sport" part of the name. The sleek crossover SUV also has daytime running lights as standard, while around back reside a set of sleek taillights and a twin-paired dual exhaust. We like the sharply styled design, with impressive details merging with aerodynamic efficiency that include hidden underbody fairings. Standard equipment on the Sport are 17-inch alloy wheels with 235/65R17 tires, while the Sport 2.0T has 18-inch alloys with 235/60R18 tires as standard and 19-inch alloys with 235/55R19 tires optionally available.</p>, <p>Hyundai’s Santa Fe Sport for 2018 includes a driver's-side blind-spot mirror and auto up/down passenger window, air conditioning, cruise control, tilt/telescoping steering column, steering-wheel-mounted controls, Drive Mode Select, remote keyless entry, heated mirrors, a 6-speaker audio system that includes a 5-inch-color LCD display with rearview monitor, USB and auxiliary inputs and Bluetooth. Turbocharged 2.0T models get a lot more equipment standard, including most of the base model's Premium and Value Packages, adding roof rails, fog lights, a power driver's seat, Blue Link, heated front seats, push-button start/stop and more. Safety features include blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>The base 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport offers the Value Package and Premium Package already mentioned, plus a Tech Package that includes a panoramic sunroof, rear park assist, navigation with 8-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Infinity premium audio, Multi-View Camera, heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and a power liftgate. The Santa Fe Sport 2.0T Ultimate adds 19-inch wheels, Infinity Premium audio and a heated steering wheel plus offers the Ultimate Tech Package that adds Smart Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, adaptive headlights, high-beam assist and an electronic parking brake.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport offers a choice of two engines. Standard on the base Sport is a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 185 horsepower; if that's not enough, the 240-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine in the Sport 2.0T should satisfy you. Both engines benefit from modern direct-fuel injection and continuously variable-valve timing for the optimum in efficiency and power. The only transmission choice is a 6-speed automatic with a Shiftronic manual shift gate, for those who wish to shift for themselves, and is available in either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD), delivering responsive and impressive performance and fuel economy.<br>

[<p>As SUV sales dominate, the midsize sedan market has become more competitive than ever. Fighting for every scrap of midsize sedan sales, mainstays like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry continue to top the sales charts, but rivals like the Hyundai Sonata are ambitious climbers. The Sonata also faces strong contenders like the Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Malibu, Nissan Altima, and Kia Optima. The Sonata already stood out for tremendous value for the money, a choice of naturally aspirated, turbocharged, hybrid and plug-in drivetrains; the latest in high-tech, and a comfortable and quiet driving environment. Refreshed this year, the 2018 Hyundai Sonata receives a significant update that adds more muscular styling, a redesigned interior, and a new transmission for the turbocharged engine.</p>, <p>The Hyundai Sonata is a refined, affordable, high-tech sedan that now has styling that makes it standout on the road. With everything ranging from a cost-effective, well-equipped base model to topline models with class-above features, the Sonata has you covered.</p>, <p>The improvements for 2018 are significant, but conservative. 2018 sees an all-new Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, and this intimidating duo may overshadow the new Sonata. Drivers seeking all-wheel drive will have to turn to the Subaru Legacy or certain versions of the Ford Fusion.</p>, <p>New styling, new technology, a redesigned interior and a new transmission behind the available turbocharged engine are the biggest highlights for the 2018 Hyundai Sonata. Hyundai has added more features while only marginal price increases, keeping the Sonata among the least expensive midsize sedans you can get.</p>, <p>Already lauded for its comfort, Hyundai updated the Sonata's suspension to improve handling and reduce body roll. While the ride is firmer, comfort wasn’t sacrificed in the process. The standard 2.4-liter has enough power to satisfy most drivers, with ample acceleration and passing power, and decent fuel economy. This transmission works harder on grades, but it shifts smoothly and does a fine job managing the power. If you want more sporting attitude, consider the optional 2.0-liter turbo engine. It offers 245 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque -- the same as last year -- but is now backed by a new 8-speed automatic transmission. It offers quick acceleration from a stop and plenty of easy-to-access torque. The 8-speed is responsive, yet the shifts are smooth and subtle. With the 2.0-liter engine, the Sonata receives a different version of electric power steering, which has a natural feel.</p>, <p>CONNECTED CABIN<br>
Between standard features like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 7-inch touch screen and Bluetooth, and options such as wireless smartphone charging, navigation, satellite radio, Blue Link telecommunications, and a rear USB port, your crew will always be charged, connected and caught up on social media.<br>
<br>
DRIVE MODES<br>
All Sonatas come standard with drive modes: Eco, Comfort and Sport. Eco improves fuel economy by changing the transmission and throttle programming. Sport mode affects transmission, throttle and steering response. The 2.0T adds a Smart driving mode. This alternates between the other three modes, responding to the driver's input.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Sonata's redesigned interior looks sharper, and as an added benefit: The controls are even more intuitive. The screen sits higher, allowing all the controls to sit higher, making them easier to reach. Buttons and knobs are well organized in wider horizontal rows, with navigation and audio controls just below the screen and the climate controls falling neatly below. The new 3-spoke steering wheel has a more upscale design, and the overall look and feel of the interior is more premium than before. Sport models have a flat-bottomed steering wheel and cloth seats with leather bolsters and contrast stitching.</p>, <p>No longer lost in the shuffle, the Sonata's new sense of style is dominated in front by Hyundai's cascading grille, sharper lines and LED running lights. Sport models receive a unique grille and front fascia, plus dual exhaust tips. In all models, the panoramic sunroof option is gone, replaced by an available conventional tilt-and-slide unit. Also, the trunk release is now hidden in the Hyundai logo. Push the area below the ring, above the "H" to open the trunk. Once the lid opens, you have access to the largest trunk in the Sonata's class.</p>, <p>Hyundai reorganized its trim-level lineup: It dropped the base model, making the SE the most affordable Sonata. It comes nicely equipped with plenty of tech, including a 7-inch touch screen display, 6-speaker audio system, Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, a rearview camera, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Sonata also has air conditioning, power windows and locks, heated side mirrors, blind-spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist, cloth seats, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and a 60/40-split fold-down rear seatback. There are seven airbags, including a driver's knee airbag, plus standard stability control and electronic brake assist.</p>, <p>From SE, you can move up to SEL, Sport and Limited. Available features include automatic high beams, 10-speaker Infinity audio, navigation, power heated/ventilated leather front seats, a heated steering wheel, and Blue Link Connected Car. Those in the back seat can enjoy a USB port, center-console-mounted vents and rear side window shades. LED headlights and taillights, 17- or 18-inch wheels and a hands-free smart trunk are available, while safety adds include smart cruise control, automatic emergency braking, rear parking sensors, and lane-keep assist. You can also get the turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine with an 8-speed automatic.</p>, <p>There are five drivetrain choices for the 2018 Hyundai Sonata, all of them with four cylinders. The standard 185-horsepower 2.4-liter inline-4 is more than adequate. For a more spirited drive, you can choose the 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 and its 245 horsepower, an engine that is now backed by a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission. The Sonata Eco's 1.6-liter turbo puts out less horsepower (178) but more torque (195 lb-ft) than the standard 2.4, and is available only with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. The two hybrid models -- regular and plug-in each pairs a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with a battery-powered electric motor. The plug-in model has a larger battery pack that allows up to 27 miles of electric-only range. Both are unique among hybrid sedans in that they use a 6-speed automatic transmission vs. the continuously variable transmission (CVT) setups found in rivals.<br>

Next up is the Eco, at just above $23,500, and the nicely equipped new midrange SEL trim that starts at $24,585. As soon as you get into Sport ($26,085) and Limited ($28,285) territory, you can opt for the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. With the Sport, the upgraded engine and other included features add $2,400 to the bottom line. The absolute top-of-the-line Limited has an MSRP of just over $33,000. The 2018 Sonata Hybrid starts at $26,385 and spans to over $35,000 in Limited form with the Ultimate Package. Prices for the Plug-in variant are still forthcoming, but the outgoing model started in the mid-$30,000 range before factoring in federal incentives. Those prices are in line with the Honda Accord (2017), Toyota Camry (2018) and Nissan Altima (2017), with a slight price advantage overall. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area, and note that the Sonata's projected mid-pack resale value has been improving.</p>]

[<p>Once unrivaled at offering numerous features at a great price, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> suddenly finds itself scrambling to make the 2018 Hyundai Tucson the unbeatable bargain it once was. The changes come as a sea of newer and equally well-equipped competitors hit the market, including compact-crossover-SUV favorites like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue/">Nissan Rogue</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/compass/">Jeep Compass</a>. To its credit, Hyundai has created a stylish and sporty compact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, offering numerous technology features, a choice of normally aspirated or turbocharged 4-cylinder engines and such high-end options as a panoramic sunroof and Infinity premium audio system. Also along for the ride is Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a compact-crossover SUV and don’t require rugged off-road credentials, the 2018 Hyundai Tucson offers style, features and safety, all at a great price. The Tucson’s optional turbocharged engine delivers good performance with decent fuel economy.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for maximum cargo and rear-seat space, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a> makes a better choice. You’ll find more power in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a> SX and better handling from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>.</p>, <p>2018 sees a reordering of the Tucson’s trim lines to five models: SE, SEL, SEL Plus, Value and Limited. SEL and higher trims gain heated front seats, SiriusXM, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The SEL Plus gets an 8-inch touch screen and Infinity audio, while the Limited gains a heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>For a small-crossover SUV, the 2018 Hyundai Tucson is remarkably quiet inside. Wind, road and engine noise are impressively contained and the well-sorted suspension delivers a composed ride even over unpaved roads. The comfort level varies widely, however, depending on wheel size. Feedback from the electric-assisted power steering still feels a bit vague at times, but it’s better than previous iterations. The optional 1.6-liter turbocharged engine is strong off the line, but then seems to fade just when we need it to shine, namely during passing and merging maneuvers. Placing the drive-mode select into Sport mode makes the engine, throttle and transmission more responsive, but not more powerful. We found much to like in the Tucson’s 7-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission that delivered quick, smooth shifts and helped our test vehicle achieve a respectable 30 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>SMART POWER TAILGATE<br>
 No flailing arms or legs required to activate the Tucson’s power tailgate. Simply approach the vehicle with the fob in hand (or pocket), stand behind the vehicle for a few seconds and the tailgate automatically opens.<br>
<br>
 YES ESSENTIALS STAIN PROTECTION<br>
 Spills and mishaps are a fact of family car life, which is why Hyundai adds stain-resistant YES Essentials technology to Tucson models with cloth seats. Beyond its ability to minimize stains, the fabric also deters odors and reduces static discharge.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The base <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/tucson/">Hyundai Tucson</a> SE offers a 6-way-manual seat, but skip that and move up to the SEL or SEL Plus, both of which come with an 8-way-power seat and lumbar support. The sensible dash offers big vents, simple instrumentation, and buttons and knobs for climate and audio controls. At night, the controls are backlit in soft blue lighting. Simplicity extends to the digital display between the gauges, which doesn't overload the driver with info. Even if it's not best-in-class roomy, the comfortable rear seat works just fine, and the cargo area's adjustable floor also includes storage for the cargo cover.</p>, <p>There's no question the 2018 Tucson is a sharp-looking compact SUV. The big grille, flowing lines and LED-accented headlights bring it into the same fold as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/santa%20fe/">Hyundai Santa Fe</a> and Santa Fe Sport -- very good company. The front end's styling centers on that trapezoidal grille, with lines flowing over the hood and across the fenders to the rear, blending into the taillights. Under the pretty styling is a chassis that uses more than 50-percent high-strength steel, providing a strength that makes the Hyundai Tucson safe and stable. </p>, <p>The 2018 Hyundai Tucson SE is the least expensive, and offers what we consider the basics on a modern vehicle: rearview camera, Bluetooth- and USB-equipped audio system, 17-inch alloy wheels, and an automatic transmission for the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. But it's better to step up to the SEL model, where you'll get heated front seats, an 8-way-power driver's seat, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. A half-step up from that is the SEL Plus, which adds blind-spot monitoring, proximity key, leather seating and an 8-inch navigation touch screen with Infinity audio. Top-line Limited models get a heated steering wheel, the 1.6-liter turbo engine (also standard on the Value trim) and an 8-way-power passenger seat.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available on every trim level, but optional equipment doesn’t show up until you reach the Limited trim’s Ultimate package. When so equipped, the Limited becomes the ultimate Tucson, with ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, lane-departure warning, a panoramic sunroof, rear parking sensors, and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. Oddly, the Value model offers the better 1.6-liter turbo engine but not the SEL Plus’ 8-inch navigation system or Infinity audio.</p>, <p>Base Tucson SE, SEL and SEL Plus models get a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder and 6-speed automatic transmission, which is a bit of a dog. Choose Value or Limited to get the much better 1.6-liter turbo-4 and 7-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission. All-wheel drive (AWD) is available with either engine in lieu of the standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) setup. AWD Tucson models offer a "lock" feature, ensuring up to a 50/50 torque split between the front and rear wheels for better grip in low-traction situations. And don't equate "turbo" with "speed"; instead, the upgrade engine successfully concentrates on fuel economy, getting up to 30 mpg on regular-unleaded gas. <br>
<br>
 2.0-liter inline-4<br>
 164 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br>
 151 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/30 mpg (FWD), 21/26 mpg (AWD)<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 175 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br>
 195 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/30 mpg (FWD), 24/28 mpg (AWD)<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You can get a 2018 Hyundai Tucson SE with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $23,500, but we suggest skipping that and heading to the better-equipped SEL models, which start at a bit more than $24,750 and $27,650, respectively. The Value trim kicks off at about $27,500, while the top-line Limited will run about $30,400. All-wheel drive adds $1,400 to any Tucson's starting price. If you opt for the Ultimate package on the 2018 Tucson Limited, you'll be looking at about $35,000 worth of compact SUV. That's pretty favorable next to the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue, and is nearly identical to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a>. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Tucson. Residual values for the Tucson are about on par with the rest of the compact-SUV class.</p>]

Gorgeous, comfortable and boasting one of the lowest starting prices in its class, Infiniti’s best-selling model also has a distinct power advantage when outfitted with its most popular engine, a 300-horsepower turbocharged V6.

Interior changes include a new steering wheel, new shift knob and more stitching. The trim grades have also been rethought, with the lineup now divided into Pure, Luxe, Sport and Red Sport 400 versions. And if you were holding out until <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> offered the Q50 in a Mocha Almond coating, now’s the time to grab your checkbook and run to the dealer.</p>, <p>While the sweet spot in the 2018 Infiniti Q50 lineup is the 3.0t -- an excellent blend of luxury, performance and value, and the best-selling model in the bunch -- our first taste of the updated 2018 Infiniti Q50 took place near the automaker’s U.S. headquarters in Tennessee, where we drove 400-horsepower Q50 Red Sport 400 models exclusively. The Q50’s 2018 update included few dynamic changes, so the car felt familiar. While the added power is entertaining and addictive, the overall performance driving experience isn't particularly satisfying. Our test vehicles were equipped with Infiniti's Direct Adaptive Steering, a technically and functionally impressive setup that does more for lower-speed drivability than higher-energy jaunts.<br/> <br/> But unless you’re big into carving canyons and demand an unfiltered, telepathic connection between you, the car and the road, the 2018 Infiniti Q50 should be plenty sporty for you. And while it also tips the scales a couple hundred pounds heavier than the segment’s legendary driver’s car, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a>, the Q50 3.0t significantly overpowers its closest competitors with its 300-horsepower rating. In addition to the effortless and confidence-inspiring acceleration afforded by all that power, daily driving highlights include terrific seats and soft touchpoints that help create a palpable sense of luxury. To sit in the Q50 is to sink into it, but just enough to enhance the feelings of both comfort and control.</p>, <p>DYNAMIC DIGITAL SUSPENSION<br>
 The Infiniti Q50’s available adaptive suspension features adjustable dampers that allow you to choose between a more comfortable ride and sportier handling.<br>
<br>
 V6 POWER<br>
 We’re on board with the industry’s move to turbocharged 4-cylinder engines in place of thirstier, heavier 6-cylinder powerplants, but there’s much to be said for the buttery power delivery of a V6.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Soft, high-quality materials, a performance-themed gauge cluster and a digitally enhanced, dual-screen center stack all come together in a passenger cabin that’s rich, sporty and contemporary at once. It’s an appealing combination that’s not easy to pull together.<br/> <br/> There isn’t a whole lot of personal storage up front -- a common theme across the category -- but the cup holders are decent in size and placement, and there’s a useful bin under the center armrest.<br/> <br/> The 2018 Infiniti Q50 is strong in tech overall, but it’s showing its age in the infotainment department. The lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility is quickly becoming a bigger shortcoming as the list of competitors that offer a couple of our favorite features has grown to include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/tlx/">Acura TLX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a>, BMW 3 Series, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> and others (<a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus IS</a> notwithstanding). And while the dual-screen setup is visually impressive, it’s more compelling on paper than in practice. With that said, we like the high-resolution touch screen and find it easy to perform most functions.<br/> <br/> Other highlights include an impressive 16-speaker Bose audio system and an Around View Monitor with Moving Object Detection. Using cameras on each side of the vehicle, Infiniti’s Around View Monitor gives you a simulated bird’s-eye view of the vehicle and its surroundings, making it easy to park like a pro. It also gives you a warning if the cameras detect a moving object nearby.<br/> <br/> The Infiniti Q50’s rear seat is among the roomier such accommodations in the category, and backseat drivers would be much happier barking suggestions from the back of the Q50 than from the rear quarters of the Lexus IS, for instance. Trunk room is similarly on par with the category, while buyers looking for added cargo flexibility should consider the available 60/40 split-folding rear seatbacks.</p>, <p>We’re fans of the Q50’s sporty but substantial look, which has been enhanced for 2018. While the visual updates are comprehensive, the effect is evolutionary on the whole. A key change is further visual differentiation between trim grades, with the Q50 3.0t Sport and Q50 Red Sport 400 now distinguished by a unique face featuring a bolder bumper and wider, lower air intakes.</p>, <p>At its starting sticker price of $34,200, a 2018 Infiniti Q50 2.0t includes a voice-controllable, dual-display infotainment system with 8-inch upper and 7-inch lower touch screens, USB and Bluetooth phone/audio connectivity, backup camera, keyless entry and start-up, leatherette seats, power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, HD and satellite radio, plus a full complement of LED headlights, fog lights and taillights.</p>, <p>Infiniti has developed a reputation for introducing innovative technologies, for which the 2018 Q50 is a rolling showcase. In addition to expected optional niceties like real leather seating, upgraded audio and a navigation system, check out the impressive list of driver-assist and safety technologies offered on the Q50:</p>, <p>As you’ll see below, the 2018 Infiniti Q50 has one of the segment’s most comprehensive engine lineups. The bread-and-butter 300-horsepower engine offers more oomph than the competition at that price, and each of the four powertrains is available in conjunction with rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD).<br/> <br/> <b>2018 Infiniti Q50 2.0t</b><br/> <b>Starting Price: $35,105</b><br/> Engine: 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder<br/> Horsepower: 208 hp @ 5,500 rpm<br/> Torque: 258 lb-ft @ 1,500-3,500 rpm<br/> Transmission: 7-speed automatic<br/> Drivetrain: Rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive (+$2,000)<br/> RWD Fuel Economy: 25 mpg combined (23 city, 30 highway)<br/> AWD Fuel Economy: 24 mpg combined (22 city, 28 highway)<br/> Base Curb Weights: 3,671 pounds (RWD), 3,803 pounds (AWD)<br/> Base Wheel: 17-inch aluminum-alloy<br/> <br/> <b>2018 Infiniti Q50 3.0t -- Most Popular Model</b><br/> <b>Starting Price: $39,855</b><br/> Engine: 3.0-liter turbocharged V6<br/> Horsepower: 300 hp @ 6,400 rpm<br/> Torque: 295 lb-ft @ 1,600-5,200 rpm<br/> Transmission: 7-speed automatic<br/> Drivetrain: Rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive (+$2,000)<br/> RWD Fuel Economy: 25 mpg combined (23 city, 30 highway)<br/> AWD Fuel Economy: 24 mpg combined (22 city, 28 highway)<br/> Base Curb Weights: 3,671 pounds (RWD), 3,803 pounds (AWD)<br/> Base Wheel: 18-inch aluminum-alloy<br/> <br/> <b>2018 Infiniti Q50 Hybrid</b><br/> <b>Starting Price: $51,505</b><br/> Engine: 3.5-liter V6 + <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor + lithium ion battery<br/> Net System Horsepower: 360 hp<br/> Transmission: 7-speed automatic<br/> Drivetrain: Rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive (+$2,000)<br/> RWD Fuel Economy: 29 mpg combined (27 city, 32 highway)<br/> AWD Fuel Economy: 28 mpg combined (26 city, 30 highway)<br/> Base Curb Weights: 4,015 pounds (RWD), 4,187 pounds (AWD)<br/> Wheels: 19-inch aluminum-alloy<br/> <br/> <b>2018 Infiniti Q50 Red Sport 400</b><br/> <b>Starting Price: $51,905</b><br/> Engine: High-output 3.0-liter turbocharged V6<br/> Horsepower: 400 hp @ 6,400 rpm<br/> Torque: 350 lb-ft @ 1,600-5,200 rpm<br/> Transmission: 7-speed automatic<br/> Drivetrain: Rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive (+$2,000)<br/> RWD Fuel Economy: 22 mpg combined (20 city, 26 highway)<br/> AWD Fuel Economy: 22 mpg combined (19 city, 26 highway)<br/> Base Curb Weights: 3,840 pounds (RWD), 3,993 pounds (AWD)<br/> Wheels: 19-inch aluminum-alloy (staggered width on RWD models)</p>, <p>One of the 2018 Infiniti Q50’s key strengths is offering more features for less money, especially compared to European entries like the A4, 3 Series and C-Class. In addition to a sticker price advantage, the Infiniti Q50 typically has been offered with more competitive lease rates and other incentives. Resale values have typically been in the bottom half of the segment, but the difference is often more than offset by the lower purchase and lease prices.</p>]

[<p>Infiniti’s only 2-door <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a>, the luxurious 2018 Q60 is sleek, sexy and sophisticated with turbocharged engines, available all-wheel drive and as much as 400 horsepower. All-new just last year, it’s available in four trim levels, with prices starting just under $40,000. Three engines are offered. Pure and Luxe models get a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 208 horsepower, but Luxe models are also available with the 300-horsepower twin-turbo V6 found in the Sport models. The Red Sport, which competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m4/">BMW M4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s5/">Audi S5</a>, gets a 400-horsepower version of the V6, and it’s a satisfying combination for enthusiasts with strong acceleration and handling. All-wheel drive is offered on all models for an additional $2,000. The 2018 Infiniti Q60 battles the popular <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a5/">Audi A5</a> as well as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rc/">Lexus RC</a> and Mercedes C-Class Coupe.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a luxurious performance coupe with head-turning design and available all-wheel drive, you’ll like the 2018 Infiniti Q60. The fact that its base price undercuts the MSRP of the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> 430i Coupe, Audi A5 Coupe, Lexus RC Turbo and Mercedes C300 Coupe only makes it more attractive.</p>, <p>Unlike some of the Infiniti’s competition, the new Q60 is not available as a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/convertible/">convertible</a>. If you want to put the top down, look to the BMW 4 Series, the Audi A5 and the Mercedes C-Class. The Infiniti is also unavailable with a manual transmission, unlike the BMW, which still offers diehard enthusiasts three pedals.</p>, <p>All-new just last year, the 2018 Infiniti Q60 gets a small list of refinements. For 2018, the Q60 renames some trim levels; now there are four: Pure, Luxe, Sport and Red Sport 400. Also, the top Red Sport 400 gets a wheel-size upgrade from 19-inch rims to 20-inchers.</p>, <p>Part <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a>, part sports car and part muscle car, the new 2018 Infiniti Q60 is a blast to drive, especially with the more powerful twin-turbo V6. The Red Sport 400 can punch to 60 mph in less than five seconds. Although the new Q60 is a bit larger and heavier than some of its competitors, it’s quick and athletic on the road. Acceleration is satisfying, even with the standard turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, and the 7-speed automatic transmission is well-geared and responsive and makes the most of its 208 horsepower. It’s fun to manually shift the transmission with the standard paddle shifters and there’s a Sport mode with downshift rev matching. The ride is comfortable, but not class-leading. The <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> and BMW ride better. But the Infiniti’s standard suspension and 2-mode adaptive system offer ample handling and enough compliance for soaking up light road imperfections. At higher speeds, the cabin is well-isolated from road and wind noise.</p>, <p>AROUND VIEW MONITOR<br>
 Nissan’s Around View Monitor is like the ultimate rearview camera. It not only shows you what’s behind the low-slung coupe, but additional cameras on the side and front of the vehicle give you a bird’s-eye 360-degree view of the Q60 and its surroundings. It makes maneuvering in tight spaces and parking lots much easier.<br>
<br>
 FORWARD EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
 Standard on the Luxe trim level and up, this important safety system scans the road ahead for obstacles, vehicles and even pedestrians in your path. If it senses a probable collision it will warn you, but if you do not take action to avoid the accident the system will apply the brakes for you.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Attractive, comfortable and finely crafted, the interior of the 2018 Infiniti Q60 is a pleasing mix of technology, design and strong ergonomics. Control placement is excellent, and the two touch screens that control the navigation and infotainment systems are well placed; unfortunately, they feel small compared to others in the class. Also, the mapping interface and graphics are a bit outdated. Seat comfort is among the best in the segment, however, and sightlines are surprisingly good for such an aggressively styled coupe. Though rear headroom is not suitable for adults, legroom out back is shockingly acceptable, and the trunk can swallow a pair of small carry-ons.</p>, <p>On the road, the Q60 looks long, low and wide with a hunkered-down stance over its sizable wheels and tires. Only a handful of production models can wear a concept-car exterior and get away with it, and the 2018 Infiniti Q60 is one of them. Bucking the “good from afar, but far from good” designs of late, a closer look reveals intricate touches and careful attention to detail ranging from drilled exhaust tips, to a 3D grille badge, to a unique aero bulge that begins in the grille and extends to the hood. Overall, it’s more interesting than the Mercedes C-Class Coupe, more voluptuous than BMW 4 Series and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a>, and less cartoonish than the Lexus RC.</p>, <p>Impressively well-equipped in base form, the 2018 Infiniti Q60 comes with key standards like 19-inch wheels, keyless access with push-button start, a dizzying array of drive settings, LED headlights and taillights, an 8-way-power driver’s seat with manual lumbar support, a rearview camera, Bluetooth and a 6-speaker sound system tied to a dual-screen infotainment center. Sadly, onboard Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available on any trim level. Also, standard is a folding rear seat to expand the coupe’s trunk space, dual-zone climate controls, brushed-aluminum interior trim and two USB ports. A tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel is also standard.</p>, <p>With no physical connection between the wheel in your hand and the wheels on the road, arguably the biggest story here is the Q60’s optional steer-by-wire system. An engineering marvel it may be, but in a sports-car context, Adaptive Direct Steering, as it’s known, leaves a lot to be desired in terms of feedback and predictability. As a result, we recommend pocketing that extra $1,000 and sticking to the conventional steering unit. Options we do recommend include heated seats, a heated steering wheel, semi-aniline leather, navigation and a low-resolution 360-degree camera system. If active safety is on your mind, there are lane-keeping assist, blind-spot intervention, adaptive cruise control, and predictive forward collision.</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti Q60 Pure and Luxe are powered by a, you guessed it, 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that produces 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It’s also rated 30 mpg on the highway. Like every Q60, a 7-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive (RWD) are standard, but all-wheel drive (AWD) is available as a $2,000 option. Luxe and Sport 3.0t models make use of a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6 that generates 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, while Red Sport 400s employ an up-tuned version that cranks out an additional 100 horsepower and 55 lb-ft of torque with virtually no drop in fuel economy.<br>

It’s also less expensive than the Lexus RC and Audi A5. Although the entry-level model represents a high value, we recommend stepping up to the twin-turbocharged V6 engine, which makes 300 horsepower and nearly equals the 4-cylinder’s fuel economy. Prices for the V6 model start around $45,000. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new Q60. Things get a bit dicey on the resale front, as the 2018 Infiniti Q60 is expected to retain some of the lowest 5-year residual values in the category.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/infiniti/q70/2018
[<p>The 2018 Infiniti Q70 is the flagship <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> from Nissan’s <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> division. Known until a few years ago as the M, this premium-midsize sedan is available in standard form as the Q70 or the long-wheelbase Q70L, which has an additional 5.6 inches of legroom in its spacious rear seat. As a rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive sports sedan with choice of V6, V8 or <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> powertrains, the Q70 pits itself against luxury rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a>. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q70/">Infiniti Q70</a> has strong powertrains and some innovative safety features, but it ultimately falls short against fresher, more sophisticated and better-established rivals.</p>, <p>If there’s one aspect where Infiniti’s midsize-luxury sedan has a real leg up on rivals, it’s with the generous rear-seat legroom of the Q70L. If you find yourself playing the chauffeur and want a luxury sedan with seriously impressive rear-seat space, this is it.</p>, <p>The aging Infiniti Q70 lacks features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, has below-average <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>, and in general remains off the radar from potential luxury-car shoppers.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Infiniti Q70 lineup gets revised naming with the “Luxe” designation added to models. Otherwise, the biggest change is a standard 8-inch touch-screen display that replaces the former 7-inch screen on lower trims.</p>, <p>Unlike the majority of its rivals, the Infiniti Q70 continues to use naturally aspirated V6 or V8 engines, as opposed to a smaller-displacement turbo engine. This isn’t exactly beneficial if you want high fuel economy, but it does provide for satisfying, linear acceleration and power output across a broad range. Though it’s an older powertrain, even the 3.7-liter V6 in base models remains gratifying, and its 330 horsepower has plenty of gusto. Step up to the big 5.6-liter V8, and its 420 horsepower can be a startling surprise in what some may consider a sleeper sedan. The Q70 hybrid splits the power difference of the standard V6 and the V8. With 360 horsepower, this hybrid is a potent performer, though with a combined fuel economy of 30 mpg, its efficiency is more in line with a diesel than a traditional hybrid. Speaking of Eco, we continue to bristle at the available Eco Pedal. When engaged in Eco mode, the pedal actually adds resistance to prevent lead-foot tendencies. The Q70 in general favors a more comfort-oriented ride than, say, the athleticism of a BMW 5 Series.</p>, <p>PREDICTIVE FORWARD-COLLISION WARNING<br>
Infiniti’s system goes beyond merely sensing the vehicle ahead of yours: It senses the vehicle ahead of that one, too. So if a driver two cars in front suddenly brakes, the Q70 alerts you so you can take action. It’s the automotive equivalent of seeing into the future.<br>
<br>
BACK-UP COLLISION INTERVENTION<br>
The Q70 also has your back when in reverse. This optional safety system can detect cars approaching as you back up, first alerting you to the potential collision. If you don’t take action, the car can automatically brake to prevent an accident.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Q70’s cabin has a stately, roomy air to it. Leatherette or genuine leather and loads of available wood trim make this seem like a vehicular boardroom, while the array of buttons that cascade down the wide central console can make you feel like you’re piloting a plane. There are lots of curves and organic shapes, but the Q70’s cabin is yet another area that is showing its age. We do enjoy the driver’s seat. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> cars have a knack for providing above-average driver comfort, and that holds true for this flagship sedan. Rear-seat space is just okay in the standard Q70, while the Q70L’s best attribute and reason for being is its additional 5.6 inches of legroom that add to a total of 41.8 inches. We only wish the rear compartment of this vehicle had other amenities for rear passengers, such as a recline function or entertainment and climate controls.</p>, <p>The Q70 is at once elegant, muscular, yet understated. We're thankful that Infiniti has resisted the temptation to add a gaping grille to the Q70, as has become the trend among so many other luxury automakers. As with its interior, curves and rounded shapes are in abundance. At 196.1 inches, the standard-wheelbase Q70 is already substantial in size, longer than rivals like the Lexus GS, BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. At 202 inches in length, the long-wheelbase Q70L has the proportions of a full-size luxury sedan.</p>, <p>Infiniti’s 2018 Q70 3.7 Luxe sedan comes with 10-way power-operated and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, power moonroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and power-adjustable steering column with the helpful entry/exit driver assist, which moves the steering wheel and driver’s seat. Japanese ash wood trim is standard, but you’ll still have to pay extra for genuine leather instead of Leatherette. The basic infotainment system now is based around a larger 8-inch color display and includes a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with Bluetooth and USB connectivity. Unlike many of its competitors, this Infiniti does not support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone interfaces. In addition to the extra space the Q70L has heated rear seats.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is optional on all models except the Q70 Hybrid, which is rear-drive only. And extra rear-seat room can be bought via the long-wheelbase Q70L, also available in all forms except the hybrid. Other major options are bundled into packages and include higher-grade semi-aniline leather seating, power rear sunshade, heated rear seats, sport-tuned suspension and Bose surround-sound system. Tech and safety options include blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure/prevention system, forward and reverse emergency braking, and Infiniti's innovative Predictive Forward Collision Warning (see Favorite Features).</p>, <p>Three powertrains are available for the 2018 Infiniti Q70 luxury sedan, including a hybrid gas-electric. The standard engine is a V6 in the Q70 3.7, while a big, 5.6-liter V8 propels the Q70 5.6. The Q70 Hybrid employs a 3.5-liter V6 paired with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor that’s good for a combined output of 360 horsepower and up to 33 mpg. All three engines work with a 7-speed automatic transmission, and gearshifts can be made manually through steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. All models come standard with rear-wheel drive (RWD), and the Q70 3.7 and Q70 5.6 can be had with all-wheel drive (AWD). Aside from the hybrid Q70, the Infiniti is thirsty for premium fuel, reflected in its EPA fuel ratings.<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.7-liter V6<br/> 330 horsepower @ 7,000 rpm<br/> 270 lb-ft of torque @ 5,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (RWD), 18/24 mpg (AWD) <br/> <b><br/> </b>5.6-liter V8<br/> 420 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 417 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/24 mpg (RWD), 16/23 mpg (AWD)<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.5-liter V6 + 50 kW electric motor<br/> Hybrid system net horsepower: 360 @ 6,500 rpm<br/> Hybrid system net torque: 258 lb-ft<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 28/33 mpg<b></b></p>, <p>The 2018 Q70 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $51,000. A V8-powered Q70 5.6 begins over $64,000. Long-wheelbase variants run $1,500 over the standard-wheelbase versions, and AWD is an extra $2,150 for V6 models and $2,550 for V8 variants. The Q70 Hybrid, meanwhile, begins just over $57,000. Fully loaded, a Q70 can reach over $75,000. The Q70’s starting price undercuts rivals like the BMW 5 Series, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ct6/">Cadillac CT6</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rlx/">Acura RLX</a> and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.

[<p>The 2018 Infiniti QX30 luxury-crossover SUV may wear a Japanese badge, but its composition is far more international having been designed in conjunction with German auto giant Daimler and assembled in Great Britain. Sharing its engine, transmission and chassis with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gla/">Mercedes-Benz GLA</a> 250, the QX30 parts ways with its German cousin by offering a more opulent interior and lower base price. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> has also done its own thing with the QX30’s suspension and engine tuning, making it more of a performance threat to <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q3/">Audi Q3</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x1/">BMW X1</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a> 200t. While you can find larger, more accommodating luxury-crossover SUVs in this segment, the 2018 Infiniti QX30’s blend of styling, features and price should hold sway over young urban up-and-comers.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a compact-crossover SUV with full-size <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> credentials, Infiniti’s 2018 QX30 should definitely make the cut. The turbocharged engine is both powerful and efficient, while Infiniti’s superb attention to detail is evident throughout the cabin.</p>, <p>If you want compact exterior dimensions but maximum interior space, you might find a BMW X1 or slightly larger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkc/">Lincoln MKC</a> a better fit. One might expect a luxury brand to offer Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but in the case of the 2018 QX30, one would be wrong.</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti QX30 has no changes of note.</p>, <p>With unique chassis tuning, quicker steering ratios and a lower ride height, the 2018 Infiniti QX30 Sport beckons the type of enthusiast drivers who appreciate exact handling over blistering acceleration. The Luxury and Premium trims ride a bit softer and corner a bit less aggressively, but even with the added ground clearance found on the all-wheel-drive (AWD) models, we would never characterize the QX30’s handling as sloppy or vague. Power comes from a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine noted for its wide torque band and linear acceleration. We did find the QX30’s transmission a bit coarse at times, but the unit shifts when it should and always seems to hold the right gear for just the right amount of time. We disliked the rough ride caused by the car’s mandatory run-flat tires, and the wide C-pillars serve to create hefty blind spots.</p>, <p>SPINAL SUPPORT SEATS<br>
 Borrowing a page from Nissan’s “Zero Gravity” seat design, the 2018 Infiniti QX30’s standard bucket front seats distribute body weight evenly over the seat’s surface, helping to reduce downward pressure on the hip region, as well negate fatigue on long trips.<br>
<br>
 AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE<br>
 With Infiniti’s Technology Package, owners can load the 2018 QX30 with a number of active/passive driver assists including a 360-degree Around View Monitor, Intelligent Park Assist plus Forward Emergency Braking, Intelligent Cruise Control, Blind Spot and Lane Departure Warning and auto high-beam headlights.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While not the largest in its segment, the 2018 Infiniti QX30’s well-appointed passenger compartment looks sharp and feels inviting thanks to the generous use of high-quality materials throughout, including Nappa leather and teak wood in several variants. Some switchgear carries from Mercedes, but the Infiniti-signature asymmetric dash design, InTouch infotainment with integrated central display, console-mounted controller and Spinal Support Seats that boast extra grip in Sport models are unique. The QX30’s decently scaled aft quarters will accommodate a pair of average-size adults, and lowering the fixed-rake backs on its 60/40 rear bench more than doubles the basic 19.2-cubic-foot cargo capacity.</p>, <p>The core design cues on Infiniti’s 2018 QX30 are classic new-gen Infiniti and reflect a contemporary take on the brand’s bold double-arch grille, highly sculpted bodywork, “crescent-cut” C-pillar and LED-infused lighting treatments -- which can be upgraded to full LED-spec across the lineup. Each of the three basic QX30 models also fine-tunes its individual character themes with unique front/rear fascia configurations, ride-height settings and 18-inch or 19-inch wheel/tire fitments with the Sport jettisoning the roof rails that are standard on other variants. AWD models gain SUV-style over-fenders that add a bit more substance to their stance.</p>, <p>A lengthy roster of standards expands as you roll through the QX30’s model hierarchy, but even the base version comes with a full array of power assists, dual-zone climate control, basic Infiniti InTouch with a 7.0-inch touch screen and a Rear View Monitor. Sport models net unique suspension tuning and upgraded seating as well as premium touches like navigation, Bose premium audio, Around View Monitor and a power moonroof, while the QX30 AWD gets its own chassis tweaks and puts the power to all four corners, while offering full Nappa leather trim and even more primo touches.</p>, <p>Most QX30 extras are model-specific. While the QX30 Base and Luxury have no options, the Premium grade can be fitted with a moonroof, navigation, LED lighting, wood cabin trim, roof rails, 19-inch wheels and a Technology Package, which features a full suite of driver assists as well as a Gallery White Theme Package with White Nappa Leather upholstery and bespoke trim accents. Sport-spec options include leather upholstery plus the LED and Technology Packages. Although the QX30 AWD Luxury is option-free, the Premium version can be had with moonroof, navigation, LED/Tech Packages and wood or a dedicated Café Teak interior trim group.</p>, <p>Regardless of trim level or the number of driven wheels, all versions of the 2018 Infiniti QX30 share the same Daimler-sourced but Infiniti-tuned powertrain elements also found in the Mercedes-Benz GLA 250. While not the most powerful engine in its class, the QX30’s smooth and responsive turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder teams well with the paddle-shiftable 7-speed dual-clutch automatic to deliver spirited acceleration across a fairly wide rev range. A driver-selectable start/stop system further enhances fuel economy, netting 24/33-mpg city/highway EPA marks in front-wheel-drive (FWD) QX30s and 21/30 stats in AWD configuration.<br>
<br>
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 208 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br>
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,200-4,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/33 mpg (FWD), 21/30 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>An attractive pricing schedule should serve the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a> lineup well compared to its more costly competitors from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a>. The impressively well-equipped base Infiniti QX30 opens at just under $31,000 while the Sport-spec version that also comes with primo features like navigation, Bose audio and a power moonroof commences closer to $39,500, but ticking all the option boxes can push either just beyond $43,000. The QX30 AWD starts around $35,500 although maxing out one of these range-toppers will take that number closer to $45,500. To make your best deal on a new 2018 Infiniti QX30 compact-luxury-crossover SUV, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price. Although the QX30 has only been on sale for one year, preliminary 5-year resale values show it slightly ahead of the BMW X1, but well behind the Mercedes-Benz GLA 250, Lexus NX 200t and Audi Q3.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Infiniti QX60 offers room for seven, a dynamic exterior and a sumptuous interior all wrapped in a manageably sized <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV. Available with the latest technology and safety innovations, the QX60 represents a viable alternative to the more conservatively styled <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a>, as well as the more expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a>. The QX60’s athletic suspension setup delivers a firmer ride than that of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/enclave/">Buick Enclave</a> or Lexus RXL, but the reward is superior handling and cornering. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> provides the QX60’s owner a choice of drivetrains including the option of all-wheel drive and a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model. As gasoline looks to remain cheap, however, we think most buyers will be more than satisfied with the potent 295-horsepower gasoline V6.</p>, <p>Looking for a 3-row luxury SUV that’s fun to drive, loaded with features and still reasonable in size and price? The 2018 Infiniti QX60 is all that and more. The QX60 is less expensive than comparably equipped models from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> and offers a more dynamic driving experience than a Lexus RXL.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for maximum horsepower and handling, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>, Mercedes-Benz GLS 550 or an AMG GLS 63 makes a better choice. If your towing requirements exceed 5,000 pounds or you just need massive amounts of cargo space, a full-size <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx80/">Infiniti QX80</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/navigator/">Lincoln Navigator</a> makes a better choice.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx60/">Infiniti QX60</a> luxury SUV carries over with a few modest updates. A new feature called Rear Door Alert reminds drivers to check the rear seat before exiting the vehicle, a helpful way to remember not to leave valuables, pets or children behind.</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti QX60 is one of the better-handling luxury <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> on the market, but it does sacrifice the softer ride and lighter steering input preferred by some buyers. We think it’s an acceptable trade-off so long as the road remains fairly smooth. Infiniti has taken a rather aggressive approach toward the QX60’s suspension tuning, a bonus when speeding through winding back roads and mountain passes, but a bit of a drawback when encountering rough or pothole-packed pavement. The 295-horsepower V6 is admirable in both its ability to move the QX60 and its fuel consumption, and while the 4-cylinder hybrid version offers about 5-mpg-better city fuel economy, it surrenders 45 horsepower in the bargain. We find it odd that while driver-assist systems such as collision avoidance, lane-departure warning and adaptive cruise control are available, they’re not standard.</p>, <p>PREDICTIVE FORWARD-COLLISION WARNING<br>
 Infiniti takes forward-collision-warning technology a step further by monitoring two cars ahead. The system is able to react to any sudden braking situation that may occur with the car directly in front of yours, thus speeding up the emergency braking system’s response time.<br>
<br>
 DISTANCE CONTROL ASSIST<br>
 Stop-and-go traffic at any hour is now a reality we all have to live with. Distance Control Assist makes life a little bit easier by keeping an appropriate distance between you and the vehicle ahead. It’s an invaluable aid should traffic halt while your attention is momentarily elsewhere.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The midsize-luxury, crossover-SUV segment has plenty of 3-row vehicles, but Infiniti’s 2018 QX60 luxury SUV stands out because its plush, leather-lined cabin is comfortable in all seven spots. The comfortable front seats make highway miles go by in a flash, and climate, audio and navigation controls are easy to reach and use. The third row is surprisingly accommodating for two adults and, thanks to a second row that slides fore and aft, getting there is easy. Infiniti makes the interior even more pleasing with ample soft-touch materials, and by using laminated glass to make the interior quieter.</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti QX60's rounded, sleek design wears the company’s signature headlight-and-grille design, which works well with the overall design. The side view shows a gently sloping roof, but that design doesn’t negatively affect the QX60's impressive interior room. One of the key styling cues of the QX60 is the bowed window frame at the back of the side windows. A smaller version of this design detail can also be seen on Infiniti's stunning Q60 <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a>. In back, the power-operated tailgate, which comes standard, makes it easier to load and unload gear and groceries.</p>, <p>Buyers expect a luxury SUV to come equipped with a bevy of standard features. And even the least expensive QX60 is nicely appointed, with features like heated, power-folding side mirrors; moonroof, and a power liftgate. Inside, all QX60s come with a leather interior with heated and power-adjustable front seats, tri-zone temperature control, Bluetooth and USB ports, power tilt/telescoping steering column, rearview camera with 7-inch screen and 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio. Some optional features in the regular QX60 are standard in the Hybrid, which also has a system that emits a sound to notify pedestrians that the otherwise hushed vehicle is there.</p>, <p>You can choose gas or hybrid, and front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), but many of the other options are bundled into packages. Navigation is optional, as are a 15-speaker Bose audio system, heated seats in the second row, a motion-activated power liftgate, Wi-Fi, auto high beams, heated steering wheel, a moonroof over the second and third rows and a rear-seat entertainment package. There are also a lot of available safety features, including blind-spot monitoring, intelligent cruise control, lane-departure warning and prevention, and systems that can automatically apply the brakes when traveling in both forward and reverse.</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti QX60 is powered by a smooth, 295-horsepower V6 linked to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). This Infiniti has a Drive Mode Selector, which offers four modes -- Standard, Sport, Eco and Snow. The transmission also has a manual mode that simulates shifting gears. Under the hood of the 2018 QX60 Hybrid, you'll find a 2.5-liter supercharged 4-cylinder engine that, in combination with a 15kW <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor, has a net power output of 250 horsepower. It, too, is fitted with a CVT. Whether you are looking at the V6 version of the QX60 or the hybrid, you can choose between FWD and AWD. Towing capacity is rated at a laudable 5,000 pounds for V6 models and 3,500 pounds for the hybrid.<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6<br/> 295 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br/> 270 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (FWD), 19/26 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 2.5-liter supercharged inline-4/15kW electric motor<br/> 250 net horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br/> 243 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/27 mpg (FWD), 25/27 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti QX60 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $44,000 when equipped with a V6 and front drive. Loaded with options, the QX60 can reach close to $60,000, and the hybrid SUV can top $63,000. At its starting price, Infiniti's 3-row luxury SUV is directly in line with the Acura MDX and more than $10,000 below such rivals as the V6-powered Audi Q7 and BMW X5.

Like the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>, the QX60's resale value is expected to be very good.<b></b></p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/infiniti/qx80/2018
[<p>If you've ever doubted the power of a nose job, feast your eyes on the 2018 Infiniti QX80. Like an aging Hollywood star seeking a new lease on her career, the new QX80 got a thorough facelift, elevating it from dowdy to delightful. The same is true inside, where <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> has updated the interior with nicer leather, a bigger and better infotainment system, and the kind of high-quality fit and finish one expects in a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV targeting the likes of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/escalade/">Cadillac Escalade</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/navigator/">Lincoln Navigator</a> and even the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lx/">Lexus LX</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover/">Land Rover Range Rover</a>. While it's true the big Infiniti can't entirely hide its aging roots -- this full-size luxury SUV was introduced in 2010 as the QX56 -- it continues to be as pleasant to drive as it always has. But now, it's pretty.</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti QX80 remains a top choice if carrying eight people and towing up to 8,500 pounds are on your chore list. It's one of the few vehicles available offering such capability, and one of the few truck-type body-on-frame <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> around.</p>, <p>As nice as the QX80 is, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/armada/">Nissan Armada</a> is almost as nice and considerably less expensive. Offering much of the same capability and features, the mechanically identical Armada nonetheless costs about $20,000 less. Additionally, the QX80's fuel economy lags competitors like the Lincoln Navigator.</p>, <p>The 2018 Infiniti QX80 gets a wholly redesigned front end, including headlights, grille, hood, fenders, bumper and even fender vents. The taillights and tailgate are also redesigned, and the interior gets a nice upgrade as well. The updates make the QX80 surprisingly fetching.</p>, <p>While Infiniti made numerous changes to the way the 2018 QX80 looks, the company left well enough alone with the way it drives, and that's fine with us. The 400-horsepower 5.6-liter V8 is no fuel-economy champ, but it does an excellent job converting hydrocarbons into forward motion. Mash the accelerator, and this big beast moves with an authority we'd even call "quick." Yet it's not dramatic. The only time you hear the engine is if you gun it. In fact, that's about the only noise you'll hear, as the QX80's hushed cabin is one of its strongest points. The suspension wisely skews toward ride comfort instead of sporty handling, aided by Infiniti's Hydraulic Body Motion Control system, which helps keep the big Infiniti from leaning too much in corners without resorting to stiff springs that would ruin the ride. True, its size makes it difficult to navigate tight urban parking spots, but the Around View 360-degree camera system significantly aids even that.</p>, <p>DISTANCE CONTROL ASSIST<br>
The 2018 QX80 boasts an advanced Distance Control Assist system that works independently of things like active cruise control. Even with cruise off, the system monitors the vehicle ahead, and will automatically slow down if that vehicle starts to slow as well, bringing the QX to a full stop if necessary.<br>
<br>
HYDRAULIC BODY MOTION CONTROL<br>
While stiffer springs or anti-roll bars would keep the nearly 6,000-pound Infiniti from leaning too much in corners, both of those solutions would hurt ride comfort. Instead, the QX80 uses something called Hydraulic Body Motion Control, which utilizes active shocks to control lean in corners, without hurting the ride.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Infiniti says it drew inspiration for its 2018 QX80 interior from luxury jets; we'll take their word on that, but can confirm that the new QX80 offers a comfortable interior, with expensive-looking quilting and piping. The seats are also protected from stains. Rear-seat passengers can be entertained by a new infotainment system, and there's an updated infotainment system with a larger screen, but no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Additionally, despite the comfort -- and it is exceptionally comfortable -- the big Infiniti's 2nd-row seats don't slide forward, limiting 3rd-row legroom. The black-and-white information display between the analog gauges also looks old-school in the wrong way.</p>, <p>The odd nose, droopy headlights and ill-conceived fender vents are gone, replaced by all-new sheet metal in front that not only gathers this full-size luxury SUV into the rest of the Infiniti design fold, but makes it a genuinely handsome vehicle. It doesn't disguise the big Infiniti's size though, and at nearly 209 inches long and nearly 80 inches tall, this is a BIG SUV. Still, we like it. The proportions are spot-on, we like the kick-up of the rear-side windows even if it does limit rear visibility, and the new tailgate and fender vents all give the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx80/">Infiniti QX80</a> the kind of style that stands out for all the right reasons.</p>, <p>The only differentiator between 2018 Infiniti QX80 models is the number of wheels driven: rear-only, or all four. Standard equipment is shared between the two, and includes things like leather seating, navigation system, power liftgate, tri-zone climate control, moonroof, heated front seats and steering wheel, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and Around View monitor with Moving Object Detection. You also get luxury touches like power-folding mirrors, a leather-wrapped instrument panel, and 2nd-row captain's chairs. There's one year of complimentary subscription to the Infiniti Connection telematics system, which includes concierge service and vehicle information sent to your phone, a 13-speaker Bose AM/FM/CD/DVD Premium Audio System with USB connection and Bluetooth streaming, and front and rear sonar parking sensors.</p>, <p>Option packages on the 2018 QX80 include a Deluxe Technology Package that adds a camera-based rearview mirror, a 15-speaker Bose surround-sound system, the Hydraulic Body Motion Control suspension, and upgraded leather seats. The Theater Package adds dual 8-inch rear screens mounted in the front-seat headrests, along with wireless headphones and a remote. A Driver Assistance Package bundles all the active driver assists into one: blind-spot warning, back-up collision prevention, forward emergency braking and collision warning, active cruise control, lane-departure prevention, and so on. You can also add a 22-inch wheel-and-tire package, along with various other stand-alone options like in-car 4G LTE-based Wi-Fi.</p>, <p>The only engine available for the QX80 is Infiniti's 5.6-liter V8 driving either the rear or all four wheels through a 7-speed automatic transmission. It's an impressively powerful engine, with 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, and it lets the body-on-frame QX tow up to 8,500 pounds, quite a lot for a luxury SUV. Both rear- and all-wheel-drive (RWD, AWD) models come with Hill Start Assist and Snow Mode to help you get moving when roads are slick. Opt for AWD and you get a full-time system, and the ability to shift into a 4LO mode in case road conditions turn exceptionally rugged. But don't expect good fuel economy: The best EPA number is 20-mpg highway for rear-drive models, and we've seen averages of around 14-15 mpg in mixed driving.<br>
<br>
 5.6-liter V8<br>
 400 horsepower @ 5,800 rpm<br>
 413 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/20 mpg (RWD), 13/19 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Considering its luxury credentials, the starting Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Infiniti QX80 isn't too bad, at about $66,000 for a rear-wheel-drive model, or about $3,000 more if you want AWD. However, if you select one of the premium interior packages, such as the excellent Saddle brown interior, most of the option packages come with it, meaning your interior preference can cost you the better part of $14,000 as the price boosts to more than $80,000. Still, those prices remain competitive against the likes of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gl-class/">Mercedes-Benz GL-Class</a>, Range Rover Sport, Lincoln Navigator, Cadillac Escalade and Lexus LX 570. Check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2018 Infiniti QX80. You can expect good long-term <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> for the QX80 as well, beating the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>, similar to the Mercedes, but lagging behind the Lexus LX.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/jaguar/e-pace/2018
[<p>Jaguar leaps into the highly competitive premium subcompact crossover-SUV segment with its all-new 2018 E-Pace, which is targeted to rival the Audi Q3, BMW X2 and Mercedes-Benz GLA. While luxury and superior driving dynamics are expected, Jaguar brings something new to the table thanks to its Land Rover DNA -- strong off-road aptitude. Package those traits into one of the best-looking SUVs on the road, complemented with attractive pricing, and the British appear to have a potential winner on their hands.</p>, <p>If looking stylish is your craving, the new Jaguar E-Pace serves it up by the plateful. The gorgeous exterior of this subcompact is complemented perfectly by its stylish interior, which is beautifully designed and covered in premium upscale materials. It’s not just appearances -- sporty driving dynamics are also an E-Pace strength.<b></b></p>, <p>If you are seeking family-friendly accommodations and cargo utility, we suggest you look elsewhere. While Jaguar ensures that front passengers of all shapes and sizes are very comfortable within its new E-Pace crossover SUV, everyone (except for small children) will feel cramped in the second row. The cargo hold is acceptable for a few suitcases, but carrying anything with more volume will require folding seats flat or an optional roof-luggage system.</p>, <p>The 2018 Jaguar E-Pace is an all-new model in the automaker’s lineup. Standard models feature a turbocharged 246-horsepower 4-cylinder engine. However, performance-oriented R-Dynamic models boast an additional 50 horsepower. To celebrate the launch, Jaguar will sell a First Edition trim the first model year configured with unique colors and appointments.</p>, <p>Jaguar touts its new subcompact crossover SUV as a vehicle with the utility of an SUV, but the driving dynamics of a sport sedan -- and they aren’t exaggerating by much. Mash the accelerator pedal in the 296-horsepower premium R-Dynamic model, and there is a slight delay (engineers call it "turbo lag") that is followed by a strong surge of power -- the sprint to 60 mph takes fewer than six seconds. (The power is appreciated, but we are betting that the 246-hp model, which we didn’t get a chance to drive, is more than adequate.) Expect a 23-mpg combined fuel-economy figure, which is about average in the segment.<br>
<br>
 The ride is firm on pavement, but it’s never harsh or bothersome. Straight-line stability on the highway is exemplary, while sport-tuned suspension damping allows the E-Pace to dance through twisty corners -- the steering effort is light, but very accurate. Handling is impressive for a vehicle with a curb weight of 4,175 pounds (the new E-Pace is about 150 pounds heavier than its big brother, the F-Pace). Despite being extraordinarily capable off-road, the ride can get very jarring when the pavement ends.</br></br></p>, <p>ACTIVITY KEY<b><br>
</br></b>Jaguar offers a shockproof, and waterproof, electronic wristband that allows the wearer to lock the vehicle’s key within the cabin when they don’t have pockets (e.g., wearing a bathing suit). A simple swipe of the wristband over the E-Pace’s exterior sensor effortlessly unlocks it for the drive home.<br>
<br>
 ACTIVE DRIVELINE<b><br>
</br></b>While it is only offered with the premium engine, the performance all-wheel-drive powertrain automatically distributes power to the wheels that need it through an innovative torque-vectoring system. As a result, all-season traction and dynamic handling are improved.</br></br></p>, <p>Passengers within Jaguar’s all-new E-Pace are coddled with a stylish interior crafted from premium materials. High-resolution, configurable digital displays replace analog instruments and the infotainment system operates like an oversized tablet (warning: there’s a learning curve for its operation). The cabin is sleek, upscale, and decidedly futuristic.<br>
<br>
 The front seats are comfortable and accommodating, even for those over six-foot tall. However, second row passengers will find themselves a bit cramped -- all bets are that Jaguar wasn’t targeting those with a few teenagers in the household. The trunk will swallow a couple suitcases, or a few bags, but not much more without dropping the seats.</br></br></p>, <p>Jaguar’s design team did a spectacular job sculpting the 2018 E-Pace -- it’s arguably the most attractive SUV in its segment. The iconic Jaguar grille leads the way, with a pair of sleek cat-eye shaped headlights on either side. The greenhouse is perfectly proportioned and a pair of aggressive-looking round exhaust ports bring up the rear. Even with the standard 17-inch wheels (Jaguar offers wheels up to 20 inches in diameter), it looks fabulous. The overall design is impeccably cohesive, visually sleek, and decidedly sporty.</p>, <p>Jaguar is launching its E-Pace in seven trims: E-Pace, S, SE, R-Dynamic S, R-Dynamic SE, R-Dynamic HSE, and First Edition. All are fitted with a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine (R-Dynamic model are tuned for more horsepower) and a 9-speed automatic transmission. Standard equipment includes LED headlights, 8-way power-operated front seats, a 10-inch infotainment screen, and automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The E-Pace First Edition is offered with a Caldera Red exterior -- unique to this trim -- and Ebony Windsor leather inside the cabin (accented by Flame Red twin-needle contrast stitching). The stunning metallic paint and sporty upholstery is complemented by 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with a satin paint finish, head-up display, 18-way power-operated front seats, Activity Key, and First Edition metal treadplates.</p>, <p>Five years ago, Jaguar would have launched the E-Pace with a V6. But, that was an era before downsizing and forced induction. Turbocharged 4-cylinder engines are today’s 6-cylinder replacements -- more powerful and efficient than their larger predecessors. Under the hood of the E-Pace is a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, tuned to deliver two different outputs (premium trim levels deliver 50 more horsepower). A 9-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard across all models.<br>

[<p>Introduced just last year, the 2018 Jaguar F-Pace is the British <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand’s first-ever SUV and it has quickly become its most popular model. This all-wheel-drive compact-crossover SUV plays well on and off-road. It seats five, and in the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> tradition, it’s extremely sexy on the outside and luxurious on the inside. For 2018, the new F-Pace is improved with more standard horsepower, a radically improved in-cabin infotainment system and increases in active safety technology. With many luxury and sport variations, including the supercharged 380-horsepower S model that accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in just 5.1 seconds and an available turbodiesel engine, the new F-Pace is a worthy contender against such luxury-compact SUV stalwarts as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/glc/">Mercedes-Benz GLC</a>.</p>, <p>You’ll like the F-Pace if you want to be noticed. With the world awash in BMW X3s, Audi Q5s and Mercedes GLCs, the Jaguar is for those who want something unique. Something beautiful. It has the chops to challenge those Germans, but it also draws a crowd when you park it.</p>, <p>The quality of Jaguar vehicles is better than ever and continuing to rise steeply, but it’s statistically still behind some of its German rivals. Jaguar’s resale values also continue to lag. If ultimate reliability and high <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> are top priorities, you may want to shop other vehicles in the class.</p>, <p>For 2018, the F Pace gets more standard horsepower from its 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, an improved infotainment system with faster response, and increases in active safety technology. The optional Surround Camera System now includes Forward Traffic Detection, which alerts the driver when a vehicle is crossing his path.</p>, <p>Sitting high in the F-Pace's driver's seat and confidently aiming its bulging hood down the road feels good. The new standard turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is a powerhouse, making 247 horsepower. That’s enough to get this SUV down the road with a neck snap. Jaguar says it’ll accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 6.4 seconds. We also like the turbocharged diesel 4-cylinder engine, which provides deep torque for superb low-speed acceleration. But our favorite is the supercharged V6. It’s a thrill-maker, pumping out 380 horsepower and a mouthwatering growl from the SUV’s dual exhaust tips. With this engine Jag says the F-Pace hits 60 mph in just 5.1 seconds. The 8-speed automatic transmission is also one of the best, shifting precisely and quickly. No amateur on rugged roads, the F-Pace's full-time all-wheel-drive (AWD) system defaults to a rear-drive bias, but can seamlessly assign torque to the front wheels as needed.</p>, <p>ONBOARD WI-FI<br/> Good news for your phone-addicted teenagers: The new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-pace/">Jaguar F-Pace</a> is a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, and up to eight devices can be connected at any one time. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> also offer onboard Wi-Fi in the compact-crossover-SUV segment, but it’s still unique in the marketplace.<br/> <br/> JAGUAR INCONTROL TOUCH PRO<br/> Jag's InControl Touch Pro infotainment/navigation system is a must-have for anybody who can afford it. As part of the $3,200 Technology Pack option on F-Pace Prestige and above models, Touch Pro includes a widely configurable 12.3-inch high-definition touch screen, an ultra-quick navigation system, and a 17-speaker Meridian digital surround-sound system.<br/> </p>, <p>With good workmanship and high-quality materials, the interior of the new Jaguar F-Pace is quiet and comfortable with an understated charm and interesting details like the rotary shifter. Five adults fit comfortably with the just-right stadium-seating second row, and the feeling of roominess is enhanced by one of the biggest panorama roofs in the business. Unfortunately visibility is compromised for the driver by a thick B-pillar and a narrow view through the rear window. The standard power rear tailgate opens wide to offer a best-in-class, 33.5-cubic-foot capacity, which expands to almost twice that with the rear seatbacks folded down.</p>, <p>Remember when Jaguars reminded you of red phone booths, double-decker buses and quaint little countryside pubs? Ancient history. Jag doesn’t do stuffy and boring anymore, and its design team wanted to make sure the F-Pace doesn’t get lost in the crowd. No chance. In fact, the F-Pace draws a crowd when you park it. Long, low and wide with an athletic stance and radically raked front and rear glass, the F-Pace looks like it’s as ready for the racetrack as it is the carpool lane. But it also looks right at home parked up front at your favorite fine restaurant.</p>, <p>Beyond essentials like strong engine/transmission combinations, every Jaguar F-Pace includes all-wheel drive, weight-saving aluminum used throughout, an epic sliding panorama roof, and a 5,290-pound towing capacity. Also worth paying attention to are the SUV's power front seats and rear liftgate, 11-speaker Meridian sound system, and Jaguar EliteCare. Elite Care includes a 5-year/60,000-mile warranty, 5-year/60,000-mile free scheduled maintenance, 5-year/60,000-mile 24/7 roadside assistance program, and 5-year/unlimited-mileage subscription to Jaguar InControl Remote &amp; Protect services like a smartphone app that lets you remotely lock/unlock the doors, start the engine and heat or cool the cabin, plus automatic notification of emergency services if an airbag deploys.</p>, <p>The base 2018 F-Pace model offers an SD-card navigation system and a rearview camera option, but moving up the ladder gives you plenty of places to spend extra. F-Pace option packages offer heated seats and steering wheel, adaptive cruise control, head-up display and blind-spot monitoring. For the technocratic, there are optional Wi-Fi hotspot capability, 360 degrees of outside camera coverage and automatic parking assistance. Adaptive suspension dynamics is also available for better ride and handling, Adaptive Surface Response maximizes grip at any speed, and Configurable Dynamics allows the driver to manually set up how the F-Pace drives.</p>, <p>The new turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, which is also used in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xe/">Jaguar XE</a> and XF <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, makes 247 horsepower and is standard on all non-S models. Also available in the Premium, Prestige and R-Sport trim levels is a 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel 4-cylinder. Fear it not: This Ingenium diesel engine is torquey, fuel efficient and fun to drive. Also optional is the same 3.0-liter supercharged V6 that's making a legend out of Jag's F-Type sports car. That sweetheart of an engine comes at two levels of boost: 340 horsepower for the non-S models and 380 horsepower for S versions. It sounds sexy, with a throaty growl, and turns the F-Pace into a truly quick cat. The superb ZF 8-speed automatic comes standard on all models.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 247 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 269 lb-ft of torque @ 1,200-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/27 mpg<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel inline-4<br/> 180 horsepower @ 4,000 rpm<br/> 318 lb-ft of torque @ 1,750-2,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/33 mpg<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter supercharged V6<br/> 340 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm<br/> 332 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/23 mpg<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter supercharged V6<br/> 380 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm<br/> 332 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/23 mpg</p>, <p>2018 Jaguar F-Pace <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> start with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $43,000 including the $995 destination charge. The Premium model starts around $45,500 and the optional 20d diesel engine adds about $1,500 to the price. Pricing and feature sets move up from there, and you can add $1,400 to almost any F-Pace to get the "35t" supercharged V6 gasoline engine with 340 horsepower. The F-Pace S models start about $59,700 and come with a 380-horsepower V6. All-wheel drive and a panorama roof come on every F-Pace, which keeps the Jag reasonably price-competitive with the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. For a stronger sense of real-world F-Pace transaction prices in your area, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price. And while Jag holds no historical precedent for strength in the resale-value market, the 2018 F-Pace may hold its value better than past cats.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Jaguar F-Type <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/convertible/">convertible</a> create a direct connection to the pleasure center of your brain. Whether it's the immediate acceleration from its variety of engines, the howl of its expertly tuned exhaust, or the sumptuously cozy 2-seat interior, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-type/">Jaguar F-Type</a> has personality, sex appeal and brand cache few other cars can match. Since its debut, the F-Type has evolved, adding a hardtop to the convertible lineup, more powerful engines and even all-wheel drive. Now, the 2018 F-Type gets a new 4-cylinder engine, adding efficiency without sacrificing performance, all the better to take on the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette</a>, and more. On the other end of the performance spectrum is the F-Type SVR, with its 575-horsepower supercharged V8 engine.</p>, <p>Is it the exotic design? The bark of the exhaust when you start the engine? The wind-in-your-hair convertible or the sexy lines of the coupe? Maybe the thrust of the engine at wide-open throttle. If any of that appeals to your senses, the F-Type is worth your consideration. </p>, <p>There are two things that might keep you out of the Jaguar F-Type. One is long-term reliability, which has never exactly been a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> strength. Second is the size itself; this is a <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small car</a> inside, and although tall drivers can fit, "cozy" can become "cramped" quickly.</p>, <p>A new 4-cylinder engine promises fuel efficiency without sacrificing performance. Couple the new engine with advances to its active safety systems, and the 2018 Jaguar F-Type remains a sexy and strong alternative to the Porsche 911 and Chevrolet Corvette.</p>, <p>True to its name, the Jaguar F-Type starts with a growl before settling into a steady purr. The intensity of that growl changes depending on engine: from the subtle, slightly frantic sound of the 4-cylinder, to the metallic rasp of the V6, to the satisfyingly deep growl of the V8. Backing up all the noise is some serious performance. Jaguar claims the new 4-cylinder gets the F-Type to 60 mph in about 5.4 seconds, quick by any standard. However, if your need for speed isn't sated by that, there's the supercharged SVR at the other end of the spectrum, with its 575-horsepower supercharged V8 getting the coupe to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. Yet when you're not in Dynamic mode and just cruising around in the F-Type, it's downright civilized. The steering and suspension that are so precise on the track or mountain roads are equally good at absorbing lousy pavement.</p>, <p>THOSE SEXY LOOKS<br>
 Simultaneously classic and modern, the timeless looks of the 2018 Jaguar F-Type make it one of the sexiest cars on the road. Whether you pick the new 4-cylinder model, the all-powerful SVR, or anything in between, the jaw-dropping good looks surely played a part in your decision.<br>
<br>
 ACTIVE SPORTS EXHAUST<br>
 On the center console of the Jaguar F-Type is a small button with exhaust pipes as an icon. When you press it, a baffle opens in the exhaust system, and the F-Type sings a beautiful song. Making the car sound amazing is all it does, and we love it.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Jaguar F-Type gets new, thinner seats this year to help increase room for tall drivers. There's a wide console between the driver and passenger, with a prominent grab handle for the passenger's left hand in case there's any doubt about this car's true purpose. Yes, as befitting a Jaguar, it's luxurious, too. The materials inside are all first-rate and assembly is beyond reproach, and we love the gimmick of the center vents rising from the dash. The lone downside is the 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system, which features a nonintuitive design that needs another round with the human-interface team.</p>, <p>New on the Jaguar F-Type's exterior this year are LED headlights, and redesigned front and rear bumpers, giving the car a slightly more modern look without reducing the impact of its classic lines. By classic, we don't mean it apes another car; rather than imitate its past, Jaguar's designers crafted a unique shape that's still instantly recognizable. The coupe's tight rear window gives the impression of the fenders flaring even more than they do, while the convertible just looks right, top up or down. The SVR, befitting its ultra-performance nature, features enhanced aerodynamics of the front bumper and splitter for better performance.</p>, <p>Whether you choose coupe or convertible, the base F-Type 4-cylinder comes standard with 12-way-power leather-and-suede cloth seats with memory, single-zone climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with navigation and a rearview camera, and an excellent 380-watt Meridian system with AM/FM/CD/USB player, HD Radio tuner and Bluetooth connectivity. Also standard is the Active Sports Exhaust, rear parking sensors, and a torque-vectoring system that uses braking to help control the rear of the car in turns. Like other new Jaguars, the F-Type comes with EliteCare, which includes five years/60,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance.</p>, <p>There are numerous drivetrain choices for the 2018 Jaguar F-Type, including two supercharged V6 engines, two supercharged V8 engines, rear- and all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD), and a manual transmission in V6 models. Convertible buyers can choose the color of the soft top, and all F-Type buyers have a choice of sport or <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> seats. Option packages include an all-leather interior, carbon-ceramic brakes for intense track days, a Drive Package with blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist and active cruise control, and two different climate packages, the better one adding heated and cooled front seats, a heated windshield, heated steering wheel, and dual-zone climate control.</p>, <p>This gets a little complicated. The base engine is a 296-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that drives the rear wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. The supercharged 3.0-liter V6 comes in either 340-, 380- and 400-horsepower variants, the first two available with either a 6-speed manual transmission driving the rear wheels, or an 8-speed automatic driving the rear or all four wheels; the 400-horsepower version is available only with the automatic. The V8 engine also comes in two different power outputs -- 550 or 575 horsepower -- and only with an automatic and AWD. All F-Type models require premium fuel, and all come with an auto start/stop system to help save it; you can shut it off if it's intrusive (it is).<br>

A convertible starts off $3,100 higher. That's with the new 4-cylinder; if you want V6 power in your coupe it'll cost nearly $69,000, and more than $100,000 if you want a V8. An F-Type SVR convertible with the 575-horsepower V8 starts at nearly $126,000. That price spectrum covers a wide range of vehicles, from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/boxster/">Porsche Boxster</a> and Cayman up to the Porsche 911. Rivals include the Chevy Corvette, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/z4/">BMW Z4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/slc/">Mercedes-Benz SLC</a>; all start lower than the Jaguar, but only the Corvette outmuscles it.

The F-Type's <a alt_o_t="Residual Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">residual value</a> is expected to fare pretty well, though not quite matching Porsche’s.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/jaguar/xe/2018
[<p>The new 2018 Jaguar XE is a real-deal, rear-wheel-drive (RWD) sports sedan. It’s also the newest, smallest and least expensive model from the British <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand. The sophisticated XE seats five and packs premium amenities, advanced safety features and a lightweight all-aluminum structure. Five trim levels are offered with a variety of engines including a 380-horsepower supercharged V6 and a fuel-efficient turbodiesel. All-wheel drive (AWD) is also available for $2,500. Although its styling is a bit conservative for its class, this new <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> is classically handsome and appeals with strong performance, an impressive warranty and a starting price around $35,000. After years of sitting out the entry-level, luxury-sedan game, Jaguar finally has the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a>, Mercedes C-Class, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus IS</a> in its sights.</p>, <p>In a sea of BMW 3 Series, Audi A4s and Mercedes C-Class, the Jaguar is something your neighbors don’t have. You’ll like the XE if you want to bust out of the ordinary. It has the chops to challenge those popular Germans, but it stands on its own.<b></b></p>, <p>The quality of Jaguar vehicles is better than ever and continuing to improve rapidly, but it’s statistically still behind some of its German and Japanese rivals. Jaguar’s resale values also continue to lag. If ultimate reliability is your top priorities you may want to shop other vehicles.</p>, <p>For 2018, the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xe/">Jaguar XE</a> gets a more powerful standard engine, a 247-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, an improved infotainment system and increases in active safety technology. The optional Surround Camera System now includes Forward Traffic Detection, which alerts drivers when a vehicle is crossing their path.</p>, <p>Most buyers will be happy with the efficient turbo 4-cylinder that enables 0-60-mph sprints in just 6.5 seconds. This standard powerplant is smooth and it’s paired well with Jaguar’s 8-speed automatic transmission, which is one of the best, shifting precisely and quickly. This is a fun car to drive with this combination. Less exhilarating but more efficient is the 2.0-liter turbodiesel in the XE 20d. It isn't slow at 7.5 seconds to 60 mph, and the engine pulls strongly thanks to its gargantuan 318 lb-ft of torque. The XE 35t, with a 340-horsepower supercharged V6, records 0-60-mph blasts of five seconds. That engine is glorious in sound and performance, and pairs well with both the XE's excellent AWD system or in traditional rear-drive form. Steering feel is overly artificial, but the response is precise and the effort is perfect. Those who opt for bigger wheels must contend with a stiff ride.</p>, <p>ONBOARD WI-FI<br/> For those with phone-addicted teenagers, the new Jaguar XE is available with 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, and up to eight devices can be connected at any one time. Audi A4 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a> also offer onboard Wi-Fi in the entry-luxury-sedan segment, but it remains unique in the marketplace.<br/> <br/> JAGUAR INCONTROL TOUCH PRO<br/> After years of lagging the competition in the infotainment and connectivity wars, Jag's new InControl Touch Pro infotainment/navigation system finally measures up. Touch Pro includes a widely configurable 12.3-inch high-definition touch screen, an ultra-quick navigation system, and a 17-speaker Meridian digital surround-sound system. It is intuitive to use and quick to respond.<br/> </p>, <p>Modern, sophisticated and well-assembled, the interior of the new 2018 Jaguar XE mimics the design also used in the brand’s F-Pace <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> and XF sedan. Front passengers are treated to comfortable seats, and Jaguar uses a good mix of a touch-based screen and traditional buttons for audio and climate controls. It’s a very clean design, simple and intuitive to use. Unfortunately, the ambiance isn’t as inspired as the interior of the Mercedes C-Class or the Audi A4. Calling the 2018 Jaguar XE a family sedan is a stretch. It seats five, but snugly, and rear-seat legroom is tight.</p>, <p>Simple, stylish and a little understated, the compact XE sedan looks like a smaller iteration of the brand’s XF <a alt_o_t="Midsize Sedan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-sedans/2000009275/">midsize sedan</a>. This is hardly a bad thing; however, it may be a little too familiar. Some critics have called the XE’s design overly conservative. Some think Jaguar should have taken a few more chances with the XE’s shape. We appreciate the sedan’s long hood, downward sloping roof and curtailed tail. We also applaud Jag for not inflicting a gaping grille on the XE, when such grilles have become all the rage. We also appreciate the delicate adornment of chrome.</p>, <p>Step into the least expensive Jaguar XE compact sports sedan, and you'll get Luxtec faux leather in black, tan or gray, dual-zone climate control, rear-passenger vents, 17-inch alloy wheels and moonroof. The standard infotainment system consists of Jaguar's InControl 8-inch touch-screen display and 6-speaker, 80-watt audio system with HD Radio, USB inputs and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. Surprisingly, a rearview camera still costs extra. We recommend the XE Premium, which adds a folding rear seat, auto-dimming and folding side mirrors, an upscale 11-speaker Meridian audio system and HomeLink garage-door opener. All new XE <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> come with a 5-year/60,000-mile warranty and complimentary maintenance/roadside assistance.</p>, <p>The 2018 Jag XE offers a wide array of extras, many of which are bundled into higher trims. Prestige models, for instance, include navigation, leather interior with heated front seats and heated steering wheel, keyless entry and power-adjustable steering column. Top-line Jaguar XE R-Sport and S trims ladle on a slew of otherwise optional safety features that include blind-spot monitoring, front and rear parking aids, autonomous emergency braking and lane-departure warning. Additional options vary by trim and include cooled front seats, power-operated trunk, power rear sunshade, CD/DVD player, in-car Wi-Fi 4G hotspot, and parallel/perpendicular park assist.</p>, <p>Four engines are available in the new 2018 Jaguar XE. The base powerplant is a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline 4-cylinder that makes 247 horsepower and is offered with RWD. A 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbodiesel engine is optional, and can be had with traction-enhancing AWD. It makes 67 less horsepower but generates tremendous torque: 318 lb-ft. It’s also the undisputed fuel-economy king of the group with 42 mpg on the highway. Two supercharged 3.0-liter V6s are offered. Most trim levels offer a very strong 340-horsepower version of that engine, which can be paired with RWD or AWD. The new top-of-the-line, rear-drive-only S model gets a 380-horsepower version of the V6 and it’s hell bent for leather. All engines are linked to an 8-speed automatic transmission.<br>

[<p>The 2018 Jaguar XF performance sedan continues to make inroads against better-established models like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/cts/">Cadillac CTS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>. Joining the sedan this year is a new <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/wagon/">wagon</a>, which <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> calls the Sportbrake. Like the sedan, the 2018 XF Sportbrake reveals a stunning design with an air of exclusivity that is becoming increasingly uncommon in this segment. The XF’s interior is traditionally British in its reserved styling, but the materials are of the highest quality and craftsmanship. When it comes to powertrains, Jaguar provides the XF with no less than two supercharged, one turbocharged and one diesel-engine option, all mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission that can route power to either the rear wheels or all four.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a midsize-performance sedan as luxurious as it is exclusive, the 2018 Jaguar XF deserves your full attention. The XF Sportbrake combines the best attributes of a performance sedan and an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, giving the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v90/">Volvo V90</a> Cross Country and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> wagon a run for their money.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s reputation for trouble-free ownership, although rapidly improving, still lags behind most of its chief rivals. Those seeking eye-popping exterior and interior designs might be more satisfied with a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a>, BMW 5 Series or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q70/">Infiniti Q70</a>. A limited dealer network might also pose problems.</p>, <p>For 2018, the base <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xf/">Jaguar XF</a> sedan gains a new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. The 2018 XF Sportbrake wagon joins the lineup with a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 and standard all-wheel drive. New options include a gesture-activated power trunklid, 12.3-inch virtual instrument cluster and more driver-assist features.</p>, <p>While any number of performance <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> can leave us satisfied after a few hours behind the wheel, only a handful linger in our memories long after the test drive is over. Jaguar’s 2018 XF luxury-performance sedan definitely makes the short list. Our test vehicle’s 380-horsepower supercharged V6 delivered rocket-like acceleration and an abundance of torque for passing and merging. The XF’s steering fears no turn, and the response through the wheel never felt vague or over-assisted. Jaguar’s complex adaptive suspension was able to compensate for whatever road conditions awaited us, and although the 8-speed automatic reacted quickly to inputs from the paddle shifters, we think the automatic doesn’t really need much help finding the right gear. The XF’s user-selectable drive mode allows a choice of Normal, Eco, Dynamic and Winter settings. We were most impressed by the Dynamic setting’s suspension calibration, but some editors found the rather abrupt shift points somewhat unsettling.</p>, <p>INCONTROL TOUCH PRO<br>
 Jaguar infotainment and in-cabin technology have improved by leaps and bounds, and nowhere is this more evident than with the InControl Touch Pro system. The setup includes an app to control vehicle functions and smartphone-inspired features like gesture control.<br>
<br>
 JAGUAR ELITECARE<br>
 Putting its money where its mouth is, Jaguar backs the 2018 XF sedan and XF Sportbrake wagon with a 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty. This package also includes all scheduled maintenance, roadside assistance as well a 5-year/unlimited-miles warranty for the InControl Remote and Protect feature.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Jaguar XF <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> sedan’s interior isn't fancy or flashy. Instead, it trades chrome highlights and out-there design for a simple, straightforward interface that's tasteful and elegant. The big InControl Touch Pro system takes center stage, offering most functions through its touch-screen interface. That could be a problem, but the big screen and easy-to-see icons make using it simple. The heated and cooled seats are comfortable when cruising, and plenty supportive for those times when you just have to blast through that onramp. The rear seats are also decent, and the around-town quiet is pure luxury sedan.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s 2018 XF sedan isn't a radical styling departure from the previous version, and we're okay with that. The latest XF maintains the same basic profile, with the long hood and short trunk emphasizing the rear-wheel-drive (RWD) configuration. The grille is properly upright for better aerodynamics and to better tie it in with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xe/">Jaguar XE</a> and revised XJ sedans. The LED accents on the headlights look modern and just right, and vents in the front bumper route air over the front wheels, reducing drag and helping fuel economy. The 2018 XF Sportbrake wagon is a more alluring prospect.</p>, <p>Jaguar’s 2018 XF comes as nicely equipped as you'd expect of a high-end luxury sedan. There's dual-zone climate control, cruise control, power windows and all that kind of stuff, sure. There's also an 8-inch version of the InControl touch-screen interface, start/stop technology, rearview camera, and a 380-watt 12-speaker Meridian sound system. Other standard features include Jaguar Drive Control with its selectable modes, 3-position memory for the driver's seat and keyless start. Mid-level Prestige models come standard with heated leather seats and navigation, while top-end R-Sport models add exterior design cues, lane-keeping assist and more.</p>, <p>XF S models come with an upgraded engine, putting out 380 horsepower to the standard model's 340. Other options include the InControl Touch Pro, which adds a larger touch screen, a navigation system with a solid-state drive, and a host of other features. Also available are front and rear parking sensors, a comfort and convenience package that includes soft-close doors, plus cooled and heated front seats and heated rear seats. A Driver Assistance Pack adds adaptive cruise control, proximity cameras and traffic-sign recognition. There's also a luxury package that adds a suede headliner, among other interior upgrades.</p>, <p>With the 2018 Jaguar XF, buyers can choose from two versions of a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 engine, one turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engine and one 4-cylinder 2.0-liter turbodiesel. The first V6 is a 340-horsepower version, available in Prestige, Premium and R Sport models. Opt for the XF S and you get the 380-horsepower version. Interestingly, torque figures for both engines are identical. The 2.0-liter turbodiesel offers nearly identical torque but with vastly better fuel economy, while the 2.0-liter gas engine splits the difference. Both are available on all but the S trim. All Jaguar XF models are available in all-wheel drive (AWD), and all route their power through an 8-speed automatic transmission that offers shift-for-yourself paddles on the steering wheel.<br>

Of course, prices increase the higher up the ladder you climb, and if you opt for the quicker XF S with AWD, prices start just below $69,000, and climb up from there. The Sportbrake wagon starts around $71,500. That’s in line with its competitors from Germany, Japan and the United States, and Jaguar has the best warranty of any of them.

[<p>The 2018 Jaguar XJ is a large and luxurious sedan in the twilight years of this current generation. As such, it cannot offer some of the semi-autonomous technologies that newer rivals come with almost as a matter of course. Instead, the XJ provides a singular driving experience, one that combines all the comfort worthy of a flagship sedan with a sinewy control. Put one of Jaguar’s mighty supercharged V8 engines into the mix and the thrill of the thrust becomes intoxicating. Ease off the throttle though, and there’s still much to enjoy, from the quality of the leather to the burled walnut trim to the excellent Meridian sound system.</p>, <p>Rivals like the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS seem a) too common and b) a tad sterile. The 2018 XJ has plenty of character to accompany its space and plushness, and, in V8 form, more than enough acceleration. The V6 is pretty punchy too.</p>, <p>…you’re looking for cutting-edge car tech. In which case, check out the all-new 2019 Audi A8. Also, as great as Jaguars are, and even though they often score above average in customer satisfaction surveys, their resale values aren’t as strong as Lexus or the German marques.</p>, <p>An 825-watt/20-speaker Meridian audio system, Wi-Fi, and a 10.2-inch infotainment screen are now all standard, along with some advanced driver aids, including All-Surface Progress Control. A new performance model is the XJR575, taking over from the 550-horsepower XJR with 25 more horses.</p>, <p>The XJ uses a lot of aluminum in its construction, which doesn’t necessarily make the car light, but allows Jaguar better scope for an even weight distribution. It’s this fine balance that’s at the core of the XJ’s driving appeal. It’s also adept at highway cruising. The only dynamic drawback is light steering. That's fine when parking, but we would prefer more feedback on twisting roads. Every version has an 8-speed automatic transmission with manual-shifting control, and the standard 340-horsepower XJ R-Sport is sufficiently lively. The V8-powered models are quicker, of course. The new-for-2018 XJR575 is particularly formidable. It sprints from a standstill to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds and hits a top speed of 186 mph, which is phenomenal for a long-wheelbase luxury car. However, it still delivers on Jaguar's reputation for a comfortable ride, thanks to the standard active-damping suspension.</p>, <p>SUPERCHARGED ENGINES<br>
 In the quest for power and efficiency, most makers are turning to turbochargers. But superchargers have their own attributes. They enhance acceleration right from the lowest engine speed. Listen carefully (the XJ is a super-silent high-class conveyance, after all) and there’s also a subtly thrilling whoosh that turbochargers don’t have.<br>
<br>
 INCONTROL INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM<br>
 Jaguar’s InControl infotainment system includes features like swipe and pinch-to-zoom controls, the kind of gestures we use daily with smartphones. Dual-view technology allows the driver to monitor the audio setup on the new 10.2-inch screen, while navigation information can be shown on the 12.3-inch configurable instrument display.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Spacious and inviting, the interior of the 2018 Jaguar XJ is awash in soft hides, real woods and chrome trim. Its leather-covered dash and door panels exude old-world luxury and craftsmanship with a classy analog clock and double stitching. Yet the modern shapes and switchgear are pure 21st century. It’s a wonderful and dynamic blend that never feels old-fashioned or stuffy. The seats are exceedingly comfortable, and the quilted upholstery imparts a look and feel of fine furniture. The Jag’s rotary shift knob rises theatrically when the engine is fired up.</p>, <p>It seems like Jaguars have always been beautiful and the 2018 Jag XJ is arguably one of the marque’s most agreeable designs. A long, flowing shape is accentuated by athletic curves and an understated elegance. The XJR575 heightens the drama with hood vents and black 20-inch wheels that strike a contrast with the red-painted brake calipers. The long-wheelbase models manage to add five inches to the overall length without spoiling the profile. Downsides are a trunk that's small for the class (15.2 cubic feet) and the low roofline, which means tall passengers have to watch their heads climbing into the back.</p>, <p>Call it “entry level” instead of “base” because standard equipment in the least expensive 2018 XJ is far from basic. This includes a panoramic moonroof, 19-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery (even the dashboard), navigation, digital LCD gauge cluster, adaptive suspension, power-closing doors, rain-sensing wipers, parking sensors at both ends, and satellite radio. Plus forward-collision mitigation and blind-spot monitoring. Versions with a V8 have an active differential for superior traction. The XJL Portfolio enjoys quad-zone climate control, along with heated/cooled seats front and rear. The high-performance XJR575 has sport seats, sport exhaust and a sport-tuned suspension.</p>, <p>Regular length or long wheelbase, rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, V6 or V8 engine -- these are the first decisions to make when buying the 2018 XJ. After that, it’s down to tastes and budget. Adaptive cruise control is available, so are massaging seats and a heated windshield. Long-wheelbase models offer a 1,300-watt/26-speaker Meridian audio upgrade, reclining rear seats, self-parking feature for parallel and perpendicular spaces, 360-degree camera system, and a powered rear sunshade.</p>, <p>A supercharged 3.0-liter V6 brings a respectable 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque to the 2018 R-Sport and XJL Portfolio, which can be fitted with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD). The XJ/XJL Supercharged versions are rear-drive only and propelled by 470 horsepower and 424 lb-ft from a supercharged 5.0-liter V8. A boosted version of this engine endows the rear-drive XJR575 with 575 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque. Bear in mind that 500 horsepower is generally considered to be a lot of muscle. All versions have an 8-speed automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.<br>

The entry-level XJ R-Sport has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $76,400 including the $995 destination charge, while the lowest-priced XJL Portfolio long-wheelbase model starts at about $84,500. Keep climbing that ladder, and we’re looking at nearly $125,000 for the XJR575 before options push the price beyond $130,000. While the V6 is fine, the V8 engine is worth the step up to the mid-$90,000 range for either the short- or long-wheelbase models. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what buyers are paying in your area. While the 2018 Jaguar XJ meets or beats its German and Japanese competition on price, those cars generally have better resale values.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/jeep/cherokee/2018
[<p>The 2018 Jeep Cherokee is just one student in a crowded class that includes best-sellers like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a>. With a dozen other rivals in the compact-SUV segment, it can be difficult to stand out. Yet the Cherokee manages to do so, thanks largely to its inherent "Jeep-ness." That is, its rugged image isn't just for show. All models have an attitude for adventure, and properly outfitted such as in Trailhawk form, the Cherokee is a legitimate off-roader. In everyday commuting, the Cherokee is comfortable and quiet, and boasts a strong roster of tech and amenities. It's also one of the last small <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> to offer a V6 engine, which is fortunate because the standard 4-cylinder can feel anemic.</p>, <p>If you have an affinity for the outdoors or just want to look like you do, the 2018 Cherokee will back you up with its rugged looks and engineering chops that enable it to escape civilization. If you want a <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">compact SUV</a> with a V6, the Cherokee still offers one.</p>, <p>Subjectively, your eyes may not like the Cherokee's styling, and objectively this <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jeep/">Jeep</a> SUV has less interior room than a Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. If you prefer sportier, athletic manners, go for the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>. If you want Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, you'll also have to look elsewhere.</p>, <p>Jeep has dropped the Sport trim from the 2018 Cherokee lineup, making the Latitude the new base model, and has added a step-up Latitude Plus trim. Trailhawk and Limited models gain standard features including blind-spot monitoring and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>While you probably expect the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a> to stand apart from rivals like the Honda CR-V where the pavement ends, you might be pleasantly surprised to know that it's quite comfortable and quiet on-road, too. It's not very fun to drive in corners, but it shines on the highway, taking some of the misery from a long commute. The standard 4-cylinder isn't very peppy, so bring patience for passing and getting up to speed. The optional V6 handles tasks better, but the 9-speed transmission that's linked to both engines can be hesitant but seems to be improving over earlier versions. If you are one for off-road adventures, or just live where snow and muddy roads are part of life, you'll appreciate the Selec-Terrain system on 4-wheel-drive models that optimizes the Cherokee for such conditions with the twist of a dial.</p>, <p>V6 ENGINE<br/> The Jeep Cherokee is one of only two non-luxury compact SUVs to offer a V6 (<a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mitsubishi/">Mitsubishi</a>'s Outlander is the other). Where its rivals have turned to turbocharged 4-cylinders for extra power, the Jeep gets it the old-fashioned way with extra cylinders and more displacement.<br/> <br/> TOWING CAPACITY<br/> Here's another reason to opt for the V6. With this engine, the 2018 Cherokee's towing capacity increases from 2,000 pounds with the 4-cylinder to 4,500 pounds, an impressive figure for a small SUV.<br/> </p>, <p>The Cherokee's 2-row/5-passenger interior blends traditional Jeep cues -- such as the trapezoidal "center stack" -- with modern touches to create an attractive and upscale layout. The front seats are surprisingly well-padded and comfortable. The heated and ventilated top-of-the-line seats also come with power adjustments and memory. The 2nd-row seats adjust forward and backward for better legroom, and split 60/40 for maximum cargo flexibility. On Latitude Plus and higher models, the front-passenger seat also folds. Still, the Cherokee can't touch cargo-carrying capacity of the CR-V: 54.9 cubic feet with rear seats folded, vs. 75.8 cubic feet in the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a>.</p>, <p>"Polarizing" is one way to describe the Jeep Cherokee, most notably regarding its headlights. It's one thing to stray from the traditional Jeep design aesthetic of round headlights flanking a 7-slot grille, but quite another to ditch the appearance of headlights entirely, in favor of thin light housings that seem to squint. But there remain other Jeep characteristics, such as the 7-slot grille that folds it into the hood. The less-controversial rear resembles the Grand Cherokee SUV. Trailhawk versions kick up the attitude with a higher ride, red-painted front tow hooks, skidplates and more aggressive front and rear treatments.</p>, <p>With 2018's trim shuffle, the Jeep Cherokee lineup now starts with the Latitude trim, which includes air conditioning, high-intensity-discharge (HID) headlights, 17-inch aluminum wheels and rearview camera. The basic Uconnect infotainment system includes a 5-inch display with rearview camera monitor, and 6-speaker audio system with AM/FM radio, USB/auxiliary inputs and Bluetooth connectivity. If you can afford the extra $1,900, you're better off in the new Latitude Plus trim, which includes the larger 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system with SiriusXM satellite radio, cloth and leather seats, power driver's seat and 115-volt A/C.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the Cherokee Limited adds a power liftgate, blind-spot monitoring (both optional on Latitude Plus), power-adjustable driver's seat, dual-zone climate control, universal garage remote, 18-inch wheels and remote engine start. Cherokee Overland trims have premium leather seating, power-adjustable passenger seat, navigation, Alpine premium audio system and cornering fog lights. Cherokee Trailhawk trims add off-road-oriented features, including the Jeep Active Drive II system with Drive Lock and rock-crawling terrain mode. Options range from safety/driver-assist systems like adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and automatic emergency braking to a dual-pane sunroof and ventilated front seats. Notably absent are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>Two engines are offered in the 2018 Cherokee. Standard is 2.4-liter Tigershark 4-cylinder that makes 184 horsepower, not a lot as this vehicle can top 4,000 pounds. Better suited is the 271-horsepower, 3.2-liter V6, standard on the 4x4 Overland and optional on all other models. Both engines use a 9-speed automatic transmission, whether equipped with front-wheel drive (FWD) or 4-wheel drive (4WD). Three different 4WD systems are available, starting with the base Jeep Active Drive I with a single-speed transfer case. Active Drive II has a 2-speed transfer case, while Active Drive Lock is reserved for the Trailhawk, which also includes the Rock mode in the Selec-Terrain system. The Cherokee is rated to tow 2,000 pounds with the 4-cylinder or 4,500 with the V6.<br>

The new Compass has style, substance and impressive technology, all wrapped in a <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">compact SUV</a> form with a tempting starting price around $22,000. The 2018 Jeep Compass is something of a "tweener," slotting between the subcompact Renegade and the compact Cherokee, though style-wise it resembles the handsome Grand Cherokee flagship. The Compass is small enough to be easy to maneuver, but large enough to make its presence known and deliver a comfortable highway ride. The Compass isn't the most powerful compact SUV, but it upholds its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jeep/">Jeep</a> credentials by being able to outperform rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue%20sport/">Nissan Rogue Sport</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/tucson/">Hyundai Tucson</a> when the pavement ends.</p>, <p>More than just a small Jeep at an affordable price, the 2018 Compass looks good, is comfortable, and surprisingly quiet on the road. And unlike other small <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, this one is quite capable off-road, especially when dressed in Trailhawk trim.</p>, <p>There's no alternative to the somewhat anemic 180-horsepower engine in the Compass, while competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a> and Hyundai Tucson offer turbocharged upgrades. Additionally, the 9-speed automatic transmission can feel hesitant to shift.</p>, <p>The Jeep Compass was all-new just last year, so there are only minor changes for 2018. You can now get a high-end Limited model in front-wheel drive (FWD), not just 4-wheel drive (4WD).</p>, <p>The 2018 Jeep Compass is built on the same underpinnings as the smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> and larger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a>, and it behaves like a successful blend of the two. The 9-speed automatic transmission that's the only choice for 4WD automatic-transmission models hampers power delivery from the 180-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine, and we shut off the intrusive start/stop system. (A 6-speed automatic is offered for front-drive models, and a 6-speed manual is standard on lower trims.) When the road begins to twist and turn, the Compass isn't as nimble as competitors like the Kia Sportage or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mazda/">Mazda</a>'s CX-3 or CX-5. But nothing can touch the Compass Trailhawk off-road, thanks to its raised ride height, more rugged tires (including a full-size spare), skidplates, a special crawl mode that locks the transmission in first gear, an additional Rock mode in the 4WD system, and more off-road-oriented hardware and technology.</p>, <p>COMPASS TRAILHAWK<br/> The Compass Trailhawk is a unique proposition in the compact-crossover SUV segment. With lifted ride height, a low-range setup -- not a 2-range transfer case, though -- and other mechanical and electronic tricks, it's far more capable in off-road situations than you might expect a car-based <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV to be.<br/> <br/> UCONNECT 4<br/> We already like the Uconnect system in various <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chrysler/">Chrysler</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/dodge/">Dodge</a>, Jeep and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/fiat/">Fiat</a> models, and this latest version fixes what few complaints we had. It's far quicker, with a faster response to tapping the screen. And importantly, it incorporates Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.<br/> </p>, <p>If you've driven a Jeep in the past couple years, the Compass' 5-passenger interior will be distinctly familiar. There are big vents flanking the dash's outer edge and the infotainment screen, comfortable seats for the front two occupants, and controls that are easy to use and find. Rear-seat passengers are treated to 38.3 inches of legroom -- more than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry/">Toyota Camry</a> sedan -- and there's over 27 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, plenty for gear and shopping bags. Folding the seats more than doubles that space, to just under 60 cubic feet.</p>, <p>The 2018 Jeep Compass looks like a smaller Grand Cherokee, which is welcome to our eyes. A black, 2-tone roof is standard on the Trailhawk and Limited models, and optional on the Latitude. The Compass has its share of "Easter eggs" -- hidden design elements like the Loch Ness monster on the rear hatch glass -- that will surprise and delight buyers. Limited models offer more chrome on the exterior, while Trailhawk models double down on off-road ruggedness with increased ground clearance, skidplates, a blackout anti-glare hood and snazzy red tow hooks.</p>, <p>The Jeep Compass is offered in four trims: Sport, Latitude, Trailhawk and Limited. The least expensive Jeep Compass Sport model comes with some respectable features for its roughly $22,000 starting price, including keyless entry and push-button start, rearview camera and a 6-speaker infotainment system with 5-inch touch screen, Bluetooth streaming and voice control. We recommend stepping up to the Latitude model. In addition to more standard features like automatic headlights, cornering fog lights, 17-inch wheels, ambient interior lighting and illuminated vanity mirrors, it opens the door for options like the power-adjustable driver's seat, navigation and safety systems like blind-spot monitoring.</p>, <p>The Compass is available in both Sport and Latitude models with 4WD and a manual transmission, a rare combination these days. The Jeep Compass Trailhawk includes leather interior, dual-zone climate control, 7-inch color LCD display and 8.4-inch Uconnect center display with a 1-year subscription to SiriusXM satellite radio, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration (a 7-inch version is optional on Sport and Latitude models). Top-line Limited models get 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, heated front seats and auto-dimming rearview mirror. Options include a Beats premium audio system and active-safety features like lane-keep assistance, blind-spot monitoring and forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>The only engine for the Compass is a 180-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder powering either the front or all four wheels. A 6-speed manual comes standard on all Sport models, and is available on 4WD Latitude models. If you want a FWD Compass with an automatic, it's going to be a 6-speed, while 4WD models get the 9-speed automatic. Automatic-equipped Compasses get a start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle. Fuel economy is pretty good; manual FWD Compass models get up to 32 mpg on the highway. The engine is smooth and quiet enough, but power is only adequate for an SUV that weighs up to 3,600 pounds in Trailhawk form. Note that 4WD Compass models can tow up to 2,000 pounds, respectable for this size SUV.<br>

Add $1,500 if you want 4-wheel drive. The Latitude is more recommendable, but is also over $3,000 more. The Trail Rated Jeep Compass Trailhawk starts just shy of $30,000. With options, the Trailhawk and Limited Compass can reach over $34,000. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. In addition to its tweener-size status, the Compass' pricing also sits between subcompact SUVs like its Renegade brother and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a>, and compact SUVs like its other brother the Cherokee and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>. Similar in price are the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> and the new Nissan Rogue Sport.

[<p>The 2018 Grand Cherokee is <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jeep/">Jeep</a>'s flagship <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, a 2-row/5-passenger hauler with a model lineup spanning from rather basic to absolutely bonkers. For 2018, the latter end of that spectrum just pushed beyond all rationality with the new Grand Cherokee Trackhawk, which packs the 707-horsepower supercharged V8 from its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/dodge/">Dodge</a> Hellcat cousins. As the Grand Cherokee nameplate celebrates its 25th anniversary, it continues to improve on its formula for a rugged, powerful yet civilized <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUV</a>. Yes, it still offers off-road capability that few rivals outside a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/4runner/">Toyota 4Runner</a> can match, all while improving on features more important to today's buyers like Apple CarPlay integration. This Jeep faces a range of rivals, but none can match its breadth of trim choices or power.</p>, <p>If you want a rugged yet refined 5-passenger midsize SUV that packs plenty of power and room, there's probably a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/grand%20cherokee/">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> for you. Its off-road credentials are legit, while higher trims could pass for a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV. The new Trackhawk, meanwhile, is the world's most powerful and quickest production SUV.</p>, <p>If you could care less about off-road capability and tough appeal, a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a> or Chevy Traverse are more car-like and have higher fuel efficiency. They also offer 3-row seating, something not found in the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/jeep/grand%20cherokee/2018/">2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee</a>.</p>, <p>While admittedly niche, the 707-horsepower, roughly $87,000 Trackhawk is the big newsmaker for the 2018 Grand Cherokee. The rest of the lineup benefits from improved infotainment offerings that include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. The Sterling Edition marks the Grand Cherokee's 25th anniversary.</p>, <p>For all its off-road capability, the 2018 Grand Cherokee is remarkably refined in the city and on highways. That's a good thing, because that's where most will spend their time. While the Grand Cherokee's character varies depending on which engine you choose, all are civilized and easy to maneuver. Steering feel can be too soft at times, and the Grand Cherokee's tough design can result in wind noise. For the adventurous who plan off-highway excursions, know the GC is up to the task thanks to ample ground clearance and a choice of 4-wheel-drive systems. The Jeep Grand Cherokee <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/srt/">SRT</a> and the new Trackhawk bring a different kind of performance to the table. With a 4.8-second 0-60 mph time, the 425-horsepower SRT is sports-car fast. Churning the 707 supercharged horses under the Trackhawk's hood, we did 0-60 mph in 3.4 seconds -- even quicker than its stated time of 3.5 seconds. These high-performance Grand Cherokees excel in a straight line, but in corners perform about as well as can be expected of a 5,000-plus pound SUV.</p>, <p>JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE TRACKHAWK<br/> A 707-horsepower Jeep may seem the epitome of automotive absurdity -- and in some respects it is -- but this ultra-performance SUV is still a Grand Cherokee. Unlike a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a> Hellcat, the Trackhawk has the all-weather traction and utility expected of a sport-utility vehicle.<br/> <br/> QUADRA-LIFT AIR SUSPENSION<br/> Jeep’s new Grand Cherokee SUV offers an optional air suspension with five separate height settings. At its highest, the Grand Cherokee delivers 10.6 inches of ground clearance. At its lowest setting, entry and exit are made easier and aerodynamics is improved. Trailhawks get a modified version for improved wheel articulation.</p>, <p>Depending on trim, the Grand Cherokee spans from a reasonably comfortable SUV to one capable of giving some luxury brands a run for their money. All models are 2-row/5-passenger configurations -- there is no 3rd-row option. This layout means good room for passengers and a healthy 36.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats. Folded, that space expands to 68.3 cubic feet. Base Laredo models look the part with cloth and manually adjusted front seats, but stepping up just one trim brings power operation to the driver. Higher-end models are awash in leather and feature heated and ventilated front seats.</p>, <p>The 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV has a muscular, handsome design. True to its off-road roots, the GC has 8.6 inches of ground clearance, with the performance-oriented SRT model sitting slightly lower (8.3 inches), and the high-performance Trackhawk lower still (8.1 inches). The new Trackhawk also stands out with quad tailpipes and "supercharged" emblazoned on the lower front doors. It also gets distinctive red tow hooks, an anti-glare hood decal, and 18-inch off-road wheels. Despite its tall profile, the Grand Cherokee is easy to get into, making it convenient for the vertically challenged. Conversely, the liftgate can be a bit difficult to reach when fully extended, but you can opt for the power-operated liftgate.</p>, <p>The Grand Cherokee lineup now spans seven trims, including the new, roughly $87,000 Trackhawk high-performance SUV. Of course, most buyers will stay far south of that. Starting with the base Laredo, you get a V6 engine, new higher-resolution 7-inch touch-screen Uconnect system, dual-zone climate control, parking sensors and a backup camera. We recommend stepping up to at least a Limited model. This adds a power liftgate, power front seats, heated front and rear seats, and the ability to opt for the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 or 3.0-liter diesel V6.</p>, <p>From advanced 4-wheel-drive (4WD) systems to an 8.4-inch touch-screen Uconnect system with navigation and CarPlay/Android Auto capability, there's a bevy of options available for the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Some can be had by climbing trims. The Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, for example, comes with the Quadra-Drive II 4WD, plus creature comforts like ventilated front seats -- a welcome feature on a hot day. Our ears are pleased with the premium harman/kardon audio system. Active safety and driving features include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist, which can move the vehicle back into a lane if it drifts, and automatic emergency braking if a collision appears imminent and the driver doesn't take action.</p>, <p>A total of five engines are available for the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but in reality most will be choosing among three. Standard across the lineup is a 3.6-liter gasoline V6 that is capable and relatively fuel-efficient. Optional is a 5.7-liter V8 that is stout but thirstier. We have a particular fondness for the 3.0-liter diesel V6 that is both strong and efficient. Jeep's FCA parent has filed for an emissions certification, and reps tell us this engine is part of the product plan for 2018 models. The high-performance Grand Cherokee SRT uses a 6.4-liter V8 that spits out 425 horsepower and can blast to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds. The new Trackhawk boasts the 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine also used in Hellcat models of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a> and Charger. With 707 horsepower, it screams to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds or less. The V6 engines come with rear-wheel drive (RWD) or optional 4-wheel drive (4WD), while the V8 models are 4WD. All Grand Cherokees use an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Grand Cherokee is rated to tow an impressive 7,400 pounds.<br/> <br/> 3.6-liter V6<br/> 295 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br/> 260 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/26 mpg (2WD), 18/25 mpg (4WD)<br/> <br/> 5.7-liter V8<br/> 360 horsepower @ 5,150 rpm<br/> 390 lb-ft of torque @ 4,250 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 14/22 mpg (4WD)<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter diesel V6<br/> 240 horsepower @ 3,600 rpm<br/> 420 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A<br/> <br/> 6.4-liter V8 (Grand Cherokee SRT)<br/> 475 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 470 lb-ft of torque @ 4,300 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/19 mpg<br/> <br/> 6.2-liter supercharged V8 (Grand Cherokee Trackhawk)<br/> 707 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 645 lb-ft @4,800 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 11/17 mpg</p>, <p>The 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $31,700 for a RWD Laredo model. Higher trims run from the mid-to-high-$40,000 mark, and options can add thousands more. The Trailhawk starts around $44,000 while a Summit begins over $50,000. From there, prices climb drastically for the niche, high-performance Jeep Grand Cherokee variants. The SRT model starts around $68,000, while the new Grand Cherokee Trackhawk begins just under $87,000 and can run to the $100,000 mark with options. While a 6-figure Jeep might sound crazy, it's also the most powerful and quickest production SUV money can buy, and significantly cheaper than something like a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayenne/">Porsche Cayenne</a> Turbo S. Against more ordinary rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/edge/">Ford Edge</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a>, the Jeep starts higher, but it also comes standard with a V6 engine as opposed to a 4-cylinder. The Toyota 4Runner, meanwhile, begins higher than the Grand Cherokee. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Jeep Grand Cherokee's resale value is expected to hold up fairly well, above that of the Ford Edge, but below that of the 4Runner.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Jeep Renegade doesn’t just look more rugged and off-road capable than its rivals in the compact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> class, it actually is. Jeep’s smallest and least expensive SUV is equipped with ample ground clearance and an advanced 4-wheel-drive (4WD) system that give the Renegade impressive performance in all types of weather and over all terrains. Four trim levels are available with prices starting around $20,000 for a 2-wheel-drive (2WD) Sport model and max out well past $30,000 for a loaded Renegade Trailhawk model with best-in-class off-road ability and a 180-horsepower Tigershark engine. Although the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> rides on the same platform as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500x/">Fiat 500X</a>, little else is shared between the two, which compete in a crowded field that includes the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/c-hr/">Toyota C-HR</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue%20sport/">Nissan Rogue Sport</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an affordable compact SUV that doesn’t just look rugged and ready for action but actually is, you’ll like the 2018 Jeep Renegade. Unlike many in this class, the Jeep Renegade seeks adventure. It’s up for more than a run to Costco and the mall; it likes to get dirty and it doesn’t want to stay inside when it’s snowing.</p>, <p>If your dreams of fording streams and fantasies of rock crawling are unlikely to come true, you may be happier in the sportier and better-handling Mazda CX-3 or the larger Honda HR-V. Although the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> offers less power than the Jeep Renegade, it gets better fuel mileage and all-wheel drive is standard.</p>, <p>A rearview camera is now standard on all 2018 Jeep Renegades. Jeep’s Uconnect 4 infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is now standard on Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk models. Latitude, Trailhawk and Limited models are available with an optional 8.4-inch touch screen with navigation. A redesigned center console has increased front-seat storage.</p>, <p>Although two engines and transmissions are available, the base 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder is uninspired and it’s only available with a 6-speed manual transmission. No automatic is available, which means few people choose this engine anyway. Most will buy a 2018 Renegade with Jeep’s 2.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, which makes 180 horsepower, and works exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. It’s a likable combination with plenty of performance, but the 9-speed automatic isn’t as well tuned as it could be, and the engine can feel a bit crude if you rev it out. Acceleration is strong enough for most buyers and the Renegade’s maneuverability and handling are on its list of positives. Compared to the rugged <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/wrangler/">Jeep Wrangler</a>, the 2018 Jeep Renegade is much more civilized, more comfortable and it handles better, but compared to others in the Renegade’s class, like the Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, Nissan Rogue Sport and Toyota C-HR, its on-road dynamics are not class-leading.</p>, <p>SELEC-TERRAIN<br>
 Like a much more expensive Range Rover, Jeep Renegades with 4-wheel drive give the driver the ability to choose among four settings; Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud. Each customizes the SUV’s 4WD system to optimize performance for the conditions. The system in the even more capable Trailhawk trim level also gets a Rock mode and Hill Descent Control.<br>
<br>
 MY SKY OPEN AIR SUNROOF<br>
 Optional on all trim levels, the My Sky open-air sunroof goes well beyond the dual-pane power glass sunroof, which is also available. The My Sky sunroof offers a power vent-and-slide front panel along with two large manually removable panels, which can be stored inside the vehicle and brought along for the ride.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You and the new Renegade may be in rush-hour gridlock, but the mud splatter printed on the face of the Jeep’s tachometer will remind you that the weekend is getting closer by the second. It’s as if the SUV is telling you, “Hang in there. You can make it.” The new Jeep Renegade is comfortable for five, with good legroom. There’s also 18.5 cubic feet of storage capacity behind the rear seats. That expands to over 50 cubic feet with the rear seats folded, and in all but base models, the front-passenger seat folds to accommodate longer items like surfboards.</p>, <p>Round headlights? Check. Seven-slotted vertical grille? Check. Rugged attitude? Check. Short overhangs for rock climbing? Check. One of the best things about the 2018 Jeep Renegade is that it looks like a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jeep/">Jeep</a>. A real Jeep. It’s as if the Renegade is a greatest-hits mix tape engineered from the DNA of the iconic Wrangler and the luxurious Grand Cherokee. Its angles and upright greenhouse even sample from the Willys MB of the 1940s. Still, the Renegade manages to be more modern than retro, with plenty of black trim and curvaceous surfacing. Although the X featured in its unique taillights is derived from army jerrycans. And that’s just cool.</p>, <p>Jeep’s Renegade for 2018 comes in four trims: Sport, Latitude, Limited and Trailhawk. The base model's roughly $20,000 starting price is tempting and grants immediate access to the Jeep brand, but is rather light on content with simpler features like an AM/FM radio with USB input, 6-way-adjustable driver's seat, rearview camera, power windows and door locks, and 16-inch wheels. Most glaring is its lack of standard air conditioning and Bluetooth connectivity. We recommend stepping up even one trim level to Latitude, which brings those two basic features along with a 7-inch Uconnect touch-screen infotainment system, and fog lights.</p>, <p>Four-wheel drive is optional on all new Jeep Renegade models except Trailhawk, where it's standard. If you want an automatic transmission, you'll have to opt for the larger, 2.4-liter engine. It's standard on Limited and Trailhawk models, optional on all others. Other options that vary by trim include blind-spot monitoring and lane-departure warning, leather seats, navigation, heated seats and steering wheel, 506-watt Beats audio with nine speakers, the My Sky removable-roof system, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control and rear park-assist. Four-wheel-drive models have a terrain-select system that optimizes the Jeep's traction for settings like snow, sand, mud and -- on Trailhawk models -- rocks.</p>, <p>Two 4-cylinder engines are available for the 2018 Jeep Renegade. Sport and Latitude models come with a turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, while the larger 2.4-liter is optional on those models and standard on Limited and Trailhawk variants. Which engine you choose may rest on the transmission you want. The 1.4-liter is available only with a 6-speed manual, while the 2.4-liter only comes with a 9-speed automatic, and fuel economy is very similar between the two. Both can be had with 4WD instead of the standard 2WD (front-wheel drive). The 6-speed manual transmission is easy to use, and the 9-speed models we tested were more refined than those used in earlier <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> vehicles. The Jeep Renegade can tow up to 2,000 pounds with the 2.4-liter engine and 4WD. Towing is not recommended for 1.4-liter models.<br/> <b><br/> </b>1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 (6-speed manual)<br/> 160 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 184 lb-ft of torque @ 2,500-4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/31 mpg (2WD), 24/31 mpg (4WD)<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.4-liter inline-4 (9-speed automatic)<br/> 180 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br/> 175 lb-ft of torque @ 3,900 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/31 mpg (2WD), 21/29 mpg (4WD)</p>, <p>The 2018 Jeep Renegade has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $20,000 for a base, 2WD model. That’s an attractive price but offers few frills. With popular features such as an automatic transmission, air conditioning and a touch-screen infotainment system, expect costs to rise to the low- to mid-$20,000 range. At the upper end, loaded Trailhawk and Limited models can reach well past $30,000. At these prices, the Renegade is in line with its close competitor, the Chevy Trax, above that of the more hard-to-define <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/soul/">Kia Soul</a> and but below the Subaru Crosstrek, Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new Jeep Renegade. As for the Renegade's resale, it seems to hold about average values, well below the Honda HR-V and Subaru Crosstrek, but on par with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/trax/">Chevrolet Trax</a>.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/jeep/wrangler/2018
[<p>The new 2018 Jeep Wrangler successfully blends modern technology with one of the most iconic SUVs to ever travel our roads. The new Wrangler and Wrangler 4-door (which gained fame as the Wrangler Unlimited) retain their immediately recognizable design, yet manage to be all-new underneath, with new engines, drivetrains, interiors, technology, and everything else that comes with it. It is arguably the most significant update ever to this most classic Jeep, but all done without sacrificing one bit of the Jeep Wrangler's essential character trait: its ability to conquer any terrain, at any time. The solid axles in front and rear, torquey and powerful engines, and versatile 4-wheel-drive system make the new Wrangler unstoppable off road. And yet, at last, the Wrangler no longer feels like it was raised by wolves around town, offering up ride quality and refinement that were once anathema to the Wrangler. With no direct competitor, and 4x4 versions of the Toyota Tacoma pickup coming closest, the 2018 Jeep Wrangler and Wrangler 4-door SUVs stand alone.</p>, <p>If you prefer the unblazed trail, have ever operated a winch, terms like "breakover angle" mean something to you, then the new Wrangler or Wrangler 4-door is just what you want.

Naturally, options inflate that price, and if you want all the goodies on your 4-door Wrangler Rubicon, you'll easily pass the $55,000 mark, which is luxury crossover territory. That's not cheap, of course, but at least you can get into a fully capable rock-hopping Wrangler for considerably less. The Jeep Wrangler is a unique proposition in the market, with few direct competitors.

[<p>The new 2018 Jeep Wrangler successfully blends modern technology with one of the most iconic SUVs to ever travel our roads. The new Wrangler and Wrangler 4-door (which gained fame as the Wrangler Unlimited) retain their immediately recognizable design, yet manage to be all-new underneath, with new engines, drivetrains, interiors, technology, and everything else that comes with it. It is arguably the most significant update ever to this most classic Jeep, but all done without sacrificing one bit of the Jeep Wrangler's essential character trait: its ability to conquer any terrain, at any time. The solid axles in front and rear, torquey and powerful engines, and versatile 4-wheel-drive system make the new Wrangler unstoppable off road. And yet, at last, the Wrangler no longer feels like it was raised by wolves around town, offering up ride quality and refinement that were once anathema to the Wrangler.

[<p>Full-size near-luxury <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> like the 2018 Kia Cadenza have come a long way in recent years. In the Cadenza, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a> has built a solid, attractive 4-door sedan to challenge cars like the Chevy Impala and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon/">Toyota Avalon</a>, but with styling and luxury more akin to what one might find in an entry-level <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>. From its powerful V6 engine and laudable driving manners to its taut lines and amazing standard warranty, there is so much right about this car it’s hard to find fault. If you don’t need the utility and all-wheel-drive ability of a crossover SUV, but are still looking for a comfortable and roomy way to transport four passengers, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/cadenza/">Kia Cadenza</a> deserves a good long look.</p>, <p>With increasingly good scores in the areas of safety and reliability, considering a Kia over longer established makes is a pretty easy move so long as resale isn’t an important factor. The Cadenza delivers brilliant styling, a long list of standard and available features and a civilized ride.</p>, <p>If you need the sure-footed grip of all-wheel drive, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/charger/">Dodge Charger</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/legacy/">Subaru Legacy</a> might make a better choice. Those seeking bragging rights in the fuel-economy and eco-friendly categories might enjoy a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/avalon%20hybrid/">Toyota Avalon hybrid</a>, while fans of BMW-like handling might enjoy a Dodge Charger R/T or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/taurus/">Ford Taurus</a> SHO.</p>, <p>Fresh from its redesign last year, the 2018 Kia Cadenza carries over largely intact. The Premium trim’s Luxury Package now includes a panoramic sunroof and LED interior lighting.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadenza hits the mark when it comes to the kind of comfort, quiet and refinement you expect from a premium full-size sedan. Kia's tried-and-true 3.3-liter V6 puts out 290 horsepower in the Cadenza, and the new Kia-designed 8-speed automatic extracts brisk acceleration with the pedal to the metal, and relaxed cruising when you're just feathering it at highway speeds. That relaxation extends to the suspension, which uses special shock absorbers to smooth out harsh bumps without making the ride too soft. The Cadenza sailed gracefully over the pavement, but it was also suitably flat and controlled when the road narrowed and bent. The electrically assisted steering provided good weighting in corners -- although not much feedback -- and very good on-center feel on the highway. While no sports sedan, the Cadenza's drive mode select does offer a Sport mode, and there are shift paddles on the steering wheel.</p>, <p>ENORMOUS BACK SEAT<br>
 The Cadenza’s rear seat is a place where two good-sized adults will find plenty of leg, hip and headroom. Even when equipped with the optional panoramic sunroof, headroom remains acceptable for all but the tallest of passengers.<br>
<br>
 HARMAN/KARDON AUDIO<br>
 Audiophiles aren’t the only ones who will appreciate the excellent harman/kardon audio setup in the 2018 Kia Cadenza sedan. The system’s Clari-Fi technology delivers crisp highs, rich bass and an even midrange though 12 speakers. Think if it as a set of BluBlockers for your ears.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>If the 2018 Kia Cadenza’s interior looks familiar, it’s because it bears a striking resemblance to the smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/optima/">Kia Optima</a>. The two share the same split-level design placing important gauges and screens up above the physical switches and knobs used to control them. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are along for the ride, as is an outstanding harman/kardon audio system. Both front-seat occupants get multi-adjustable seats including available lumbar support, a refreshing change from cars that treat the passenger like a second-class citizen. The Cadenza’s rear seat is the real star, however, offering cavernous accommodations for even the tallest passengers.</p>, <p>Kia’s Cadenza sedan for 2018 displays a handsome, clean design that sheds the somewhat pudgy look of the last-generation car to wear the nameplate. Little details such as the concave “tiger-nose” grille add a sense of individualism. Depending on the trim, the grille is offered with either the traditional diamond pattern or waterfall design. The car’s front and rear Z-shaped LED accent lights are connected via a subtle crease at the shoulder line, a visual cue that ties the entire design together and helps the Cadenza make a more elegant statement than the edgier Kia Optima and Stinger.</p>, <p>The 2018 Cadenza Premium model anchors the bottom of the lineup, and comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, LED accent lights, and the trunk automatically pops open if you stand near it for a few seconds. There's leather on the seats and on the tilt-and-telescope steering wheel. The driver's seat power-adjusts 10 ways, the power passenger's seat adjusts eight ways, and both are heated. Also standard are dual-zone climate control, push-button ignition, a 7-inch touch-screen display that includes a rearview camera, USB inputs, Bluetooth, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Safety gear includes nine airbags, hill-start assist, and that rearview camera.</p>, <p>The Technology model adds power-folding mirrors with puddle lights, a panoramic sunroof and the harman/kardon audio system with an 8-inch touch screen and navigation; all available as upgrades to the Premium model, too, as part of the optional Luxury Package. However, Technology models also get 19-inch wheels, LED headlights and fog lights, a heated steering wheel, shifter paddles on the steering wheel, automatic windshield wipers, and a wireless smartphone-charging system. Step up to the Limited model if you want nicer Nappa quilted leather on the seats, a 14-way-adjustable driver's seat with memory, and a power-operated trunk.</p>, <p>One engine is available for the 2018 Cadenza: Kia's 3.3-liter V6, putting out 290 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque to the front wheels. We're familiar with this engine, as it's the standard-issue V6 for Kia models for some time now. What's improved is the use of an 8-speed automatic transmission. It's an all-new design by Kia itself, and it offers smooth shifts and brisk acceleration. The paddle shifters worked fine, but we're guessing most people will let the transmission do its own shifting. The Cadenza consumes regular fuel at the rate of about 28 mpg on the highway.<br>
<br>
 3.3-liter V6<br>
 290 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br>
 253 lb-ft of torque @ 5,200 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/28 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Cadenza Premium carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting right around $33,200. Stepping up to the Technology trim elevates the price to just under $40,200, while the Nappa-leather-clad Limited sneaks in just shy of $45,600 when fully loaded. That's actually on the high side of the segment, with base prices for the Impala, Taurus and Charger all undercutting the big Kia, but the 2018 Cadenza offers more standard equipment. On the high end, the Kia is still higher than its competitors, but again, the Cadenza makes a more luxurious play with the quilted leather and other high-end features. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what others in your area paid for their Cadenza. As for resale, early indications are the Cadenza comes in on the lower side, with values falling short of the Dodge Charger and Chevy Impala, and well off the excellent marks set by the Toyota Avalon.</p>]

[<p>Kia’s entry in the competitive and crowded compact-car class is available in two body styles, the stylish 2018 Kia Forte sedan and the even sexier Forte5 hatchback. Both are refined, fuel-efficient and packed with features including available driver-assist systems. Each offers high-quality interiors, impressive infotainment systems that incorporate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a choice of three trim levels, while the top-of-the-range Forte5 SX features a turbocharged engine with over 200 horsepower. Prices start just under $18,000 for a Forte LX sedan with a 6-speed manual transmission. Under the hood is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 147 horsepower. An optional 6-speed automatic transmission is available and kicks up fuel-economy ratings to 29-mpg city and 37 mpg on the highway. Competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, Chevy Cruze, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/elantra/">Hyundai Elantra</a>, Mazda3 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Forte lineup offers you a choice of a practical 4-door or Euro-styled 5-door hatchback, each replete with a generous warranty, lots of standard features and a decent price. If you’re looking for an attractive, stylish, comfortable and well-equipped compact with the highest crash-test safety ratings, you’ll like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/forte/">Kia Forte</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a diesel engine in this class, the Kia Forte is not for you; check out the Chevy Cruze. If all-wheel drive is on your wish list, shop the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/impreza/">Subaru Impreza</a> or the VW Golf SportWagen. If a hybrid interests you, shift over to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/niro/">Kia Niro</a>. The Kia Forte is also light on rear-seat legroom compared to the Honda Civic.</p>, <p>For 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a> has improved in the Forte’s list of luxuries. The Forte LX now has standard cruise control and available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The Forte S gets new 16-inch wheels and the Technology Package now includes a sunroof. The Forte EX gets standard Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Blind Spot Detection with Lane Change Assist.</p>, <p>There’s a pleasing and satisfying entertainment value to the driving characteristics of the Kia Forte. This is not a boring car to drive. It isn’t an exciting hot rod either, but the Forte’s steering, engine, transmission and suspension are all tuned well and they feel lively and responsive. This is not by chance; Kia engineers like their cars to have a sporty feel. That said, there are sportier and more thrilling cars in this class. Despite the available 201-horsepower engine in the Forte5, enthusiasts should check out the Mazda3, Honda Civic SI, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus%20st/">Ford Focus ST</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/jetta/">Volkswagen Jetta</a> GLI or VW Golf GTI for their fix. For the rest of us, the Forte’s 147-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is adequate. The 164-horsepower version of the engine in the Forte LX sedan, and Forte5 LX and EX models is better and it works well with the 6-speed automatic transmission. Around town and on the highway, the Forte sedan and hatchback are all excellent choices.</p>, <p>DRIVE MODE SELECT<br/> Much like similar systems found in more expensive cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ct6/">Cadillac CT6</a>, Kia’s Drive Mode Select system allows the Forte’s driver to choose among three settings, Normal, Eco and Sport depending on mood and the driving situation. Each adjusts the car’s engine, transmission and steering, maximizing comfort, fuel economy or performance.<br/> <b><br/> </b>AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING<br/> This important safety technology is optional on the 2018 Kia Forte S and EX. The system reads the road ahead for obstacles in your path, including vehicles or pedestrians. If it determines a collision is imminent and the Forte’s driver is not taking action, it will apply the vehicle’s brakes for you.<br/> </p>, <p>Much like its exterior, the interior of the 2018 Kia Forte and Forte5 is simple and a bit understated, but interesting, attractive and artistically detailed. Control layout is intuitive and the soft-touch dash and high-quality materials add an upscale ambiance. Seat comfort is excellent and four adults can ride in comfort. EX models get standard leather and there are heating and cooling seats available, as well as a 10-way-power driver’s seat with power lumbar support. Even the rear seat offers a center armrest with cup holders. Then there's the Forte5's excellent 23 cubic feet of cargo space, in case the sedan's 15-cubic-foot trunk isn't enough.</p>, <p>Kia has forgotten how to make ugly cars. The Korean automaker is now a style and design leader, with trendsetting sedans like the Optima and Stinger and cool-looking SUVs like the Soul and Sportage. The 2018 Forte and Forte5 are also lookers, with tight bodywork, LED accent lights and athletic proportions. Kia also gets the stance right, and the Forte looks right on the road. Although the two body styles share a nose, the Forte5 hatchback is the better-looking of the two with its short rear overhang and rear spoiler. Overall, it's a fresh and good-looking group of cars with a number of luxurious features like power-folding exterior mirrors, puddle lights and illuminated door-handle pockets.</p>, <p>All 2018 Forte sedan and Forte5 hatchback models come with keyless entry, standard Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, air conditioning and a split-folding rear seat. The base LX model Forte sedan is fairly dressed down, even offering steel wheels and a manual transmission. A new mid-level S model sedan offers nicer interior appointments at a lower price than the EX. A full complement of active and passive safety features is standard on every Forte. The 2.0-liter 4-cylinder base engine in the Forte LX sedan makes 147 horsepower, while the more expensive Forte5 LX hatchback starts with a 164-horsepower version.</p>, <p>Options for the 2018 Kia Forte lineup include navigation, leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control and Kia's UVO infotainment system. Most of that's included in the Forte's Premium Plus package, although leather is now standard on EX sedans. Many features are bundled by trim level, and the Forte5 models offer a level above the sedan called SX that adds a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 201 horsepower, as well as 18-inch wheels. A Technology Plus Package includes a power moonroof, Autonomous Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Warning, Lane Keep Assist, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, push-button start, fog lights, LED taillights and other features.</p>, <p>The base engine for the 2018 Forte and Forte5 is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque. It's standard in the LX and S models of the Forte sedan. The other 2.0-liter engine is a direct-injection 4-cylinder that puts out a more robust 164 horsepower. Transmission choices in the sedan are a 6-speed manual or a smooth and responsive 6-speed automatic. The Forte5 gets just the more powerful 2.0-liter, while the 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Forte5 SX can be paired with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.<br>

[<p>Kia’s entry in the competitive and crowded compact-car class is available in two body styles, the stylish 2018 Kia Forte sedan and the even sexier Forte5 hatchback. Both are refined, fuel-efficient and packed with features including available driver-assist systems. Each offers high-quality interiors, impressive infotainment systems that incorporate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a choice of three trim levels, while the top-of-the-range Forte5 SX features a turbocharged engine with over 200 horsepower. Prices start just under $18,000 for a Forte LX sedan with a 6-speed manual transmission. Under the hood is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine good for 147 horsepower. An optional 6-speed automatic transmission is available and kicks up fuel-economy ratings to 29-mpg city and 37 mpg on the highway. Competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, Chevy Cruze, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/elantra/">Hyundai Elantra</a>, Mazda3 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Forte lineup offers you a choice of a practical 4-door or Euro-styled 5-door hatchback, each replete with a generous warranty, lots of standard features and a decent price. If you’re looking for an attractive, stylish, comfortable and well-equipped compact with the highest crash-test safety ratings, you’ll like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/forte/">Kia Forte</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a diesel engine in this class, the Kia Forte is not for you; check out the Chevy Cruze. If all-wheel drive is on your wish list, shop the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/impreza/">Subaru Impreza</a> or the VW Golf SportWagen. If a hybrid interests you, shift over to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/niro/">Kia Niro</a>. The Kia Forte is also light on rear-seat legroom compared to the Honda Civic.</p>, <p>For 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a> has improved in the Forte’s list of luxuries. The Forte LX now has standard cruise control and available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The Forte S gets new 16-inch wheels and the Technology Package now includes a sunroof. The Forte EX gets standard Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Blind Spot Detection with Lane Change Assist.</p>, <p>There’s a pleasing and satisfying entertainment value to the driving characteristics of the Kia Forte. This is not a boring car to drive. It isn’t an exciting hot rod either, but the Forte’s steering, engine, transmission and suspension are all tuned well and they feel lively and responsive. This is not by chance; Kia engineers like their cars to have a sporty feel. That said, there are sportier and more thrilling cars in this class. Despite the available 201-horsepower engine in the Forte5, enthusiasts should check out the Mazda3, Honda Civic SI, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus%20st/">Ford Focus ST</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/jetta/">Volkswagen Jetta</a> GLI or VW Golf GTI for their fix. For the rest of us, the Forte’s 147-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is adequate. The 164-horsepower version of the engine in the Forte LX sedan, and Forte5 LX and EX models is better and it works well with the 6-speed automatic transmission. Around town and on the highway, the Forte sedan and hatchback are all excellent choices.</p>, <p>DRIVE MODE SELECT<br/> Much like similar systems found in more expensive cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ct6/">Cadillac CT6</a>, Kia’s Drive Mode Select system allows the Forte’s driver to choose among three settings, Normal, Eco and Sport depending on mood and the driving situation. Each adjusts the car’s engine, transmission and steering, maximizing comfort, fuel economy or performance.<br/> <b><br/> </b>AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING<br/> This important safety technology is optional on the 2018 Kia Forte S and EX. The system reads the road ahead for obstacles in your path, including vehicles or pedestrians. If it determines a collision is imminent and the Forte’s driver is not taking action, it will apply the vehicle’s brakes for you.<br/> </p>, <p>Much like its exterior, the interior of the 2018 Kia Forte and Forte5 is simple and a bit understated, but interesting, attractive and artistically detailed. Control layout is intuitive and the soft-touch dash and high-quality materials add an upscale ambiance. Seat comfort is excellent and four adults can ride in comfort. EX models get standard leather and there are heating and cooling seats available, as well as a 10-way-power driver’s seat with power lumbar support. Even the rear seat offers a center armrest with cup holders. Then there's the Forte5's excellent 23 cubic feet of cargo space, in case the sedan's 15-cubic-foot trunk isn't enough.</p>, <p>Kia has forgotten how to make ugly cars. The Korean automaker is now a style and design leader, with trendsetting sedans like the Optima and Stinger and cool-looking SUVs like the Soul and Sportage. The 2018 Forte and Forte5 are also lookers, with tight bodywork, LED accent lights and athletic proportions. Kia also gets the stance right, and the Forte looks right on the road. Although the two body styles share a nose, the Forte5 hatchback is the better-looking of the two with its short rear overhang and rear spoiler. Overall, it's a fresh and good-looking group of cars with a number of luxurious features like power-folding exterior mirrors, puddle lights and illuminated door-handle pockets.</p>, <p>All 2018 Forte sedan and Forte5 hatchback models come with keyless entry, standard Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, air conditioning and a split-folding rear seat. The base LX model Forte sedan is fairly dressed down, even offering steel wheels and a manual transmission. A new mid-level S model sedan offers nicer interior appointments at a lower price than the EX. A full complement of active and passive safety features is standard on every Forte. The 2.0-liter 4-cylinder base engine in the Forte LX sedan makes 147 horsepower, while the more expensive Forte5 LX hatchback starts with a 164-horsepower version.</p>, <p>Options for the 2018 Kia Forte lineup include navigation, leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control and Kia's UVO infotainment system. Most of that's included in the Forte's Premium Plus package, although leather is now standard on EX sedans. Many features are bundled by trim level, and the Forte5 models offer a level above the sedan called SX that adds a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 201 horsepower, as well as 18-inch wheels. A Technology Plus Package includes a power moonroof, Autonomous Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Warning, Lane Keep Assist, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, push-button start, fog lights, LED taillights and other features.</p>, <p>The base engine for the 2018 Forte and Forte5 is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque. It's standard in the LX and S models of the Forte sedan. The other 2.0-liter engine is a direct-injection 4-cylinder that puts out a more robust 164 horsepower. Transmission choices in the sedan are a 6-speed manual or a smooth and responsive 6-speed automatic. The Forte5 gets just the more powerful 2.0-liter, while the 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Forte5 SX can be paired with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.<br>

[<p>Available as a hybrid and as a plug-in hybrid, the 2018 Kia Niro is a stylish, family-friendly 4-door hatchback with outstanding fuel economy and impressive safety and convenience features. Introduced just last year, the new Kia Niro competes with the best-selling Toyota Prius, Ford C-Max, Chevy Volt and the similar Hyundai Ioniq. And with a combined city/highway fuel-economy rating of 50 mpg, the Niro Hybrid is one of the most efficient in the class. The new Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid can be driven 26 miles on electricity alone, before a 1.6-liter gasoline engine turns on to charge the batteries and expand range to over 600 miles. Four trim levels are available with prices starting around $24,000 for a Niro Hybrid FE, which includes a standard 7-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>Hybrid shoppers looking for an impressive mix of fuel economy, comfort and eye-pleasing design will like the 2018 Kia Niro. It’s perfect for small families looking for a stylish, affordable and fun-to-drive runabout with a high-quality interior, hatchback versatility and room for five.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for the absolute highest miles-per-gallon rating, the Toyota Prius is still the king with a combined rating as high as 56 mpg. The Niro Plug-In Hybrid’s 26 miles of electric range is outperformed by the Chevy Volt, which can travel about 50 miles on a full battery charge. Although Kia markets the new Niro as an SUV, it is not available with all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>This year Kia adds the Plug-In Hybrid model to the Niro lineup. Also, Lane Keep Assist replaces Kia’s Lane Departure Warning system, and the Advanced Tech Package is now standard on the top-of-the-line Niro Touring trim level. EX models get a new Electrochromatic rearview mirror that keeps glare down.</p>, <p>Kia has managed to inject some fun-to-drive spirit into the new 2018 Niro Hybrid. Unlike some small electrified vehicles the Niro never feels like a fancy golf cart or a pod without personality. Although it weighs 3,000 pounds, the Niro is athletic and feels light on its feet, with a welcome agility. Its steering feel is surprisingly satisfying. Its combined 139 horsepower won’t win any drag races, but there’s plenty of acceleration, especially in Sport Mode, which sharpens throttle response, tightens the steering and quickens the action of the hatchback’s smooth 6-speed automatic transmission. It also keeps the Niro’s 1.6-liter gas engine more involved for additional power. The complex powertrain is seamless in its operation, and once up to speed the Niro is quiet and comfortable. The Niro also performs well in the city, thanks to a tight turning radius, standard rearview camera, good outward visibility, and available rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT<br>
 Standard on the upper-trim levels, this clever system uses sensors in the rear bumper to scan the Niro’s surroundings and warns the driver of vehicles and pedestrians approaching from the side. It makes backing out of your driveway or out of tight parking spaces a lot less stressful.<br>
<br>
SPORT MODE<br>
 Engaged with a button on the Kia’s console, Sport Mode transforms the driving dynamics of the new Niro Hybrid. It sharpens throttle response, tightens the steering and quickens the action of the hatchback’s 6-speed automatic transmission. It also keeps the Niro’s 1.6-liter gas engine more involved for additional power.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>A number of years ago, Kia’s interior design went from frumpy to fantastic, and the cabin of the 2018 Kia Niro is one of the finest in its class. The design is clean and simple with an upscale feel and high-quality materials. The layout is intuitive and all of the controls work with precision. Seat comfort is excellent and the 6-speed automatic is controlled with a conventional shifter on the console, which is a good thing. There’s a handy open bin with USB and power ports ahead of the shifter, and the Niro’s audio and climate controls are smartly situated. There’s plenty of rear-seat headroom and legroom for 6-footers, and the 60/40-split-folding seatback adds valuable cargo/passenger flexibility.</p>, <p>Kia markets the new Niro as a compact-crossover SUV, and its exterior design backs up that market position. The hybrid’s black plastic wheel arches, rear skidplate and other design cues add visual height, and its rather formal roofline bears a strong resemblance to Kia’s much larger 3-row Sorento SUV. It all gives the well-proportioned Niro a more rugged appearance than the futuristic Toyota Prius and the mechanically similar Hyundai Ioniq. While every Niro gets body-color door handles and mirrors, you have to reach all the way to the top-line Niro Touring to move out of 16-inch wheel covers into 18-inch alloys.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Niro lineup starts around $24,000 (with destination) for the Niro FE trim, but Kia doesn’t plan to sell many of them and you shouldn’t plan to buy one (you get one extra mpg, but it’s not worth the equipment trade-off). So let’s focus on the standard-equipment roster of the Niro LX, which is priced just a few hundred dollars higher than the FE. Highlights include keyless entry and push-button start, UVO3 infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, AM/FM/SiriusXM audio, a 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, Bluetooth phone connectivity and dual-zone automatic climate control, to name a few.</p>, <p>A fully loaded 2018 Kia Niro Touring with the Advanced Technology Package stickers around $32,500 with destination. In addition to 18-inch aluminum wheels and power-folding heated outside mirrors with integrated turn indicators, a loaded Touring model features upgrades like a moonroof and heated and ventilated leather front seats. The touch screen is upgraded to eight inches, sound is upgraded to an 8-speaker harman/kardon system, and there’s a wireless charger for compatible phones. Then there’s a long list of driver-assist technologies that includes blind-spot detection, lane-change assist, rear cross-traffic alert, forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, autonomous emergency braking, smart cruise control, plus front and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>The new Niro’s gas-electric hybrid system comprises a 4-cylinder engine and a lithium-ion polymer battery, the output of which is run to the front wheels via a quick-shifting 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. It’s an impressive system for both its outstanding efficiency and its seamless operation. It’s important to note, however, that Niro Touring models are rated to return 43 mpg combined, versus 49 mpg for LX and EX models. Kia explains it as a consequence of added weight and aerodynamic differences. At 12,000 miles per year and $3 gallon, the difference is about $9 per month.<br>

The new Niro Plug-in hybrid kicks off at $28,840. While the Niro is covered by Kia’s superior 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, as well as a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, the Prius boasts an established reputation and excellent resale value.

[<p>The 2018 Kia Optima sedan family receives a handful of improvements this year, building on the momentum it has earned since its introduction in 2016 when it won our Best Buy award for midsize sedans. The Optima established itself early as a leader in the midsize-sedan segment, offering excellent performance, power, fuel economy, technology and value. Against rivals like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Chevy Malibu, the Optima holds its own, with the 2018 Optima now offering a standard 7-inch touch screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and standard blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking-assist systems. The icing on the cake: the Optima's 10-year/100,000-mile warranty.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Optima offers a little something for everyone, packing value and technology at every trim level, from the base-model LX, to the sporty turbocharged SX, and the hybrid and plug-in hybrid. The competitively priced Optima also comes standard with a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.</p>, <p>While you can get driver-assist technology on the Optima, it's reserved for higher-end models, unlike the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, which offer it across the board. Unlike the Subaru Impreza, the Optima isn't available with all-wheel drive either.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Optima gets a standard 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system, and standard blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking assist. A new S trim level adds a level of sportiness at a lower price, offering a sporty front bumper, rear spoiler, 17-inch alloy wheels and more.</p>, <p>Kia’s 2018 Optima isn't billed as a sports sedan, but the SX model with the turbo engine doesn't seem to have gotten the memo. The 245-horsepower turbocharged engine, quick-shifting 6-speed automatic, and responsive steering all make the Optima SX turbo feel more agile and fun than many of its competitors. The SX gets singled out here thanks to its better power-steering setup and firmer suspension and 18-inch wheel-and-tire package. The LX and EX are geared more toward comfort, which is no bad thing really. The good news is that superior handling doesn't come at the expense of a harsh ride. While we love the turbo's plentiful power, we have to admit that the standard 2.4-liter engine is actually more than adequate for most drivers, and the 1.6-liter with its 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is a nice intermediate step, although the transmission could use some refinement.</p>, <p>ANDROID AUTO &amp; APPLE CARPLAY<br/> With Android Auto and Apple CarPlay standard across the board on a 7-inch touch screen, the 2018 Optima feels that much more modern. And what's not to like: Both systems offer up the same interface you've grown to love on your phone, and with similar functionality, too.<br/> <br/> HARMAN/KARDON AUDIO<br/> Kia knows you're going to be listening to more than your own thoughts, and the harman/kardon QuantumLogic7 surround audio system in the 2018 Optima goes a step beyond its rivals with its Clari-Fi feature that helps restore even old MP3 files.</p>, <p>Kia bifurcates the 2018 Optima interior with a metallic band of trim, placing the gauges, infotainment touch screen and vents above, and the audio-system and climate-control buttons below. As we expect in Kias these days, the interior materials all feel high quality, and we like the soft-touch panels on the door tops, dash and pretty much everywhere else. We also like the fact that Kia still uses buttons and knobs for most functions, instead of relying on touch-sensitive sliders. The comfortable seating extends to the huge back seat, and Optima SX Limited models get Nappa leather and other high-end touches.</p>, <p>The 2018 Optima is a good-looking and sharply styled car, one that subtly builds on the design language established by the previous-generation car. We like the long, low look, the "tiger-nose" grille treatment, and the subtly aggressive stance. Then again, we said the same things about the previous-generation Optima, and considering the significant changes under the skin, it'd be nice if that skin was different as well. Then again, that gamble didn’t pay off too well for Hyundai’s Sonata, so we’re fine with the Optima keeping a familiar look.</p>, <p>All Optima models now come with a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In addition to that, the base-model LX comes with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a Driver Mode Select system that switches among Normal, Sport and Eco modes. Other standard features include air conditioning, a rearview camera, and controls on the tilt-telescope steering wheel for the cruise-control and audio systems. The infotainment system includes Sirius satellite radio, Bluetooth, aux and USB inputs. The front seats adjust manually, except for the driver's power lumbar.</p>, <p>You can equip the LX with a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder connected to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic or you can step up to the 2.0-liter turbo in the SX models. Other options include a new Convenience Package for LX models that adds a 10-way-power driver's seat and laminated front-side windows, and of course the new S model. EX and SX buyers can add active cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warning, while the Limited package on SX models adds Nappa leather, an around-view monitor and more. Of course, there's also the harman/kardon audio system we can't say enough nice things about.</p>, <p>The base Optima LX, S, and EX models all get a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine with 185 horsepower connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission. There's an additional low-end engine available on the LX, a 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder connected to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. If you want power, the Optima SX 2.0L Turbo comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine with 245 horsepower, also connected to a 6-speed automatic. If you're looking at hybrids, they use a 2.0-liter non-turbo engine paired to an electric motor. Fuel economy is solid across the board, with LX models getting 34 mpg on the highway, SX getting 31 mpg, and the LX 1.6T model getting 37 mpg. The 2018 Optima Hybrid promises 46-mpg highway and the plug-in 103 mpge.<br/> <br/> 2.4-liter inline-4 (LX, EX)<br/> 185 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 178 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/34 mpg <br/> <br/> 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 (LX 1.6T)<br/> 178 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 195 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 28/37 mpg<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (SX, SXL)<br/> 245 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 260 lb-ft of torque @ 1,350-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/31 mpg<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter inline-4 + Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (Hybrid)<br/> 154 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 140 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm<br/> Electric Motor: 50 horsepower/151 lb-ft of torque<br/> Net Output: 192 horsepower/271 lb-ft of torque<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 39/46 mpg<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter inline-4 + Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (Plug-in Hybrid)<br/> 154 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 140 lb-ft of torque @ 5,000 rpm<br/> Electric Motor: 66 horsepower/151 lb-ft of torque<br/> Net Output: 202 horsepower/276 lb-ft of torque<br/> EPA fuel economy: 103 mpge/40 mpg combined</p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base Optima LX starts at just under $23,400, including the $895 destination charge. The new S model adds $1,000, and if you want the 1.6-liter turbo engine in your LX, you'll pay just under $25,200. EX models start at about $26,500, while the SX with its turbocharged engine comes in at about $31,400. Start checking option boxes and you'll wind up at about $38,000 for a fully loaded SX Limited with all the trimmings. Hybrid prices haven't been announced yet, but will likely be similar to last year. Overall, the Optima's prices are in line with the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and the rest of the midsize-sedan segment.

[<p>The value-packed 2018 Kia Rio, available as a sedan or 5-door hatchback, boasts a larger interior than its diminutive size would suggest, a generous serving of tech-savvy features and the best warranty in the segment. The Rio is a more substantial car than its sub-$15,000 base price would suggest, and its options list includes items that you'd normally find on cars costing significantly more. All-new for 2018, the Rio is bolstered by an attractive, quiet interior, a comfortable ride, and an expansive array of safety features. An underappreciated car in the subcompact group, the Rio is poised to take on segment standouts like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a> (and Note), <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/yaris/">Toyota Yaris</a>.</p>, <p>For city dwellers, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/rio/">Kia Rio</a> offers an appealing mix of good fuel economy, good looks and lots of value, while making it much easier to deal with snug parking spaces. The Rio also boasts a fantastic warranty, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility and safety features including autonomous emergency braking.</p>, <p>If your goal is to find a low-priced fuel-sipper, the Rio does the job, but you can find better fuel economy elsewhere. The Rio also lacks a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> or <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> option. There are also subcompact cars that offer a more sporting attitude.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a>'s subcompact sedan and hatchback are all-new for 2018, riding on a new, larger platform with a new body. The redesigned interior is more upscale, and the Rio also has an expanded suite of safety features.</p>, <p>Thanks to a new platform and suspension, the longer, lower, wider Kia Rio feels more planted and confident than in the past and has more poise than you might expect for its size and price. The newly redesigned cabin is smartly laid out, is roomier than the car's size would suggest, and is available with features you'd expect to find at a higher price point. The Rio is available with one engine and either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. The Rio used every ounce of the engine's 130 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque, and did fine accelerating onto the freeway. This isn't a ton of power, but the benefit is better fuel economy. Considering this is a commuter car, getting mpg as good as 29 in the city and 37 on the highway will offer a bigger benefit than high horsepower in the long run.</p>, <p>TECH-FRIENDLY INTERIOR<br>
It's easy to stay connected in the Rio, with available features like a 7-inch display to run Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Sirius satellite radio is standard, Bluetooth and a rearview camera are available, and there's a USB jack and optional charger.<br>

The Kia Rio is one of the least expensive cars to offer Autonomous Emergency Braking. There's also a long list of safety features that are standard across the board. Six airbags, hill-start assist, vehicle-stability management and tire-pressure monitoring are included on every Rio.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Kia Rio's relatively roomy interior looks more upscale than you may expect in this size category -- even in the base LX -- and contains several appealing convenience and tech features. The screen serves as the infotainment center and is well placed near the top of the dashboard. Controls to adjust temperature and the stereo are logically placed and within easy reach. Steering-wheel-mounted controls are standard; the more features your Rio has, the more features you can control via buttons on the steering wheel. Leather accents are optional on the EX.</p>, <p>Whether in 4-door sedan or 5-door hatchback form, the Rio's new looks have a European influence, and the Rio is now both sportier and more mature than in the past. Even though the sedan and hatch share the same wheelbase, the sedan is almost 13 inches longer. All models come with 15-inch wheels and tires, but step up to the EX and your Rio rides on alloy wheels. Also differentiating the EX from the rest are fog lights, a black-and-chrome grille, and a black/body-color bumper.</p>, <p>The starting price for the base LX, including destination fees, is under $15,000. There are some pleasant standard-equipment surprises in the LX trim, such as the 5-inch audio display, steering-wheel-mounted controls, air conditioning, tinted glass, Sirius satellite radio and extensive safety equipment. However, you'll be cranking the windows by hand, the 15-inch wheels are steel with covers, you don't get a center console with armrest, a 60/40-split rear seat comes only on S-and-higher Rio <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> (standard on <a alt_o_t="Hatchbacks" href="/hatchback/">hatchbacks</a>), and power seats aren't offered on any trim level.</p>, <p>If you opt for the top-of-the-line EX, you're welcomed by a Rio with alloy wheels, front fog lights, heated side mirrors, tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel (it's tilt-only on LX and S) and a 3.5-inch LCD display within the gauge cluster. You control UVO3 infotainment and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto through a 7-inch screen, and you get cruise control and one-touch auto up/down power windows. On the safety side, all EX models come with Autonomous Emergency Braking.</p>, <p>The engine is an updated version of the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that powered last year's Rio. Power is down a bit -- a mere eight horsepower -- from last year, but the upside is that fuel economy has improved for 2018, by one mpg on the highway and as much as two mpg in the city. You can get a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission in either the 4-door sedan or the 5-door hatchback.<br>
<br>
 1.6-liter inline-4<br>
 130 horsepower @ 6,300 rpm<br>
 119 lb-ft of torque @ 4,850 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 29/37 mpg (manual), 28/37 mpg (automatic)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The value-minded 2018 Kia Rio sedan starts with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price of $14,795 for the LX with the 6-speed manual. That is $1,160 less than in 2017. Spend another $1,090 and you get the 6-speed automatic. The hatchback starts at $15,095, which is also a lower starting price than last year. Both body styles top out at around $21,000. The Honda Fit and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa%20note/">Nissan Versa Note</a> hatchbacks have starting prices that are a little higher than the Rio, as does the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/toyota/yaris/2018/">2018 Toyota Yaris</a>. On the sedan side, you can get a Ford Fiesta for just under $15,000 and the Nissan Versa for around $13,000.

[<p>A favorite with families looking for a comfortable, versatile and safe <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a>, the popular 2018 Kia Sedona is available with seating for seven or as many as eight passengers. Available in five trim levels, the 2018 Kia Sedona fits a range of budgets, and with a starting price under $28,000, it’s less expensive than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/odyssey/">Honda Odyssey</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sienna/">Toyota Sienna</a>. All five are powered by a strong 276-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 and smooth 6-speed automatic transmission, a combination that gives the front-wheel-drive Sedona ample acceleration. The new Sedona also offers a smooth ride, a well-crafted interior and a much longer warranty than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chrysler/pacifica/">Chrysler Pacifica</a>. Many high-tech safety systems are available, including Autonomous Emergency Braking and Blind Spot Detection. When equipped with Forward Collision Warning, the new Sedona earns a Top Safety Pick + rating from the <a alt_o_t="Insurance" href="/car-insurance/">Insurance</a> Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a stylish family hauler with a smooth ride, a comfortable interior and the highest safety ratings you’ll like the 2018 Kia Sedona. It’s also a strong value, with a cavernous interior, a powerful V6 engine, a class-leading warranty and a starting price around $28,000.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an all-wheel-drive minivan you’re looking in the wrong place. Only the Toyota Sienna offers all-wheel drive in this class. Also, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sedona/">Kia Sedona</a> is not offered as a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>. The only hybrid in the minivan class is the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chrysler/pacifica%20hybrid/">Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid</a>, and it is the most fuel-efficient minivan available.</p>, <p>Changes to the new Kia Sedona for 2018 are limited to a few new available colors. Silky Silver replaces Bright Silver, Celestial Blue replaces Midnight Sapphire and Beachwood Pearl is no longer available.</p>, <p>From behind the wheel the 2018 Kia Sedona is one of the most fun minivans to drive. It’s powerful, responsive and out on the road it magically feels smaller than it really is. Unlike some of its rivals, the Sedona doesn’t make you feel like you’re the captain of a cruise ship. The minivan’s ride quality is smooth and comfortable, but the Sedona also handles well, with quick steering, good balance and excellent body control. It doesn’t lean way over in the turns and it doesn’t feel tipsy or top-heavy. You’ll be surprised how much this <a alt_o_t="Van" href="/van-minivan/">van</a> likes to get thrown around. And it has plenty of power. The large 3.3-liter V6 has a strong kick off the line and its 276 horsepower give it a satisfying surge of passing power out on the highway. Steep grades, even when the Sedona is packed with people and possessions, are not a problem.</p>, <p>AROUND VIEW MONITOR<br>
 Optional on the SX and standard on the SX Limited trim levels, the Around View Monitor makes parking and maneuvering the 2018 Kia Sedona much easier, especially in tight spaces. It uses cameras mounted around the minivan’s exterior to provide the driver with a 360-degree bird’s-eye view of the vehicle and its surroundings.<br>
<br>
 AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
 Optional on the 2018 Kia Sedona LX, EX and SX, and standard on the top SX Limited trim level, this system reads the road ahead for obstacles in your path, including vehicles or pedestrians. If it determines a collision is imminent and the Sedona’s driver is not taking action, it will apply the brakes for you.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Like its competitors, the new Kia Sedona has three rows of seats and seating for eight or seven passengers, the latter figure reserved for higher-end trims with the desirable 2nd-row chairs. Although cavernous inside and more spacious than most 3-row <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna and Chrysler Pacifica are larger and provide more people space and more cargo capacity behind the 3rd-row seats. Seat comfort is excellent, especially with the First Class Lounge Seating option, which equips a Sedona SX Limited with reclining 2nd-row seats worthy of a living room. We also appreciate the Sedona’s contemporary cockpit layout. It looks great and the controls are intuitive and easy to reach.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a> design has become a world leader regardless of price point, and the new 2018 Kia Sedona is a looker, especially in SX Limited trim wearing its chrome 19-inch wheels. Kia set out to make this family vehicle look more like an SUV and less like a minivan. Key elements are a hoodline with less slope, side panels with minimal creases, and a beltline rising from the windshield pillar to the rear of the van. The front fascia features Kia’s signature “tiger nose” grille and LED accents for the headlights, while the rear sports a roof spoiler and LED taillights.</p>, <p>Available in five trim levels, there’s a 2018 Sedona for essentially every budget. Standard equipment on the L includes AM/FM/CD/satellite audio system with 5.0-inch touch screen, Bluetooth and USB/auxiliary inputs, a rearview camera, air conditioning with front and rear controls, and the all-important pop-out "conversation mirror" to keep an eye on back-seat shenanigans. Other road-trip perks include 12 cup holders and tricot-fabric upholstery with built-in stain-resistance. Safety features include a bevy of airbags, traction and stability systems, and hill-start assist control. As with all new Kias, the Sedona has an excellent 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.</p>, <p>Adding features to the new Kia Sedona means climbing trims. The LX includes 8-way-power driver's seat, power-sliding rear doors and power-folding outside mirrors. EX models add quite a bit more value with a power-operated liftgate, leather seating, Kia's updated UVO infotainment system, USB 2.1 charger ports, backup-warning system, and tri-zone climate control. SX models have Infinity premium audio, 8-inch touch screen with navigation, ventilated front seats, blind-spot monitoring and LED headlights. Top-line SX Limited models up the luxe factor with Nappa leather, lounge seating, dual sunroofs and a heated steering wheel. Other options include smart cruise control and forward-collision and lane-departure warnings.</p>, <p>The new 2018 Sedona is front-wheel drive and powered by a 276-horsepower 3.3-liter V6 with direct fuel injection that has also proven impressive in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/cadenza/">Kia Cadenza</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> and Sorento SUV. It works wonderfully with the Sedona’s 6-speed automatic transmission and delivers plenty of power for this family hauler. Acceleration is more than adequate. The Kia Sedona's towing capacity is rated at 3,500 pounds. EPA fuel-economy ratings are 18 mpg in the city, 24 mpg on the highway on the three lower trims, and decrease slightly in the generously equipped SX Limited model. Those numbers are competitive for the class.<br/> <br/> 3.3-liter V6<br/> 276 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 248 lb-ft of torque @ 5,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/24 mpg (L, LX, EX models), 18/25 mpg (SX), 17/22 mpg (SXL)</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Sedona has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at about $28,000 for a base L model including a $950 fee for destination. On the other end, the top-line SX Limited begins at nearly $43,000 and can climb a few thousand higher with options. Realistically, a mid-trim EX model that starts at roughly $34,500 represents a very good value. The Sedona is among the least expensive full-size minivans. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/quest/">Nissan Quest</a> and Chrysler Pacifica start around the same price, while the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna are a couple thousand beyond the Sedona's base price. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Kia minivan. When it comes to <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> the Sedona has typically trailed that of the Sienna and Odyssey.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/kia/sorento/2018
[<p>The 2018 Kia Sorento offers loads of amenities, an upper-crust-appearing interior, sharp looks, and one of the best warranties in the business. Available in 2-row and 3-row configurations, able to seat five and seven passengers respectively, the 2018 Sorento offers different configurations for different needs. Three engines, all-wheel drive, and prices that range from mid-$20,000 to more than $45,000 mean there's a Sorento for just about any need and budget. The 2018 Kia Sorento is smaller than its primary rivals, such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/pathfinder/">Nissan Pathfinder</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/explorer/">Ford Explorer</a>. That means the third row is smaller, and there isn't as much cargo space. On the other hand, it's easier to maneuver and park.</p>, <p>Kia’s 2018 Sorento offers lots of features, lots of warranty and some pretty high-end styling. Its smaller size could be a perfect Goldilocks scenario if you don't want a big machine. Its available 5-passenger versions open up the rear for tons of cargo space, too.</p>, <p>The Sorento only seats seven, and even then it's pretty cramped in the third row. If you want more space, the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander is a better bet.</p>, <p>For 2018 the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sorento/">Kia Sorento</a> gets a handful of updates. For example, the hands-free power liftgate is now standard on EX models, as are power-folding side mirrors. A Cool and Connected package adds dual-zone climate control and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to LX models.<b></b></p>, <p>Whether you're choosing a base model with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, a 5-passenger EX with the 2.0-liter turbo, or one of the higher-end models with the V6, you'll likely be more than satisfied with the way the Kia Sorento drives. Not surprisingly, the turbo and V6 feel strongest, but the 2.4 is adequate and offers better fuel economy, making the most of the 6-speed automatic transmission all the engines use. The steering, suspension, handling and ride are all what we expect from the class; it doesn't lead the pack, but neither does it call attention to itself for the wrong reasons. The Kia Sorento uses an all-wheel-drive (AWD) system with Torque Vectoring Cornering Control, designed to enhance traction and cornering stability by sending power and torque to where they’re most needed, not just in bad weather, but for better cornering on dry roads, too.</p>, <p>AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
With the modern technology of smartphones leading to more and more distracted driving, the Kia Sorento turns to a different kind of modern technology to prevent disaster. Available on Sorento LX models and above is <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a>'s automatic braking system, which scans the road ahead and hits the brakes if it senses an impending collision.<br>
 <br>
SMART LIFTGATE<br>
While many manufacturers offer a hands-free way of opening the rear hatch, we like Kia's solution. The Smart Liftgate automatically opens if you just stand near it with the key fob in your possession, letting you access it when your hands are full, while still keeping both feet on the ground.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>For the past couple years Kia has excelled in offering interior design, materials and assembly that feel far more luxurious than the price tag suggests. That holds true for the 2018 Sorento. Available in 5- and 7-passenger configurations, the Sorento's dash is simple but elegant, with just enough chrome trim to make it feel special. There's plenty of room and comfort in the first and second rows, but the third row in 7-passenger versions is for small passengers and short trips. There's not a lot of cargo space behind the third row either, although the seats fold down to expand that dramatically.</p>, <p>Like the interior, the 2018 Sorento projects a sophisticated and upscale look from the outside. We like the "tiger-nose" grille treatment, and the overall blunt styling. Some of us think that it's the best-looking <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUV</a> in its class, although beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Details include the multi-element LED fog lights on some models, LED accent lights in the headlights, and the tastefully appropriate use of chrome to class things up. Wheel sizes range from 17-inch alloys on base and LX models, to the 18-inch alloys on EX models, all the way to 19-inchers on SX models.</p>, <p>The base 2018 Kia Sorento L is a bargain play, but it's still decently equipped with keyless entry, cruise control, stain-resistant cloth upholstery and basic AM/FM/CD audio system with Bluetooth connectivity and a USB input. It also comes with a rearview camera and auto on/off headlights, both new this year. However, the better bet is the LX model, which adds a sound-deadening windshield, touch-screen audio display, and the simple ability to add options to your Sorento, plus all-wheel drive. Safety features include airbags all around and a slew of traction- and stability-control systems.</p>, <p>As with most cars these days, features are added by climbing the trim ladder. The Sorento EX offers a good value, coming standard with Kia's UVO infotainment system that offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There's also leather seating, keyless start, and dual-zone climate control, 2nd-row window shades, power driver's seat, heated front seats and either a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine or V6. The SX Limited adds blind-spot monitoring, a panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated Nappa leather front seats, power liftgate, 8-inch touch screen with navigation, Infinity audio system and driving aids like lane-keep assist, smart cruise control and the new auto-braking feature.</p>, <p>The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that's standard in L and LX models puts out 185 horsepower, 178 lb-ft of torque, and gets 28 mpg on the highway, the best fuel economy the Sorento offers. The 2.0-liter turbo available in the EX and Limited Sorento SUV models gets 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, but it's only available on 2-row models. The 3-row EX and Limited models, and all SX models, come with the 3.3-liter V6 with 290 horsepower. All of the engines come with a 6-speed automatic, and Kia's torque-vectoring all-wheel drive (AWD) is available instead of front-wheel drive (FWD) on all but the base L model. The Sorento can tow between 2,000 and 5,000 pounds, depending on engine and drive configuration.<br>

That's a lower base price than competitors like the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Highlander and Ford Explorer. If you want a V6, the LX V6 starts at about $30,500, while the turbocharged EX starts at just under $34,000. A fully loaded Sorento SX Limited with AWD starts at just over the $47,000 mark. All-wheel drive adds about $1,800 to every trim except the 4-cylinder LX, where it's $2,790 because it comes with the third-row seats. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Kia. The Sorento's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> should be good, but still short of the Toyota Highlander.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/kia/soul/2018
[<p>Since its debut, we’ve loved everything about the Kia Soul except its lack of power. Well, that all changed last year with the introduction of a new turbocharged engine. With more power onboard, the 2018 Kia Soul wagon delivers in every area that matters. Its styling remains fresh and funky, and the interior provides room for five, or two people and a ton of cargo. Kia knows its intending audience is a young one, so Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are along for the ride, too. While the 2018 Kia Soul doesn’t offer the all-wheel-drive capability of the Fiat 500X, Mazda CX-3 or Mini Cooper Countryman, it competes well against the Chevrolet Cruze and Honda Civic hatchbacks, and its 10-year/100,000-mile warranty smokes them all. The all-electric Soul EV touts gas-free driving, and its range has increased to 111 miles.</p>, <p>Kia’s 2018 Soul compact wagon is a tempting choice for anyone seeking a boldly styled, fun-to-drive hatchback that’s as easy on the wallet as it is on gas. Available equipment like a harman/kardon audio system and advanced driver-assist features make the choice all the more easy to live with.</p>, <p>If you need your next <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">compact car</a> to have the year-round driving ability afforded by all-wheel drive, you’ll need to look elsewhere. And, while the 2018 Kia Soul is a competent driver, it lacks the go-kart-like ride and handling of the Mazda3, Honda Civic and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Kia Soul sees the UVO3 infotainment system expanded to the Base Convenience package and made standard on the Soul Plus. The Plus Primo package becomes the Primo Lit package and gains HID headlights, LED positioning lights and a new Wild Orange paint option. A more powerful battery increases the Soul EV's full-charge electric range to 111 miles (up from last year's 93 miles), which is good, but can't match the new Nissan Leaf's 150 miles and pales beside the Chevrolet Bolt's 238.</p>, <p>The Soul’s driving experience is on par with similar cars like the Nissan Juke, Chevy Trax and Hyundai Elantra GT, but it’s the turbocharged engine in the 2018 Kia Soul Exclaim that really wakes this car up. The Exclaim’s on-road performance is further enhanced by firmer shock and spring settings along with a big 18-inch wheel/tire package. While we give Kia credit for improving the Soul’s steering feedback, it’s still not up to the standard set by the Honda Civic and Mazda3. Cornering capabilities are better than one would expect from such a tall vehicle, but some of the fun is sapped from the experience by the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. We found it slow to shift, and random surges of power sometimes made us question if the transmission was fully engaged, even when using the Sport setting. And why are there no steering-wheel paddle shifters? Oh well, maybe next year. The battery-powered Kia Soul EV has the quiet operation desirable of electric vehicles (EVs), but not the quickness. It takes over 11 seconds for the Soul EV to reach 60 mph. The Chevy Bolt are both significantly quicker and offer longer ranges.</p>, <p>TURBO POWER<br>
Who doesn’t love horsepower? With the 2018 Kia Soul 5-door wagon, you’ll get all the power you need without sacrificing fuel economy. In fact, the turbocharged engine in the Soul Exclaim gets the best fuel economy of the Soul’s three engines. The only penalty is the extra cost, but it’s worth it.<br>
<br>
APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO<br>
With Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, your infotainment system will always be as up to date as the latest smartphone. Both systems allow you to access everything on your phone, such as the iPhone’s Apple Music or Android’s Google Maps.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Soul wagon offers 5-passenger seating, although four will be more comfortable. Upholstery and trim get notably better as you climb the model ladder, with the Soul Exclaim getting contrast stitching on its cloth and leather seats, plus a sporty D-shaped steering wheel. Available dual USB ports allow you to recharge one phone while the other is used for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. The Soul's boxy shape provides very good headroom for all passengers, and offers good cargo space, especially when you fold the rear seatbacks down. The pulsating speaker lights are pure whimsy.</p>, <p>You'll still immediately recognize Kia’s Soul for 2018 for what it is, but there are minor tweaks to the exterior that distinguish from the first generation. Front and rear bumpers have changed a bit, with the Soul Plus getting body-color inserts, and the Soul Exclaim getting black. The Exclaim also distinguishes itself from its non-turbo mates with 18-inch alloy wheels, dual exhaust tips, HID headlights and LED fog lights – updating an exterior already known for a quirky blend of function and fashion. The upright styling offers good cargo and passenger space, and the distinctive vertical taillights are practically the car's signature. The Soul EV has a front charge port tucked neatly away behind a solid grille in front.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Soul comes in three models: Base, Plus (+) and Exclaim (!). Base models include 16-inch alloy wheels, a new drive-mode function, and an updated audio system. They combine with preexisting features: air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, 6-way-manual-adjust driver's seat, power windows and door locks and Bluetooth wireless technology. The standard engine is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder connected to a 6-speed manual transmission, making the base model the only Soul available with a stick. Higher-level models come standard with more, like bigger engines, better interior materials, and larger wheels, including 18-inch alloys on the Exclaim. The Soul EV comes in two trims: The EV and the better-equipped EV+. Both come with heated front seats and steering wheel, environmentally-friendly interior materials, a DC Fast Charge port, and the ability to start the climate system while the vehicle is still charging.</p>, <p>Options vary by model level, with base models with an automatic transmission offering a Convenience Package that adds the UVO3 infotainment system with a rearview camera, and automatic headlights. Soul Plus offers the Primo Lit package that combines a panoramic sunroof, leather seats with power adjustments and heating and cooling in front, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and a bunch of other features. Then there's the Exclaim which, along with the turbo engine, offers a panoramic sunroof and a Technology package that adds most of what's in the Primo Lit package, along with a harman/kardon audio system. The top-line Soul EV+ comes with leather seating and heated rear seats, and offers an optional panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>The Soul Base model gets a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with a meager 130 horsepower, connected to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic; to say it's sluggish is an understatement. The Soul Plus comes with a more satisfactory 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 161 horsepower connected only to a 6-speed automatic. Last, there’s the 1.6-liter turbocharged engine, with its 201 horsepower and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. All Soul models are front-wheel drive and while all are fairly fuel-efficient, the thriftiest is actually the turbo, and not the base model. The electric Kia Soul EV makes 109 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Charge times take from 33 hours on a 120-volt outlet to a more reasonable 5-plus on a 240-volt outlet. DC Fast Charging can be done in about 30 minutes.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/kia/soul-ev/2018
[<p>Since its debut, we’ve loved everything about the Kia Soul except its lack of power. Well, that all changed last year with the introduction of a new turbocharged engine. With more power onboard, the 2018 Kia Soul wagon delivers in every area that matters. Its styling remains fresh and funky, and the interior provides room for five, or two people and a ton of cargo. Kia knows its intending audience is a young one, so Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are along for the ride, too. While the 2018 Kia Soul doesn’t offer the all-wheel-drive capability of the Fiat 500X, Mazda CX-3 or Mini Cooper Countryman, it competes well against the Chevrolet Cruze and Honda Civic hatchbacks, and its 10-year/100,000-mile warranty smokes them all. The all-electric Soul EV touts gas-free driving, and its range has increased to 111 miles.</p>, <p>Kia’s 2018 Soul compact wagon is a tempting choice for anyone seeking a boldly styled, fun-to-drive hatchback that’s as easy on the wallet as it is on gas. Available equipment like a harman/kardon audio system and advanced driver-assist features make the choice all the more easy to live with.</p>, <p>If you need your next <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">compact car</a> to have the year-round driving ability afforded by all-wheel drive, you’ll need to look elsewhere. And, while the 2018 Kia Soul is a competent driver, it lacks the go-kart-like ride and handling of the Mazda3, Honda Civic and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Kia Soul sees the UVO3 infotainment system expanded to the Base Convenience package and made standard on the Soul Plus. The Plus Primo package becomes the Primo Lit package and gains HID headlights, LED positioning lights and a new Wild Orange paint option. A more powerful battery increases the Soul EV's full-charge electric range to 111 miles (up from last year's 93 miles), which is good, but can't match the new Nissan Leaf's 150 miles and pales beside the Chevrolet Bolt's 238.</p>, <p>The Soul’s driving experience is on par with similar cars like the Nissan Juke, Chevy Trax and Hyundai Elantra GT, but it’s the turbocharged engine in the 2018 Kia Soul Exclaim that really wakes this car up. The Exclaim’s on-road performance is further enhanced by firmer shock and spring settings along with a big 18-inch wheel/tire package. While we give Kia credit for improving the Soul’s steering feedback, it’s still not up to the standard set by the Honda Civic and Mazda3. Cornering capabilities are better than one would expect from such a tall vehicle, but some of the fun is sapped from the experience by the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. We found it slow to shift, and random surges of power sometimes made us question if the transmission was fully engaged, even when using the Sport setting. And why are there no steering-wheel paddle shifters? Oh well, maybe next year. The battery-powered Kia Soul EV has the quiet operation desirable of electric vehicles (EVs), but not the quickness. It takes over 11 seconds for the Soul EV to reach 60 mph. The Chevy Bolt are both significantly quicker and offer longer ranges.</p>, <p>TURBO POWER<br>
Who doesn’t love horsepower? With the 2018 Kia Soul 5-door wagon, you’ll get all the power you need without sacrificing fuel economy. In fact, the turbocharged engine in the Soul Exclaim gets the best fuel economy of the Soul’s three engines. The only penalty is the extra cost, but it’s worth it.<br>
<br>
APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO<br>
With Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, your infotainment system will always be as up to date as the latest smartphone. Both systems allow you to access everything on your phone, such as the iPhone’s Apple Music or Android’s Google Maps.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Soul wagon offers 5-passenger seating, although four will be more comfortable. Upholstery and trim get notably better as you climb the model ladder, with the Soul Exclaim getting contrast stitching on its cloth and leather seats, plus a sporty D-shaped steering wheel. Available dual USB ports allow you to recharge one phone while the other is used for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. The Soul's boxy shape provides very good headroom for all passengers, and offers good cargo space, especially when you fold the rear seatbacks down. The pulsating speaker lights are pure whimsy.</p>, <p>You'll still immediately recognize Kia’s Soul for 2018 for what it is, but there are minor tweaks to the exterior that distinguish from the first generation. Front and rear bumpers have changed a bit, with the Soul Plus getting body-color inserts, and the Soul Exclaim getting black. The Exclaim also distinguishes itself from its non-turbo mates with 18-inch alloy wheels, dual exhaust tips, HID headlights and LED fog lights – updating an exterior already known for a quirky blend of function and fashion. The upright styling offers good cargo and passenger space, and the distinctive vertical taillights are practically the car's signature. The Soul EV has a front charge port tucked neatly away behind a solid grille in front.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Soul comes in three models: Base, Plus (+) and Exclaim (!). Base models include 16-inch alloy wheels, a new drive-mode function, and an updated audio system. They combine with preexisting features: air conditioning, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, 6-way-manual-adjust driver's seat, power windows and door locks and Bluetooth wireless technology. The standard engine is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder connected to a 6-speed manual transmission, making the base model the only Soul available with a stick. Higher-level models come standard with more, like bigger engines, better interior materials, and larger wheels, including 18-inch alloys on the Exclaim. The Soul EV comes in two trims: The EV and the better-equipped EV+. Both come with heated front seats and steering wheel, environmentally-friendly interior materials, a DC Fast Charge port, and the ability to start the climate system while the vehicle is still charging.</p>, <p>Options vary by model level, with base models with an automatic transmission offering a Convenience Package that adds the UVO3 infotainment system with a rearview camera, and automatic headlights. Soul Plus offers the Primo Lit package that combines a panoramic sunroof, leather seats with power adjustments and heating and cooling in front, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and a bunch of other features. Then there's the Exclaim which, along with the turbo engine, offers a panoramic sunroof and a Technology package that adds most of what's in the Primo Lit package, along with a harman/kardon audio system. The top-line Soul EV+ comes with leather seating and heated rear seats, and offers an optional panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>The Soul Base model gets a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with a meager 130 horsepower, connected to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic; to say it's sluggish is an understatement. The Soul Plus comes with a more satisfactory 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 161 horsepower connected only to a 6-speed automatic. Last, there’s the 1.6-liter turbocharged engine, with its 201 horsepower and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. All Soul models are front-wheel drive and while all are fairly fuel-efficient, the thriftiest is actually the turbo, and not the base model. The electric Kia Soul EV makes 109 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Charge times take from 33 hours on a 120-volt outlet to a more reasonable 5-plus on a 240-volt outlet. DC Fast Charging can be done in about 30 minutes.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/kia/sportage/2018
[<p>With last year's redesign still fresh, the 2018 Kia Sportage gets a host of updates to keep it competitive with the likes of the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and other compact- and subcompact-crossover SUVs. It all enhances an already compelling SUV, one that more than holds its own against its competition. It sports good value, a comfortable and roomy interior, and a long list of standard and available features, not to mention Kia's excellent warranty. All-wheel drive is of course available, as is a powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder if you're willing to sacrifice fuel economy. Now in its fourth generation, the Sportage is actually Kia's longest-running nameplate, and proof of how far this Korean company has come in the last two decades.</p>, <p>The 2018 Sportage offers style, features, an excellent warranty, and expanded availability of high-tech safety equipment like autonomous emergency braking. Throw in upscale features like climate-controlled seats, a harman/kardon audio system and a turbocharged engine, and this budget SUV feels much more premium.</p>, <p>The new Honda CR-V offers more room and better fuel economy than the Sportage. If you need more space, especially a third row, the Kia Sorento might be a better bet. If you want even better fuel economy, the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid might make sense.</p>, <p>The base-model LX can now be equipped with blind-spot and rear-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, autonomous emergency braking and outside-mirror turn signals thanks to the new Technology Package. All that's now standard on the EX, and the SX now gets an electronic parking brake with auto hold.</p>, <p>It'd be easy to just point to the 240-horsepower turbocharged Sportage SX as the model to get, thanks to its additional power, but the reality is that few will complain about the standard 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and its 181 horsepower. It's a surprisingly eager combination, with the standard 6-speed automatic transmission unobtrusive in its operation, just as it should be. The bonus is that it also gets notably better fuel economy than the turbo. That's not to say that the turbo's additional power isn't without its charms of course, and if you're looking for maximum acceleration, then the SX and its turbo engine are the way to go. Kia has improved its electrically assisted power steering to the point where it feels more natural than before, and the suspension overall, even in SX models, is smoother and less harsh than in the previous Sportage.</p>, <p>GLORIOUS KNOBS<br/> The Kia Sportage has a touch-screen navigation system of course, but the volume, tuning, and the climate-control temperatures are set with knobs, while most other functions use actual buttons. Maybe we're old-fashioned, but in our cars we prefer the tactile feedback of a button or knob over a touch-sensitive surface.<br/> <br/> LUXURY AMENITIES, MAINSTREAM PRICE<br/> The climate-controlled seats, heated steering wheel, premium harman/kardon audio system and power tailgate on the Kia Sportage were the exclusive purview of luxury cars not too long ago. That they're all available in a mid-priced compact SUV proves you don't need to spend premium money to get premium amenities.<br/> </p>, <p>We like the comfortable driver's seat, thoughtfully laid-out interior, and good outward visibility. Thoughtful features include cubbies and other storage spaces, and a 12-volt outlet and USB port for rear-seat passengers. The second row also gets heated outboard seats on some models, a nice complement to the good head- and legroom, and the fact that the seatbacks recline. There's an available panoramic sunroof, but it cuts into headroom. Cargo space isn't up to the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, but its 30.7 cubic feet with the rear seat up is still pretty good, and the floor can be lowered as well.</p>, <p>You either like the high-mounted headlights or you don't, so you can make up your own mind there. As for the rest of the stubby little Sportage, we're quite fond of it. The lines are clean and crisp. The "tiger-nose" grille treatment works well here, both aesthetically and in establishing the Sportage as a Kia from first glance. The SX Turbo models get dual exhausts and cool LED fog lights. If you opt for all-wheel drive (AWD) you get a bit more ride height versus the front-wheel-drive models (FWD), and a unique nose with a steeper approach angle.</p>, <p>The base Sportage LX model adds stain-resistant YES Essentials upholstery as standard equipment, which includes a 5-inch touch-screen display and rearview camera, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD player with USB input and Bluetooth wireless connectivity, drive-mode selector (Sport, Normal, Eco), and automatic headlights. The mid-level EX is an even better deal, especially since blind-spot detection, cross-traffic alert, power-folding outside mirrors with turn signals, and glossy interior trim were added to a standard-equipment list that includes a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, power driver's seat, leather upholstery and dual-zone climate control. Standard on SX models this year is an electronic parking brake.</p>, <p>All models offer Kia's Dynamax AWD that includes locking differential for improved traction on slick surfaces. Beyond the powerful engine, the top-line SX Turbo includes things like navigation with an 8-inch touch screen, lane-departure warning, panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel, and auto-dimming rearview mirror. There's no CD player with the premium 320-watt harman/kardon sound system, but its Clari-Fi technology improves the sound of digital music files. We particularly like the power hatch, which features Kia's hands-free operation: Just stand near it when you have the key, and the hatch opens automatically.</p>, <p>The base 2.4-liter 4-cylinder offers up 181 horsepower, which is par for the course in this class. If you need more boost, literally, the turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder offers up 240 horsepower. Both engines power either the front or all four wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy isn't the strongest selling point for the Sportage, whether you're talking about the standard engine or the turbo. At best, FWD models earn ratings of 23-mpg city/30 highway, while a turbo AWD Sportage gets a middling 20/23. The Kia Sportage can tow up to 2,000 pounds.<br>

However, you really want the Sportage EX, with its additional features and a reasonable price of a bit more than $27,000. If you want turbo power, the SX starts at just under $33,700. Bring an extra $1,500 if you want all-wheel drive on the EX or SX. Generally speaking those prices are comparable to the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, and even better in a few cases.

---------http://www.kbb.com/kia/stinger/2018
[<p>The 2018 Kia Stinger is an all-new model from the Korean automaker, and its mission statement couldn’t be simpler: Change everything you think about <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a>. This svelte 4-door liftback targets no less than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a> Gran <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a> and our Best Buys-winning Audi A5 Sportback, lofty goals to be sure. Yet the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/stinger/">Kia Stinger</a> comes equipped for the fight, with rear- or all-wheel drive (RWD, AWD), turbocharged engines boasting either 255 or 365 horsepower, a sport-tuned suspension, sharp steering, and the kinds of road dynamics we associate with, well, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>. Whether the public is ready to accept a full-fledged sports <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> from Kia is unclear, but for those buyers willing to take a chance, they're going to be very satisfied.</p>, <p>If you want a sports sedan because you love driving and are less concerned about impressing valets with a fancy badge, then the 2018 Kia Stinger may be just what you're looking for. With excellent handling, plenty of power and sharp steering, the Kia Stinger is the real deal.</p>, <p>While prices for a base rear-drive 4-cylinder model start reasonably enough in the low-$30,000 range, those prices climb quickly, and can break through the $50,000 barrier. That's BMW and Audi territory, and it may be hard to justify spending premium money without a premium brand to show for it.</p>, <p>The 2018 Kia Stinger is all-new, from where it touches the pavement to the roof panel. Beyond that, the Stinger represents a new philosophy for Kia, with Justin Sohn, Kia's North American president and CEO, going so far as to say it will "divide our history into before and after."</p>, <p>From the moment you pull away from a stop, it's obvious that the 2018 Kia Stinger is something special. From the growl of the 365-horsepower V6, to the sharp steering, to the bite of the suspension, this Kia means business. Best of all, it's not an illusion: this is as legit a sports sedan as you could hope for. The engine pours out power seamlessly, and the 8-speed automatic transmission snaps off shifts quickly and smoothly. In corners, there's just enough suspension travel to keep the Stinger from being upset when it encounters bumps, but not so much that it leans too far. Different driving modes range from Smart, Eco, Comfort and Sport; the last of those would seem like the default, but we thought it made the steering unnecessarily heavy. Instead, switch to Custom and program the steering to Comfort and you'll find just the right balance. Dial it back from those extremes and just cruise, and you can appreciate the upscale interior accommodations, comfortable seats and quiet cabin. Yet even when relaxed, the Stinger provides just enough feedback through the steering wheel and suspension to remind you that at a moment's notice it's ready to play.</p>, <p>CHASSIS DYNAMICS<br/> Key to any sports sedan is well-developed chassis dynamics, something the Stinger absolutely nails. With an ideal balance between ride and comfort, the 2018 Stinger feels every bit the European sports sedan it hopes to emulate.<br/> <br/> LIFTBACK BODY<br/> There is a rebellion against crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> quietly beginning, and as proof we submit the recent availability of liftback-bodied cars like the Kia Stinger. Offering nearly as much utility as a crossover SUV but in a sleeker shape, the Stinger doesn't sacrifice usefulness for sport.<br/> </p>, <p>The Stinger's interior looks like Kia ran its standard layout through a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> filter. The familiar layout reminds us of the Forte, Cadenza, Sedona <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a>, etc., yet everything feels and looks nicer. We like the exposed speaker grilles and Mercedes-Benz S-Class-style eyeball center vents. We even like the metallic finish on the infotainment controls, even though it makes reading the lettering on the buttons difficult. There's plenty of room in the front and rear seats for four, although anyone in the center position in back will likely feel cramped. Lift that big hatch and you have tons of cargo space, with foldable seats providing even more.</p>, <p>The 2018 Stinger offers classic rear-drive proportions, with a long hood and short rear deck, the latter part of its useful liftback design. While the design incorporates many of the cues we've come to expect from Kia, such as the "tiger-nose" grille treatment, it's not like any Kia before it. The silhouette could be mistaken for an Audi A5 Sportback, for example, or maybe a BMW 4 Series Gran Sport. Yet the surface details are notably different. In fact, some think maybe the exterior is trying a bit too hard, and if you think its various vents, winglets and elongated taillights all come across as fussy, rather than sporty, you're not alone.</p>, <p>True to its role as an alternative to premium European brands, even the base Kia Stinger comes nicely equipped. Consider leather upholstery that includes the steering wheel and shift knob, push-button ignition and keyless entry, power driver and passenger seats, dual-zone climate control, and a 7-inch touch-screen audio system that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The base engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder driving the rear wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddles for manual shifting. On the safety side, in addition to multiple airbags and the usual array of stability controls, the Stinger comes with front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera with dynamic guidelines, and a cool Brake Fade Compensation, which increases brake boost when it detects the brakes overheating.</p>, <p>The most notable options are all-wheel drive and the V6 engine, which is available in GT models. Like most modern cars, options are divided into trim levels for the most part; as you work up from the base model through Premium, GT, GT1 and GT2, you get more stuff. At the top, the GT2 gets a standard limited-slip differential, launch-control system, 19-inch wheels, LED headlights, black chrome trim and high-gloss hood vents. Inside, there's soft Nappa leather on the 16-way driver's seat, and other exclusive trim. We're particularly fond of the 720-watt harman/kardon audio system, which is also standard on Premium and GT1 models. Option packages include a driver-assist package that bundles forward-collision avoidance and warning, smart cruise control, lane-keep assist and warning, blind-spot and cross-traffic warning. Note those features come standard on GT2 models.</p>, <p>Two engines are available in the 2018 Stinger. Base and Premium models get a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 255 horsepower. That's a good helping of beans, and it certainly gets the Stinger moving, but unfortunately, it's not a particularly refined-sounding engine when it comes to smoothness and engine note. A better option is the 365-horsepower twin-turbo V6. Smooth, seamlessly powerful, and with an excellent engine note, this is definitely the powerplant for this car, and worth the premium you'll pay for it. Both engines come connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission. While a manual would be fun, we have no complaints about how quickly this automatic shifts, both on its own and when using the steering-wheel-mounted paddles. With up to 29 mpg, the 4-cylinder gets better fuel economy, but the V6's 25 mpg isn't bad; Kia recommends premium fuel for both engines.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/25 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on the base Stinger model with rear-wheel drive is a reasonable $32,800, including the $900 destination charge. Still, we suggest at least stepping up to the Premium model, which at $38,000 offers upscale items like LED headlights, power tilt/telescope steering wheel, seat memory, and more. The base V6 GT starts at about $39,200 and ranges up to a bit more than $50,000 for the GT2. All-wheel drive adds about $2,200 to any model. That's a lot for a brand normally associated with lower prices, but considering the Stinger is as capable as an Audi A5 Sportback or a BMW 4 Series Gran Turismo costing thousands more, it starts to look like a bargain.

[<p>As <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/land%20rover/">Land Rover</a> finalizes a move away from its old body-on-frame <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, some worry its newest models won’t have the same rugged feel and off-road capability. In the case of the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/land%20rover/discovery/2018/">2018 Land Rover Discovery</a>, a far more civilized, efficient and luxurious SUV has emerged, one that gives up nothing in its ability to tackle the great outdoors. Thanks to an extensive use of aluminum throughout the vehicle, the 3-row, 7-passenger Discovery feels lighter and more nimble than the old LR4, and its choice of supercharged gasoline or turbodiesel engines ensures ample power with respectable fuel economy. Land Rover’s advanced terrain-management setup guarantees the new Discovery can travel to off-road destinations no <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> will ever reach.</p>, <p>If you’ve been looking at 7-passenger luxury SUVs, but deep down you really want something with Jeep-like off-road abilities, the 2018 Land Rover Discovery has your name all over it. Its diesel engine and car-like driving characteristics give it a leg up over the less advanced <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gx/">Lexus GX</a> 460.</p>, <p>If you’re not interested in the Discovery’s off-road abilities or unproven track record, you can spend less and get the same level of luxury from an Acura MDX, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/xc90/">Volvo XC90</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/acadia/">GMC Acadia</a> Denali. Fans of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto are out of luck.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Discovery sees the diesel engine offered across the line, while the 10-inch Touch-Pro navigation screen and automatic emergency braking are made standard on every model. A new Head-Up Display (HUD) is offered on HSE and HSE Luxury trims, and both trims gain a new 12.3-inch interactive driver display.</p>, <p>That this mid-level luxury SUV reminds us so much of being behind the wheel of the larger, more expensive Range Rover speaks volumes about the 2018 Discovery’s design. Light years ahead of the old LR4, the Discovery not only rides and drives better than its predecessor, it is vastly quieter inside. Most owners will find the supercharged gasoline V6 more than adequate with an ability to propel the Discovery to 60 mph in under seven seconds. However, if you’re seeking maximum torque and fuel economy, we’d go with the 3.0-liter turbodiesel. The Discovery’s on-road manners are everything you’d expect from a Land Rover, and the same can be said of its off-road abilities. Be it loose sand, sloppy mud or deep snow, the Discovery’s Automatic Terrain Response fears no obstacle. Want more control? A number of user-selectable settings and an available low-range allow the driver to push the Discovery to its limits.</p>, <p>DUAL PERSONALITY<br>
While the Discovery has not strayed from Land Rover’s mission to tackle the world’s toughest terrain, it has made getting there a lot more enjoyable. Most would never guess this luxurious 7-passenger SUV can also climb steep hills and navigate through water nearly three feet deep.<br>
<br>
TECH TRICKS<br>
Technology lovers will enjoy the Discovery’s numerous high-tech gadgets, including a waterproof Activity Key wristband that allows access via the power tailgate and a set of power folding seats activated via the owner’s smartphone.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>All trims of the 2018 Discovery can seat seven passengers across three rows, but that configuration is optional on base and HSE models, which seat only five. Unlike other 3-row <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUVs" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUVs</a>, even adults can use the third row without feeling punished. The best seat remains the driver's. The frontal view out is great, and we continue to praise the infinitely adjustable armrests on the sides of the front seats. Cargo space behind the third row is very tight, but grows to roughly 40 cubic feet with the third row folded, and nearly 83 with the second row down.</p>, <p>The Discovery’s exterior shuns the blocky SUV design long associated with classic Land Rover SUVs, becoming softer and more rounded. The new language is clearly in step with the Range Rover and the Discovery's little brother, the Discovery Sport. While the shape has changed, the Discovery is still one tough and functional premium SUV, boasting over 11 inches of ground clearance. One of the LR4's signature design elements -- an asymmetrical, 2-piece tailgate -- is gone, but we welcome the standard power-operated one in its place. Moreover, the Discovery still offers a hidden inner tailgate that can hold up to 600 pounds.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Discovery is available in three trims: SE, HSE and HSE Luxury. The least expensive Discovery includes a supercharged V6 engine, full-time 4-wheel drive with single-speed transfer case and Terrain Response 2 system, dual-zone climate control, fixed panoramic sunroof, emergency braking, navigation, leather interior, 12-way-adjustable front seats, hands-free power tailgate and rear parking sensors. The basic infotainment system includes a 10-speaker, 250-watt audio system, Bluetooth connectivity and 10-inch touch screen. SE and HSE models come with 2-row/5-passenger seating. A 3-row/7-passenger setup is optional. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are still not offered.</p>, <p>We'd recommend at least the HSE trim, with tri-zone climate control, 380-watt Meridian audio, and power inner tailgate. It also opens the door to several option packages. The HSE Luxury comes with seating for seven, air suspension, 2-speed transfer case, 825-watt Meridian audio, heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel and 16-way front seats. Further options include surround camera system, blind-spot monitoring, traffic-sign recognizer, lane-keep assist, and adaptive cruise control. A locking rear differential makes this a serious off-roader.</p>, <p>Two V6 engines are available for the 2018 Discovery. Standard is a potent supercharged V6 gasoline engine. Optional is the V6 turbodiesel first seen in the Range Rover. The gasoline-engine Discovery feels swift, but we like the extra grunt and efficiency of the diesel. Both are connected to a smooth 8-speed transmission. All Discovery models feature full-time 4-wheel drive. A single-speed transfer case is standard. Those who wish to off-road this off-roader should get the 2-speed transfer case, the air suspension and locking rear differential. Towing is impressive. Gasoline models are rated at 8,201 pounds, while the heavier diesel models are rated at 7,716 pounds. Both engines use an idle start/stop system, which can be abrupt at start-up. Thankfully it can be switched off.<br>

[<p>A stylish, comfortable and off-road-capable compact SUV, the popular <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/land%20rover/discovery%20sport/2018/">2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport</a> is also the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand’s most affordable model. Prices start well below $40,000 for a Discovery Sport SE with a 237-horsepower turbocharged engine and Land Rover’s advanced all-wheel-drive Terrain Response system. A small kid-friendly third row is also offered, which is unusual for the class. Competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/glc/">Mercedes-Benz GLC</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a>. But, unlike these worthy rivals, the Discovery Sport SUV isn’t just about an opulent interior and advanced safety and entertainment options. Land Rover’s Discovery Sport can actually conquer some serious off-road obstacles. Buyers can also step up to a 286-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, which is available on the HSE and top Luxury HSE trim levels. Both engines work with a smooth 9-speed automatic transmission.</p>, <p>Land Rover’s 2018 Discovery Sport uniquely blends a handsome design, an opulent interior and luxurious appointments with the authentic rugged off-road capability the British brand is known for. It also offers one of the only 3rd-row seats in the segment, and its low starting price undercuts many of its competitors.<b></b></p>, <p>Unlike some other <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/land%20rover/">Land Rover</a> <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, the new 2018 Discovery Sport is not available with a diesel engine. There’s no <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model either. Also, some buyers may be disappointed in the firm ride provided by the Discovery Sport’s off-road-capable suspension.</p>, <p>For 2018, the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery%20sport/">Land Rover Discovery Sport</a> gets two new turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engines with as much as 286 horsepower, which is a significant increase over last year’s model. For the first time Land Rover has made a 12-way-power driver’s seat available, and Adaptive Cruise Control and Blind Spot Monitor are now stand-alone options. Onboard Wi-Fi has also been upgraded to 4G.</p>, <p>The 2018 Land Rover Discovery Sport possesses all the luxury credentials expected of a $40,000 SUV. The cabin isolates wind and road noise efficiently enough to allow for normal conversation at highway speeds, and the ride is rather firm, although not jarringly so. For the driver, there is good visibility in all areas save for the rear quarters, which have small side glass and big blind spots. The Discovery Sport’s new 237-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine is smooth and powerful. Acceleration is brisk enough for most buyers and the 9-speed automatic is a good match for the 4-cylinder engine. The more powerful 286-horsepower engine adds serious muscle. With that engine 0-60 mph takes just 6.3 seconds. Most of the Discovery Sport’s competition can’t come close to its capability off-road, thanks to its ground clearance, suspension travel and Land Rover’s all-wheel drive and Terrain Response system with various settings for Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud and Ruts and Sand.</p>, <p>SURROUND CAMERA SYSTEM<br>
Optional on the HSE model, but standard on the top HSE Luxury trim level, the Surround Camera System is like a rearview camera on steroids. Four cameras mounted around the SUV provide an overhead 360-degree bird’s-eye view of the Discovery Sport and its surroundings. It makes parking and maneuvering the SUV in tight spaces much easier.<br>
<br>
EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
This optional system is part of the Driver Assist Plus Package. It provides autonomous emergency braking when necessary if the system detects a forward collision is about to take place. First it will warn the driver of the danger, but if action is not taken the Land Rover will apply the brakes for the driver.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Discovery Sport's interior offers the same blend of off-road utility and luxury-brand plushness the rest of the SUV delivers. The efficient, blocky theme feels right in line with off-road adventuring, but the deep-dish seating, 8-way-power front seats, and leather upholstery (leather and cloth on SE versions) remind you this is a luxury SUV. We’re also fans of its unique rotary shifter and the SUV’s 8-inch touch screen and intuitive infotainment system. The raised 2nd-row seats slide and recline, and will easily accommodate 6-foot-4 occupants, and the smart interior packaging gives it more usable cargo space than its larger BMW X3 and Audi Q5 rivals. The optional third row is small but useful for small children.</p>, <p>The new Land Rover Discovery Sport is not the luxury brand’s smallest SUV. The Discovery Sport is about 10 inches longer than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover%20evoque/">Land Rover Range Rover Evoque</a>. It is shorter than competitors, however, but it's also wider, giving it an edge when it comes to stability. It shares much of its attractive shape with the larger and more expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery/">Land Rover Discovery</a>, including its steeply sloped windshield and body-color C-pillar, which looks like a bladed weapon. The Discovery Sport’s short overhangs front and rear give it generous approach and departure angles -- that means it can tackle steep slopes without scraping -- and it can even <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">ford</a> streams up to 23.6 inches deep.</p>, <p>For a luxury SUV starting under $40,000, the 2018 Discovery Sport SE comes nicely equipped. All-wheel drive is standard, as is the Terrain Response System which has settings for different conditions like snow and sand, Hill Descent Control, push-button start, partial leather seating, power-adjustable front seats, USB media and charging ports in the first row, plus two 2nd-row USB charging ports. A 10-speaker audio/infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen and Bluetooth connectivity is also standard. If you want full leather seating and the panoramic sunroof, you'll have to move up one trim level to the Discovery Sport HSE.</p>, <p>Stand-alone options and packages are available for the Discovery Sport SE, HSE and HSE Luxury and include keyless entry and heated front and rear seats on the SE model, plus smart safety features like automatic traffic detection, high-beam assist, surround-camera system, adaptive headlights and emergency braking on the HSE and HSE Luxury versions. The HSE and Luxury trims can come with a heated steering wheel and windshield, head-up display, upgraded audio and adaptive suspension. A 12-way-power driver’s seat is now available, and Adaptive Cruise Control and Blind Spot Monitor are stand-alone options. A Meridian audio upgrade and Touch Pro navigation system are also offered.</p>, <p>For 2018, the new Land Rover Discovery Sport gets a pair of new engines and they’re both a big improvement over engines in last year’s model. All three trim levels are offered with a 237-horsepower version of the new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, which is smoother and more responsive than last year’s engine. Buyers wanting more power can upgrade to a 286-horsepower version in the top trim levels for about $7,000. Interestingly, both engines get essentially the same fuel mileage but the more powerful engine shaves nearly a full second off the SUV’s 0-60-mph acceleration time. All Discovery Sports get a smooth-shifting 9-speed automatic transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system, which seamlessly varies the power between the front and rear tires that have the most grip.</p>, <p>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>

We suggest the more lavishly equipped Discovery Sport HSE, which starts at a still reasonable $43,900. If you want all the bells and whistles, head for the $47,790 Discovery Sport HSE Luxury. Once you've added in all the various options, including the more powerful engine, you're looking at a price tag well north of $60,000. We still recommend the HSE first for the longest-lasting satisfaction, though the SE model will also earn your pride. And the standard 237-horsepower engine is enough for most buyers.

At resale time, the Audi Q5 is a little better, while the BMW X3 slots well below.</p>]

[<p>Opulent, extravagant and refined, with the power of a supercar, the off-road capability of a monster truck and the comfort of a Montauk mansion, the full-size <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/land%20rover/range%20rover/2018/">2018 Land Rover Range Rover</a> is the ultimate large <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>. It’s also Land Rover’s largest and most expensive model. It’s available in two wheelbases and five trim levels with a fuel-efficient diesel, a supercharged V6 or a burly supercharged V8 packing as much as 557 horsepower. Prices start around $88,500 for a short-wheelbase Range Rover powered by the 340-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6. The 254-horsepower diesel costs an additional $2,000. Prices top out over $209,000 for a long-wheelbase Range Rover SVAutobiography, powered by the supercharged 5.0-liter V8, an engine also used in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-type/">Jaguar F-Type</a> sports car. Competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a> and G-Class and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bentley/bentayga/">Bentley Bentayga</a>.</p>, <p>If you like power, panache and prestige, if you enjoy being pampered and appreciate a vehicle that can coddle and indulge you in an epicurean cocoon of lavish materials, hedonic pleasures and unmitigated silence regardless of road conditions and Mother Nature’s whim, you’ll like the new 2018 Land Rover Range Rover.</p>, <p>If your ultimate luxury SUV has three rows of seating you’ll have to look elsewhere, as the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover only seats five. Three-row competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLS, the Bentley Bentayga and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover%20sport/">Land Rover Range Rover Sport</a>, which is similar but less expensive than its sibling.</p>, <p>For 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/land%20rover/">Land Rover</a> has improved the new Range Rover with new elaborate LED headlights, wider and softer front seats with more adjustment, Hot Stone massage and heated armrests and an updated infotainment system. There’s also a new 557-horsepower SVAutobiography Dynamic model that can thrust from 0-60 mph in just 5.1 seconds.</p>, <p>Perched up in its driver’s seat, you feel like there’s nothing the 2018 Range Rover can’t handle, nothing it can’t get you through, from a zombie apocalypse to preschoolers, blizzards and that holiday trip to grandma’s. Oh, grandma lives in the jungles of Borneo? No problem. The Range Rover feels solid, like a tank, and it weighs two and half tons, but our Supercharged model was refined, light on its feet, easy to maneuver and fun to hustle through traffic. It’s agile, and its light steering and tight turning circle make it easy to park. Power is never a problem and there’s always more in reserve. The big burly V8 sounds like it was plucked from a muscle car, the automatic transmission is smooth and responsive, and the standard all-wheel-drive system provides incredible grip on all surfaces. The Range Rover’s long-travel air suspension is softly sprung and compliant, and it’s extremely quiet and comfortable out on the highway.</p>, <p>ACTIVITY KEY<br>
 A new standard feature on the 2018 Range Rover is called Activity Key. It’s a wearable waterproof and robust device worn on the wrist, much like a Fitbit, and it can lock and unlock the SUV. This allows you to leave the keys behind when surfing, mountain biking or hiking. Clever.<br>
<br>
 EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
 Standard on all Range Rovers, this important safety system provides autonomous emergency braking when necessary if the system detects a forward collision is about to take place. First it will warn the driver of the danger, but if action is not taken the Land Rover will apply the brakes for the driver. Also standard are Lane Departure Warning and front and rear parking sensors.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Comfortable, opulent and artistically crafted, the interior of the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover is one of the finest you’ll find at any price point. Detailed to perfection it marvelously blends old-world British charm and the build quality of fine custom furniture with modern technology, including two large touch screens and well-thought-out ergonomics. Every surface is covered in the finest leather, stitched to perfection, and surrounded by finely crafted wood and aluminum. The new wider and soft front seats are decadent, providing intense heat and 25 different massage programs. Even the armrests are heated. Rear-seat space is abundant, especially in the long-wheelbase models, which have enough rear legroom for a couple of Shaquille O’Neals.</p>, <p>It isn’t easy designing an SUV that looks both rugged and elegant, one that is understated but sexy and imposing, one that looks rich and expensive but falls short of ostentation and pretension. It isn’t easy but somehow the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover pulls it off. It’s a fantastic-looking thing, with slab sides, large glass and short overhangs. It's also surprisingly compact, with even the long-wheelbase model being only as long as a Chevy Traverse. Our favorite detail? The crease linking the headlights and taillights, which slices through the door handles, and ultimately underlines “Range Rover” on the SUV’s unique clamshell tailgate.</p>, <p>Land Rover’s 2018 base-model Range Rover comes with the 3.0-liter supercharged V6 good for 340 horsepower, 4-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case and Land Rover's Terrain Response system, which has settings for different terrain including Sand and Snow, and roll-stability control. Inside you'll find leather seating, a 10.2-inch InControl touch-screen infotainment system, a rearview camera, and a 380-watt Meridian audio system. There are also 3-zone automatic climate control, reclining rear seats, and 10-way-power-adjustable front seats. Out back is a hands-free gesture-controlled power hatch that flips the glass half up first, then lowers the tailgate, which makes for a comfortable place to sit and watch the sunset.</p>, <p>Step up to the HSE model (our choice) and you get the Panoramic Roof, Oxford perforated leather, 14-way-power-adjustable front seats, heated rear seats, 20-inch wheels, a more powerful supercharged V6, and other features. If you want V8 power, the supercharged level adds the 5.0-liter V8, plus Dynamic Response, Terrain Response 2, All-Terrain Progress Control, fog lights, 21-inch wheels and trim items. The new SVAutobiography Dynamic and LWB add a 557-horsepower version of the V8, plus a specially tuned suspension and a Meridian sound system with 1,700 watts (!), 29 speakers and 3D Surround Sound. And that doesn't even count stand-alone options.</p>, <p>The standard 2018 Range Rover engine is a 3.0-liter supercharged V6 with 340 horsepower; the HSE model gets the same engine with 380 horsepower, and both are available with a 3.0-liter diesel V6 with 443 lb-ft of torque. The supercharged 5.0-liter V8 is available in 518- and 557-horsepower versions if you need your massive luxury SUV to get moving in a hurry. Every engine comes with an 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. Note that the diesel however is an excellent choice, offering gobs of low-end torque, but while still getting 22-mpg city and 28-mpg highway. And, with any engine, the towing capacity is an impressive 7,716 pounds, the English equivalent of 3,500 kg.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/land-rover/range-rover-evoque/2018
[<p>Land Rover offers the 2018 Range Rover Evoque as a unique 2-door convertible with a power-folding soft top or a traditional 5-door SUV. Although the compact-luxury SUV is off-road ready, the Evoque isn’t as rugged as the larger Land Rover models. It’s more Rodeo Drive than Rubicon Trail. However, all-wheel drive with a switchable Terrain Response System is standard, and Land Rover says the Evoque has over eight inches of ground clearance and can wade through 19 inches of standing water. All new Evoques are powered by new turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, including a 286-horsepower mill that powers the new HSE Dynamic and Autobiography trim levels. Evoque SE, SE Premium, HSE, Landmark Edition and all convertibles pack 237 horsepower, and all models get a smooth-shifting 9-speed automatic. Rivals include the BMW X3 and Audi Q5.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an SUV convertible, the 2018 Range Rover Evoque is the only one in the world. Try it, you’ll like it. The more conventional 5-door Range Rover Evoque also pegs the cool meter with an unmistakable Land Rover design. It’s perfect for those who desire the products of the world's premier-luxury-SUV maker but are still on a budget.</p>, <p>The 2018 Range Rover Evoque is small, which translates to a tight interior and limited cargo space. In fact, it’s probably too small for most families. And Land Rover does not offer a third row in the Evoque. Other models in this class that are more family-friendly include the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Mercedes GLC.</p>, <p>For 2018 Land Rover has improved the Range Rover Evoque with two new turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, one with 237 horsepower and a high-output 286-horsepower version. Models with the more powerful engine also get a more aggressive-looking front bumper. Onboard 4G Wi-Fi is also a new option.</p>, <p>The 2018 Range Rover Evoque is in fact an actual Land Rover, with unexpectedly good capability when the tires leave paved roads. An adjustable drive mode allows the driver to choose among Mud, Sand, Snow and other terrains with the flick of a switch. While it lacks the low-range gearing of its bigger brothers, which keeps it from serious off-road duty, it's definitely more capable than you might expect for something as stylish as this. Around town the Evoque's firm suspension and sharp steering make it feel like a sports sedan, but it also means the ride's on the stiff side. There's good power from the new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, but the 9-speed automatic sometimes hesitates when downshifting, and feels particularly rough as you slow to a stop. The convertible drives similarly, but with a top that goes down quickly while keeping your hair mostly in place, plus it looks like nothing else on the road.</p>, <p>ACTIVE DRIVELINE 4WD &amp; TERRAIN RESPONSE SYSTEM<br>
 The Evoque is all-wheel drive (AWD) up to 22 mph. Then it switches to front-wheel-drive (FWD) mode to save fuel. If the system detects low traction, it immediately redirects torque to the rear wheels. The Evoque's Terrain Response system lets you choose among different modes including Snow, Sand and Trail. Throttle input, suspension settings and other systems alter to best enhance traction.<br>
<br>
 SURROUND CAMERA SYSTEM<br>
 The Range Rover Evoque’s Surround Camera System is like the ultimate rearview camera. Four cameras mounted around the SUV provide an overhead 360-degree bird’s-eye view of the Evoque and its surroundings on the Range Rover’s 10.2-inch touch screen. It makes parking and maneuvering the SUV in tight spaces much easier and it helps when off-roading.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Although the 2018 Range Rover Evoque is one of Land Rover’s most affordable models, it features a cabin packed with all the elegant aesthetics, upscale materials and fine detailing you expect in the brand’s luxury SUVs. The front seats are comfortable and heated, although the back seats are on the snug side. The Evoque’s 20.3 cubic feet of cargo space is somewhat limited, but not out of line for a small vehicle like the Evoque. The InControl Touch Pro touch-screen infotainment system has its lovers and haters, while the Meridian sound system is universally loved. We also like its dial shifter, which rises dramatically from the console when you start the engine. The convertible seats only four, and cargo space is particularly diminutive.</p>, <p>With its tall, blunt nose and short overhangs, the 2018 Range Rover Evoque looks a lot like a full-size Range Rover or Range Rover Sport, only smaller. It’s striking and aggressively proportioned, with a sloping roof, which seems to float over the SUV’s black pillars, flared flanks and oversized wheels and tires. The front end features a racy-looking bumper and there are supercar-style vents in its hood. The convertible’s top-up profile mimics the coupe's roofline, and it hides completely from view when folded. At the same time, the folded top emphasizes the Evoque's high sills, blunt nose and tall tail.</p>, <p>All 2018 Range Rover Evoque models come standard with Active Driveline all-wheel drive, a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and a 9-speed automatic transmission. Also standard is Land Rover’s Terrain Response system, with its modes for General, Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud and Ruts, and Sand. Evoque drivers also get standard Hill Start Assist, and the All-Terrain Progress Control system maintains a preset speed between 1.1 mph and 19 mph to assist in negotiating difficult terrain. The InControl Touch infotainment system is also standard, as are numerous comfort and convenience features and driving aids. The base Evoque SE gets power leather seats, an 8-inch touch screen, 18-inch wheels and front and rear parking sensors.</p>, <p>2018 Evoque models above the SE and SE Premium trim levels get standard navigation and InControl Pro services, with other available upgrades including heated front seats and 19-inch wheels. Step up to the Range Rover Evoque HSE Dynamic and you'll get the more powerful 286-horsepower engine, Adaptive Dynamics and Oxford leather steering wheel along with 14-way Oxford leather seats and InControl Touch Plus. Also available: a Blind Spot Monitor system with Reverse Traffic Detection and configurable interior mood lighting. The top-line Autobiography comes with adaptive headlights with the Land Rover LED signature, satin-brushed aluminum trim, and an 825-watt, 17-speaker Meridian surround-sound system.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Range Rover Evoque Convertible is powered by a 2.0-liter direct-injection turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with 237 horsepower. This same engine is used in the 5-door SE, SE Premium, HSE and Landmark Edition. The Evoque HSE Dynamic and Autobiography get a stronger 286-horsepower version of the 2.0-liter, which drops the SUV’s 0-60-mph acceleration time from 6.7 seconds to six seconds flat. Both engines are smooth, with some turbo lag that's perfectly acceptable, and plenty of kick when you step on the gas. Note that the engines also achieve the same fuel-economy ratings and they have been engineered for operation at the kinds of extreme angles encountered while off-roading. Connected to both engines is a 9-speed automatic with paddle shifters for manual control. Full-time AWD is standard on all 2018 Evoques.<br>

The base Convertible SE Dynamic model will set you back about $53,000. The new Evoque Landmark Edition, which gets interior and exterior upgrades but retains the base model’s 237-horsepower engine, starts around $49,500. And the top-of-the-range Evoque 5-door Autobiography starts around $66,500, and that's before options. Whatever model you get, be sure to get the Driver Assistance Packages, ranging from $1,000 to $2,700, for their additional safety and convenience attributes. The Evoque's rivals like the BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC and Audi Q5 tend to start in the mid- to high-$30,000 range, and offer more interior space without the Evoque's style.

[<p>In sharp contrast to the market’s many curvaceous luxury SUVs, the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport’s square-edge styling conveys a message of solidity, ruggedness and pedigree fit for Royals and Rap stars alike. Unlike its more sleekly styled competitors, the Range Rover Sport can actually venture over some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet, all while surrounding its occupants in the finest leathers, woods and touchably-soft cloth and suede materials one can imagine. And while we know most Range Rover Sports will never leave the paved road, one can take comfort in knowing the premium paid over a comparably equipped Audi Q7 or BMW X5 does permit one to roam, if you want to.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a luxury SUV that’s as versatile as it is exclusive, look no further than the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport. Equipped with a diesel engine, the Sport is both functional and frugal. Opt for the supercharged V8, and you’ve got an SUV as exciting on-road as off.</p>, <p>You can find plenty of luxury SUVs with a more reliable track record for less money and with more interior room. The Acura MDX, Audi Q7, Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator all come to mind, while the Lexus LX 570 is equally capable off-road.</p>, <p>The Range Rover Sport gets a refreshed exterior and remade interior featuring Land Rover’s newest InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system. The power sunshade can now be opened via gesture control, and the SVR trim sees horsepower bumped to a healthy 575.</p>, <p>We've had the rare opportunity to test both elements of the Land Rover Range Rover Sport in none other than England itself. An off-road trail let us push the Sport’s 4-wheel-drive setup to the limit as we ventured over rutted English back roads, through deep bogs and into water deep enough to make us wonder if we'd be using the sunroof as an escape hatch; ultimately it was drama-free, with the Range Rover Sport pulling through with flying colors. With its off-road chops verified, we were turned loose on an airport runway, taking the Range Rover Sport to an impressive 145-mph straight-line speed, which it handled with all the stability and calm as if it were loafing down the Interstate. Around town, the 2018 Range Rover Sport impresses with its sophistication, responsive drivetrains and comfortable interior.</p>, <p>TORQUE VECTORING<br>
 When equipped with a V8 engine, the Range Rover Sport includes a unique torque-vectoring system that, during turning maneuvers, shuttles power to the outside rear wheel. This action permits better control in tight turns both on- and off-road.<br>
<br>
 3.0-LITER TURBODIESEL ENGINE<br>
 Where Audi and Mercedes-Benz have dropped their diesel engines, the Range Rover Sport still offers the option. With 440 lb-ft of torque, the diesel provides nearly as much thrust as the V8 models, yet attains nearly 28 mpg on the highway.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The beauty in the Range Rover Sport’s interior isn’t just what the design says, it’s in the way the designers allow the customer to arrange colors, materials and trim. Hard plastics and cheap vinyl are nowhere to be found, replaced by the highest-quality leather with wood, metal or carbon fiber serving as accents. Intricate stitch patterns on the seats and door panels are simple yet elegant. Indeed, the entire Range Rover Sport’s interior is devoid of the hectic and often overwrought theme that makes sitting in some luxury SUVs feel more like manning the controls of an advanced fighter jet.</p>, <p>There’s no mistaking the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport for anything but a Land Rover vehicle. Its electric-razor style grille, slab sides and signature narrow headlights are both defining and yet modern, creating a mystique that exudes the British idea of luxury and good taste. Variations on the exterior depend on the trim. The Autobiography model, for example, has lots of shiny bits, whereas its 575-horsepower SVR counterpart tones it down a bit. While some paint color options can cost thousands of dollars, for us it’s the little things, such as the Range Rover Sport-shaped approach lighting beam, that make this SUV so special.</p>, <p>The base-model Range Rover Sport SE comes standard with a leather interior and 14-way-power front seats, air suspension, multi-mode selectable Terrain Response, 60/40-split rear seat, front/rear parking sensors, and new this year, the InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system with twin 10-inch touch screens. Also included is Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, remote-sensing unlocking and push-button start, and an Automatic Access Height lowers the vehicle’s air suspension when placed in Park. All that, along with dual USB ports, 14 total power points and a hard-disk navigation system, makes one wonder what else there is to add. Well...</p>, <p>There are multiple engine options from supercharged V6 and V8 engines to a turbocharged V6 diesel, as you work your way from SE, through HSE, to Supercharged and ultimately Autobiography and SVR models. The top-line 2018 Range Rover Sport SVR comes with a 575-horsepower supercharged V8 engine, plus adaptive cruise-control, "automatic" parallel parking, advanced blind-spot monitoring, traffic-sign recognition, a surround-view camera system and a full LCD instrument panel. For off-road capability, there are a 2-speed transfer case, All-Terrain Progress Control, torque vectoring and Terrain Response 2 Auto. For luxury, consider a panoramic moonroof, 3rd-row seat and 1,700-watt, 23-speaker Meridian audio system.</p>, <p>The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport offers a choice of three engines, all of them either supercharged or turbocharged. Toward the bottom end is a 340-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6, which is also available in a more powerful 380-horsepower version. The 254-horsepower 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 makes a whopping 440 lb-ft of torque, nearly as much as the V8 engines. About those, there's a 518-horsepower 5.0-liter V8, or a high-performance version that puts out 575 horsepower in the Range Rover Sport SVR. All of the engines come with an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission, and all Range Rover Sport models come standard with 4-wheel drive. While the V8 engines obviously win on power, the V6 versions actually offer plenty of power.<br>
<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/19 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base-model 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Sport SE is right at the $67,745 mark; add about $2,000 if you want a diesel with that. On the other end of the spectrum is the Range Rover Sport SVR, which starts at more than $114,000, and with options the price can climb to more than $130,000. While that's more expensive than competition like the BMW X5, Acura MDX and Audi Q7, it is in line with vehicles like the Porsche Cayenne and BMW X6, although neither of those offers a third row. Before you set out to purchase your Range Rover Sport, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. Note that resale value for the Range Rover Sport isn't expected to reach the long-term standards set by Audi, Lexus, and BMW.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/land-rover/range-rover-velar/2018
[<p>Sandwiched between the Evoque and the Sport, Land Rover’s all-new Range Rover Velar is sportier and more modern than both. Its beautiful exterior is bolstered by the elegant, tech-friendly interior, with the same level of quality materials Range Rover owners have come to expect. The Velar has its quirks, but is sporty on-road without losing the trademark Range Rover off-road capability. It’s also one of the few <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> sold in America that’s available with a diesel engine. Few <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUVs offer the combination of features and capabilities of the Velar, and this Range Rover’s size falls somewhere between small- and midsize-luxury SUVs, so buyers may want to look at vehicles in both categories, such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/macan/">Porsche Macan</a> or Cayenne, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-pace/">Jaguar F-Pace</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/glc/">Mercedes-Benz GLC</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re bowled over by the styling, have a soft spot for Rangies and off-road capability, and want a luxury 2-row SUV with some sporty tendencies, the all-new Velar is tempting.</p>, <p>There’s no denying the Velar is pricey. There are other luxury SUVs that can offer a similar mix of amenities, and may offer more value for the money. Plus, the jury is still out on reliability.</p>, <p>The Velar is an all-new model for 2018. With a choice of three compelling engines, gorgeous styling, and the most modern Range Rover interior to date, the Velar may reflect the direction in which Range Rover is heading.</p>, <p>The base Velar’s 2.0-liter turbo gas engine isn’t a rocket, but it feels spry and quick off the line and has almost as much torque as the available supercharged V6. That V6 offers a good amount of power, but it comes standard with electronic air suspension, a feature that adds noticeable weight to the vehicle while not providing as intuitive a feel of the road, especially when cornering. If you want to tow or go off-road, the air suspension is worthwhile -- the Velar is more capable off-road than you might think. Otherwise, the standard suspension offers a much more engaging drive and a suppler ride. The sweetest spot in the lineup is with the 2.0-liter turbodiesel. It’s the ideal mix of effortless power and impressive fuel economy. If you don’t like diesel, you can select the gas 4-cylinder and be perfectly happy.</p>, <p>TOUCH-SCREEN CONTROLS<br>
 The InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system allows you to tap and swipe on the top high-resolution 10-inch center screen, as if you were using a tablet or smartphone. It also lets you organize the digital gauge cluster. Climate control is easy to control through a second 10-inch screen and dials.<br>
<br>
 TRACTION TECH<br>
 Features like Terrain Response 2, hill-descent control, an active locking rear differential, and the optional air suspension make exploring the backcountry a low-stress adventure. It also gives the Velar more off-road prowess than its styling would suggest.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Velar’s cabin brings together an elegant, simple layout, high-quality materials, and the most modern amenities available in a Range Rover to date. With the ignition off, you see a clean, tasteful layout with contrasting dark and light hues plus brushed-aluminum accents. Leather is standard, but if you prefer an alternative material, there’s a Kvadrat interior, a mix of textile and Suedecloth inserts. Push the start button, and what seemed like blank spaces illuminate for the digital gauge cluster in front of the driver, and the InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment and climate control in the center stack.</p>, <p>Lower and more swept back than the Range Rover and more streamlined than the Sport, the Velar has fewer body lines and is the sleekest vehicle in the Range Rover line. In fact, the new Velar was awarded 2018 World Car Design of the Year honors. Making the side profile even cleaner are the flush door handles, which come out when you unlock the vehicle. (They have been tested to ensure that they can open even when caked in 0.15 inch of ice.) Narrow LED headlights define the front end, and you can get wheels up to 22 inches in diameter.</p>, <p>All Velars come standard with all-wheel drive, 5-passenger layout and an 8-speed automatic transmission. The base Velar comes with the 2.0-liter turbocharged gas engine. It has heated power-folding side mirrors, a tailgate that can open with a gesture, Terrain Response, trailer-stability assist, torque vectoring, hill-launch assist and hill-descent control, autonomous emergency braking, rear parking aid, and lane-departure warning. Inside, there are 10-way-power seats and an 8-speaker sound system. The Velar rides on 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>Move all the way up the ladder to the First Edition, and you get the supercharged V6 and air suspension, an on/off-road package that includes Terrain Response 2, a configurable dynamic mode, and more; adaptive cruise control with intelligent emergency braking, park assist that takes care of parallel and perpendicular parking, 360-degree parking assist, a 1,600-watt Meridian surround-sound audio system, and 20-way-power front seats, with all five spots covered in perforated Windsor leather. The windshield is heated and 22-inch wheels are available.</p>, <p>The Range Rover Velar is one of the few SUVs that’s available with a turbodiesel engine. There are three engines you can choose from. In addition to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel, considered the midrange engine in terms of price and power, there are also a 2.0-liter gas-powered turbocharged 4-cylinder and a 3.0-liter supercharged gas V6. All three are backed by an 8-speed automatic. The turbodiesel offers the best fuel economy, followed by the gas four and then the V6. All-wheel drive is standard.<br>

S, R-Dynamic SE and R-Dynamic HSE trims are also available. The vehicle is very new to market, so Fair Purchase Prices are only slightly below the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). In the Velar’s competitive set, the Porsche Macan starts at just below $49,000 and ramps up to well over six figures, and the Cayenne starts at about $60,000 and can get as pricey as above $200,000 if you so desire. The all-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz GLC 300 4Matic comes in at just over $43,000, and the Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 4Matic can cost upwards of $83,000. The Jaguar F-Pace starts at $43,000 and tops out at over $70,000.</p>]

[<p>Among midsize-luxury sedans, the 2018 Lexus ES 350 is about the closest thing to a sure bet. With its outstanding reliability and resale record, long list of luxury features and sophisticated styling, the 2018 ES is hard to fault. In hybrid form, the 2018 ES 300h delivers up to 40 mpg without any measurable loss in performance. Of course, most ES buyers flock to this sedan not for its world-class handling or sizzling off-the-line acceleration, but for its allegiance to the idea a luxury car should be as quiet and comfortable as it is responsive. Sure, you can get better performance from a BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS, but you won’t find the same sense of serenity on the open road.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus ES 350 luxury sedan and ES 300h hybrid-luxury sedan appeal to buyers looking for a premium sedan with a heavy emphasis on reliability, safety and passenger pampering, although hybrid buyers will sacrifice some trunk space to the system’s battery pack.</p>, <p>The front-drive Lexus ES 350 for 2018 can’t hold a candle to the performance credentials of rear-drive sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Infiniti Q50 or Cadillac CTS, and Lexus doesn’t offer an all-wheel-drive or a diesel-engine option.</p>, <p>Lexus’ ES 350 and ES 300h hybrid for 2018 see only minor changes. The Premier package replaces last year’s Premium package, while the Enform Safety and Service Connect free trial period is extended to the first 10 years of ownership.</p>, <p>If a smooth ride and a hushed cabin are your idea of luxury, you’ll find much to like in the 2018 Lexus ES 350 and ES 300h hybrid-luxury sedans. The ES soaks up road imperfections like a sponge in water, yet its driving dynamics are far from soft or disconnected. Acceleration from the 3.5-liter V6 is robust, attaining 60 mph in just over seven seconds. A more aggressive driving style can be dialed in, thanks to the ES 350’s Sport mode that delivers more aggressive shift points for quicker passing and merging. This same feature on the hybrid offers even more thrills, thanks in part to the added torque from the hybrid electric-motor setup. The ES 300h hybrid is actually a more aggressive driver than the gasoline-powered ES 350, although when placed in Eco mode, both throttle response and powertrain reaction feel a bit dull.</p>, <p>HYBRID POWERTRAIN<br>
 While some companies have been forced to roll back their rosy hybrid EPA fuel estimates, the 2018 Lexus ES 300h easily lives up to the impressive figures posted on its window sticker. Our test regularly saw a combined 40-mpg figure, even when pushing the 200-horsepower hybrid powertrain to its limits.<br>
<br>
 CREATURE COMFORTS<br>
 From its 835-watt, 15-speaker Mark Levinson audio to its heated steering wheel and panoramic sunroof, the Lexus ES luxury sedans for 2018 never fail to impress. Additional options include heated and ventilated front seats, intuitive park assist and a host of driver-assist safety features.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus ES 350 luxury sedan boasts upscale interior materials and the exacting fit and finish we’ve come to expect in Lexus vehicles. All models offer a centrally mounted multimedia screen above the center air vents, operated by a console-mounted mouse-like Remote Touch system, which some find overly sensitive and frustrating to use. The drive-mode selector in front of the shift handle allows drivers to switch among Normal, Sport or Eco modes with the push of a button. The seats are comfortable and the interior is roomy enough for four adults. Rear-seat legroom is ample.</p>, <p>Once the very definition of a conservative sedan, the current-generation Lexus ES has taken on a bold new look with sleek lines and the aggressive Lexus "spindle" grille. Yet it retains an elegant look that has the 2018 ES and ES hybrid falling right in line with the sporty Lexus IS sedan and RC coupe. Flared fenders and narrow windows give this Lexus a tough masculine look, and the lines flow smoothly from nose to tail. We like the sporty twin tailpipes on the ES 350, and that you can upgrade from the standard 17-inch wheels to a cool set of 18s.</p>, <p>Every new ES comes with push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror and a HomeLink garage-door opener. Also standard is the Lexus Safety System+ package that includes Pre-Collision System (PCS), Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam (IHB) and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. Bluetooth, heated outside mirrors, 10-way power-adjustable front seats and a rearview camera are also standard as are the sedan’s 10 airbags, and Lexus' Automatic Collision Notification, which notifies emergency assistance in the event of an accident.</p>, <p>Among features available on the lengthy options list for the 2018 ES 350 and hybrid ES 300h are a navigation system, leather and aniline-leather seats that can be heated and ventilated, a panorama glass roof, power rear sunshade, and an awesome Mark Levinson premium sound system. It also offers radar cruise control, a lane-departure warning system, parking assist and blind-spot monitoring. Fully loaded examples will also feature a heated wood-and-leather steering wheel, a one-touch power trunklid, a power tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, memory seats, door sunshades and perhaps the ultimate luxury, a genuine wood-trimmed cup holder.</p>, <p>With 268 horsepower, the 3.5-liter V6 engine that's standard in the 2018 Lexus ES 350 has plenty of grunt to get this sedan moving quickly. It's connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission that's a model of smooth operation. Fuel economy is good for the class, but if saving fuel is part of your luxury experience, then the hybrid powertrain in the Lexus ES 300h is what you need. The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine combines with an electric motor to develop a total of 200 horsepower, routing it through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). That's enough power for day-to-day driving, while also offering fantastic fuel economy. Both Lexus ES models are available only in front-wheel drive, and both run on regular 87-octane gasoline.<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.5-liter V6 (ES 350)<br/> 268 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br/> 248 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/30 mpg<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.5-liter inline-4 + hybrid electric motor and nickel-metal hydride battery module (ES 300h)<br/> 156 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm (gasoline engine alone)<br/> Total system horsepower: 200<br/> 156 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm (gasoline engine)<br/> EPA fuel city/highway fuel economy: 40/39 mpg</p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Lexus ES 350 is right around $40,000, including the $995 destination charge. If you want hybrid power, the ES 300h starts just under $43,000. Add options, and you can inflate the price of either car to just over the $50,000 mark, a relative bargain for a luxury brand. That's higher than cars like the Genesis G80 and the surprisingly good Buick LaCrosse, but notably less than cars like the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Cadillac CTS. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what buyers are actually paying for the 2018 Lexus ES in your area. Down the road, sleep well knowing that a strong resale value is one of the strongest selling points for the Lexus ES.</p>]

[<p>If you were building the perfect premium-performance sedan, you’d likely want it loaded with abundant luxury and technology, stellar performance credentials and impeccable reliability and resale stats. Luckily, someone has already built such a car, and it’s called the 2018 Lexus GS. As a direct competitor to the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Audi A6, Lexus stocks the GS lineup with a wide variety of trims ranging from the quick and efficient 4-cylinder turbocharged GS 300 to the fire-breathing GS F with its 467-horsepower V8. Looking for power and efficiency? Lexus offers a hybrid model in the GS 450h. Those seeking performance on a budget can opt for the F-Sport upgrade offered on three of the GS’ four trim levels.</p>, <p>Larger than the IS but lacking the bulk and hefty price tag of the LS, the 2018 Lexus GS sedan is the perfect middle child. Powerful, roomy and stylish, the GS also comes with the peace of mind only a Lexus can offer.</p>, <p>With the exception of the GS F, the rest of the GS line isn’t as driver-oriented as a BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS. In a segment known for subtle and sophisticated design, the GS’ daring styling may be too aggressive for some.</p>, <p>For 2018, the GS 200t is renamed the GS 300, while the Enform Safety and Service Connect package is made complimentary for the first 10 years. GS F upgrades include All-Speed Cruise Control and Lane Keep Assist.</p>, <p>Our time in the V6-powered GS 350 left us with a positive impression of a smart midsize-luxury sedan delivering competent handling, impressive acceleration, a smooth ride and, when equipped with the F-Sport package, thrilling cornering abilities. The GS’ rigid architecture, lightweight aluminum suspension and wide track all aid in the car’s on-road performance, as does the 3-setting Drive Mode (Eco, Normal and Sport) that allows the driver to vary the degree of steering response and throttle input. The F-Sport package opens the door to even better options like Lexus’ Dynamic Handling system. If you’re comparing apples to apples, we’d place the GS slightly below the BMW 5 Series but on par with the ride and handling abilities of the Audi A6 and Jaguar XF.</p>, <p>LEXUS SAFETY SYSTEM+<br/> Inattentive driving has led to an upsurge in fender-benders, so it’s nice to know the 2018 GS includes a state-of-the-art driver-assist system featuring a Pre-Collision System, High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Intelligent High Beam and Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist.<br/> <br/> HYBRID POWERTRAIN<br/> The hybrid GS 450h combines the performance and acceleration of a small-block V8 with the fuel economy of a 4-cylinder turbo. The Atkinson-cycle 3.5-liter V6 and electric motor pump out a combined 338 horsepower resulting in faster acceleration times than the GS 350 with a combined city/highway rating of 31 mpg.<br/> </p>, <p>Although edgy on the outside, Lexus’ 2018 GS luxury sedan is all about comfort on the inside. Both front occupants enjoy 10-way-power seats, and LED ambient lighting is integrated into the door ornamentation and the console. Soft leather is everywhere and nice touches and details abound, from “Lexus”-stamped scuff plates on all doorsills to contrast stitching on the upper instrument panel, door panels and shift boot. The attractively shaped instrument panel includes analog Optitron gauges with a color Multi-Information Display and an 8- or 12.3-inch color high-resolution central-control screen that operates with the 2nd-generation Remote Touch Interface (RTI) control function.</p>, <p>Not for the shy, the Lexus GS luxury performance sedan is a boldly styled piece of road-going art. It leads with an aggressive front-end treatment with an oversized grille, deep chin spoiler and intense expression. Distinctive headlights and LED taillights fit its sporting image, as do its muscular lines, highly defined shapes and low stance. The GS 350 and 450h are fitted with 18-inch alloy wheels, while the F Sport Package and GS F add 19-inch wheels. Rich and varied paint options are a pleasant departure from the ubiquitous sea of silver, white and black.</p>, <p>The Lexus Safety System+ package comes standard on the GS 300, GS 350 and GS 450h. The state-of-the-art system includes Pre-Collision System Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. All 2018 Lexus GS models include leather upholstery (NuLuxe simulated leather on the GS 300), wood/metallic accent trim, power moonroof, multifunction steering wheel and energy-saving S-flow automatic climate control. The standard Lexus Premium Audio System has 12 speakers, AM/FM/DVD with HD Radio and WMA/MP3 capability, Bluetooth streaming, 5.1 Surround Sound and numerous other features.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus GS with a Premium Package includes heated and ventilated front seats; a Luxury Package with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), rear audio and climate controls and semi-aniline leather upholstery; a Cold Weather Package with heated steering wheel; and the F Sport Package, which makes any Lexus more fun to drive. It adds a 16-way driver’s sport seat, custom-tuned AVS, bigger wheels, tires and brakes along with Variable Gear Ratio Steering. Stand-alone options include an HDD 12.3-inch Navigation system, power trunk release, an 835-watt, 17-speaker Mark Levinson premium surround-sound audio system and a Head-Up Display.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus GS 300 sedan is powered by a twin-scroll 2.0-liter turbocharged engine sending power to the rear wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission. The GS 350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 with dual variable-valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) and direct fuel injection. In rear-wheel-drive (RWD) models it is matched with an 8-speed automatic transmission and with all-wheel drive (AWD) it has a 6-speed automatic. The hybrid GS 450h employs an Atkinson-cycle version of the 3.5-liter V6, with the Lexus Hybrid Synergy Drive that combines the gasoline engine and the electric motor for a total system output of 338 horsepower. The rear-drive high-performance GS F is equipped with a 5.0-liter V8 engine and an 8-speed automatic with manual shift control.<br>

The GS F starts just over $85,350. The GS 350’s likely European competitors, the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class, tend to have starting prices above that of the GS and are fairly close to each other in resale values, but the GS 350 is expected to maintain both 3-year and 5-year residuals that are higher, thus paying benefits in the long term.

[<p>In the 2018 Lexus GX 460, you’ll find a capable luxury SUV with a bit of dual personality. Derived from the Toyota 4Runner platform, the GX 460 utilizes an old body-on-frame design that has been abandoned by almost every competitor. Yet, despite its aging architecture, the 2018 Lexus GX 460 is loaded with the latest technology, luxury and safety features, making it a highly desirable 7-passenger vehicle. And while its ride and handling pale when compared to newer SUVs such as the Audi Q7 and Acura MDX, the GX 460’s off-road and towing capabilities exceed all but the Land Rover Discovery. Factor in Lexus’ reputation for quality and high resale, and the GX 460’s appeal becomes obvious.</p>, <p>If you need your luxury SUV to be as capable off-road as on, a 2018 Lexus GX 460 has the credentials you’ve been looking for. Loaded with Lexus’ best features, the GX knows how to pamper its passengers even when it’s getting down and dirty.</p>, <p>You can find roomier and more comfortable seating in an Audi Q7, Infiniti QX60 or Mercedes-Benz GLS. If you need off-road ability, the Land Rover Discovery is every bit the GX’s equal. Looking for a luxurious SUV without the exorbitant price tag? Check out the sleek Mazda CX-9.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus GX 460 SUV carries over with only minor changes. A Semi-Aniline bench seat is now standard on the Luxury grade, while heated and ventilated front seats are made available on the base GX. The Sport Design Package gains captain’s-chair 2nd-row seating.<b></b></p>, <p>Due to its rugged platform and tall ride height, the 2018 Lexus GX 460 can’t deliver the same sporty ride and confident cornering as a car-based crossover SUV, but the trade-off is a firm-riding SUV with impressive off-road abilities. With its fully boxed frame, tall tires and full-time 4-wheel drive, the GX 460 can feel a bit brutish on rough pavement, even with Lexus’ Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System helping to lessen body lean. The same system works off-road by providing greater wheel articulation and traction when needed, making the GX one of the few luxury SUVs that can actually tackle more than deep snow and gravel roads. The GX’s 301-horsepower V8 offers plenty of power for hauling, as evidenced by the GX 460’s 6,500-pound tow rating. Unfortunately, fuel economy is far from optimal, ranking near the bottom of the class. If these shortcomings matter to you, an Acura MDX or Mercedes-Benz GLS will probably be a better fit.</p>, <p>KINETIC DYNAMIC SUSPENSION SYSTEM (KDSS)<br>
The GX 460’s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) uses stiffer anti-roll bars attached to hydraulic cylinders that can increase or decrease resistance. On-road, the system helps the GX attain a more civilized ride than it otherwise would have, and off-road permits greater wheel articulation.<br>
<br>
COMPREHENSIVE FULL-TIME 4-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
Equipped with one of the most capable off-road systems on any SUV, the 2018 Lexus GX 460’s full-time 4-wheel-drive setup is one of its principal selling points. The Torsen limited-slip center differential includes electronic locking for better front-to-rear power distribution, while Active Traction Control ensures all four tires remain connected to the road (or ground) below.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus GX 460 has 3-row, 7-passenger seating; a 40/20/40-split 2nd-row bench seat and flat-folding 3rd-row seat offer numerous configurations for people and cargo. Front-seat comfort is terrific, the second row is adequate for adults, and the third best for children. The base version has NuLuxe upholstery while the Premium trim gets real leather. Instrumentation is easy to see, and controls easy to reach but there are lots of them; the instrument panel’s center stack contains the sound and climate systems and in the center console are controls for the 4-wheel-drive system. It’s all finished impeccably.</p>, <p>The GX 460’s tall, square-shouldered shape is clear evidence of its robust off-road intentions; no rounded-over aerodynamic teardrop this. But that tall shape pays dividends. Entry and exit are high, but the doors are big, and ample standard running boards make the step easy. Some may like, some may dislike the rear door; it’s a side-opening arrangement, hinged on the right, which can make loading from curbside awkward and is inconvenient when carrying long stuff home from the lumberyard. On the other hand, for loading luggage or groceries you don’t have to lean in over a swing-down tailgate.</p>, <p>In base form, the Lexus GX 460 is well equipped with a synthetic leather interior, wood trim, 10-way-power front seats, dual-zone climate control, rearview camera, power moonroof and power-operated tilt/telescope steering wheel -- always a nice touch. Entertainment and phone connectivity are provided by a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD display audio system with 8-inch touch screen and Bluetooth, dual USB inputs and the new Siri Eyes Free iPhone compatibility. On the safety side, there are 10 airbags, active headrests to reduce the severity of whiplash, and Lexus’ Safety Connect system with 24/7 emergency services.</p>, <p>While the base GX 460 is a good value we recommend the Premium trim; it’s only slightly over $4,000 more but includes leather, 3-zone automatic climate control with interior air filter, mahogany trim, LED foglights and Intuitive Parking Assist. We think that represents reasonable value for the money. Top-line Luxury models include Adaptive Variable Suspension, Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, captain’s-chair 2nd-row seating, power-folding outside mirrors, wood and leather-trimmed heated steering wheel and power-fold-flat 3rd-row seats. Other available options include a 17-speaker Mark Levinson Premium Surround Sound audio system, the Driver Support Package and a dual-screen rear-seat entertainment system.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus GX 460 has a 4.6-liter V8 of 301 horsepower and a 6-speed automatic transmission. With its off-road intentions, the GX 460 has an impressive full-time 4-wheel-drive system with a 2-speed transfer case and lockable center differential. This capability does not arrive without a price, and that’s fuel consumption; the EPA numbers are 15-mpg city, 18-mpg highway and 16 combined. If, like most people, you drive on the pavement your taxes paid for, there are many alternatives that are more refined and use less gas, such as the Audi Q7, Acura MDX, Mercedes-Benz ML 350 BlueTec, Infiniti QX60 hybrid and BMW X5. All will beat the GX 460 in fuel economy, but not in climbing over, around and through boulders and mud.<br/> <br/> 4.6-liter V8<br/> 301 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 329 lb-ft of torque @ 3,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/18 mpg<b></b></p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus GX 460 has a base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) right around $52,700; fully loaded, it easily tops $70,000. At its base price, the GX costs more than every likely competitor except the BMW X5, which is slightly higher, so it’s not a bargain item. But it is a quality piece of work, with great fit and finish and a proven record of dependable reliability. We recommend the GX 460 with the Premium package for its value for the money. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the GX 460. While the Lexus starts several thousand dollars higher than most competitors, it holds its value exceptionally well. In fact, in the past it has won the KBB.com Best Resale Value Award for Luxury Mid-Size SUV/Crossover. Inexpensive? No. Great long-term value? Yes.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/lexus/is/2018
[<p>In the competitive compact-luxury-car market, any vehicle that doesn’t do better than “good enough” simply can’t compete. Thankfully, this isn’t an issue for the 2018 Lexus IS, a small sports sedan good enough to take on the likes of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a>. The IS is backed by Lexus’ indisputable reputation for quality, reliability and high resale, not to mention a long list of <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> and safety features buyers have come to expect. We won’t deny the IS’ gaping-grille design is more than polarizing, but that’s a personal opinion not shared by everyone. However, when it comes to performance, capability and sheer driving enjoyment, there is no arguing the 2018 Lexus IS has come into its own.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus IS</a> delivers the speed, handling, comfort and luxury expected of a premium European brand, but with the kind of reliability and resale history for which Lexus is famous. Expressive styling sets the IS apart from most in this class.</p>, <p>If you like your styling more subtle than stand-out, the 2018 Lexus IS may be a bit too over the top. Hardcore driving enthusiasts will lament the omission of a manual transmission and the fact that the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> brand is synonymous more with luxury than performance.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus IS 250 is renamed the IS 300, while V6 models gain an additional five horsepower. Adaptive front headlights are now available and new standard features include a rearview monitor, 10-year complimentary Enform Safety and Service Connect and, on the IS 350 F Sport, a limited-slip rear differential.</p>, <p>Unlike Lexus <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> of the past, the 2018 Lexus IS demonstrates a rather playful suspension, direct and precise steering and a satisfying engine note every time the throttle is pressed to the floor. Even better, our feelings about the IS remain the same regardless whether equipped with the 4-cylinder turbo or potent V6. Push the IS up an onramp faster than you normally would and you’ll discover a car that rejoices in the challenge, revealing itself a true sports sedan ready to play with the best <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a> cars. Swap the onramp for a twisting mountain road, and you’ll find the IS in its element, with plenty of horsepower readily on tap as you accelerate out of the curve. For those who really enjoy pushing their limits, the F Sport models bring bigger wheels and more aggressive shock and spring rates, but also a bit firmer ride.</p>, <p>STANDARD LEXUS SAFETY SYSTEM+<br>
 Because Lexus puts such a high premium on the safety of its customers, the IS comes standard with a comprehensive safety suite often optional on its competition. The system includes pre-collision warning and braking, lane-departure warning and assist, adaptive cruise control and auto high beams.<br>
<br>
 2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED ENGINE<br>
 Utilizing both direct and port fuel injection, the IS 300’s 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine pumps out a healthy 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Power is run through a precise and responsive 8-speed automatic delivering a 0-to-60-mph run in under seven seconds.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>It comes as no surprise that the 2018 IS interior is impeccably assembled with high-quality materials everywhere. In keeping with the current Lexus styling theme, the center stack sits flush with the rest of the dash, improving accessibility and aesthetics. The infotainment screen makes full use of the real estate allotted on the dash -- it's no longer letter-boxed by plastic -- but the mouse-like controller is still frustrating to use at times. We like the F Sport gauges, inspired by the Lexus LF-A exotic car, with their digital instrument cluster and sliding bezel.</p>, <p>It's no secret that the design of the Lexus IS -- especially that big "spindle" grille -- ruffled some feathers when it came out. After a styling update last year, it looks like Lexus is happy leaving those feathers ruffled. Lexus revised the IS’ headlights, grille, front bumper and taillights, but nothing detracts from the eye-catching grille that looks like it's about to eat you alive. The bumper revisions give the F Sport a bit of a "chipmunk-cheek" look, though. Regardless, in profile and from most angles, the IS remains a uniquely styled car, and that's the point.</p>, <p>In addition to the standard Lexus Safety System+ on all 2018 Lexus IS models, you get a moonroof, HID headlights with LED running lights, LED fog lights and 17-inch wheels. Push-button start, a rearview camera, keyless entry and Bluetooth are also standard. Included is Lexus Personalized Settings to allow drivers to tailor electronic settings to their liking. Siri Eyes Free Mode accommodates better integration with the infotainment system and Apple's iPhones, but curiously, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren't available. There's an 8-speaker audio system with a 7-inch VGA (Video Graphics Array) screen on the dash, USB and auxiliary inputs and luxury comfort and convenience items.</p>, <p>Besides engine choice and all-wheel drive, options include an upgraded 10.3-inch screen for the Navigation Package, which adds upgraded Bluetooth, HD radio and the Lexus Enform suite. There's a Mark Levinson audio system available with 15 speakers and 835 watts. A luxury package adds a rearview camera with dynamic guidelines, heated steering wheel, leather interior with contrasting stitching, and wood trim. The F Sport package gives the grille an even more aggressive look, firms up the suspension, increases braking power, and adds a lot of other sporty trim throughout, including the cool gauge package.</p>, <p>Rear-wheel-drive (RWD) 2018 Lexus IS models can be equipped with either a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with its 241 horsepower, or a 3.5-liter V6 with 311 horsepower. Both are connected to a very good 8-speed automatic transmission that includes paddle shifters on the steering wheel. If you want all-wheel drive (AWD), you have the option of the same 3.5-liter V6 in either 260- or 311-horsepower versions. IS models with AWD get a 6-speed automatic transmission. While the V6 has more power, the smaller turbocharged 4-cylinder feels plenty quick from behind the wheel, and gets notably better fuel economy as well. That's important, as all IS models require premium-grade fuel.<br>

F-sport versions add about $3,000 to any given model, give or take. It's all fairly priced, along the lines of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a>, but you can get into an Audi A4, BMW 3 Series or Cadillac ATS for notably less, but those cars may have less equipment standard.

---------http://www.kbb.com/lexus/lc/2018
[<p>If European cars dominated a particular segment, it would be in the prestigious realm of high-end grand tourers. But with the introduction of the 2018 Lexus LC 500 and LC 500h <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>, that’s all about to change. As the first model to ride atop Lexus’ GA-L platform architecture, the 4-seat <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lc/">Lexus LC</a> bolsters its cutting-edge foundation with a world-class interior, high-tech trappings, and a potent V8 or optional V6-hybrid. Wrapped in a package that handles as sharp as it looks, it’s safe to say the LC 500 and LC 500h are poised to take on established stalwarts like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a>, Mercedes-AMG E63 <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a>, and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> 650i and i8 plug-in hybrid.</p>, <p>If you’re in the market for an ultra-premium 2+2 coupe that looks like nothing else on the road today, there might be an LC in your future.</p>, <p>Though no slouch in the dynamics department, the 2018 Lexus LC lacks the visceral thrill of the Porsche 911 Carrera S and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-type/">Jaguar F-Type</a> S.</p>, <p>The 2018 LC 500 and LC 500h are completely new nameplates, and reaffirm Lexus’ commitment to contesting at the highest levels of the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> marketplace.</p>, <p>It becomes immediately evident that the Lexus LC is something special from the moment the wheels begin to turn. From steering response, to brake feel, to chassis and suspension control, the harmonious manner in which the LC’s systems operate conveys an ever-present sense of solidness like no other <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> before it. In fact, the LC is the first Lexus -- and perhaps the only Japanese vehicle -- to accurately match the high-speed composure of its Autobahn-tuned rivals. Pitch it aggressively into a corner, and the LC’s body won’t roll past a few degrees no matter how unrefined your turn-in. But that also doesn’t mean the LC has abandoned its roots, as evidenced by a communicative-yet-comfortable ride and surprisingly good sightlines for a low-slung coupe. Plus, the cabin is exceptionally quiet, even by Lexus standards.</p>, <p>13-SPEAKER MARK LEVINSON AUDIO<br>
 Specifically designed for the LC’s uniquely shaped interior, Mark Levinson and Lexus teamed up to build a sound system that strategically positions every speaker for optimum sound. The result is one of the finest-sounding audio systems ever to grace the dash and doors of an automobile.<br>
<br>
 10-SPEED CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION<br>
 Transmissions rarely appear on our list of favorite features, let alone CVTs, but the LC 500h’s is deserving of such praise. Thanks to what is essentially a 4-speed differential, this CVT behaves just like the LC 500’s conventional 10-speed automatic. Swap gears, and you can even detect a hint of shift shock.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The interior was designed to be as driver-focused as you'd hope from a sports coupe, while retaining the elegance and refinement expected from a brand flagship. The seats are designed for all-day comfort and support, while available sport buckets offer additional side bolstering to keep you in place during spirited driving, though horizontally challenged drivers may find them somewhat restrictive. The only shortcoming, besides the cramped rear seats, is the infotainment system, due to a laptop-style touch pad that’s nearly impossible to get right while in motion and a convoluted interface that’ll have you sifting through multiple menus to access basic functions.</p>, <p>The LC 500 is a real-world interpretation of the acclaimed LF-LC concept car. Lexus underscored its pledge to bringing that stunning shape into production, and the LC represents one of those rare instances when it's not hyperbole to call it a concept car you can buy. Against all odds, touches like a first-ever 3D taillight effect, 3-element headlights emphasized by Lexus’ signature LED check mark, and dramatic spindle grille all survived the transition from prototype to production. Best of all, the LC 500 and LC 500h are virtually indistinguishable -- apart from their badging, of course.</p>, <p>Not surprisingly, the 2018 Lexus LC comes exceptionally well-furnished in base form. Key standards consist of LED headlights, 20-inch wheels, magnesium steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, a fixed glass panel roof, and a 12-speaker Pioneer audio system Pioneer tied to a high-mounted, wide-screen display. Safety tech arrives in the form of full-range adaptive cruise control, automatic pre-collision braking, lane-keeping assist that will steer the car back into its lane for you, and automatic high-beam control.</p>, <p>For those who want it all, the 2018 LC can be outfitted with a carbon-fiber roof panel, heated and ventilated front seats wrapped in semi-aniline leather or Alcantara, blind-spot monitoring, and a full-range of performance add-ons including a limited-slip rear differential, larger 21-inch wheels, active rear-wheel steering for added agility, and a speed-activated rear spoiler.</p>, <p>The LC 500 and LC 500h get their motivation from a revised version of Lexus’ naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 and 3.5-liter V6 hybrid, respectively. The conventional mill sends 471 horsepower to the rear wheels through a new 10-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid powertrain routes 354 net system horsepower to the same area via a gearless continuously variable transmission. Lexus claims the LC 500 can sprint from 0-60 in about 4.5 seconds, with the LC 500h coming in only two-tenths slower despite delivering considerably better fuel economy.<br>

[<p>The all-new 2018 Lexus LS brings together elegance, quality, luxury and value, in a new boldly styled package. It expands on what already made this sedan remarkable: an exquisite interior with luxury amenities and modern tech; fantastic materials and build quality; and a strong emphasis on value that doesn't compromise content. However, the new looks, inside and out, may make this the most polarizing LS to date. This <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> offers the niceties of models such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/7%20series/">BMW 7 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/s-class/">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a>, with a lower starting price and a long tradition of excellent resale value. The new LS is offered with a gasoline engine or hybrid powertrain and the option of all-wheel drive (AWD). The gas-powered <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus is</a> also available in F Sport trim.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/ls/">Lexus LS</a> provides the elegant, upscale interior you'd expect from a luxury car and boasts enviable build quality and resale value. Smooth ride, impressive power and Lexus levels of comfort continue to be LS mainstays. New styling finally gives the LS the looks that make it stand out.</p>, <p>Despite being around for nearly 30 years, Lexus doesn't have the same cachet as other luxury brands. There are more enthusiast-friendly offerings elsewhere, including AMG-tuned Mercedes and a wide variety of <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/panamera/">Porsche Panamera</a> options. In addition, some of the Lexus' styling cues aren't universally loved.</p>, <p>The all-new LS is longer, lower and wider than before, and the luxury sedan's styling is vastly more expressive and distinctive. A new engine/transmission combo powers the Lexus, and a passenger can literally put his feet up while enjoying the LS' all-new new comfort and tech amenities.</p>, <p>Driving the new LS is a more engaging experience than in the past, yet the ride remains comfortable. The LS 500's 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 has more horsepower and torque than the V8 it replaces, and makes the LS plenty quick from a stop. It's backed by a wonderfully smooth 10-speed automatic transmission. With Drive Mode Select in Sport+ mode, suspension and engine and transmission response become more aggressive. For those who prefer to stay on the comfort side of the equation, adjustable air suspension is available for a pleasant highway ride. The LS 500 F Sport doesn't offer more power, but has a firmer ride, quick transmission shifts and feels more agile than the LS 500. Its excellent brakes are strong but not jarring. The LS 500h hybrid, with 354 total system horsepower, is almost as quick as the LS 500, with the added bonus of better fuel economy.</p>, <p>SUMPTUOUS INTERIOR<br>
The stylish cabin offers tastefully crafted seats inspired by comfortable armchairs, and rich materials throughout. Design cues were inspired by traditional Japanese artisanship, and there are plenty of high-tech amenities. Options include Shiatsu-inspired seat massagers, 28-way-power seats, a reclining rear seat with ottoman, and 23-speaker audio.<br>
<br>
HYBRID POWERTRAIN<br>
The LS 500h's powertrain puts out 354 total system horsepower. It offers a seemingly impossible combination of speed -- reaching 60 mph from a stop in 5.1 seconds -- and excellent fuel economy. Lexus estimates the LS 500h will get combined fuel economy as good as 28 mpg.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Always known for its high-quality, well-crafted interiors, Lexus adds modern lines and traditional Japanese artisanship to the equation. There are unique touches, such as available Kiriko-cut glass and origami-inspired cloth panels on the doors. We preferred the beautiful wood accents instead of the glass. Want to be enveloped in luxury? Enjoy the 23-speaker audio, 28-way-power seats, Shiatsu-inspired seat massagers and a reclining rear seat with ottoman. A touch pad accesses some of the car's technology. It isn’t the most intuitive system, but is worth learning, as there are plenty of appealing features there.</p>, <p>The Lexus LS has the most expressive styling of any LS to date, and has a newfound attitude. There's a large spindle grille up front -- a design element that's not for everyone -- flanked by jagged, angular headlights. Along the sides, the sharp angles are overtaken by smooth curves. There are design cues that would seem to contradict each other, but end up working well together. The car is longer, lower and wider than the previous LS, dimensions that put its size within a half-inch of its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> competition.</p>, <p>An all-new 416-horsepower twin-turbo V6 with more horsepower and torque than the V8 it replaces bows in the new LS 500. It's controlled by a new 10-speed automatic transmission. The LS 500 comes as a rear-wheel-drive (RWD) car with 19-inch wheels. All LS sedans give you the ability to choose among Eco, Comfort and Sport drive modes. Inside, the Lexus uses a touch pad to access navigation and more, and there's Active Noise Control to keep the interior quiet. The extensive Lexus Safety System+ is standard, which includes pedestrian detection, lane-keep assist, lane-departure alert and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>The optional hybrid powertrain has plenty of power plus improved fuel economy. Another choice for LS buyers is the F Sport. While it doesn't offer an increase in horsepower or torque, it adds larger brakes and wheels. Adjustable air suspension and all-wheel drive are available on all LS models. The Executive Package includes 28-way-adjustable seats, seat massagers and a reclining rear seat with an ottoman. Adding the Advanced Package to the standard safety suite provides pedestrian alert, active steering assist and front cross-traffic alert. The interior is available with Kiriko glass accents and pleated panels inspired by origami.</p>, <p>There are two powertrain choices with the LS: The LS 500 is powered by a twin-turbo V6 backed by a 10-speed automatic transmission. Horsepower and torque are higher than last year, and the torque is easier to access. The LS 500h uses an Atkinson-cycle 3.5-liter V6 and two electric motors, which put out 354 total system horsepower. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is matched with a 4-speed automatic gear set, a setup designed to deliver the feel of a 10-speed automatic, with more feedback than you find in a more straightforward CVT. This transmission does offer more feedback, but at times the shifts feel artificial.<br>

That’s about $2,500 more than last year’s regular-wheelbase LS, but nearly $4,000 less than the starting price of the long-wheelbase LS 460 – and the 2018 LS has a lot more features and amenities. The hybrid LS 500h starts at $80,505. The LS follows the Lexus philosophy of offering content- and feature-heavy cars for a lower price. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class starts at over $90,000 and the BMW 7 Series starts at $84,000.

[<p>Built from the same sturdy bones that support the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/land%20cruiser/">Toyota Land Cruiser</a>, the 2018 Lexus LX 570 takes an already luxurious platform and elevates it to world-class status. With its powerful V8 engine and stout off-road abilities, the LX 570 can easily challenge newer <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover/">Land Rover Range Rover</a>, yet it retains a record of reliability and resale few others can touch. Lexus’ 3-row luxury SUV is also saturated with the latest infotainment and safety assists, leaving almost nothing to be desired. And, while we know most LX 570s rarely encounter unpaved terrain outside a gravel driveway, it’s nice to know the LX 570’s multiple AWD settings, locking differential and low-range gearing can tackle the toughest off-road challenge.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a high-end, 3-row luxury SUV that isn’t afraid to tackle nasty off-road situations and come out none the worse for wear, the 2018 Lexus LX 570 might be exactly what you’re looking for. The LX’s impeccable reputation for quality and reliability also doesn’t hurt.</p>, <p>If you want your luxury SUV to ride and handle more like a large sports <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>, a newer model like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/xc90/">Volvo XC90</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a> is a better choice. You’ll find more interior space in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/escalade%20esv/">Cadillac Escalade ESV</a>, and while others offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> does not.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lx/">Lexus LX</a> 570 now offers its Enform Safety and Service Connect telematics for the first 10 years at no charge (previously offered with a one-year trial period).</p>, <p>For all its luxury trappings, underneath that sexy sheetmetal and copious acreage of leather and real wood beats the heart of a true off-road-capable SUV. Yet despite its size and sturdy body-on-frame design, the 2018 Lexus LX 570 isn’t a beast in the civilized world. While not sporty by any measure, the LX 570 corners confidently and its ride is smooth without feeling tippy. The big wheel/tire combo does produce more in-cabin noise than one might expect from a Lexus, but of course most Lexus are not equipped with a sophisticated 3-mode independent suspension setup, locking differential or low-speed transfer case. Challenge an Audi Q7 or a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/escalade/">Cadillac Escalade</a> to follow the LX 570 into the bush and you’ll soon have both calling AAA for assistance. In fairness, a Land Rover Range Rover could easily keep up, and its on-road ride and handling are superior to the LX’s. And while none of these large SUVs are fuel-economy champs, the LX 570 rates near the bottom of the pack.</p>, <p>ACTIVE SAFETY AND DRIVING AIDS<br>
 A well informed driver is a safe driver, which is why the LX 570’s impressive list of standard equipment includes adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision warning system with automatic braking and pedestrian detection plus blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.<br>
<br>
 CRAWL CONTROL<br>
 For those times when you do get the LX 570 out into nature, Lexus’ Crawl Control can come in handy. The system regulates throttle and brake inputs helping the LX creep down steep grades while you focus on avoiding damaging obstacles.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>All 2018 LX 570 models feature a leather-lined 3-row/7-passenger configuration. But this big SUV differs from most others in that in addition to folding forward, the pair of small, power-operated 3rd-row seats also flip up against the sides to create a flat floor behind the second row, which also slides forward and back. Atop the center of the dash is a huge 12.3-inch widescreen that displays navigation, audio features and Apple Siri Eyes Free integration. We wager some of the prominent controls near the transmission selector will never be used; they're for low-range gearing, locking the differential and setting off-road crawl speed.</p>, <p>The 2018 LX 570 wears a face that makes this big brute hard to ignore. Look at the size of that "spindle" grille -- it could swallow a Yaris. The rest of the LX 570 is classic Land Cruiser DNA -- tall, boxy, imposing. The rear features a clamshell tailgate, with the top portion opening and closing at the push of a button, and below that a manually operated tailgate like that of a <a alt_o_t="Pickup Truck" href="/pickup-truck/">pickup truck</a>. While not quite as large as a Cadillac Escalade, the LX is a sizable rig. Make sure you have ample space in the garage if you intend to park it there.</p>, <p>Every 2018 LX 570 comes with 4-wheel drive, a V8 engine and the active safety and driving aids referenced in "Favorite Things." Standard equipment includes quad-zone climate control, a power moonroof, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, leather interior, and a 14-way driver's seat. This latest-gen Lexus LX conveys standard navigation and other infotainment functions on a 12.3-inch screen that utilizes the Lexus Remote Touch Interface controller. That includes a 9-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with HD Radio, Bluetooth streaming audio, and USB and iPod inputs. In addition to 10 airbags, there's a system that can automatically send help after an accident.</p>, <p>There are relatively few options for the 2018 Lexus LX 570, but those that are available are easy to recommend. Among them is the 19-speaker Mark Levinson audio system that will do wonders for your ears. A rear-seat entertainment system with twin 11.2-inch dual screens is available, as is a center-console cool box for keeping drinks chilled. The Luxury Package bundles semi-aniline leather-trimmed interior, 4-zone climate control and heated and ventilated front and 2nd-row seats. For just $150, the heated wood-and-leather steering wheel is a tasteful and satisfying bargain. Also available is a color head-up display.</p>, <p>There's only one engine for the 2018 Lexus LX 570: a 5.7-liter V8 putting out 383 horsepower and a stout 403 lb-ft of torque. It gives the big Lexus a tow rating of up to 7,000 pounds. All LX 570 models come standard with full-time 4-wheel drive, a system that can make the LX ready for the trail with the press of a button to lock the center differential, and a real switch to engage the LX's low-speed transfer case. The latest Lexus LX uses an 8-speed automatic transmission, but with 6,000 pounds to haul around, it improves fuel economy only a bit. At a combined 15-mpg rating, the LX is a thirsty rig.<br>

With options, that price can increase a few thousand dollars. At these prices, the Lexus LX is in Range Rover territory, and tens of thousands of dollars beyond easier-to-drive and easier-to-live-with 3-row luxury SUVs like the Mercedes-Benz GLS, Volvo XC90, Cadillac Escalade and Audi Q7.

[<p>Lexus’ smallest luxury-crossover <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> is also one of its most popular, making the 2018 Lexus NX a resounding sales success. Not wanting to mess with a good thing, the NX gets a mild mid-cycle freshening this year, but all the elements from the original vehicle are still in place, including the turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model. Although it shares its platform with the RAV4, the two have little else in common. The NX makes a bold visual statement, touting Lexus’ somewhat polarizing spindle grille design. Inside, the NX displays a futuristic dash and instrument panel, luxurious seating options and a roomy rear seat. And while the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx30/">Infiniti QX30</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gla/">Mercedes-Benz GLA</a> 250 cost a bit less, neither offers the option of a hybrid engine.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus NX 300 serves up the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand’s most desirable features in a compact-luxury-crossover SUV as efficient as it is fun to drive. The NX 300h hybrid’s 31-mpg combined fuel-economy figure places it at the top of its class.</p>, <p>If you regularly carry four adults, or need a luxury SUV with a large cargo area, an RX 350 is probably a better choice. You’ll find more conservative styling in an <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q3/">Audi Q3</a> or even the new <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> E-Pace, although neither has the NX’s strong resale and reliability record.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a> 200t is renamed the Lexus NX 300. A more aggressive front end and suspension and interior updates mark the major changes, with new optional equipment including a foot-activated rear liftgate, 10.3-inch center dash display and adaptive dampers. The <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> Safety System + (forward-collision warning, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning and auto high beams) is now standard.<b></b></p>, <p>Many cars tempt buyers with sporty good looks only to let them down with an engine and suspension that don’t live up to the visual hype. Thankfully, this description does not apply to the 2018 Lexus NX 300. The NX’s turbocharged 2.0-liter engine loves to run, delivering its power in a smooth, linear fashion that makes this nearly 4,000-pound <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV feel like a much lighter, more nimble vehicle. The available adaptive suspension is a modified version of the system used in the LC 500 <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a>, helping improve cornering and stability and putting this little Lexus in the same league as its German rivals. Less thrilling but every bit as reliable is the NX 300h hybrid. With a less powerful drivetrain and the added weight of standard all-wheel drive, the NX 300h can’t quite keep pace with its gasoline-only counterpart, but its excellent mileage and equally impressive ride and handling are definitely something to consider.</p>, <p>2.0-LITER TURBOCHARGED 4-CYLINDER ENGINE<br>
 Although Lexus doesn’t have a long history in the world of turbocharging, they nailed it with the NX 300’s 2.0-liter turbo. Advanced engineering ideas, such an exhaust manifold-mounted turbocharger, reduce turbo lag while improving responsiveness and fuel economy.<br>
<br>
 DESIGN<br>
 Certain people prefer their vehicles be subtle, while others like them to make a statement. The 2018 NX 300 is anything but subtle, and its aggressive spindle grille gets even more pronounced this year. Still, it’s a look we like, and it certainly won’t be mistaken for one of the NX’s more generic-looking competitors.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>It's no surprise that the cutting-edge exterior of a car looking like the 2018 NX has a cutting-edge interior. And we do mean edge, as the multiple levels, cutlines, materials and finishes could distract some drivers. Schizophrenic design choices aside, there's no mistaking the quality. From the stitched material on the dash to the many soft and padded surfaces, the Lexus NX exudes the sophistication of a higher class of vehicle than what you're actually driving. The improved touch-pad interface for the Remote Touch is clever, but still not as intuitive as touch-screen or knob-based systems.</p>, <p>It used to be that Lexus vehicles were so understated they were boring. Not anymore. From its dramatically gaping grille, to the intricately detailed LED headlights, to the 3-dimensional sculpting of the taillights that you have to touch to really understand, the 2018 Lexus NX 300 takes everything you thought you knew about Lexus styling, folds it up into a crazy shape, and throws it back in your face. It doesn't always work -- the nose, for example, protrudes Durante-like in profile -- but overall it's nicely executed and at the very least is a welcome break from previous humdrum Lexus vehicles.</p>, <p>The compact 2018 NX 300 luxury-crossover SUV is as feature-packed and nicely equipped as the Lexus badge on the nose suggests. There are things you'd expect, like power seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, and leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. And a few others, such as the standard Lexus Display Audio with its 7-inch screen, voice recognition and the ability to divide the screen into three sections. There's LED interior lighting, plus LED taillights and low-beam headlights. Standard driver assists include forward-collision warning, lane-departure warning, auto high beams and adaptive cruise control.</p>, <p>Options extend beyond all-wheel drive for the NX 300 or a hybrid powertrain in the AWD NX 300h hybrid. A Navigation Package includes the Lexus Enform system, which adds Bing, Yelp, iHeartRadio and other apps, including maintenance reminders. The Remote Touch Interface uses a touch-pad controller that's slightly less fiddly than the mouse-like shuttle in other Lexus vehicles. The Leather package includes the Comfort and Premium packages, which add driver's-seat memory, and heated and ventilated front seats. The sporty set will like the aluminum pedals and sport-tuned suspension that come with the F Sport.</p>, <p>The standard engine in the 2018 Lexus NX 300 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. If you measure performance by the infrequency of your visits to the gas pump, the NX 300h hybrid may be more your speed, with its combination of 2.5-liter 4-cylinder and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor putting out a total of 194 horsepower. This runs through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), but with a twist: Floor the throttle, and it activates a kick-down switch, immediately giving you full power. The NX 300 is available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD), while the hybrid is offered only in AWD. Note that the turbo requires premium fuel, while the hybrid is happy with regular unleaded.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 235 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,650-4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/28 mpg, 22/27 mpg (F Sport)<br/> <br/> 2.5-liter inline-4 engine + electric motor<br/> Engine:<br/> 154 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm<br/> 152 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br/> Front Electric Motor: <br/> 141 horsepower<br/> Rear Electric Motor: 67 horsepower<br/> Net output: 194 horsepower<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 33/30 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) on a front-wheel-drive 2018 Lexus NX 300 starts at about $37,000 when you include the $975 destination charge. If you want all-wheel drive, bring an extra $1,400. The hybrid starts notably higher, at nearly $41,000. Note that the NX is priced higher than competitors like the Audi Q3, Infiniti QX30 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x1/">BMW X1</a>, all of which start closer to $31,000; it's even about $1,000 higher than the Mercedes-Benz GLA 250, but $2,500 less than the new Jaguar E-Pace.

[<p>The 2018 Lexus RC lives on the exciting side of the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand’s extensive lineup.

Buyers looking for all-wheel drive (AWD) can step up to the V6-powered 260-horsepower RC 300 or the 311-horsepower RC 350, which is also available with rear-wheel drive. Each is also offered with the desirable F Sport package that adds a sport suspension, sport seats and about $4,000 to the bottom line. The top-dog V8-powered RC F costs north of $65,000 and competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m4/">BMW M4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s5/">Audi S5</a>.

It packs all the luxury, reliability and features you expect in a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>, but also delivers the thrill, passion and visual impact coupe buyers desire.<b></b></p>, <p>Lexus still struggles with its infotainment interface. You get used to it over time, but the systems in the BMW 4 Series, Audi A5, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/q60/">Infiniti Q60</a> are just easier to use.

Lexus has also increased the size of the infotainment screen to 10.3 inches, added onboard 4G LTE Wi-Fi and improved the F Sport’s Drive Mode Select system with a custom mode. The Lexus Safety System+, which includes multiple driver aids, is now standard.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus RC coupe backs up its sexy shape and aggressive design with strong performance and an engaging driving experience. It’s more fun to drive than most Lexus models. Although it’s heavier than many of its competitors from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus is</a> quick and handles well enough for most buyers. Even the base RC turbo, which is badged the RC 200t, accelerates quickly and delivers the same cat-like reflexes as the RC 350. More demanding drivers should step up to the V6-powered RC 300 or RC 350; you’ll appreciate the additional power over time. And the F Sport models are worth the investment for the increase in handling, although the stiff ride might be a rude awakening for longtime Lexus owners. Those seeking the ultimate Lexus performer should opt for the 467-horsepower RC F with its intoxicating V8 rumble and thrust. Still, it’s outperformed by the lighter, turbocharged BMW M4 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats-v/">Cadillac ATS-V</a>.</p>, <p>LEXUS SAFETY SYSTEM+<br>
 Now standard on every 2018 Lexus RC, Lexus Safety System+ adds a list of active-safety systems and driver aids including Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, which will apply the brakes for you in emergency situations. Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist and Dynamic Cruise Control will keep a safe distance from the car ahead.<br>
<br>
 DRIVE MODE SELECT<br>
 This system is standard on all 2018 Lexus RC models, and it allows the driver to customize the coupe’s throttle response, transmission tuning and gauge cluster. Twist the knob on the console and choose among Normal, Sport, Sport+ and Eco. F Sport models also get an adjustable suspension and a Custom mode, which saves the driver’s favorite settings.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>It’s a 2-door coupe, which means the 2018 Lexus RC has long doors, which can be an issue in tight parking spaces. It seats four as long as the rear-seat passengers are small and don’t mind cramped quarters. Up front the seats are comfortable in all trims and feature extra bolstering in RC Sport and RC F models, and the stylistic instrumentation combines a digital speedometer with a larger center-mounted analog tachometer. The new much larger 10.3-inch infotainment screen is wonderful, but the touch pad and joystick interface, although improved, can still be frustrating to use. In the Lexus tradition, materials are first-rate and the fit/finish is exacting.</p>, <p>From its large Lexus "spindle" grille -- extra-large on the RC F model -- to its fins and other aggressive details, the new 2018 Lexus RC is anything but boring. It looks more menacing and distinctive than its European and American competitors and bears a striking resemblance to the exotic <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lfa/">Lexus LFA</a> supercar of a few years ago. Its proportions are perfect and its stance is properly low, especially with the larger wheels and tires worn by F Sport models. To announce its additional performance, the top-dog RC F model gets uniquely stacked exhaust pipes and additional vents and flares.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus RC comes as nicely equipped as you'd expect of a luxury-sports coupe. There are standard automatic climate control, a self-dimming rearview mirror, and an infotainment system with a 10.3-inch display screen, Lexus Safety System+, rearview camera, Lexus Enform Service Connect service and onboard Wi-Fi. The 10-speaker audio system includes HD Radio, dual USB inputs and Bluetooth streaming with Eyes Free iPhone integration. F Sport models get standard variable suspension and Sport+ driving mode, heated and ventilated front seats, a suspension tuned for higher performance, and a power-adjust steering wheel. RC F models include bigger brakes, front sport seats and forged BBS aluminum wheels.</p>, <p>The options list starts with a navigation system that uses a touch-pad controller and includes an upgraded Enform suite with services such as Yelp, Pandora and stock prices. There are also heated/ventilated front seats, a leather interior, heated steering wheel and a moonroof. The Mark Levinson premium audio system makes even your iPod sound amazing, and should top the list for music lovers. Advanced safety features include blind-spot monitoring and a pre-collision system that can automatically brake the car. RC F models can add to their prowess with a torque-vectoring rear differential and carbon-fiber roof and rear spoiler.</p>, <p>Lexus’ RC coupe for 2018 offers a choice of four engines. Filling out the bottom end is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with 241 horsepower in the RC 200t. The 2018 RC 300 AWD comes with a 3.5-liter V6 putting out 260 horsepower, while the RC 350 and 350 AWD share a 3.5-liter V6 making 311 horsepower. Power for rear-wheel-drive Lexus RC models is routed through an 8-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models have to make do with an older, less responsive 6-speed automatic. Topping the range is the 5.0-liter 467-horsepower V8 in the RC F, which is also connected to an 8-speed automatic. Note that while Lexus RC models have an edge against their BMW foes in horsepower, they aren't quite as fuel-efficient.<br>

If you want all-wheel drive, the RC 300 AWD starts at about $43,750, about $1,300 less than the rear-wheel-drive RC 350. The AWD RC 350 starts just over $46,000. Those prices are a little less than for a BMW 4 Series, an Infiniti Q60 or Audi A5, but quite a bit more than the excellent Cadillac ATS coupe. If you're looking to endanger your license, the RC F starts a little over $65,000, in line with a BMW M4 coupe but several thousand more than the Audi S5. Prices climb quickly once you start adding options. Do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying, and note that the RC should retain its value very nicely.</p>]

[<p>Comfortable and luxurious, the 2018 Lexus RX continues to dominate the midsize-luxury-SUV segment. Two standard models are available, the V6-powered RX 350 and RX 450h hybrid, which is a fuel-economy class leader. New this year is a 3-row variant that can seat up to seven passengers. Lexus also offers the desirable RX F Sport for those who want a sportier driving experience and a more aggressive appearance. F Sport models get a sport-tuned suspension, larger wheels and tires, an in-your-face mesh grille, sport seats and an electronic gauge cluster with additional instrumentation. The new Lexus RX seats five comfortably and delivers a smooth ride, quiet interior and legendary Lexus reliability. It also leads the class with traditionally high resale value. Its long list of competitors includes the Mercedes-Benz GLE, BMW X5, Volvo XC90, Audi Q5 and Cadillac XT5.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus RX is smooth, quiet and comfortable with a luxurious interior and a long list of safety features. If fuel economy is a high priority, the RX 450h hybrid is a class leader, and the sporty F Sport models handle well and are fun to drive. All RXs enjoy excellent resale values.</p>, <p>If understated style is more your taste, the RX’s aggressive look and massive grille might not be for you. The new 3-row Lexus RX is still best suited for five passengers, as its third row is very tight. If you regularly need a third row, opt for a larger SUV.</p>, <p>The big news for the 2018 Lexus RX lineup are the new 3-row, extended-length RX 350L and RX 450hL models. Other updates include an available blind-spot monitor and sunroof on the RX 350 base model and the RX 450h hybrid. Navigation and rear cross-traffic alert are also now available on the hybrid along with a new Premium Package. Lexus’ Enform Safety Connect system is now complimentary for 10 years.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lexus RX 350 remains a luxury SUV that places an emphasis on comfort and confidence over blistering performance. The ride is smooth and the interior is quiet, isolating you from the harsh world outside its leather-lined interior. This is an SUV you can drive for hours with little fatigue. We’re not saying the Lexus can’t handle tight turns or twisting back roads, but if you’re seeking razor-sharp reflexes, a step up to the F Sport trim is in order. Equipped with Lexus’ selectable drive-mode system, the F Sport adds a Sport S+ setting that increases steering feedback and quickens throttle response. The RX’s V6 is both powerful and impressively smooth, matched to an 8-speed automatic transmission that should be the standard by which all automatics are judged. The RX 450h hybrid combines an electric motor with the V6 delivering even more horsepower and torque with superior fuel economy. For the most part the new 3-row RX 350L drives much like the standard version, but its increased size and weight make it feel heftier in turns and a touch slower off the line.</p>, <p>LEXUS SAFETY SYSTEM+<br>
 The Lexus Safety System+ is standard on all 2018 Lexus RX models. The state-of-the-art system includes Pre-Collision System (PCS) with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Keep Assist and Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam Headlamps (IHB) and All-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.<br>
<br>
 PANORAMIC VIEW MONITOR<br>
 This clever safety system takes the rearview camera to the extreme. It uses four cameras mounted on the front, sides and rear of the Lexus RX to create a bird’s-eye 360-degree view of the SUV on its large 12-inch monitor. It makes parking and backing safer and stress-free.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>We expect a lot from a Lexus interior, and the 2018 RX delivers with upscale materials, exacting fit and finish and attractive modern design. The analog clock is an elegant touch. All models offer a large multimedia screen which is operated by a console-mounted mouse-like controller some may find frustrating to use. The seats are plush, and there is plenty of head- and legroom in back. Beware of rear blind spots from the narrow roof design. Cargo space is impressive, with over 18 cubic feet behind the rear seats and over 56 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. The new RX 350L has standard seating for seven with a 3-across 2nd-row bench. Optional on that model and standard on the RX 450hL are 2nd-row captain’s chairs that reduce total passenger count to six. While a 3-row Lexus RX has been much anticipated, the result is a letdown if you need the last row for all but the most occasional use. Space is extremely tight, even for children. One positive is slightly more cargo room with the rear seats folded.</p>, <p>Lexus doesn’t do boring anymore. The brand has moved away from its attractive but stoic styling and now creates some of the most daring and dynamic shapes on the road. With its gaping “spindle” grille, high beltline and futuristic hard edges, the 2018 Lexus RX isn’t classically beautiful, but you’re not going to lose it in the Target parking lot. More important, no one is going to confuse it for a <a alt_o_t="Minivan" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivan</a>. The F Sport’s larger 20-inch wheels give the RX an aggressive stance, and the SUV’s blacked-out C-pillar behind its rear windows gives its roof a unique floating appearance. The RX L models are 4.3 inches longer, and Lexus’ designers have done a good job hiding the extra length. It will take a keen eye to tell the difference from the standard model.</p>, <p>The Lexus RX has always been well-equipped, and the latest model is no different. Even a base RX comes with a power tailgate, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, a power-adjustable steering wheel, a faux-leather interior, rain-sensing wipers, dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, a HomeLink garage-door opener, 18-inch wheels, and the Lexus Safety System+ with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, auto high beams and lane-departure alert. The standard infotainment system includes an 8-inch command screen, 9-speaker audio with USB, Bluetooth, Micro SD card slot and auxiliary input, and Siri Eyes Free for Apple iPhones. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, however, remain unavailable for the Lexus RX.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on the new RX 350 and standard on the RX 450h hybrid. F Sport models come with front-wheel drive (FWD) as standard, but can also be had with all-wheel drive. Other options include leather seating, a sunroof, a heated steering wheel, heated/ventilated front seats, a touch-free tailgate, navigation, a larger 12.3-inch screen, and a fantastic-sounding 15-speaker Mark Levinson audio system. F Sport models add 20-inch wheels, paddle shifters, adaptive variable suspension, and unique front and rear fascias. A rear-seat DVD entertainment system with dual screens, a Heads-Up Display and a Panoramic View Monitor, which gives you a 360-degree view of the SUV’s surroundings, are also available.</p>, <p>The 2018 RX 350 uses Lexus’ tried-and-true 3.5-liter V6 with 295 horsepower and strong fuel economy for its class. Unlike some luxury SUV rivals, this one runs just fine on regular 87-octane unleaded gasoline. The V6 works with a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic transmission, which gets paddle shifters on the F Sport. The RX 350L uses the same V6 but has slightly less power (290 horsepower) due to a single exhaust vs. the standard model's dual exhaust setup. The most efficient Lexus RX remains the 450h hybrid, which delivers class-leading fuel economy. It pairs the 3.5-liter V6 with a battery-electric powertrain, an electronic continuously variable automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. No plugging in is required, and it gets its best mileage in the city, but premium gasoline is recommended. The 2018 RX 450h and the RX 450hL both have a total output of 308 horsepower, and the 2-row model delivers up to 31 mpg in the city. The Lexus RX’s towing capacity is 3,500 pounds.<br>

Adding options to any model can increase the bottom line by thousands. At these prices, the Lexus continues to significantly undercut German rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz GLE and BMW X5. It is in line with the 3-row Acura MDX, and above the starting prices of the Lincoln MKX, Volvo XC60 and Infiniti QX50. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new RX.

[<p>Comfortable and opulent, with nifty features like "magic" door handles and 30-way-adjustable front seats, the 2018 Lincoln Continental is the brand’s flagship luxury sedan. All-new just last year, it offers powerful turbocharged engines, all-wheel drive and a design worthy of the legendary Continental name, which first appeared on a sexy convertible in 1941. Prices start around $46,000 and the smooth-riding Lincoln’s list of competitors includes the Volvo S90, Cadillac CTS and Lexus GS. Four trim levels are available, starting with the front-wheel-drive Lincoln Continental Premiere powered by a 305-horsepower 3.7-liter V6. Lincoln also offers the Continental Select, Reserve and Black Label, with the upper-trim levels powered by a 2.7-liter V6 packing twin turbos and 335 horsepower. All-wheel drive is available across the range, but it’s standard on Continental Reserve and Black Label models with the optional 400-horsepower twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6.</p>, <p>If you’re shopping for a powerful, spacious and technically advanced luxury sedan with sleek, elegant lines and the highest safety ratings, you’ll like the 2018 Lincoln Continental. This sedan offers a cushy ride, a decadent interior and it has been chosen as Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>, <p>Although Lincoln offers a hybrid version of its MKZ sedan, it does not offer a hybrid version of the larger Lincoln Continental. If you’re looking for a large, hybrid-luxury sedan, check out the Lexus ES, Acura RLX and BMW 3 Series and 5 Series, which offer a plug-in hybrid powertrain. </p>, <p>For 2018, the Lincoln Connect infotainment system with an onboard 4G Wi-Fi hotspot is now standard on all Lincoln Continental models. The Select Plus Package, which adds<b> </b>Navigation and Blind Spot Information System with Cross-Traffic Alert, is now standard on Select models. And the 13-speaker Revel premium audio system is standard on the Reserve trim level.</p>, <p>Despite its big horsepower numbers, available all-wheel drive and low and hunkered-down stance, the 2018 Lincoln Continental is not a sports sedan. It’s quick and it can cruise comfortably at 100 mph all day if you bought up the Mojave with your lottery winnings, but driving enthusiasts won’t find satisfaction in the Continental’s cushy ride and isolated steering feel. The Lincoln performs well, but it’s for luxury lovers, not g-force junkies. It cruises effortlessly. Its cabin is quiet and plush. And its overall driving character is relaxed. The Continental does have a Sport mode that livens its steering, suspension and throttle response, however, which does make it a bit more fun to drive, but the Lincoln is best for long and straight highway runs and when used as an isolation chamber in the hustle and bustle of the urban sprawl. Oh, have I been in traffic for the last two hours? I didn’t notice, sitting here in my new Continental with my massaging seat set on “hard.”</p>, <p>LINCOLN PICKUP AND DELIVERY<br>
 Saving you time and inconvenience should be as much a part of luxury ownership as soft leather and a smooth ride. Lincoln agrees so every 2018 Lincoln, including the new Continental, comes with complimentary vehicle pickup and delivery for all service and maintenance. A loaner car is also part of the deal.<br>
  <br>
 MASSAGING FRONT SEATS<br>
 The Continental’s 30-way-adjustable front seats are exceedingly comfortable. And of course, they are heated. But they also offer massage and you can even dial in the intensity as it gives your back and buttocks a thorough working. Perfect after a long day at the office, but they also fight off fatigue on long drives.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The days of Lincolns with outdated interiors full of hard plastics and cheap bits are long over. The cabin of the 2018 Lincoln Continental is modern, stylish and filled with upscale materials and precise fit and finish. It’s also spacious with room for five and comfortable with front seats with 10-, 24- or 30-way adjustment with heat and massage. The configurable gauge cluster is digital and minimalistic and the Sync 3 infotainment system is easy to use, featuring an onboard 4G Wi-Fi hotspot and a large touch screen. The Continental’s unique push-button shifter takes a little getting used to, but you’ll acclimate to it quickly.</p>, <p>The new Lincoln Continental looks expensive and draws inspiration from classic Lincoln Continental models from the early 1960s. Just take in that shiny honeycomb grille, the bulging hood, sleek sides and tapered rear. Its size itself makes a statement, living large at over 201 inches in length. Among the Continental's most notable design elements are the E-latch electronic door handles, situated in the beltline just below the windows and sitting stationary. Rather than pulling them, you simply reach and press a button to open. Optional is a feature that gently opens and closes the doors -- just like on a Rolls-Royce.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln Continental comes in four trims: Premiere, Select, Reserve and Black Label. A base Premiere model includes heated and 10-way-adjustable front seats, power-operated steering-wheel adjustment, universal garage-door opener, auto-hold brake system (convenient at stoplights), rearview camera and parking-aid system, dual-zone automatic climate-control system and 18-inch wheels. The Lincoln also includes an 8-inch touch screen and the Sync3 infotainment system that's compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and includes a 4G onboard Wi-Fi hotspot. For around $3,000 more, we suggest the Select model, which adds leather interior, hands-free power-operated trunk, self-closing/opening doors, and the ability to add more option packages.</p>, <p>A new Lincoln Continental Reserve model adds navigation, blind-spot monitoring, tri-zone climate control and the 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 with 335 horsepower. In addition to more features like Venetian leather and other fancy bits, the Black Label model comes with exclusive services ranging from culinary adventures to complimentary car washes and travel perks. Other goodies include the 400-horsepower 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 engine, which makes the Continental one of the most powerful sedans in it class, a rear-seat package with recline function and heat/ventilation, the Revel premium 19-speaker audio system, and active safety and driving aids such as dynamic cruise control, lane-keep assist and automatic emergency braking. All-wheel drive is available on all models.</p>, <p>A trio of V6 engines is available in the 2018 Continental. Standard is a naturally aspirated (non-turbo) 3.7-liter V6 with 305 horsepower. Optional are a 335-horsepower 2.7-liter twin-turbo or 3.0-liter twin-turbo with a serious 400 horsepower. The Lincoln Continental is front-wheel drive (FWD), but all-wheel drive (AWD) can be had on all three engines for about $2,000 and is exclusive to the 3.0-liter. All use a 6-speed automatic transmission that does a fine job. The big Continental isn't especially thrifty with fuel, with all engines achieving about 20 mpg combined.<br>

At just over $50,000, we think the Select is a better bet. From there, prices zoom to the mid-$50,000 range for the Continental Reserve and about $70,000 for the Continental Black Label models. A loaded Black Label can kiss $80,000. At these prices, this full-size luxury sedan is more comparable to slightly smaller rivals like the Audi A6, Volvo S90, Acura RLX, Lexus GS, Mercedes E-Class, Cadillac CTS and BMW 5 Series. As much as we appreciate a fully loaded 400-horsepower, all-wheel-drive Black Label model, the Continental's best value is nearer its base price. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Lincoln Continental's resale value is predicted to be only marginal.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Lincoln MKC is the luxury brand’s smallest and least expensive SUV. Exquisitely detailed, luxuriously appointed and powered by a choice of turbocharged engines, the compact SUV packs big comfort, features and performance in a small package. All-wheel drive is available and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkc/">Lincoln MKC</a> offers a long list of in-cabin convenience and safety technology, including Apple CarPlay connectivity and Active Park Assist, which will practically parallel-park the SUV for you. Offered in four trim levels, Premiere, Select, Reserve and Black Label, the new 2018 Lincoln MKC exudes a youthful and cool vibe, something that has eluded Lincolns of late and is a welcome change. It competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q3/">Audi Q3</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rdx/">Acura RDX</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gla/">Mercedes-Benz GLA</a>. Prices start just over $34,000.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a luxurious-compact SUV with elegant American style and powerful turbocharged engines, you’ll like the new 2018 Lincoln MKC. Buyers also appreciate the MKC’s spaciousness and its refined interior, which features the very latest in-cabin connectivity and unique features like a push-button shifter.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> doesn’t offer a hybrid version of the MKC. If you’re looking for a hybrid in this class, check out the Lexus NX hybrid, which gets significantly better fuel mileage than the Lincoln. Some may also prefer the less traditional exterior design of the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volvo/">Volvo</a> also offers a plug-in hybrid version of its new XC60 with 400 horsepower.</p>, <p>For 2018 every Lincoln MKC gets onboard 4G Wi-Fi hotspot standard. Also, the Lincoln Way app adds remote features, including smartphone-integrated technology, remote start, remote lock/unlock and scheduled remote start. New exterior colors include Iced Mocha Metallic, which sounds delicious.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln MKC is a compact-luxury-crossover SUV that exudes a feeling of solidity, confidence and safety. Lincoln gave the new MKC a wide track and a low center of gravity, which greatly improve this compact SUV’s ability to corner and maneuver like a small sports sedan. Power from the standard turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is smooth, and acceleration is more than enough for most buyers. Its 6-speed automatic has fewer gears than many in the class, but it’s well-tuned and a good match for the 245-horsepower engine. Front-wheel-drive versions benefit from Lincoln’s Torque Vectoring Control system that helps improve grip on any road surface. But, for the driving enthusiast, Lincoln’s Continuously Controlled Damping system is a must-have. The system’s Comfort setting is a bit too soft for our taste, but we very much approve of the Sport and Normal modes, noting that the Sport mode’s ride is quite firm.</p>, <p>LINCOLN PICKUP AND DELIVERY<br>
 Lincoln understands that luxury is more than soft leather and a smooth ride. It’s also saving you time and inconvenience. And that’s why every 2018 Lincoln, including the new MKC, comes with complimentary vehicle pickup and delivery for all service and maintenance. A loaner car is also part of the deal.<br>
<br>
 ACTIVE PARK ASSIST<br>
 This optional system takes all the stress out of parallel-parking the new Lincoln MKC. With the push of a button its sensors will locate a parking spot and steer the SUV into and then later out of the space while you control the accelerator, brakes and gear selection.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Those expecting a boring, old-school interior inside the Lincoln MKC will be disappointed. The SUV’s cabin is modern, cleanly designed and packs a youthful exuberance. Lincoln has infused the MKC’s interior with the comfort and refinement associated with traditional American luxury along with the technology and inspired design expected from Japanese and German luxury brands. It’s a unique combination and it works. The Lincoln’s dash-mounted push-button shifter yields additional storage space while the infotainment system features a sizable touch screen and user-friendly knobs and buttons. The MKC’s power bucket seats offer laudable support, and the rear bench folds flat to expand cargo space, which is tight compared to some rivals.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln MKC’s sleek profile is enhanced by a flowing roofline, bold shoulder creases and smartly sculpted body panels. Up front is Lincoln’s split-wing grille framed by high-efficiency HID headlights. Full-width LED taillights grace the new MKC’s sophisticated wraparound rear hatch. Overall the SUV’s design stakes middle ground in the compact-luxury-SUV class, sandwiched between a few radically shaped competitors and others that take a more conservative approach. Standard across the MKC lineup is a class-leading Approach Detection System that automatically illuminates the Lincoln when its owner comes within eight feet and even includes color-keyed mini-lamps in each door pull.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Lincoln MKC compact-luxury-crossover SUV comes dressed to impress. The entry-level Premiere model packs a bounty of power assists, active noise control and dual-zone climate control with Sync 3, onboard 4G Wi-Fi and a 9-speaker audio system with SiriusXM radio. MKC Select spec replaces Leatherette and aluminum cabin appointments with Bridge of Weir leather and premium wood, while adding ambient lighting, a 10-way-power passenger seat and auto-folding side-view mirrors. The Lincoln MKC Reserve brings heated/cooled front seats, a glass panoramic Vista Roof, navigation, the MyLincoln Mobile app for always-on remote-vehicle access, blind-spot monitoring and a power-adjustable tilt/telescoping steering column.</p>, <p>Buyers can personalize their 2018 Lincoln MKC with a selection of free-standing extras as well as with focused equipment packages. Highlights include Continuously Controlled Damping, all-wheel drive, a 14-speaker THX II Certified Audio system, 19- and 20-inch wheel/tire fitments, and various paint finishes. All MKC’s offer the Climate Package that adds heated steering wheel/rear seats, rain-sensing wipers and automatic high-beam headlights. A Class II Trailer Tow Package is also offered. The Select Plus Package bundles navigation with blind-spot monitoring, and the Reserve-only Technology Package brings adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and Forward Sensing and Active Park Assist systems. The Black Label series represents the ultimate Lincoln experience.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln MKC compact-luxury SUV offers front- and all-wheel drive and a choice of two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. The base 2.0-liter is the same one used in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a> and produces an identical 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Rated at 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque, the MKC’s optional engine is the same 2.3-liter used in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/mustang/">Ford Mustang</a>. Both engines are backed by a 6-speed SelectShift automatic transmission that offers manual-style control via paddles mounted on the steering wheel. Although the engines boast very respectable fuel-economy figures, the MKC’s maximum tow rating -- when fitted with the optional Trailer Tow Package-- is 3,000 pounds, well under the Audi Q5’s class-leading 4,400-pound figure.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 245 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 275 lb-ft of torque @ 3,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/28 mpg (FWD), 19/25 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 2.3-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 285 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 305 lb-ft of torque @ 2,750 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/25 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p>Lincoln offers the 2018 MKC compact-luxury-crossover SUV with fairly aggressive pricing. A front-drive 2.0-liter MKC Premiere opens with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $34,000 including a $925 destination charge. That’s about $3,000 less than the Acura RDX. An MKC Select pops that figure by nearly $3,000 with the Lincoln MKC Black Label starting close to $46,500. Adding AWD bumps the bottom line on any 2.0-liter model by about $2,500. Pricing on the MKC Select AWD with the 2.3-liter engine starts around $40,000 and can top $56,000 on the fully equipped Black Label. Maxed-out SUV rivals from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>, Volvo, BMW and Mercedes-Benz can all top that figure by $5,000 or more, but they can also offer V6, turbodiesel and/or hybrid powertrain choices, enhanced towing capabilities, and stronger resale values.

[<p>The 2018 Lincoln MKT still boasts the same odd proportions, overwrought <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> winged grille, and peculiar rear-end styling that have proved unappealing to the general public. Yet behind this Lincoln's styling turnoffs is a vehicle that actually offers some advantages in the luxury-crossover-SUV space. It can seat seven passengers comfortably, and there's generous cargo room behind the snug 3rd-row seats. You can order the MKT with the much praised 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost engine. Unlike the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery/">Land Rover Discovery</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gx/">Lexus GX</a>, the 2018 MKT is not meant to be an off-roader, its available all-wheel drive geared more toward foul-weather situations. Instead, think of this big Lincoln as a competitor to <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx60/">Infiniti QX60</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/enclave/">Buick Enclave</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln MKT comes with a lot features you expect in a luxury-crossover SUV, including a powerful V6 engine and room for up to seven passengers. It also can cost considerably less than many of its competitors, sometimes by thousands of dollars.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkt/">Lincoln MKT</a>'s styling has been a lodestone since it debuted, with the big grille, weird rear end, and bulbous look never catching on. The rear-seat headroom is also tight for tall passengers, and its size means it's hard to maneuver in parking lots.</p>, <p>No major changes this year, with only a change in a few paint colors marking the model changeover.</p>, <p>When equipped with the potent twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6, the 2018 Lincoln MKT has no problems with acceleration, passing or merging. Yet dial it back and just relax, and the MKT proves itself to be a good cruiser, with a comfortable ride, nicely weighted steering with good feedback, and strong brakes. If anything, the base model is too soft and leans too much in corners, but the EcoBoost models with all-wheel drive get Lincoln Drive Control, which firms things up. LDC also offers modes for Sport, Comfort and Normal throttle modes, but it's hard to tell the difference. The excellent 6-speed automatic is a good match for both the turbocharged and non-turbo engines, boasting quick shifts on its own or when using the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. Since there's no around-view camera like you'd get on an Infiniti QX60, we strongly recommend the rearview camera and parking sensors.</p>, <p>ECOBOOST V6 ENGINE<br>
Considering the MKT's size and weight, the 365-horsepower twin-turbo V6 engine is a no-brainer. It costs about $4,500 more than the base model, but comes standard with all-wheel drive, additional luxury features, and virtually no fuel-economy penalty.<br>
<br>
INNOVATIVE INTERIOR<br>
It's a shame the MKT's exterior is such a barrier, because the interior is quite nice. The seats are handsome, and the dash and control layout is both attractive and easy to operate. You can even get a refrigerator between the 2nd-row captain's chairs, and a power-folding third row.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 MKT boasts a spacious interior that’s easily competitive on space with other large 3-row luxury SUVs. Front and middle-row passengers are treated like royalty, with plenty of leg-, head- and elbow room, and a touch-screen infotainment system. The third row isn't quite as spacious, and should be reserved for kids or smaller adults. You can replace the 2nd-row bench with heated and cooled captain's chairs, and even outfit the MKT with a refrigerator between them. The big windows give the driver and passengers a commanding view outside, and the seats fold quickly for a flat floor and generous cargo space.</p>, <p>Surprisingly, the bulbous and curvy Lincoln MKT shares its underpinnings and chassis with the boxy <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/flex/">Ford Flex</a>. While the Lincoln is certainly eye-catching, we'll let you decide if it's pleasing or punishing to the eyes. Let's just call it "distinctive," especially the massive winged grille, the squinting headlights, and the oddly kinked droop of the side-window line. The massive hatch gets gracelessly bisected by the long wide taillights. At least the hatch is powered, and we'll admit we like the big panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>Even the base-model 2018 Lincoln MKT comes nicely equipped, with leather on the first and second rows, 3-zone automatic climate control, heated and cooled driver and front-passenger seats, heated 2nd-row seats, a rearview camera and a power tailgate. The steering wheel features power tilt-and-telescope adjustment, which along with the power-adjustable pedals makes it easy for drivers to find a comfortable driving position. The standard audio system offers 10 speakers and AM/FM/CD/aux inputs, all controlled via the touch-based Sync 3 system and 8-inch screen. Get the EcoBoost engine and you get standard all-wheel drive, Lincoln Drive Control adjustable chassis dynamics, and more.</p>, <p>The easiest way to load up the 2018 Lincoln MKT is to select the EcoBoost-equipped version. That adds things like a heated steering wheel, navigation system, THX II audio, and a dual-screen DVD rear-seat entertainment system. You can replace the 2nd-row bench with two captain's chairs, and even put a refrigerator between them. Also available are a panoramic roof and a power-folding third row. Available active-safety features include adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and blind-spot monitoring. There are also inflatable seatbelts available for the second row. We like the Active Park Assist, which performs the bulk of parallel parking for the driver.</p>, <p>The base-model 2018 Lincoln MKT gets a naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V6 powering the front wheels (FWD). It puts out 303 horsepower, which results in okay acceleration and passing power, but isn't particularly exciting. The better option is the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6. With 365 horsepower, 350 lb-ft of torque, and standard all-wheel drive (AWD), the EcoBoost works perfectly for the luxury-equals-power crowd. Either engine comes with a 6-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift mode. Both engines can run on 87-octane gasoline, but Lincoln says you should use 91 octane in the EcoBoost for best performance. EcoBoost versions can be equipped to tow up to 4,500 pounds.<br>
<br>
 3.7-liter V6<br>
 303 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm<br>
 278 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/24 mpg (FWD)<br>
<br>
 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6<br>
 365 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm<br>
 350 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-5,250 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/21 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The least expensive 2018 Lincoln MKT features the non-turbo engine, front-wheel drive, and carries a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) tag just under $44,500, including the $925 destination charge. If you want the extra power from that EcoBoost engine -- and let's face it, you really do -- you'll need just under $50,000. That's a big step, but it adds all-wheel drive and more luxury features. A fully loaded Lincoln MKT can run right about the $60,000 mark, splitting the difference between luxury-SUV models as the Buick Enclave, Infiniti QX60 and Acura MDX on the lower end, and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> on the high end. Before buying, check out the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price, which tells you what others in your area paid for the MKT. In the long term, we expect the MKT's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> to be lower than that of its competitors.</p>]

[<p>While the 2018 Lincoln MKX still wears an older version of the signature <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> grille and front-end treatment, it’s far from obsolete. This 5-passenger <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV offers a softer side that is increasingly difficult to find in competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-pace/">Jaguar F-Pace</a>, midsize luxury SUVs that sometimes sacrifice a smooth ride in the name of aggressive handling. The MKX isn’t large enough to accommodate big families, but it is ideal for those seeking a modestly sized mode of personal transportation. Loaded with such premium features as 22-way-adjustable front seats and a Revel 19-speaker audio system, the 2018 Lincoln MKX knows how to pamper its passengers while still offering acceptable levels of performance and handling expected of this class.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a luxury-crossover SUV that doesn’t demand an exorbitant price simply because of the symbol on its key fob, take a test drive in a 2018 Lincoln MKX. Powerful, competent and reasonably priced, the MKX offers a uniquely American take on luxury.</p>, <p>If your idea of a luxury SUV is one that rides and handles like a sports car, the 2018 MKX probably won't satisfy in the way a BMW X5 or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> AMG GLC 43 can. The MKX doesn’t offer a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model, and its resale numbers are far from great.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Lincoln MKX now comes standard with the Lincoln Way app and Lincoln Connect. Black Label models get last year’s Climate Package (heated rear seats, heated steering wheel, rain-sensing wipers, auto high beams and windshield-wiper de-icer) as standard equipment.</p>, <p>When equipped with the 355-horsepower twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter GTDI V6, the 2018 Lincoln MKX is quite a sizzling performer. Having more than 100 lb-ft additional torque versus the standard 3.7-liter V6, the turbo engine delivers the kind of power required to move this 4,300-pound SUV with urgency, especially when passing or merging. We also prefer the turbocharged engine for its fuel economy, which is actually better than the less powerful base engine. As much fun as the MKX is in a straight line, however, it isn’t as dialed-in when the road starts to bend. The ride is comfortable, the steering is firm but still a bit vague, and there’s more lean than in an <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx70/">Infiniti QX70</a>. The best situation for the MKX and its occupants is long-distance cruising where comfort is paramount.</p>, <p>2.7-LITER TWIN-TURBOCHARGED GTDI V6<br/> The 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged V6 in the MKX is a wonderful engine that delivers more horsepower and torque than the base 3.7-liter V6, yet actually delivers the same or better fuel economy. The engine’s ample low-end torque helps move the MKX with authority.<br/> <br/> 22-WAY POWER-ADJUSTABLE MASSAGING SEATS<br/> The 2018 Lincoln MKX displays its luxury credentials with overkill, and that’s just what a <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a> should do. An available set of 22-way power-adjustable seats can not only find the ideal driving position, they can heat, cool and even massage their occupants.<br/> </p>, <p>Elegant color combinations and high-quality materials like supple leather on the seats and aluminum-and-wood accents highlight the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkx/">Lincoln MKX</a> for 2018. The huge Panoramic Vista Roof gives the interior a light, airy feel. The Lincoln MKX's second row is pleasantly roomy, and with nearly 40 inches of rear-seat legroom (even more in front), it's easy to stretch out. The hub of the center stack is the new Sync 3 system, which uses an 8-inch touch screen to control Bluetooth, audio, climate and navigation. Optional on Select and Reserve trims are two available Revel audio systems.</p>, <p>The overall shape of Lincoln’s 2018 MKX luxury SUV is similar to that of its kin, the previous-generation <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/edge/">Ford Edge</a>, but there are some styling cues that separate the two. The MKX employs a split grille, plus generous use of LED lighting. The MKX comes standard with 18-inch wheels, which can be upped to 20- or 21-inch wheels with Lincoln's top-of-the-line Black Label. In addition to a choice of interior themes, it adds exclusive paint colors and badges to the MKX's exterior.</p>, <p>Included in the base price of the Lincoln MKX (Premiere trim) are cool features like LED taillights and a reverse-sensing system, plus heated side mirrors. Also heated is the standard 10-way-power driver seat. A media hub is included, as are Sync 3, a 9-speaker audio system and a rearview camera. Other standard niceties include a particulate air-filtration system, remote start, torque-vectoring control and curve control.</p>, <p>Options for the MKX include the Revel audio systems with up to 19 speakers. The huge Panoramic Vista Roof. Front seats that aren't just heated and cooled, but also are 22-way-adjustable and have seat massagers. Voice-activated navigation. The Driver Assist package adds lane-departure warning and lane-keeping aid, adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning with active braking and more. Then there's the Lincoln Black Label, a trim level that's treated like an exclusive membership. You get a personal liaison, complimentary car washes, free annual detailing, vehicle <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/pickup/">pickup</a> and drop-off for service, and access to the Culinary Experience at restaurants with acclaimed chefs.</p>, <p>Lincoln offers two engine choices for the 2018 MKX luxury SUV. First is the tried-and-true 3.7-liter V6, which is the standard powerplant. Pony up an additional $2,000 and you can get a 2.7-liter twin-turbo GTDI V6 offering 32 more horsepower than in the 3.7-liter V6, 102 more lb-ft of torque with no fuel-efficiency penalty. In fact, the EcoBoost engine meets or beats the 3.7-liter's fuel economy, whether the MKX is front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD). Both engines come with a 6-speed automatic transmission.<br>

Move up to the Select trim and the price begins closer to $43,000, while the Reserve's starting-off point comes in right around $46,500. The top-of-the-line Black Label starts at over $54,000, and can top out over $67,000. Opting for the turbocharged engine adds $2,000 no matter what trim. The 2018 MKX's base price is higher than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rdx/">Acura RDX</a>, on par with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/xt5/">Cadillac XT5</a>, but below the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/xc60/">Volvo XC60</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rx/">Lexus RX</a> and Audi Q5.

[<p>The 2018 Lincoln MKZ is the midsize-luxury sedan with a distinctively American twist regarding what a luxury car should be. While its powerful engine options and high-tech features help it keep pace with cars like the Audi A4, the MKZ’s styling, interior design, ride and handling all cater to those who appreciate a competent car with a more luxurious feel. The MKZ offers the option of all-wheel drive, as well as a hybrid version at no extra cost. The sum total of all its parts gives the MKZ an upscale feel more distinctive than in a Cadillac ATS or Lexus ES 350. For the money, it’s hard to beat what this stylish Lincoln offers, and that may just be the MKZ’s most appealing feature.</p>, <p>If your idea of a luxury car is one that pampers its passengers with the latest technology, impresses with its sophisticated design and delivers good power and handling without compromising ride comfort, the 2018 Lincoln MKZ or MKZ Hybrid deserves a good look.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a performance machine on par with the BMW 3 Series or Cadillac ATS, the 2018 Lincoln MKZ isn’t going to get your juices flowing. The MKZ’s resale value isn’t as good as some rivals, nor is its dealer network as exclusive.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln MKZ carries over with no major changes of note.</p>, <p>The 2018 MKZ isn’t some Ford clone wearing a Lincoln badge, it is a truly exceptional sedan that when equipped with the available 400-horsepower/400-lb-ft-of-torque twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6, will take your breath away. While ride and handling in the turbocharged 2.0-liter car are clearly geared for comfort over aggressive cornering, the 3.0-liter version equipped with the optional Driver’s package makes time spent behind the wheel noticeably more engaging. The package includes Lincoln’s Dynamic Torque Vectoring that works by adjusting the amount of torque going to each wheel, thus improving cornering and traction. Also part of the package is Lincoln’s adjustable-shock setup with driver-selectable Comfort, Normal and Sport settings. The MKZ’s steering feel isn’t as heavy or precise as with a BMW or Infiniti sedan, but it’s not far from the experience behind the wheel of a Lexus, Volvo or Acura.</p>, <p>PUSH-BUTTON SHIFT<br>
 In keeping with its high-tech luxury theme, the 2018 Lincoln MKZ replaces the traditional manual shift lever with a series of dash-mounted buttons. As with all new technology, Lincoln has built in safeguards to keep accidental gear changes from occurring should one inadvertently bump the panel.<br>
<br>
 LINCOLN DRIVE CONTROL<br>
 Lincoln Drive Control permits the driver more control over the car’s handling via a 3-mode setting for the shocks, transmission shift points, traction control, throttle and steering inputs. The settings for Normal, Sport or Comfort are self-explanatory and actually work as promised.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While we generally like the exterior styling, the 2018 Lincoln MKZ's interior still gets mixed reviews. Seating material with Lincoln logos imprinted on the faux-leather grace the base model, separated by a new center console with proper knobs and switches marking a vast improvement over the previous generation’s capacitive-feedback setup. MyLincoln Touch is also gone, replaced by an improved Sync 3 system. Despite being a large car on the outside, this Lincoln's interior is somewhat cramped. Rear-seat legroom is pretty good, but for the tall, headroom can be in short supply.</p>, <p>The 2018 Lincoln MKZ wears the bold new face of Lincoln, modeled after the company’s flagship Continental sedan. While the new grille bears more than a passing resemblance to Jaguar’s signature grille, it works to make the MKZ look more of a player in this league. Although based on the Ford Fusion, Lincoln has done an admirable job with the MKZ's styling, giving it an upscale flair that its broader-market sibling lacks. The MKZ is loaded with simple but clever features such as the capless-fuel-filler system, which allows you to refill without getting your hands dirty, or forgetting the fuel cap.</p>, <p>Lincoln has positioned itself as a value-oriented luxury brand, and there's no doubt that the Lincoln MKZ for 2018 is stuffed with a lot of equipment for the price. There are heated front seats, faux-leather upholstery, an adaptive suspension, adaptive HID headlights, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and an 11-speaker audio system. There's also Sync 3 that uses an 8-inch display and voice-recognition software to control a wide variety of functions. Each MKZ also comes with eight airbags, stability control, and Lincoln's SOS Post-Crash Alert System that activates the horn and hazard lights in the event of an airbag deployment.</p>, <p>Three equipment groups are offered with Lincoln’s 2018 MKZ sedan. Premier is the standard-issue car, but the Select group adds leather seating, a power-steering column and rear-seat USB ports. The top-line Reserve group adds navigation with voice recognition, blind-spot information and ventilated front seats. Individual options include heated rear seats, a THX II-certified 14-speaker sound system, and your choice of moonroofs, including a panoramic roof. A Technology package adds adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and Active Park Assist. The Black Label Series brings a personal touch, with your own shopping concierge, additional paint colors and four unique interior-design layouts.</p>, <p>A turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder serves as the base engine choice in the 2018 Lincoln MKZ; a hybrid powertrain can be had at no additional cost if you prefer mpg over mph. Also on the roster is a 400-horsepower 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (350 horsepower on front-drive cars), and its performance advantage over the base 4-cylinder is dramatic. Both conventional powerplants are matched with a 6-speed automatic, while the hybrid variant directs power through a continuously variable transmission. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, with all-wheel drive (AWD) restricted to non-hybrid models.<br>

All-wheel drive adds another $2,000. A fully optioned MKZ Black Label can approach $62,000, but most buyers will be happy with a well-equipped Reserve trim that tops out around $50,000. These numbers put a 2018 MKZ Reserve on par with the Lexus ES, but still less than a loaded BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class or Audi A4. While the majority of entry-level luxury sedans undercut the MKZ’s starting price, most also fail to offer a comparable level of standard equipment.

[<p>The all-new 2018 Lincoln Navigator isn't just the best Navigator ever, it may be the best vehicle <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> currently makes. Why? Because it's completely distinct from its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> counterpart, the Expedition.

Safety upgrades include active cruise control, lane-keeping assist, lane-departure warning, and a 360-degree-view camera system. The Black Label models offer unique touches, like "themed" interior treatments that include blue-on-white Yacht Club, or brown-on-brown Destination.</p>, <p>The only available engine is a 450-horsepower version of Ford's excellent 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6. It's a lot of power, more than the Expedition, and the Lincoln puts it to good use through a 10-speed automatic transmission. While not exactly sports-car quick, the powerful V6 makes short work of acceleration from a dead stop, or zipping around slower traffic on the freeway. It can even tow up to 8,700 pounds when properly equipped. Unlike a lot of high-end engines, this one doesn't require premium fuel. For a full-size SUV, fuel economy is also pretty solid, ranging from 21-23 mpg on the highway, depending on model.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/maserati/ghibli/2018
[<p>The 2018 Maserati Ghibli is the gateway into the Italian exotic brand. Starting around $75,000, however, there’s little that’s “entry level” about it. This luxury sedan packs a Ferrari-built twin-turbo V6, follows the performance-car tradition of being rear-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is optional), and features fine Italian craftsmanship inside and out. But this Maserati’s biggest boast is that it’s a Maserati. Attaining one means you can finally say you drive a Maserati. That’s the good news. The flip side is that you can get faster, more technically advanced and simply more rewarding sedans like a V8-powered BMW 5 Series or Mercedes-AMG E 43 for less money. And for about the same starting price, you can get its slightly smaller -- but far more powerful -- cousin, the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio.</p>, <p>If exclusivity, Italian flair and being able to boast that you drive a Maserati mean more to you than horsepower figures or lap times, then the Ghibli is probably the new Maserati you’ve been waiting for (and/or the one you can afford).</p>, <p>Just because it’s a Maserati doesn’t mean it’s blazing fast or even all that rewarding to drive. In reality, a sub-$40,000 base Alfa Romeo Giulia will beat a standard Ghibli to 60 mph, all while packing its own Italian style. A more mainstream BMW M550i may lack Maserati’s cachet, but it will roast a Ghibli off the starting line. Moreover, either of these potential rivals is simply more enjoyable to drive.</p>, <p>The Maserati Ghibli receives a substantial makeover for 2018 that includes increased horsepower (to 424) for Ghibli S models, electric power steering, interior and exterior styling updates, and a suite of active driving and safety features. Two trims are also introduced -- the luxury-oriented GranLusso and the sportier GranSport.</p>, <p>With 345 horsepower in base form or 424 in the more potent Ghibli S, this Maserati sedan certainly has the beans to be quick. The quickest, no, but enough to hit 60 mph in 5.5 seconds for the former and down to 4.7 seconds for the latter. Its powertrain and exhaust also make addicting sounds while doing so, and this engine can brag of being made by corporate cousin Ferrari. Shifts are smooth via the standard ZF 8-speed automatic transmission. These numbers look good, but in reality, we found the Ghibli just doesn’t quite stack up, especially for its price. Power is there, but so is turbo lag to get to that point. The suspension is firm, especially if you opt for the stiffer sport setup. Steering has been improved thanks to the new EPS system, but it still doesn’t measure up to the best. Put together, the Ghibli just doesn’t have the performance cohesiveness or provide the overall driving satisfaction of more mainstream rivals like the BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS, Mercedes-Benz E-Class or Audi A6.</p>, <p>ACTIVE SAFETY FEATURES<br>
 For 2018 the Ghibli offers a well-rounded roster of safety and driving aids, including adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, lane-keeping assist, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and an active blind-spot monitor that can help steer the car away in the event of a potential collision.<br>
<br>
 ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
 If you want a Maserati but live where snow and slick roads are part of life, turn your attention to the 2018 Ghibli S Q4. In addition to the more powerful engine, you’ll get traction-enhancing all-wheel drive (AWD) vs. the standard rear-wheel drive (RWD).<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Since its inception a few years ago, the Maserati Ghibli has featured an interior that on one hand flaunts supple leather, elegant Italian craftsmanship and various other nice touches. Other details, such as buttons and switches from the parts bin of its Fiat Chrysler parent, were far less impressive. While examples of those latter traits remain, updates have addressed some of those issues. The new GranLusso trim features a silk interior from Italian fashion icon Ermenegildo Zegna. Last year’s introduction of the 8.4-inch central touch screen found in other Chrysler group cars -- here with a Maserati-specific interface -- helped bolster the Ghibli’s infotainment appeal with features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. The front seats are plush and well-padded, but rear-seat room remains on the tighter side. At 17.7 cubic feet, the trunk has ample room.</p>, <p>The Ghibli skin has also been tweaked for 2018, with GranLusso and GranSport variants featuring distinctive bumper designs. Both of those new trims also receive full LED headlights. A nice new touch is the option of soft-close doors. The majority of the Ghibli’s design remains an appealing blend of voluptuous curves and distinctive design elements like a concave grille with the Maserati trident logo prominently in the middle. The upward-rising sill of the rear doors stands out on the outside but can limit visibility within. Quad tailpipes at the rear emphasize the Ghibli’s performance nature.</p>, <p>With a price tag starting over $75,000, it’s little surprise that the 2018 Ghibli brings much more than the intrinsic appeal of its Maserati image. Among its standard highlights are leather interior, heated and 12-way power-operated front seats, sunroof, power-adjustable steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, universal garage/gate opener, 19-inch wheels, and blind-spot monitoring system. The Ghibli’s infotainment system uses an 8.4-inch display that can be controlled via touch or a rotary controller and features navigation and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone integration. Standard audio bundles an 8-speaker/280-watt AM/FM/CD system with USB/SD/aux inputs and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>, <p>The Ghibli S comes with the more potent version of the V6 engine, as does the Ghibli S Q4, which signifies all-wheel drive. The new Ghibli GranLusso trim adds luxurious amenities such as extended leather interior trim with silk inserts, open-pore wood trim, ventilated front seats, heated steering wheel with wood inserts, power-operated rear sun blind, and upgraded harman/kardon audio system. The sportier GranSport stands apart with steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles and Skyhook electric damping suspension (both optional on other trims), 20-inch wheels with summer performance tires, and sport-design seats. Options available across trims include a Bowers &amp; Wilkins audiophile sound system, soft-close doors, hands-free power trunk, power-adjustable foot pedals, and in-car Wi-Fi hotspot with 1-year trial. The Driver Assistance Package includes important safety and driving aids like adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, active blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, surround-view camera system, and forward-collision warning system with automatic emergency braking.</p>, <p>All versions of the Ghibli are powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 designed by Maserati and built by Ferrari. The engine comes in two states of tune. Base models make 345 horsepower, while the Ghibli S now puts out 424 horsepower, a 20-unit improvement over last year’s model. All models feature an 8-speed automatic transmission and a mechanical limited-slip differential. All-wheel drive is only available on the higher-powered Ghibli S model. Even in its stronger form, the Ghibli is hardly the most powerful luxury-sports sedan out there, but it’s still respectable. All models use an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle to save fuel. Speaking of, with a high of 24-mpg highway, the Ghibli isn’t exactly an efficiency champ.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/24 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Maserati Ghibli starts just over $75,000 once you factor in the $1,250 destination fee. The higher-power Ghibli S begins over $80,000, and the all-wheel-drive Ghibli S Q4 starts over $83,000. Options, including the GranLusso or GranSport trims, can add thousands to these prices. Befitting its exotic badge, the Maserati Ghibli’s prices are higher than mainstream luxury-midsize sedans such as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Lexus GS, all of which arguably offer more value for the money, if not the cachet and exotic appeal that go with the Maserati badge. Those brands also have far wider dealer networks, something to keep in mind for both the initial purchase and future maintenance needs. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new luxury-sports sedan. The Maserati Ghibli’s resale value has trailed that of more mainstream brands, and is far below that of the Lexus GS.</p>]

[<p>Mazda’s 2018 CX-3 is by far the most athletic and fun-to-drive entry in the subcompact-SUV field. Sure, you’ll find more interior space in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a>, and more features for less money in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/soul/">Kia Soul</a>, but neither has the CX-3’s impressive handling or upscale interior. The CX-3 also offers the option of all-wheel drive, something you can’t get with the Soul. The sporty <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500x/">Fiat 500X</a> might also seem a good comparison, but the similarities end when it comes to resale and reliability ratings. Interior space aside, the CX-3 triumphs in the areas of styling, handling, price, safety and resale. For those who love everything about the CX-3 but need more room, a step up to the larger CX-5 may prove a satisfactory solution.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a subcompact with an all-weather drivetrain, racy good looks and exemplary ride and handling characteristics, we think Mazda’s 2018 CX-3 deserves a test drive. While not big on back-seat legroom, with the rear seats folded down, the CX-3 offers a decent amount of cargo space.</p>, <p>If you need maximum interior room, the Honda HR-V or Kia Soul is a more appealing choice. Tech fans will find the CX-3’s infotainment system isn’t as up-to-date as its rivals, while those planning light off-road adventures will probably be better off in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> Trailhawk.</p>, <p>As part of its standard equipment, the 2018 CX-3 gains Mazda’s Smart City Brake Support. New options this year include a heated steering wheel, full-color Active Driving Display and a power driver’s seat with memory. Revisions to the CX-3’s suspension improve handling and comfort while reducing road noise.</p>, <p>While no speed demon, the subcompact CX-3 reminds us that adept handling and communicative steering can be just as satisfying as an abundance of horsepower. Although a few competitors are quicker to reach 60 mph, the CX-3 can make the dash in around eight seconds, putting it well ahead of the Honda HR-V and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/c-hr/">Toyota C-HR</a>. Once the road starts to turn and twist, however, Mazda’s CX-3 leaves all comers in the rearview mirror. We wish <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mazda/">Mazda</a> offered the slick 6-speed manual from the Mazda3, but the standard multi-gear automatic does a good job getting power to the wheels when needed. Opt for the GT trim and you’ll gain steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. The CX-3’s handsome but snug interior outclasses everything in the segment, but the touch-screen setup that locks out touch controls once the car is in motion proved rather annoying.</p>, <p>UPSCALE FEATURES GALORE<br/> Mazda has a knack for making economical cars with upscale interiors, and the 2018 CX-3 subcompact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> is no exception. Standard features include push-button start, Mazda Connect infotainment and Smart City Brake Support, while the GT trims add Bose audio and adaptive LED headlights.<br/> <br/> STYLE BEYOND ITS PRICE<br/> With the CX-3, you’ll get a modestly priced subcompact SUV with styling that could just as easily be found on a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volvo/">Volvo</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a>. Drawing from Mazda’s “Kodo” design language, the CX-3’s long hood, short overhangs, curvaceous body and stunning interior make for one very attractive package.<br/> </p>, <p>Even in its Sport model, the monotone black-cloth upholstery looks good, and upping the ante to the Touring model's Leatherette and Lux Suede or the Grand Touring model's leather/Lux Suede seats with second-color piping sweetens the deal into <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> territory. With the GT you also get soft-stitched material over the gauge hood. The cockpit is geared toward the driver in what Mazda calls its "Head-up Cockpit" concept. The gauges themselves are housed in a well-defined nacelle, and the iPad-like infotainment system includes text-message audio delivery, voice command, and apps like Aha and Stitcher, with the screen fashionably mounted atop the dash.</p>, <p>Mazda designer Ken Saward says the goal of the CX-3’s exterior is a car that is “genuinely beautiful while practical.” No question that Mazda nailed the "beautiful" part. The coupe-like cabin and long hood evoke classically sporty proportions, and the flowing lines and distinctive grille all look good here. It looks all the world like a slightly raised Mazda3 5-door <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a>. However, with only 168.3 in. of overall length and 60.7 in. of height, the little CX-3 misses the mark when it comes to the "practical" part, as it offers less interior and cargo space than many of its competitors.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Mazda CX-3 comes equipped with a 2.0-liter Skyactiv-G engine connected to a 6-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift Sport mode. The Mazda Connect infotainment system is also standard, and includes a dash-mounted 7-inch monitor with a rearview camera, voice command, and multi-function dial control that looks like it's straight out of a European luxury car. Also on the list is Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, push-button start, USB input, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, cruise control, power windows and door locks and keyless entry. Newly standard is Mazda’s Smart City Brake Support that can automatically apply the brakes at speeds under 19 mph.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available across the board on the CX-3, but most features are added through trim levels. The mid-level CX-3 Touring adds automatic climate control, rain-sensing wipers, 18-inch wheels, heated exterior mirrors, moonroof, blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert plus Leatherette with Lux-Suede seats. Grand Touring models get leather and Lux Suede seats, a moonroof, LED headlights, fog lights, navigation and Bose audio, plus paddles on the steering wheel to shift the automatic transmission. Grand Touring models offer the GT Premium Package that includes Mazda Radar Cruise Control, Smart Brake Support, a power driver’s seat and heated steering wheel.</p>, <p>There's only one engine and transmission combination available for the front- or all-wheel-drive (FWD, AWD) 2018 Mazda CX-3: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder putting out 146 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. But there's a lot of technology built into that engine, such as the lofty 13.0:1 compression ratio. Once, numbers like that were for hot rods looking for the most horsepower. But in the CX-3, it's all about fuel economy, and part of the Skyactiv system that has become as indelible a part of Mazda's marketing as red cars. Good news: It works, with the CX-3 returning very good fuel economy. Just note that even when you manually shift the 6-speed automatic, the CX-3 is far from quick, although it makes the most of its power.<br>

On the other end of the spectrum, the Grand Touring starts just over $26,000, which is a little more than the top-line HR-V, but the Mazda offers more equipment. All-wheel drive adds about $1,200 to the price of any CX-3.

[<p>Among the vast field of compact-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> roaming the freeways, there’s one that offers an exceptional combination of styling, economy and sports-car-like driving dynamics. It’s the 2018 Mazda CX-5, and if you’re shopping this segment it’s an SUV you’ll definitely want to test-drive. From its sleek styling to its handsome interior, the CX-5 feels far more premium than its $25,000 asking price might suggest. There’s a new diesel model coming this year, as well as an advanced gasoline engine with cylinder deactivation, a first for a 4-cylinder car in North America. And of course, there’s the CX-5 generous equipment roster that includes such amenities as a Bose audio system, a power tailgate and a full suite of driver-safety and collision-avoidance systems.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUV</a> that rides and handles like a sporty <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> (think Mazda3), the 2018 Mazda CX-5 stands above all rivals. Excellent fuel economy from an available diesel engine further separates the CX-5 from the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue/">Nissan Rogue</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a compact SUV with a big interior and/or the ability to venture off-road, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a> is a better choice. Diesel fans can get on a waiting list, or stop by a Chevy dealer and pick up a diesel-powered Equinox right now.</p>, <p>Changes for the 2018 Mazda CX-5 include the addition of cylinder deactivation for the 2.5-liter engine and more features added to each trim. The Sport gains blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic detection, while the Touring gets the full i-ACTIVSENSE suite of safety assists (now optional on the Sport).</p>, <p>We’ve always considered the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a> to be one of the most spirited and enjoyable-driving compact-crossover SUVs money can buy. While not the quickest or most powerful in its class, the CX-5 has enough muscle to make it feel swift when accelerating from a stop or merging with fast-moving traffic. The CX-5’s beauty lies in its agility and nimbleness. If you’re the type of driver who prefers twisting back roads to vast expanses of freeway, the CX-5 is the SUV you’ll want. Feedback from the taut steering never feels too heavy or artificial, and the CX-5’s Sport mode helps deliver better response from the engine. The ride is firm, but not harsh, something to keep in mind if you prefer the softer ride of the Honda CR-V or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a>. Updates last year helped the suspension better absorb road imperfections without diminishing ride quality or comfort, and Mazda’s G-Vectoring Control is standard on every model.</p>, <p>SMART CITY BRAKE SUPPORT<br>
Active at speeds up to 19 mph, Mazda’s Smart City Brake Support can reduce or altogether prevent the damage incurred from a front-end collision. The system senses danger ahead and, if the driver fails to act, automatically applies the brakes. Best of all, it is standard on every 2018 CX-5.<br>
<br>
LANE-DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM<br>
Using sensors and a windshield-mounted camera to read the painted lane lines, this system helps alert the driver when the car is drifting from its lane. A low-pitched audible warning alerts the driver and if no action is taken, the system will gently pull the car back into its lane.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>All CX-5 models have two rows of seating for up to five passengers. Like its rivals, though, trying to fit three adults in back can be a squeeze. On the other end of the spectrum, installing child seats is now easier thanks to wide-opening rear doors. Mazda’s interiors feel a class-above: From the standard push-button start and 7-inch touch-screen display with command dial down to the elegant air vents surrounded by brightwork, this is one classy cabin. With 40/20/40-split rear seats folded, cargo room maxes out at just under 60 cubic feet -- nearly 16 less than a Honda CR-V.</p>, <p>The CX-5 has always been a fine-looking vehicle, but this latest version ups the ante to arguably the classiest in its segment. Thank the cues taken from its svelte big brother, the CX-9. Like that <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUV</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mazda/">Mazda</a>'s compact-crossover SUV begins with a prominent trapezoidal grille connected to fancy-looking -- and bright -- LED headlight slits and extends to a flowing "Kodo" design meant to invoke a "refined toughness." We think it works well. This is most true in the new Soul Red Crystal paint, a production color so deep and glossy that it'd do justice to an exotic sports car.</p>, <p>The 2018 CX-5 is offered in three main trims: Sport, Touring and Grand Touring. The least expensive CX-5 Sport model includes cloth seats, keyless entry with push-button start, 17-inch wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, electronic parking brake, the Smart City Brake Support active-safety system, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and rearview camera. The base infotainment system includes a 7-inch touch screen with 4-speaker AM/FM/HD Radio, twin USB inputs and an auxiliary port. To date Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not in the offing, but Mazda says the systems can be retroactively added later.</p>, <p>For less than $2,000 more, we recommend the mid-trim CX-5 Touring model, which replaces the base model's 6-way-manual driver's seat with a power-adjustable one and adds Leatherette, plus heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, two rear USB charging ports, rear privacy glass, auto-leveling headlights and the full i-ACTIVSENSE safety suite including adaptive cruise control, Smart Brake Support, lane-departure warning and assist, auto high beams and rain-sensing wipers. Grand Touring models add leather seating, 10-speaker Bose premium audio system and navigation. Further options include a head-up display, heated steering wheel and heated rear outboard seats.</p>, <p>To date, the 2018 Mazda CX-5 comes to showrooms with just one engine, the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder Skyactiv gasoline powerplant with cylinder deactivation. Tied to a 6-speed automatic transmission, the engine is neither the most powerful nor most efficient in its class, but it puts up respectable numbers, especially in fuel economy of up to 31 mpg. The standard setup is front-wheel drive (FWD), with all-wheel drive (AWD) optional. The CX-5 is rated to tow up to 2,000 pounds. After years in the making, Mazda says it will finally bring a diesel CX-5 to the U.S. market. The diesel model is set to use a 2.2-liter 4-cylinder that is touted for its torque and fuel efficiency. Stay tuned for our impressions on that one.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/31 mpg (FWD), 24/30 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The 2018 Mazda CX-5 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $25,125, including destination. The more recommendable Touring model, with its additional safety features and amenities, still offers a lot to like for $27,190. Top-line Grand Touring models begin at $30,620. Adding all-wheel drive to any model is an additional $1,300. Fully loaded, a 2018 CX-5 Grand Touring model dressed in Soul Red Crystal ($595) can reach past $34,000. At its starting price, the CX-5 is right in line with the Honda CR-V, slightly under the Toyota RAV4, and slightly above the Ford Escape and Nissan Rogue. A <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/tucson/">Hyundai Tucson</a> and Subaru Forester also start below the CX-5.

[<p>As Mazda’s largest and most powerful SUV, the 2018 CX-9 is also one of the industry’s most appealing 3-row family <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>. The CX-9’s styling is more seductive than better-known rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a>, and its interior is more alluring than some <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brands. But, it’s the way the 2018 Mazda CX-9 drives that makes it such a standout, with a light but rigid body and advanced features such as Mazda’s G-Vectoring technology that help improve the CX-9’s cornering ability. The CX-9’s turbocharged 4-cylinder engine is unique in this segment, offering good power and fuel economy, but a limited 3,500-pound tow rating. Being on the smaller side, the CX-9 does offer less interior room than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/explorer/">Ford Explorer</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevrolet Traverse</a>.</p>, <p>If your enthusiast-driving side is now in direct conflict with your growing family’s transportation needs, the 2018 Mazda CX-9 offers the best of both worlds. From its stunning styling to its near-luxury-like interior, the CX-9 is as impressive to stare at as it is to drive.</p>, <p>With seating limited to seven, the CX-9 isn’t the largest or most space-efficient family SUV one can buy. Tech fans won’t be happy with the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and those who need maximum towing ability will be better served by an a SUV with a V6 or V8.</p>, <p>Mazda’s 2018 CX-9 sees a number of improvements, starting with making Smart City Brake Support, rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot monitoring standard on every vehicle. A revised 2nd-row seat, G-Vectoring Control and additional standard equipment for the Sport and Touring trims round out the changes of note.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mazda/">Mazda</a> vehicles have always had a way of making a big splash on a tight budget, and the 2018 CX-9 is no exception. Offering superior ride and handling versus better-known rivals has always been the CX-9’s trump card, but now it’s backed by a stunning interior placing it in the same league as some premium luxury brands. Despite its size, the CX-9 feels amazingly light on its feet, with responsive steering and a suspension that begs to be pushed hard, especially when the road begins to twist and turn. Although the CX-9’s turbocharged 4-cylinder isn’t the most powerful engine in its class, its 310 lb-ft of torque are more than sufficient to rapidly move this SUV when needed. Mazda’s G-Vectoring Control minutely reduces torque, thus shifting more weight to the front wheels, which improves steering feel and traction. And while the CX-9’s ride is firmer than that of the Honda Pilot or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sorento/">Kia Sorento</a>, it is far from harsh.</p>, <p>PREMIUM APPEAL, MAINSTREAM PRICE<br/> The 2018 Mazda CX-9 blurs the lines between family vehicle and luxury cruiser. The top-of-the-line Signature trim features real rosewood accents and Nappa leather seating with styling that could just as easily have come from the studios at <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a>.<br/> <br/> HIGH TORQUE, HIGH EFFICIENCY<br/> Mazda’s SkyActiv-G turbocharged 4-cylinder engine isn’t the most powerful in this class, but its ability to generate 310 lb-ft of torque while simultaneously achieving 28 mpg on the highway makes it one of the most efficient.<br/> </p>, <p>All Mazda CX-9s have 3-row, 7-passenger seating. Adults fit fine in the second row, but the third row is best for kids. The front seats are roomy, and the area feels commanding thanks to a wide console. Nestled in that console is a rotary dial and auxiliary buttons controlling the CX-9's standard dash-mounted infotainment display. The view out front is good, and we like that the left windowsill is wide enough to rest an arm. The new CX-9 trails the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander in cargo room, but there's a respectable 71.2 cubic feet with the second and third rows folded.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a bit of elegance in your next family hauler, the CX-9 has it in spades. Dressed in Mazda's "Soul of Motion" design philosophy, the CX-9's sheet metal emphasizes sweeping forms, organic shapes and the idea of movement even at rest. We think it's beautiful. That big grille up front adds to the premium cred, yet doesn't seem overboard. The tapering roof and forward stance make this SUV appear smaller than it is, and even its rear is pretty thanks to a horizontal treatment of the taillights and rear lip beneath the window. A pair of exhaust outlets further emphasizes this SUV's sporty nature.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mazda CX-9 remains available in four trims: Sport, Touring, Grand Touring and Signature. Even the base Sport model offers amenities like 3-zone climate control that includes a 2nd-row control panel, 7-inch color touch-screen display with rotary controller, Smart City Brake Support (active at speeds up to 19 mph), blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, a rearview camera and 18-inch wheels. However, unless you opt for a package, you'll still have to manually adjust the front seats. Standard tech features include the Mazda Connect system with voice command, Internet radio streaming, Bluetooth connectivity, and AM/FM/HD Radio with an auxiliary input and two USB inputs. Sorry, CD fans -- a compact-disc player isn't even optional.</p>, <p>We recommend at least the Touring trim, which includes heated and power-operated front seats, leather trim, power liftgate with adjustable height setting, a larger 8-inch command screen and four USB ports. The Touring trim also comes with a significant active-safety system: Smart City Brake Support (optional on the Sport). Grand Touring trims include navigation, 12-speaker Bose audio, a moonroof and more safety/driving aids such as radar cruise control, backup sensors and lane-keeping assist (optional on other trims). Signature models have all-wheel drive standard, Nappa leather trim, rosewood accents and LED accent lighting in the grille. Many of the Touring and Grand Touring features are optional in packages on the Sport and Touring trims.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mazda CX-9 uses a small but potent 2.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder good for 227 horsepower and a whopping 310 lb-ft of torque. That low-end torque, combined with sophisticated plumbing for the turbo system, makes this engine feel plenty strong, like a V6 in disguise. You’ll see two horsepower figures: 250 is the max, running on harder-to-find 93 octane. Most drivers will opt for regular unleaded, on which the engine makes 227 horsepower. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is the standard setup, with all-wheel drive (AWD) optional and recommended if you live in a cold-weather state. All models use a 6-speed automatic transmission. The CX-9's towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, less than the 5,000-pound figure put up by the Highlander and Pilot, or the 7,400 figure of the Durango with the V8 engine.<br>

Touring trims bow at $35,900, and Grand Touring models start at $41,410. Adding AWD is an extra $1,800. The top-line Signature model that includes AWD standard starts at $45,255. At these prices, the new CX-9 begins slightly higher than rivals like the Highlander, Pilot, Traverse, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/acadia/">GMC Acadia</a> and Kia Sorento. But the price-to-features differential evens out or leans in the Mazda's favor as you climb trims. If you're simply looking for a low-priced 3-row SUV, there's the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mitsubishi/outlander/">Mitsubishi Outlander</a>, though that isn't as easy to recommend. Even harder, but it still exists, is the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/journey/">Dodge Journey</a>.

The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-9/">Mazda CX-9</a>'s <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> is expected to hold up well, though still trail the Highlander and Pilot.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/mazda/mazda3/2018
[<p>Playful and sophisticated, the 2018 Mazda3 is a fuel-efficient compact that’s one of the most fun-to-drive cars in its class. Available as a stylish 4-door sedan or a versatile 5-door <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a>, the new Mazda3 offers impressive standard features, many tech-based active safety systems and a refined interior. Three trim levels are available, Sport, Touring and Grand Touring. Sport models are powered by a 155-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, while the Touring and Grand Touring get a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that produces 184 horsepower. A 6-speed manual is standard but a far more popular 6-speed automatic transmission is available. Some of the Mazda’s rivals in the crowded compact segment are the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, VW Golf and Jetta, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a>, Chevy Cruze and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/impreza/">Subaru Impreza</a>.</p>, <p>If you want more than four wheels and a steering wheel. If you want to like your car. If you want to want your car. If you want to feel something when you drive your car. If you believe life is too short to drive an ugly car you’ll like the 2018 Mazda3.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for all-wheel drive, check out Mazda’s CX-3 <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> or shop Subaru’s Impreza. If have to have over 200 horsepower, the turbocharged VW GTI, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus%20st/">Ford Focus ST</a> and Honda Civic Si have the Mazda3 covered. The Civic also offers much more rear-seat legroom than the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mazda/">Mazda</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Mazda3 receives minor but significant updates. The 2.0-liter engine is no longer available in the Touring trim level. Touring models are now powered by the 2.5-liter also used in the Grand Touring. Also, Mazda’s Smart City Brake Support system is now standard on the Sport model.</p>, <p>Thanks to Mazda’s innovative Skyactiv powertrain and chassis design, the 2018 Mazda3 is both fun to drive and fuel-efficient. You’ll have to rev the engine high to get the most from its limited power, but the Mazda3’s precise steering, finely honed suspension and strong brakes assure a good time once up to speed. Unlike the VW GTI or Ford Focus ST, the Mazda3 sedan and hatchback don’t sacrifice a smooth, comfortable ride at the altar of great handling. The Mazda3 soaks up road irregularities well, even with the 18-inch wheels and tires of the top trim levels and it cruises well on the highway. The 6-speed manual is one of the best in the industry and is matched in efficiency and fun by the 6-speed automatic with manual mode. The Touring and Grand Touring’s 2.5-liter engine offers a bit more power with only a few miles-per-gallon sacrifice at the pump.</p>, <p>TOP SAFETY PICK+<br/> The Mazda3 may be Mazda’s smallest and least expensive model, but it has received the highest safety ratings for crash impact by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the <a alt_o_t="Insurance" href="/car-insurance/">Insurance</a> Institute for Highway Safety. The Mazda3 earned 5 Stars from NHTSA and a rating of Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS.<br/> <br/>  VERSATILE HATCHBACK BODY STYLE<u><br/> </u>Many compacts are only available as 4-door <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, but the sportier hatchback body style has made a recent resurgence in this class. The Mazda3 hatchback has one of the largest cargo volumes in the segment, 20.2 cubic feet of space behind the back seat and 47.1 cubic feet with the seats folded.<br/> </p>, <p>This is one of the best interiors in this class. The Mazda3’s cabin is warm and refined, with an upscale, expensive look and feel. All models feature a large 7-inch screen on the dash. It looks like a tablet, but it’s not a touch screen. Infotainment functions, like audio, phone, apps and navigation, are controlled by an easy-to- operate rotary knob on the console between the front seats, just like some <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brands. Seat comfort is high. Rear-seat legroom is a bit tight, but there’s room for two average-size adults, three in a pinch. All models have a 60/40-split-folding rear seat.</p>, <p>Mazda’s have always been fun to drive, but they haven’t always been beautiful. Today Mazda has righted that ship and its designs are some of the best. The 2018 Mazda3 is a looker, with athletic proportions, a large aggressive grille and the right combination of muscular, wind-shaped curves and sharp lines. The sexy Mazda3 sedan resembles the brand’s larger Mazda6, and its 5-door hatchback will win over those who don’t think a hatchback can be beautiful. For added aggression, Mazda offers the optional Appearance Package, which blacks out the Mazda3’s front spoiler, side sills, rear diffuser and mirrors.</p>, <p>Standard features on the 2018 Mazda3 Sport include electronic parking brake, the Mazda Connect infotainment system with 7-inch screen, 6-speaker audio with USB input, Bluetooth and audio streaming, rearview camera, push-button start, cruise control and Smart City Brake Support, which will brake for you in an emergency situation under 19 mph. If you go one trim higher, the Mazda3 Touring adds features such as blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat, and heated front seats. Grand Touring models bring a power sunroof, Bose audio, head-up display and perforated leather upholstery.</p>, <p>The Sport sedan’s Preferred Equipment package adds 16-inch alloy wheels, heated side mirrors, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, rain-sensing wipers and more. The Touring’s Popular Equipment package brings the Bose 9-speaker audio system, a rear spoiler, shark-fin antenna and a power sunroof. Touring and Grand Touring trims can be equipped with the iActivsense Safety suite, which adds a lane-departure warning system, lane-keep assist, active radar cruise control and high-beam headlight control, while the Grand Touring offers the Premium Equipment package that adds self-leveling LED headlights, adaptive front lighting, a heated steering wheel, paddle shifters and a navigation system.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mazda3 offers two engine choices, both with a Skyactiv pedigree. The Sport uses a 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes a healthy 155 horsepower. The 2.5-liter found in the Touring and top-tier Grand Touring variants, cranks out 184 horsepower. While the 2.0-liter is a capable performer, it trades a measure of enthusiasm for better fuel economy -- 37-mpg highway and 28-mpg city with the 6-speed automatic transmission, which costs $1,050. The 2.5-liter won’t stretch a gallon of gasoline quite as far, but it’s close and notably amps up the car’s sporting character. Both engines are smooth, vivacious and they like to rev. Manual-transmission lovers will appreciate that Mazda offers an excellent 6-speed manual in both body styles, and with both engines. All Mazda3 models are front-wheel drive.<br>

[<p>More fun to drive than many of its rivals, the stylish 2018 Mazda6 is a standout in the midsize family-sedan class. Mazda’s flagship sedan offers a sporty driving experience, fuel-efficient engines, an upscale interior and top safety ratings. For 2018 the Mazda6 gets a revised look, a new more powerful 250-horsepower 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, a retuned suspension for a more comfortable ride; wider, more comfortable seats; and improved infotainment features. With these important improvements the new Mazda6 is better equipped to compete with such popular rivals as the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima. A 6-speed automatic transmission works with both engines, but Mazda still offers a manual transmission with the base 184-horsepower 4-cylinder to satisfy enthusiasts. Four trim levels are available, with prices starting around $22,500.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a stylish and well-equipped midsize family sedan with top safety ratings, fuel-efficient engines and a well-earned reputation for reliability, you’ll like the new 2018 Mazda6. Buyers also appreciate the Mazda’s fun-to-drive dynamics and its upscale interior, which now features wider, more comfortable seats.</p>, <p>Its trunk isn’t as large as some of its rivals, and some may find the Mazda6’s rear legroom to be a little tight. Also, Mazda does not offer a hybrid or an all-wheel-drive version of the Mazda6. Hybrid shoppers should check out the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry hybrids. For all-wheel drive look at the Subaru Legacy and Ford Fusion.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Mazda6 is heavily revised with an updated exterior, a new more powerful 250-horsepower 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, a retuned suspension for a more comfortable ride; wider, more comfortable seats; an 8-inch infotainment display, and a 360-degree-view monitor. Ventilated seats are now available as is Radar Cruise Control with stop-and-go capability. </p>, <p>Mazda’s entire lineup has earned a reputation for exceptional driving dynamics and the 2018 Mazda6 lives up to the those expectations. This year Mazda has retuned the sedan’s suspension for improved handling and a smoother ride, and the results are impressive. The Mazda6 is more fun to drive than before, with class-leading cornering capability, but its ride is now far more refined. The standard 184-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is powerful enough for most buyers, but the newly available 250-horsepower turbocharged engine finally gives the new Mazda6 sports sedan acceleration and passing power. The engine, which is shared with the Mazda CX-9 SUV, is smooth with plenty of torque off the line and an entertaining punch at higher rpm. The 6-speed automatic transmission has fewer gears than many in the class, but it’s responsive and a good match for both engines, plus it has a Sport mode. And the Mazda’s steering is a favorite in the class, with just the right amount of assist and plenty of feel.</p>, <p>RADAR CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP AND GO<br>
 For 2018, this advanced cruise-control system is available on the new Mazda6. It not only maintains a safe predetermined distance from the vehicle ahead, it works at all speeds and features stop-and-go capabilities so it’ll apply the brakes and accelerate for you in heavy traffic conditions.<br>
<br>
 TOP SAFETY PICK+<br>
 The new 2018 Mazda6 is the brand’s largest and most expensive sedan and it has received the highest safety ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Mazda6 has earned 5 Stars from NHTSA and a rating of Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Mazda6's already-impressive interior has been further improved for 2018. It’s all new except for the 3-spoke steering wheel and a few small trim pieces. Mazda has redesigned the front seats, making them wider and more comfortable. The rear seats also get new padding for additional comfort, and a larger 8-inch infotainment screen is now standard. The system’s rotary-dial controller is retained. It works well enough, but a touch screen would be preferable. Overall, it’s still one of the best interiors in the class, with clean design, impressive materials and an upscale décor. On paper, the rear seat's 38.7 inches of legroom looks good, but in reality, the overall space can feel tight. Its 14.8 cubic feet of trunk space is also small for the class, but 60/40-split fold-down rear seats are standard.</p>, <p>For 2018 Mazda has tweaked the exterior design of the Mazda6 adding drama, strength and improved sound insulation. There’s a new grille that is more finely detailed and recessed, which gives the sedan a more aggressive face. Mazda has also reinforced the structure of the Mazda6, adding body reinforcements and thicker sheet metal to its rear wheelwells to keep more noise out of its cabin. The overall shape is sporty and athletic with voluptuous curves, a low roofline and a hunkered-down stance. Its long hood and muscular haunches add presence and give the Mazda the proportions of a more expensive luxury 4-door from BMW or Mercedes.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mazda6 is available in four trims: Sport, Touring, Grand Touring and Signature. A base Sport model with manual transmission comes with keyless entry and push-button start, cruise control, 60/40-split folding rear seats, the Mazda Connect infotainment system with 8-inch color touch-screen display, rearview camera and 6-speaker AM/FM/CD/HD Radio system with USB and auxiliary inputs, and Bluetooth streaming for phone and audio, plus blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Touring models have more features and standard active safety systems. Amenities include Leatherette seating, dual-zone climate control, power driver's seat, 19-inch wheels, auto on/off headlights and rain-sensing windshield wipers, and Smart City Brake Support.</p>, <p>With four trim levels to choose from, the 2018 Mazda6 can be outfitted as expensively as your wallet will allow. The Touring trim can be further outfitted with heated front seats, moonroof, 11-speaker Bose audio system and LED headlights. Grand Touring models get navigation, the Bose system, radar cruise control, perforated leather seats, a power-passenger seat, paddle shifters and illuminated grille. Grand Touring models can be further outfitted with lane-keep assist, high-beam control and memory-seat adjustment. The Premium package includes heated rear seats and steering wheel, Nappa leather-trimmed seats and interior brightwork. The new top-of-the line Signature trim level adds wood trim and suede on the dash, seats and doors.</p>, <p>The standard powerplant for the 2018 Mazda6 is the 2.5-liter Skyactiv-G gasoline 4-cylinder engine. It features a radical 13:1 compression ratio for greater efficiency, yet still runs on regular unleaded. Equally innovative are the Skyactiv-MT 6-speed manual transmission and the Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic. The latter employs aspects of both torque-converter and dual-clutch transmissions to deliver both excellent low-speed feel and admirably quick shifts. And it gets better fuel economy than the manual transmission. New this year is an available turbocharged 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, which is shared with the Mazda CX-9 SUV. It’s rated at 250 horsepower on 93-octane gasoline and 227 horsepower on less expensive 87-octane fuel. It’s available with the 6-speed automatic transmission only.<br>

The mid-trim Touring models we recommend begin just over $25,000. Opting for an automatic transmission on either is an extra $1,050. The Grand Touring model starts around $32,000 and can cross $34,000 with the Premium package, and the new Mazda6 Signature starts over $35,000. At these prices, the Mazda6 starts slightly lower than major competitors like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Nissan Altima and Subaru Legacy, and is in line with a Hyundai Sonata, which comes standard with an automatic transmission. As such, the Mazda6 is one of the best values in its segment. To be sure you're getting the best deal, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Mazda6's resale value is expected be mid-pack, trailing standouts like the Legacy, Camry and Accord.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/mazda/mx-5-miata/2018
[<p>The world’s best-selling sports car, the 2018 Mazda MX-5 is an affordable, rear-wheel-drive 2-seater that’s pure joy to drive. Available as a roadster or a coupe with a retractable roof panel, the new Mazda MX-5 in now in its fourth generation and competes with the Fiat 124, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/86/">Toyota 86</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/brz/">Subaru BRZ</a> and the V6-powered <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/370z/">Nissan 370Z</a>. Small, light and often referred to as the Mazda Miata, the MX-5 is nimble, quick and always ready for a drive up the coast or a blast on your favorite mountain road. Top down, of course. Prices start around $26,000 for the Miata Soft Top and around $32,500 for the MX-5 RF, which stands for Retractable Fastback. Both come standard with one of the best 6-speed manual transmissions in the business, but an automatic is available.</p>, <p>You’ll like the 2018 Mazda Miata because it’s cute, affordable and fun and you believe the journey is just as important as the destination. You buy this little sports car because you want it, not because you need it, and you’ll enjoy every minute you spend behind its leather-wrapped steering wheel.</p>, <p>For some the 2018 Miata is just too small and its 155 horsepower doesn’t pack enough of a punch. That’s why the world has Ford Mustangs and Chevy Camaros, two larger performance cars with back seats and optional V8s with gazillions of horsepower. The Subaru BRZ and Toyota 86 twins split the difference with tiny back seats and 205 horsepower.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Mazda Miata Soft Top’s available Brembo/BBS Recaro package now adds heated Recaro sport seats in addition to the Brembo brakes and BBS wheels. Also, buyers can choose between a black top or a new Dark Cherry soft top, and the Mazda Connect infotainment system is now standard on the base Sport model. The Miata RF Club gets standard heated seats, and the RF models with manual transmissions get standard keyless entry.</p>, <p>It’s best to get out on the road early, after the sun breaks the horizon, but before the throngs of SUVs create the inevitable clog and clutter. Put the top down. Feel that sun on your face and the warm breeze on nape of your neck. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/mx-5%20miata/">Mazda MX-5 Miata</a> has never been about gobs of power that enable it to drag-race. This Mazda's magic lies not in straight lines, but when the road twists and turns. That's when this rear-wheel-drive 2-seater is at its best, or when simply cruising along a coastal highway. The Mazda’s 155 horsepower doesn’t sound like much, but the 2.0-liter engine loves to rev and its output is more than enough in this lightweight little roadster. Wring its neck and zip through the gears of the Miata’s tight 6-speed manual transmission and it will hit 60 mph in about six seconds. The steering is quick, with plenty of feel, and the roadster’s suspension offers plenty of cornering grip while maintaining a civilized ride.</p>, <p>ADAPTIVE FRONT LIGHTING SYSTEM<br>
This available system actually turns the sports car’s headlights as you turn the steering wheel, helping you see better around turns at night. The Miata’s headlights pivot as much as 15 degrees, which doesn’t sound like much, but it makes all the difference when you’re attacking a dark twisty road.<br>
<br>
REAR CROSS-TRAFFIC ALERT<br>
Small roadsters like the 2018 Mazda Miata don’t have great rear visibility when the top is up. Backing out of a parking space can be treacherous, so we recommend the Miata’s available cross-traffic alert system, which warns you audibly and visually if a vehicle or pedestrian is approaching from either side.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Mazda MX-5 roadster has a simple, straightforward and modern interior. It's similar to the Mazda3 sedan and hatchback, with an upright infotainment screen on the dash, a push-button start button, and a surprising amount of soft-touch materials. Mazda says it literally designed the car around the driver, and the MX-5 offers excellent steering-wheel, pedal and shifter placement, though we wish the steering wheel telescoped in addition to tilting. Despite the small size, it's surprisingly accommodating for tall drivers, offering good headroom. There's even a usefully sized trunk, but as with the previous-gen model, interior space is at a premium.</p>, <p>After three generations of much of the same, Mazda’s designers had a little bit more fun with the styling of this latest 2018 MX-5 Miata. The profile keeps the classic long-hood/short-deck proportions, but the intricate surfacing of the panels is far more modern, and its flared wheelwells, squinted LED headlights and wide-mouth grille give it some attitude. Not too much. It’s still kinda cute and at only 154 inches long it remains quite small. With its top in place, the MX-5 RF is a sleek coupe, but don’t let those windows in the RF’s B-pillar fool you; they’re fakes. And with the power-operated center panel tucked away, it looks like nothing else new on the road outside of a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> Targa.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mazda Miata lineup is divided into three different models for the standard convertible -- Sport, Club and Grand Touring -- while the new MX-5 RF retractable fastback is divided into two -- Club and Grand Touring. All Miata convertibles come with LED headlights, push-button ignition, air conditioning, power windows and the world's easiest-to-use folding cloth top. It’s manual, but you can raise or lower it from the driver’s seat. Also standard is a 6-speed manual transmission. The 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system includes Bluetooth and a USB input. Cruise control is also standard, and the little steering wheel is packed with audio and cruise-control buttons. This year the Mazda Connect infotainment system has been made standard on the base Sport model.</p>, <p>While even a base 2018 Mazda Miata is a hoot, we recommend stepping up to the Club trim, which nets extra amenities and safety features, including blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and a Bose premium audio system with HD Radio and a secondary USB audio input. Manual-transmission versions come with a sport-tuned suspension with Bilstein shocks and limited-slip differential. Grand Touring models get leather upholstery, navigation, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated seats, and lane-departure warning. A 6-speed automatic transmission is optional on all versions. Club models can be equipped with higher-performance Brembo brakes, BBS wheels and leather Recaro seats for an additional $3,400.</p>, <p>The sole engine in the new 2018 Mazda MX-5 is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 155 horsepower. It comes standard with a slick 6-speed manual transmission, and even if you don't know how to drive stick, it's worth learning just so you can enjoy this one. The action is light, the shifts are short, and the clutch operation is simply spot-on. If you must, a 6-speed automatic is available; unfortunately, it adds a notable amount of weight, and despite the manual-shift mode, we still think it's worth getting the manual. Either way, you'll fill this sports car with premium unleaded, but with up to 35 mpg on the highway, you won't do it often.<br>

The C-Class even offers high-performance Mercedes-AMG models (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-amg-c-class/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) and a plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> version called the C 350e. </p>, <p>The C-Class' features and enviable reputation come at a price that starts higher than those of its rivals. If you want a compact luxury car that's as distinctive as it is practical, you might like the roomier Audi A5 Sportback or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/4%20series/">BMW 4 Series</a> Gran Coupe.</p>, <p>For 2018, all C-Class models except the hybrid receive a 9-speed automatic transmission (the hybrid retains a 7-speed). <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">Sedan</a> models gain a power sunroof as standard, while the coupe gets a rearview camera and blind-spot monitoring. Cabriolets receive a semi-automatic trunk separator, wood trim and analog clock. All models now have extendable sun visors.</p>, <p>The C-Class drives with a similar stateliness as its E-Class and S-Class brothers, but in smaller, nimbler form. While comfort and quiet are top of mind, the C-Class is easy to hustle. In fact, the 2018 C-Class is beguilingly quick, and its turbocharged 4-cylinder feels more powerful than its stated 241 horsepower. With the new 9-speed transmission, the C 300 now runs to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds, 2/10ths of a second quicker than last year. And while we've had our issues with 9-speed automatic transmissions in other cars, in the C-Class we didn't experience any hesitancy or refinement issues. Various drive modes are on top via the Dynamic Select dial, and they truly change the personality of the car, with the Comfort, Sport and Sport+ modes doing justice to their names in both acceleration and cornering dynamics. (There's also an Eco mode for the efficiency-minded.) Speaking of fuel economy, the C-Class is fitted with a stop/start system that cuts engine power at idle. If you're like us and have qualms with the engine shutting down and abruptly restarting, know the system can be turned off.</p>, <p>BURMESTER AUDIO SYSTEM<br>
 You may n<b>e</b>ver have heard of this high-end German audio brand, but once your ears hear the sound of this system, they'll never forget it. This 13-speaker, 590-watt audio system is an aural delight, and even its stainless steel speaker housings please the senses. At $850, it's a steal.<br>
<br>
 DRIVER-ASSISTANCE PACKAGE<br>
 This package bundles significant active safety and driving aids, features that can make driving less stressful and potentially save a life. They include an adaptive cruise control system with a Steering Assist function that follows the road, and even the ability to stop the car if a pedestrian enters the road.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Lovely. Few other words suffice when it comes to describing the 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class interiors, especially on the heels of the former generation, which had more of a cold, clinical demeanor. The C-Class is available with an attractive array of wood and aluminum finishes, and a relatively clutter-free layout that manages to still feel elegant. Central to the de-cluttering is a simple rotary dial and optional touch pad that respond to gestural inputs, swipes and handwriting. Adding to the upscale feel is an available Air Balance Package with a fragrance diffuser that atomizes perfume into the air-conditioning system. Pragmatically, rear-seat legroom can be tight for taller passengers, and coupe and convertible model trade the sedan's 3-passenger bench for a pair of more sculpted seats.</p>, <p>The C-Class' elegant interior isn't its only correlation to the S-Class. Like that flagship, the C-Class is curvy, bold and beautiful. Thanks to its smaller proportions, you could say it's even more purposeful. The 2-door versions of the C-Class, in the form of the coupe and cabriolet, have their own sense of style, with the coupe looking particularly strong. All can be further emboldened with the Night Package, which adds sporty AMG Line performance elements, gloss black exterior accents, and darkened 18-inch AMG wheels.</p>, <p>As should be expected from a German luxury car, even a base <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> C 300 includes a laudable amount of features, technology and safety systems to complement its badge appeal. Among the standard features are power front seats, dual-zone climate control, a sunroof, power-folding mirrors, and a brake-hold feature that can give your foot a break at stoplights. Standard infotainment includes a 7-inch high-res display and central rotary controller, AM/FM/HD Radio, dual USB audio ports, and Bluetooth streaming. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto can be bundled for an extra $350. The C-Class' standard safety systems include an automatic emergency braking system and another system that monitors for driver drowsiness. C-Class <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a> come with the nifty Airscarf neck-level heating system and heated front seats.</p>, <p>Whether you want in-car Wi-Fi, a power rear sunshade, a hands-free trunk, or the ability to check on your car via a phone with the mbrace Connect service, there are plenty of ways upgrade the 2018 Mercedes C-Class. If you real leather instead of the faux MB-Tex upholstery, that is extra. Other options include heated and ventilated front seats, a panoramic roof, and performance-oriented suspension and brakes. In the "just cool" column are that in-cabin fragrance system with your choice of fragrances, a head-up windshield display, and a system that helps you parallel park. If you opt for the navigation system, you'll also get a larger 8.4-inch center display.</p>, <p>The standard engine in the C 300 sedan, coupe and convertible is a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes a healthy 241 horsepower. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD), which Mercedes calls 4Matic, is optional. For 2018, all are now linked to a 9-speed automatic transmission. Still using the 7-speed automatic -- a good transmission in its own right -- the C 350e Plug-in Hybrid pairs a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor to make a combined 275 horsepower and a stout 443 lb-ft of torque. Beyond more power, the system results in markedly more fuel economy: the mile-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe) of 45/61 city/highway. On electricity alone, it won't take you far, with the EPA putting its range at about 8 miles. The C 350e is rear-drive only. If you're power hungry, the C-Class is available in high-performance Mercedes-AMG variants boasting up to 503 horsepower. Those models are reviewed separately.<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (C 300 sedan, coupe, convertible)<br/> 241 horsepower @ 5,550 rpm<br/> 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,300-4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/33 mpg (RWD, sedan), 22/30 mpg (RWD, coupe), 23/32 mpg (AWD, sedan), 22/30 mpg (AWD, coupe), 22/29 (RWD &amp; AWD convertible)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 + 60kW electric motor (C 350e)<br/> 275 horsepower<br/> 443 lb-ft of torque<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 45/61 MPGe</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $41,000, including destination charge. Base C-Class coupe models start at just over $44,000, while the C-Class convertible jumps to starting price of over $52,000. Adding all-wheel drive to any model is an extra $2,000. The C-Class Plug-in Hybrid, available as a sedan only, starts just over $47,000. Options and packages can easily lift these prices by thousands. A C-Class sedan, for example, can reach into the mid-$50,000 range. At these prices, the C-Class sits above most competitors. A base C-Class would be in lock-step with the BMW 3 Series, if not for the newer and lower-priced 320i. Other rivals, such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/ats/">Cadillac ATS</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus IS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xe/">Jaguar XE</a> also start lower.

The Mercedes' resale value is expected to remain quite strong, though possibly not quite as high as that of the Lexus IS.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/cla/2018
[<p>The 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/cla-class/">Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class</a> is the least expensive sedan in the automaker's lineup, leading some to assume it's not a "real" Mercedes, just a bargain-basement ploy to lure customers into the showroom. Wrong. The CLA takes on the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a3/">Audi A3</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/ilx/">Acura ILX</a>, and even the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/2%20series/">BMW 2 Series</a>, at least from a price-and-size standpoint, with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine powering the front or all four wheels. At a starting price of about $33,600, you get a decent amount of standard equipment, and the prestige of the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> brand. You also get limited visibility and a cramped rear seat, but that's a small price to pay for first-time luxury-car buyers. If you want more power, the Mercedes-AMG CLA45 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-amg-cla/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) has it in spades, and a lot more.</p>, <p>If you must have a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> brand, but don't have a ton to spend, then the 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 makes good sense. It offers solid performance, good handling, and a cool style that closely resembles the much more expensive CLS.</p>, <p>If you aren't brand-conscious, there are much better bargains out there from non-luxury brands. Your $35,000 could land you in a loaded <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/optima/">Kia Optima</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chrysler/300/">Chrysler 300</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord/">Honda Accord</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/maxima/">Nissan Maxima</a>...you get the idea. Options also quickly add to the price tag on the CLA.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA gets a new Ice Edition, combining an AMG-look exterior, LED headlights, Dinamica trim, panorama roof, blind-spot assist, the Premium package, and special white paint and black 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class uses a front-wheel-drive (FWD) architecture, a departure for the company, but it's executed so well that it's almost just an academic difference. The FWD model handles very well, and the all-wheel-drive (AWD) model improves on that. Put it in Sport mode and the car zips off the line thanks to generous low-end torque and a dual-clutch 7-speed automatic transmission. The steering is nice and responsive, and you have to push the CLA to its very edge to feel the kind of understeer that betrays its front-drive architecture. However, that limit's higher than most drivers will explore, and the AWD model mitigates it significantly while adding all-weather peace of mind. All that good handling does come at the expense of ride quality, which has a hard time absorbing small impacts such as expansion joints and the like.</p>, <p>PANORAMA ROOF<br>
 You can't get more headroom in the 2018 CLA's interior, but you can create the illusion with the big panoramic glass sunroof. When it's open, there are near-convertible levels of sunshine and fresh air, while the retractable sunshade lets in plenty of the former without the latter.<br>
<br>
 FUEL ECONOMY<br>
 While sipping fuel isn't always a priority for luxury-car buyers, the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder in the CLA gets up to 36 mpg in front-wheel-drive models. It's the best economy you'll get in a Benz that isn't powered by electrons.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>We mentioned the tight rear seat, but considering the youthful demographic suggested by the CLA's styling, we're guessing it's not much of a concern. Instead, concentrate on the front, and you'll be impressed by the overall quality of materials and assembly. Granted, there are a handful of plastic pieces that feel out of place, at least until you remember the price tag. The front seats offer good comfort with slightly-too-firm padding, and the smallness of the interior makes itself known with a center console that crowds your legs a bit. Still, the chunky steering wheel and 8-inch infotainment display won us over.</p>, <p>The 2018 CLA is one of those rare cars that looks bigger than it really is. We blame the strong resemblance to the much larger CLS-Class of <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> -- ignore that Mercedes-Benz calls it a “coupe” -- for the illusion. On the road, the CLA looks little, tiny even, swallowed by the lane it’s in. The low stance, narrow tires, clean lines give the CLA250 a slippery drag coefficient of only 0.23, better than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius/">Toyota Prius</a>. New this year is an Ice Edition package, which wraps the exterior in white paint, uses black-accented 18-inch AMG wheels, and gets matte-white exterior accents.</p>, <p>The base 2018 CLA comes decently equipped, with 14-way-power front seats with memory, dual-zone automatic climate control, push-button start, Dynamic Select driving modes, and an 8-inch infotainment display. The infotainment system includes Bluetooth, a USB input, HD audio, all controlled with the command dial on the center console. Safety features include a rearview camera, rain-sensing wipers, eight airbags, Active Brake Assist that automatically brakes when the system detects a potential collision, and Mercedes' Attention Assist drowsy-driver detector. The CLA also comes with five years of Mercedes-Benz mbrace Connect package, which lets you do things like start the car remotely from your smartphone.</p>, <p>Beyond all-wheel drive, there are many options for the 2018 CLA-Class, most bundled into packages. For example, an interior package bundles leather, stitched dash and door trim and multicolor ambient lighting. A Driver Assist package adds active cruise control and lane-keeping assist. A multimedia package includes COMAND navigation, three years of navigation updates, and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay compatibility; if you want just the Android Auto and CarPlay, it's available as a separate package for $350. Blind-spot assist, keyless entry and heated front seats are part of the Premium package. Individual options include a harman/kardon audio system, which we wholly recommend.</p>, <p>On paper, the 2.0-liter 4-cylinder under the hood of the CLA250 doesn't sound very impressive. It puts out 208 horsepower, and routes it to the front or all four wheels through a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. But the key is the turbocharged engine's torque: It spins out 258 lb-ft from 1,250 rpm to 4,000 rpm, the meat of the powerband where you'll spend most of the time. The upshot is that you get smooth and strong acceleration regardless of what gear you're in. Additionally, it gets good fuel economy, with front-wheel-drive models getting up to 36 mpg on the highway. The start/stop system helps, and stays out of your way enough that you might not even automatically reach to shut it off every time you drive.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (CLA250)<br>
 208 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br>
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/36 mpg (FWD), 23/32 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>A base, unadorned 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 comes with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) right around $33,600, including the $925 destination charge. All-wheel drive adds $2,000 to that package, and note that this "inexpensive" Benz gets pricey quickly. However, while injudicious option selections can raise the price past $40,000, more careful shoppers can get what they want for closer to $37,000. That price is right about where you'd pay for a similarly equipped Audi A3, despite its lower base price, while the surprisingly decent Acura ILX starts several thousand below the CLA, and lands about where the CLA starts when fully loaded. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area. The Mercedes CLA's <a alt_o_t="Residual Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">residual value</a> is expected to hold up very well in the long-run.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/cls/2018
[<p>Think of the 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS as an opulent “un-sedan.” The German luxury automaker calls the CLS a coupe, but in reality it’s a 4-door car with a sleek and sloping coupe-like profile. Mercedes was among the first to set the trend of crafting a vehicle with sedan-like proportions and accommodations but with coupe-like style. Since its debut nearly 15 years ago, rivals such as the Audi A7, Porsche Panamera and BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe have arrived bearing their own fresh twists on the theme. This year marks the end of the 2nd-generation CLS. An all-new version -- the 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS -- is about to arrive with even more style, the latest technology, and more usability with seating for five vs. the current model’s four.</p>, <p>If you want a large Mercedes-Benz luxury car that sets itself apart with individualistic style, a standard V8 engine and a dramatic sense of gravitas, the Mercedes-Benz CLS could be the ticket. An all-new version is just around the corner, but if you’re set on this one’s design and 4-passenger seating setup, get one while you still can.</p>, <p>A little patience will pay off in the form of the all-new, 3rd-gen 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS that will bring a wealth of fresh technology, amenities and class. If you value practicality as much as design, the Audi A7 and BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe boast far more -- and far more usable -- cargo space thanks to a liftback design vs. the CLS’s smallish trunk.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes CLS marks the last model year of this generation. An all-new version, the 2019 CLS, is just around the corner. It will feature new engine choices, including <a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-amg-cls/2018/">a high-performance Mercedes-AMG variant (reviewed here)</a>.</p>, <p>With a 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 pulsating under the hood, the Mercedes-Benz CLS is a surprising sleeper. Other drivers may just think they’re looking at a big and classy -- but not all that sporty -- luxury car. They’d be wrong. Mash the pedal and this big Mercedes hustles from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds. That’s sports-car fast, and its 400-plus horsepower will easily get you up the freeway quicker than the majority of other vehicles on the road. If you somehow still need more potency, look to the separately reviewed Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S, which reaches the 60-mph milestone in a physics-defying 3.5 seconds. We’ve found Mercedes’ 9-speed transmission a better operator than others on the market, with extra help coming in the fuel-economy department. Standard Airmatic air suspension and adjustable dampers help the CLS be a chameleon of the road, changing from a comfortable cruiser to sportier handler at the touch of a button. Still, be prepared for a somewhat stiff ride overall, a trait that can aggravate on commutes riddled with poor road surfaces.</p>, <p>ACTIVE SAFETY FEATURES<br>
 The 2018 Mercedes CLS may be in its last model year in current form, but it still touts impressive safety systems. Options range from systems that steer the car back in lanes should it drift, to another that scans the road ahead for cars or pedestrians entering your path from an intersection.<br>
<br>
 MASSAGING FRONT SEATS<br>
 Called the Active multi-contour driver seat, this optional perch offers enhanced adjustability for various body types, a semi-creepy system that inflates side bolsters to hug your body in turns (it’s defeatable), and our favorite, a massage setting. At only $660, it’s an inexpensive masseuse.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The cabin of this soon-to-be-outgoing CLS may look dated compared to the newest E-Class or S-Class sedan, but it’s still polished and sophisticated by most other standards. There is abundant leather and a choice of wood trims, a prominent 8-inch digital display in the middle of the dash, and thickly padded and highly adjustable front seats. While the upcoming next-gen CLS will have seating for five, this current version keeps its hallmark 4-passenger capacity, with a pair of sculpted seats in back. At only 11 cubic feet, the trunk is on the small side. If you plan to carry long and/or bulkier items, opt for split-folding rear seats, a $440 option.</p>, <p>Design, specifically a melding of a 4-door sedan with a coupe-like profile, has been the CLS’s automotive manifesto. While there are plenty of imitators now, it was a radical concept a decade and a half ago when the first CLS was born, and the design still holds up today. The dashing grille and long hood are certainly pretty, but it’s at the rear where the 2018 Mercedes CLS is most interesting. The roofline tapers into the nub of a trunk like a metallic waterfall, while prominent rear fender flares portray a muscular charisma.</p>, <p>As expected of a $75,000-plus German luxury car, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS 550 comes out the gate very well equipped. Standard goods include a turbocharged V8 engine, leather interior, heated and 14-way-adjustable front seats, sunroof, Airmatic air suspension, dual-zone climate control, and universal garage-door opener. The CLS’s infotainment system bundles an 8-inch display, navigation, a 14-speaker/610-watt harman/kardon audio system with Bluetooth connectivity, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. Standard safety systems include the Collision Prevention Assist Plus system that can anticipate a crash and automatically apply the brakes at speeds up to 65 mph, and the Attention Assist that monitors for driver drowsiness.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive (AWD) can be had in place of the standard rear-wheel drive (RWD) by opting for the 4Matic version of the CLS. A wide range of options is bundled into packages and includes everything from a system that helps parallel-park the car to blind-spot monitoring, power-operated trunk, ventilated front seats, and driver-assist systems like adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. Audiophiles will appreciate the available 1,200-watt Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. Also available is an in-car Wi-Fi system.</p>, <p>While a 6-cylinder was offered in the past (and will be again in the form of a powerful new version with the 2019 Mercedes CLS), this soon-to-depart version heads out with a V8 under the hood. Though older, it’s still a powerhouse. Mercedes’ 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 is good for 402 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. (The more extreme Mercedes-AMG CLS packs 577 ponies). The CLS in standard form is rear-wheel drive, while traction-enhancing all-wheel drive is available in what Mercedes calls “4Matic.” The CLS 550 coupe uses a 9-speed automatic transmission as standard. In an effort to save fuel, the Mercedes CLS uses an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle. It’s normal for the engine to turn off at stoplights, but if you find restarts bothersome -- as we do -- the system can be turned off via the Eco button next to the hazard lights.<br>
<br>
 4.7-liter twin-turbocharged V8 <br>
 402 horsepower @ 5,000-5,750 rpm<br>
 443 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-4,750 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/26 mpg (RWD), 17/25 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS 550 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $76,000. Opting for the all-wheel-drive 4Matic version raises that cost to nearly $79,000. With options, these prices can inflate quickly and steadily. Check the boxes and you can breeze by the $90,000 mark. With their low $70,000 starting prices, the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe and Audi A7 undercut the CLS’s starting price, while the Porsche Panamera, at over $85,000, begins higher. Before buying your stylish 4-door luxury coupe, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what other people in your area are paying for theirs. The Mercedes CLS’s resale value is expected to be about average, and in line with rivals like the Audi A7 and Porsche Panamera.</p>]

[<p>Slotting between the compact C-Class and flagship S-Class, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the German brand's well-established midsize-luxury car. While most know it as a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>, the E-Class is also available as a versatile <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/wagon/">wagon</a> or sportier and stylish 4-seat <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> and cabriolet. This varied lineup appeals to equally varied tastes, and sets the E-Class apart from rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gs/">Lexus GS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a>. No matter the form, the 2018 E-Class packs impressive technology and safety features, impeccable build quality, stately driving manners and the prestige that comes with a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> badge. The newly available V6 in the E 400 sedan grants appreciable power beyond the base 4-cylinder, and for those who want to tip the scale far more on the performance side, Mercedes-AMG variants are available (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-amg-e-class/2018/">and reviewed separately</a>).</p>, <p>Beyond its posh ride quality, premium amenities and envy-inducing badge, the E-Class is filled with surprise-and-delight features. From systems that fill the cabin with fine fragrances to others that can steer for you or prevent a collision, the E-Class has a remarkable way of mixing technology that serves and amenities that coddle.</p>, <p>Though handsome, the E-Class may not look as sexy to your eyes as a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xf/">Jaguar XF</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a>. The Lexus GS is expected to hold its value better in the long run, while the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/genesis/g80/">Genesis G80</a> undercuts the E-Class' roughly $54,000 starting price by over $11,000. Want a diesel <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> sedan? Look to <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a>.</p>, <p>The E-Class sedan and wagon were all-new last year, and this year it's the coupe and convertible's turn for a full revamp. These 2-door, 4-seat models boast the same technological and safety upgrades as the sedan and wagon, while now offering more room in back. New for the E-Class sedan is the E 400 trim, with a twin-turbo V6 engine.</p>, <p>With four different forms and several engines to choose from (including the AMG performance models), the 2018 E-Class remains a different-strokes-for-different-folks proposition. For the sedan, most buyers will be perfectly fine with the E 300 model, which uses a turbocharged 4-cylinder that has enough power to scoot this executive sedan to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds. That's not quite as fast as <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>'s 530i, but it's hardly shabby. Still, if you want appreciably more oomph, we recommend the new E 400. Using the same twin-turbo V6 that serves in the wagon, coupe and convertible E-Class, we expect the sedan to shave at least a second off that benchmark acceleration time and to have more in reserve for high-speed passing. A Sport mode is available in the Dynamic Select drive program, but the standard E-Class shouldn't be confused with a sports sedan. It is far happier as a comfortable cruiser than a tarmac-shredder. If that's what you're looking for, check out the Mercedes-AMG variants, higher-performance BMW 5 Series, or an <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s6/">Audi S6</a>. The E-Class' engines are paired to a refined 9-speed automatic transmission. With their standard lowered suspension and selective-damping system (optional on the sedan and wagon), the E-Class coupe and cabriolet are sportier but remain on the plusher end of the performance-comfort spectrum. Alternately, for those seeking an even cushier ride, the sedan and wagon are available with a comfort suspension option.</p>, <p>SEMI-AUTONOMOUS DRIVE MODES<br>
 The 10th-generation E-Class takes us one step closer to car as driver. Available driver-assist and safety features can do everything from steer the car in a corner and pace the vehicle ahead in traffic to make an evasive maneuver if the Mercedes senses an impending collision.<br>
<br>
BURMESTER AUDIO<br>
These optional audio systems in the 2018 E-Class remain among our favorites out of every new car available. Clear, precise and immersive, these German audiophile systems sound simply superb.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>When Mercedes' latest S-Class flagship sedan debuted a few years ago, its cabin became the benchmark for mainstream luxury opulence. The latest E-Class, which was all-new just last year, took many of its bigger brother's fineries and bettered them in some ways, such as with the introduction of not one but two 12.3-inch screens that turn the dashboard into something like a very wide-screen high-def TV that displays navigation, audio, phone and myriad other functions. For all its elegance, performing simple tasks like changing fan speed and temperature is simple thanks to easy-to-reach buttons. While the forward cabin of each E-Class variant is similar, the coupe replaces the sedan and wagon's 3-person rear bench with two individual seats, limiting total seating to four. E-Class wagon traditionalists will be happy to know that it retains its 7-passenger capacity thanks to the rear-facing 3rd-row seats. When not in use, the seats fold flat into the floor. With the 2nd-row seats up, the wagon has a generous 35 cubic feet of space. When folded, that space expands to an SUV-like 64 cubic feet.</p>, <p>With their latest revamp, the 2018 E-Class sedan and wagon look fresh but familiar. We like the understated nature of this German <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a>, and think its design will hold up well into the future. If you're looking for massive grilles and head-turning flair, you'll probably want to shop elsewhere. But most E-Class buyers appreciate substance as much as style. The 2-door coupe and convertible are naturally sportier with their lower height and slightly shorter length. The E-Class convertible uses a power-folding fabric top (available in four colors), while the E-Class coupe continues to stand out as one of the few new cars available with no B-pillar between the front and rear windows. When both windows are down, it creates a large opening to let the outside in, not to mention a dramatic look.</p>, <p>Even in its least expensive form -- around $54,000 -- the 2018 E-Class sedan is well-equipped. Included are dual-zone climate control, power front seats, sunroof, universal garage-door remote, 12.3-inch center display with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility, navigation, and five years of Mercedes-Benz's mbrace Connect service that lets you check and control some functions of the car remotely from your phone. Leather is still extra on the sedan and wagon, while genuine hide replaces the MB-Tex in the pricier coupe and convertible. While it's easy to appreciate the amenities you can touch and feel, equally impressive is Mercedes' roster of safety and driver-assistance features. Standard is an automatic emergency-braking system that will first warn you of a potential collision and, if no action is taken, apply the brakes. The Crosswind Assist system can help keep the car stable in high winds, and in a nod to future-proofing, there's the Car-to-X Communication system that will allow the E-Class to communicate with other cars.</p>, <p>Oh, the choices you have and the features with which you can bless your new E-Class. Want front seats that cool your bottom or massage your back? They're available. From a heated wood steering wheel to a choice of Burmester audio systems (see Favorite Features), in-cabin fragrance system, panoramic roof to soft-close doors, the options list is long and tempting. The E-Class can be made significantly more intelligent with semi-autonomous driving features such as active cruise control, active steering assist (which helps keeps you in lanes) and even an active blind-spot system that not only monitors for vehicles you can't see, but can keep you from colliding by braking individual wheels. Other tech offerings include a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster to complement the central screen of the same size, a 4G LTE in-car Wi-Fi system, rear-seat entertainment package and wireless phone-charging cradle. </p>, <p>The standard E-Class is powered by one of two engines: a turbocharged 4-cylinder that makes 241 horsepower, or a twin-turbo V6 that makes a more significant 329. For 2018, only the base E 300 sedan offers the 4-cylinder, while the E-Class coupe, convertible and wagon come standard with the V6 and are called the E 400. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is standard on all but the wagon, and all can be had with Mercedes' 4Matic all-wheel-drive (AWD) system, which is standard on the wagon. All use a 9-speed automatic transmission and an engine start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle. If you don't like the re-starts or find it odd that your engine shuts off at traffic signals, the system can be de-activated. If you're looking for significantly more power in your E-Class sedan or wagon, turn your attention to the Mercedes-AMG E 43 with 396 horsepower or the beastly E 63 S, which packs a 603-horsepower twin-turbo V8 and can rocket from 0-60 mph in a ridiculous 3.4 seconds. (See our separate review for these 2018 Mercedes-AMG models.)<br>

Adding AWD (4Matic in Mercedes-speak) increases that tab to just over $56,400. The 2018 E 400 E-Class wagon, which comes standard with the more powerful V6 engine and 4Matic, starts around $64,000, while the E-Class coupe starts just under $60,000. Rounding out the mix, the E-Class convertible starts over $67,000. This being a European luxury vehicle, expect these prices to inflate by thousands with options and packages. Compared to rivals, the E-Class tends to run higher. The BMW 5 Series sedan begins slightly lower, as do the Audi A6 and Volvo S90. The Lexus GS, Genesis G80, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/cts/">Cadillac CTS</a> start lower still.

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class looks, drives and has an attitude different from every other vehicle from the German <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> automaker. The uninitiated may think this $120,000-plus SUV is some sort of upscale <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jeep/">Jeep</a>. In reality, this is one of Mercedes’ oldest vehicles, and certainly its most rugged SUV. Initially made for military duty thanks to its resilient build quality and extreme off-road abilities, these days you’re more likely to see the G-Class on Rodeo Drive as a rolling status symbol of the rich and famous. Though its 5-passenger interior is luxurious and boasts plenty of amenities, the G 550’s on-road manners aren’t nearly as refined as those of a Range Rover or a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gle/">Mercedes-Benz GLE</a>. But for those seeking the ultimate <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> SUV, the G-Class delivers legendary capability and a tough-as-nails charisma.</p>, <p>If you want a luxury SUV with jaw-dropping off-road chops and an image of bravado that few vehicles outside a tank can match, then raise a salute and stand at attention for the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/g-class/">Mercedes-Benz G-Class</a> (aka the G-Wagen). The 2018 G 550 is a brute, but it also boasts amenities expected in a 6-figure Mercedes-Benz. AMG models (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-amg-g-class/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) notch up the insanity with high-performance engines.</p>, <p>Reality check: Do you really need an SUV with triple-locking differentials, 13-mpg combined fuel economy and the ride quality of, well, a vehicle designed for the military? We get the appeal of driving such an exclusive, luxurious beast. But a Range Rover, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayenne/">Porsche Cayenne</a> or any number of upscale <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> will deliver far more comfort for far less money.</p>, <p>Mercedes’ highly exclusive and mostly hand-built SUV carries over for 2018 with only minor updates. Among them are two new exterior colors -- Orange Metallic and Ocean Blue Metallic -- and a “Red and Black Edition.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV will take you almost anywhere you want to roam, from a secluded beach to the most remote trailhead in the deepest forest. The caveat is that, if you’re expecting to get to these places in comfort and quiet, that just isn’t gonna happen. Lacking the refinement of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover/">Land Rover Range Rover</a>, the G-Class nevertheless is every bit as capable, and possibly then some. Power for the G 550 is supplied by a twin-turbocharged V8 pumping out 416 ponies, readily available at the tap of the accelerator. The G-Wagen is a lesson in physics, or perhaps a lesson in defying them. Its V8 engine is capable of propelling this nearly 3-ton SUV from 0-60 mph in a mass-defying 5.8 seconds. If you’re buying this for serious off-roading, you probably already know this thing’s potential. For the majority of buyers who will (unfortunately) never leave the asphalt, know that the G-Wagen is no cream puff. Built on a truck-like ladder frame and with sides as slabbed as the Malibu cliffs, its ride tends to be rough, and wind noise only gets louder with speed. A Mercedes-Benz GLE may not have the attitude of the G-Class, but its on-road manners are much more civilized.</p>, <p>UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE<br>
 While most luxury SUVs only hint softly at their off-road ability, the 2018 MB G-Class screams it proudly from the highest peak. You won’t find a sedan-like ride or ultra-quiet cabin in the G-Class, but you will find a tenacious off-roader that will make you the envy of the Moab set.<br>
<br>
 TRIPLE LOCKING DIFFERENTIALS<br>
 What’s better than one locking diff? Three! We know that most new G-Class buyers will never touch the three switches that sequentially lock the center, rear and front differentials; just know that if you get stuck in the mud escaping the paparazzi, these lockers work like magic in getting a grip.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Talk about a dichotomy. While the 2018 G-Class has an exterior that’s all-brute, the 2-row/5-passenger interior is another story. This is still a Mercedes, after all. Its cabin is almost entirely handcrafted, featuring premium leather on the seats and dash. Polished wood and chrome accents abound. Controls are a fine mix of utilitarian (the three prominent locking-differential buttons displayed front and center) and elegant (a crisp, 8-inch tablet-style command screen). The boxy shape of this ultimate Mercedes-Benz SUV means headroom is practically unlimited. Cargo capacity is generous: nearly 40 cubic feet behind the 2nd-row seats and almost 80 with them folded.</p>, <p>While even traditionally rugged SUVs such as Range Rovers have softened their lines in recent years, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class retains the boxy, upright look it has had for nearly four decades. Aerodynamic it's not, but the G-Wagen's design is honest, masculine and pragmatic. At just 187.5 inches long, the G is actually shorter than the Mercedes GLE <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUV</a>. Instead of an upward-rising tailgate, the G-Wagen has a big, old-school swing-out door. If you want a hands-free tailgate -- or even a power-operated one -- go elsewhere. LED daytime running lights, electrically folding mirrors and an elegant instrument cluster with a 4.5-inch color display add touches of modern, but for the most part the G remains the boxy beast it's always been. You’ll either be enthralled or repelled by its machismo.</p>, <p>The G-Class is notable in that there are more high-performance Mercedes-AMG versions -- the G 63 and the ridiculous, V12-powered G 65, both reviewed separately -- than standard models. That leaves the Mercedes-Benz G 550 as the “base” model, if you can call a nearly $125,000 SUV such a thing. With that price comes a long list of features. We’ve mentioned its powerful V8 and incredible off-road hardware. Other highlights include Nappa leather seats that are heated and ventilated up front (and heated in the rear), dual-zone climate control, and an 8-inch infotainment system with navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and 12-speaker harman/kardon audio system. The G-Class’ safety and driver-assist features include Distronic adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, rearview camera and parking sensors. More advanced, semi-autonomous driving features like those found in Audis are not available.</p>, <p>Extras for the G 550 include adjustable suspension, rear-seat entertainment system, heated steering wheel, and several designo packages with plusher leather, lacquered wood trim and other aesthetic touches. The mbrace Connect package grants five years of remote access to the vehicle from a smartphone. With the Night Package, the G-Class gets black 19-inch AMG wheels, gloss-black exterior accents and black exterior protective strips.</p>, <p>The G 550 uses a 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 that makes 416 horsepower and a stout 450 lb-ft of torque, enough for quick sprints to 60 mph or towing up to 7,000 pounds. Transmitting the power to all four wheels is a 7-speed automatic transmission. The G-Class comes standard with a robust full-time all-wheel-drive system with a 2-speed transfer case and triple locking differentials. This is serious off-road hardware, and the stuff that has helped make the G-Wagen famous for its ability to go where other vehicles cannot. All this mass, power and equipment takes its toll on fuel economy, though, and the Eco start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle can’t turn the tide. You may never go off-roading in the G-Class, but with a combined EPA rating of 13 mpg, you will be making frequent stops at the gas station.<br>
<br>
 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 <br>
 416 horsepower @ 5,2,50-5,500 rpm<br>
 450 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,750 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/14 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the 2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class luxury SUV begins just over $125,000, a price that puts it well beyond that of the 3-row <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a> full-size SUV, and most competitors for that matter. While you can option up a Land Rover Range Rover, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lx/">Lexus LX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx80/">Infiniti QX80</a>, Porsche Cayenne, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/escalade/">Cadillac Escalade</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> to around or beyond the 6-figure mark, all begin less than the 2018 G-Wagen. In this league, the 5-passenger Mercedes adventure SUV is in something of a class by itself. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new G-Class. On the resale front, the Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen enjoys high <a alt_o_t="Residual Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">residual value</a>, which is predicted to hold up well even five years down the road.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/gla/2018
[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 is the smallest and most affordable SUV in the German automaker's lineup, slotting below the GLC. The GLA is among a wave of entry-level luxury-crossover SUVs such as the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and Infiniti QX30 that have struck a chord with buyers thanks to their relative affordability, premium amenities, SUV-like utility and higher seating position. Like those rivals, the GLA looks more akin to a stylish, taller hatchback than a traditional SUV, but this baby Mercedes is agile and does offer all-wheel drive and even an off-road package for venturing off-pavement. The GLA 250 also has a look-alike, the hotted-up AMG GLA 45 with 375 horsepower and race-carlike reflexes. (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-amg-gla/2018/">See separate review.</a>)</p>, <p>If you want the prestige, style, safety features and accouterments of a Mercedes-Benz SUV for an un-Mercedes price, the GLA is your answer.<b></b></p>, <p>While the GLA's starting price of just over $34,000 is tempting, it can quickly balloon with options. If your driving involves lots of highway miles or you predict the need for more room in the future, we suggest something more substantial like the Mercedes GLC or Lexus NX.</p>, <p>Mercedes freshened the GLA for 2018 with new front and rear treatments, and an interior update that includes a larger 8-inch high-res center screen. The standard power tailgate gets a hands-free open/close option, and Android Auto support joins Apple CarPlay phone integration.</p>, <p>The GLA's tidy size makes it a friend in cities and urban environments, where its easy-to-park manners and maneuverability help it slither through congestion. It's in traffic and in-town driving where you'll notice its start/stop feature, which cuts engine power at idle. Restarts aren't too jarring, but noticeable all the same. You can defeat it with the press of a button. On the highway and at higher speeds, the GLA can feel a bit twitchy -- another consequence of its smaller size and wheelbase. With a 0-60-mph time of just over seven seconds, the GLA isn't slow but also doesn't feel particularly fast. Some turbo lag can be felt, especially when you floor it from a rolling stop. We also wished for a touch more refinement from the 7-speed twin-clutch automatic. Driven with gusto in the twisties, the little GLA feels planted and holds its own.</p>, <p>AUTONOMOUS BRAKING<br>
More than ever, we live in an era of automotive distraction. That makes automatic emergency braking systems such as the GLA's Active Brake Assist all the more relevant -- and potentially life-saving. If a collision appears imminent, the car will alert you. If you fail to brake, it ultimately will.<br>
<br>
ELECTRONIC BRAKE HOLD<br>
If you seem to spend more time stopping than going, you'll likely embrace this feature. A press of a button applies the brake for you when you're at a stoplight. This enables you to take your foot off the pedal to relax, plus be able to instantly hit the accelerator pedal.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The GLA's 2-row/5-passenger cabin is a pretty cozy cocoon. As its small proportions would suggest, passenger space is at premium in back, where legroom comes up short. The same can be said for storage nooks up front, though we always felt comfortable in the multi-adjustable driver's seat. The layout below the standard 8-inch center display is starting to look a little tired, but the buttons are easy to see and use. The elegant air vents remind you that you're in a Mercedes luxury vehicle. The GLA's cargo space of 17.2 cubic feet with rear seats up expands to 43.6 with them folded.</p>, <p>The GLA may be classified as an SUV, but it's no traditional slab-sided ute. This little Mercedes crossover SUV combines traits of a hot hatchback with the higher ride height of a sport-utility vehicle. If you want more ruggedness, the Off-Road Package raises the body over an inch in addition to adding modified ride settings. Truth be told, we're not crazy about the 2018 GLA's lower front lip, which to us looks like a catfish crossed with a sad-face emoji. You can turn the frown around with either the AMG Line or Night package, both of which substitute a tauter, skidplate-style treatment.</p>, <p>The least expensive GLA is still a Mercedes, so it has a lot of nice features, such as 14-way power-adjustable driver's seat, power tailgate, dual-zone climate control, automatic brake hold, and 8-inch central display with rearview camera. The standard audio/infotainment consists of AM/FM/CD/HD Radio with dual USB ports and Bluetooth connectivity, but you'll have to pay an extra $350 for CarPlay/Android Auto integration. Safety features range from the Attention Assist system monitoring for signs of drowsiness to autonomous emergency braking. In addition to all-wheel drive, GLA 4Matic models add an off-road mode to the Eco, Comfort and Sport drive modes.</p>, <p>Genuine leather in place of the faux MB-Tex stuff is worthy of your attention, as is blind-spot monitoring, hands-free tailgate, heated front seats, panoramic roof, navigation and universal garage-door opener. Many of these goodies are bundled in packages. The Driver Assistance Package combines active cruise control and lane-keep assist, while the Park Assist Package has a surround-view camera, power-folding mirrors and Parking Pilot, which assists with parallel parking. A harman/kardon premium audio system is available, as is in-car 4G LTE Wi-Fi and the mbrace Connect service that lets you lock, start and perform other functions via your phone.</p>, <p>The GLA 250 uses a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that is tied to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. With 0-60-mph times of 7.2 seconds for front-wheel drive (FWD) models and 7.1 for all-wheel drive (AWD), neither will set the road on fire but they still get the job done. The Sport mode calibrates the vehicle for quicker responses, and there are shift paddles mounted to the steering wheel for those times you want to play the part of F1 racer. As previously mentioned, it's perfectly normal for the engine to shut off at stoplights. The Mercedes does it to save fuel and cut emissions. Called Eco Start/Stop, the system can be disabled. Note that the GLA likes to drink premium unleaded gasoline.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 208 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br>
 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,250-4,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/33 mpg (FWD), 23/31 mpg (AWD)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $34,395, the GLA 250 is Mercedes' second-least-expensive vehicle behind the CLA compact sedan, which comes in $700 less. In all-wheel-drive 4Matic form, the GLA begins at $36,395. These are certainly tantalizing prices for a German luxury vehicle, but keep in mind options can force prices up. A loaded GLA can eclipse $50,000. At these prices, the 2018 Mercedes GLA starts slightly above the Q3 and Lincoln MKC, and a hair beneath the BMW X1. Also starting higher is the Lexus NX, though the Lexus is larger, nearly the size of a GLC. The Infiniti QX30, which shares a platform with the GLA, is several thousand less. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The GLA's resale value is expected to hold up quite well, falling just short of the Audi Q3's.</p>]

[<p>Perfect for families looking for a luxurious midsize 5-passenger <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, the new 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC 300 offers up a powerful turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, available all-wheel drive, and all the <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> you could hope for. There is also a sleek GLC <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a> available that trades cargo space for a sleek roofline, and high-performance AMG GLC 43 and GLC 63; all are covered separately. But the standard GLC 300 is far from a "base" model. Its 2.0-liter 4-cylinder feels more powerful than its 241 rating, and various drive modes help you make the most of it. The standard interior is already a cut above competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q5/">Audi Q5</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rx/">Lexus RX</a>, but if it's not enough, the Designo options offer even finer interior trim.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a stylish midsize-luxury SUV with strong performance, a beautifully finished interior and all the features you’d expect in a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a>, then you’ll like the new 2018 GLC 300.</p>, <p>The BMW X3 offers more cargo space than the 2018 Mercedes GLC. If this is a priority, also look at the larger Mercedes GLE or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>. </p>, <p>Entrance lights in the GLC’s doors are now standard, and all models now come standard with a Storage Package that includes seatback pockets, storage nets, and remote releases for the rear seatbacks in the cargo area.</p>, <p>From behind the wheel, the new 2018 Mercedes GLC 300 manages to feel substantial, but also small and maneuverable. The steering is light and quick, and acceleration is strong and steady, if not swift. The smooth 2.0-liter turbocharged engine has plenty of reserve for passing and climbing, and the 9-speed automatic transmission delivers seamless gear changes. When the Dynamic Select Mode is set to Sport or Sport+, those same shifts become much more noticeable, which is exactly what you want. On the highway, Mercedes-Benz’s 2018 GLC delivers a smooth ride, but there’s some wind buffeting around the side mirrors. One area of concern is the fuel-saving stop/start system, which is too noticeable for a system that’s supposed to be invisible.</p>, <p>DYNAMIC SELECT<br>
 Every 2018 Mercedes GLC comes with Dynamic Select, which allows the driver to dial in the SUV’s character depending on his or her mood. There are five different modes, Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual, which is your personal custom combination. Each mode modifies the engine, suspension, transmission and steering.<br>
<br>
 SURROUND-VIEW SYSTEM<br>
 Mercedes offers a comprehensive suite of active and passive safety systems on the new GLC, including this clever system that makes parking and maneuvering in tight quarters a lot easier. It provides a 360-degree view of the SUV including a bird’s-eye perspective of the vehicle and its surrounds.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>There’s an artistic brilliance to the interior of the new 2018 Mercedes GLC that goes well beyond its soft leathers, glossy woods and high-tech features. There’s a rich, emotional appeal to the GLC’s cabin. It’s warm and inviting, but exceedingly modern, beautiful by both sight and touch. It’s the most finely finished interior in the class, and its functionality is exceptional. There’s room for five. The seats are comfortable and the driver’s seating position is perfect, even for shorter drivers. Visibility is excellent and there’s plenty of storage space with a large glove box, center console bin and door pockets.</p>, <p>Mercedes’ GLC-Class for 2018 is bigger than it looks, and that’s a good thing. Rather than appearing ponderous or unwieldy, it looks substantial and solid. Although the smooth curves and soft lines are a little less distinctive than Mercedes’ previous crisp-edge styling, this is much more attractive. The design aesthetic that debuted on the S-Class translates nicely to this midsize-luxury SUV, and the new GLC is arguably has the best-looking SUV lineup among the big three European luxury brands. Wheel sizes vary from the standard 18 inch to 20 inch, and if you like matte-paint finishes, Designo has you covered.</p>, <p>The 2018 GLC 300 offers a solid array of standard equipment. Beyond the power driver's seat with memory, automatic climate control, power-folding mirrors, a power tailgate and rearview camera, the GLC-Class comes with things like the Mercedes-Benz touch pad for using the infotainment system. There's a solid set of safety systems, featuring Collision Prevention Assist Plus and Pre-Safe, which help prevent and mitigate the effects of collisions. Crosswind Assist helps keep the GLC from being blown around by winds.</p>, <p>Mercedes-Benz doesn't skimp on options for its midsize-luxury SUV, with plentiful packages that let you equip your new GLC pretty much any way you want. There's the high-end Designo interior and exterior, of course, but there are also available leather, upgraded wood trims, and a variety of interior colors to choose from. Option packages include the Multimedia Package that adds COMAND navigation, an AMG Line package that gives the GLC 300 a sportier look, and a Premium Driver-Assistance Package that includes cross-traffic assist, active blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist and steering assist.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC 300 comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Rated at 241 horsepower, the engine can drive the rear or all four wheels (RWD, AWD) through a 9-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. While Mercedes-Benz says the GLC is fully off-road capable, the lack of a low-range will immediately put off die-hard off-roaders, despite the bad-road options in the Dynamic Select drive-mode function. Fuel economy is solidly competitive, if not class-leading.<br>

Options add up quickly though, with some packages -- such as the $2,500 interior package with leather upholstery -- requiring other packages, in this case, the $1,830 Premium Package. Start adding in Designo upholstery and paint, and you're well on your way to $65,000. However, more judicious option selection can keep the price right around $50,000, and still retain leather seats, adaptive cruise control and navigation. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. As for resale, the GLC 300 holds its value well, slightly better than the Audi Q5, much better than the BMW X5 but still well behind the Lexus RX 350.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE is the German automaker's midsize-luxury <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, a 2-row/5-passenger hauler that adeptly takes on rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/rx/">Lexus RX</a>. Formerly known as the M-Class, the GLE changed its name a couple of years ago and now has enough configurations to be its own lineup. Most buyers will be satisfied with the jack-of-all-trades GLE 350 and its V6, but there's also a plug-in hybrid-SUV variant for those seeking superior sufficiency. For the power-hungry, there are AMG GLE models, and even a sportier and less practical version called the GLE <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a>, all of which we review separately. Starting well over $50,000, the Mercedes GLE costs more than most rivals, but boasts impressive features and a badge to envy.</p>, <p>In addition to the luxurious amenities, safety features and technology you'd expect in a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a>, the GLE packs a few surprises, like the ability to tow up to 7,200 pounds. Another is the plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> GLE's ability to travel up to 10 miles on battery power alone.</p>, <p>The Lexus RX has a softer ride, costs about $10,000 less, and holds its value better in the long run. The slightly smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/rdx/">Acura RDX</a>, meanwhile, is agile, comfortable and costs far less than the Mercedes. If you want a diesel SUV, options keep dwindling but <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> offers one in the F-Pace.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gle/">Mercedes-Benz GLE</a> carries over unchanged, with the only updates coming on the AMG side of the equation with a power bump for the Mercedes AMG GLE 43 variant.</p>, <p>The GLE's road-going characteristics vary quite a bit depending on powertrain. Most buyers will choose the GLE 350, either in standard rear-wheel-drive form or with all-wheel drive, which Mercedes call "4Matic." In such form, the GLE has a good blend of power and handling. While its acceleration trails that of a standard X5 (the GLE's 0-60-mph time is 7.5 seconds, vs. 6.1 for the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>), it will be more than sufficient for most buyers. More relevant is the GLE's admirable road manners -- a satisfying blend of comfort and finesse, all bolstered by the confidence inspired by the GLE's physical presence and high seating position. The GLE 550e plug-in hybrid comes at a higher cost but grants a have-cake-and-eat-it-too mentality. With a total of 436 horsepower, this hybrid-luxury SUV can zoom from 0 to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds -- a few ticks faster than the AMG GLE 43 performance variant.</p>, <p>TOWING CAPACITY<br>
 Pulling heavier loads may not be the first thing on the mind of GLE buyers, but it's good to know this midsize-luxury SUV is up to the task if you have a trailer or recreational toys. Rear-drive models are rated up to 6,600 pounds, while 4Matic models go to 7,200 pounds.<br>
<br>
 TOUGH EXTERIOR, COSSETING INTERIOR<br>
 Inside the GLE's muscular and handsome shell is an interior that pampers, especially with options of your choosing. From massaging front seats to heated and cooled cup holders, the GLE's cabin has a way of making even the mundane seem marvelous.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Mercedes GLE remains a 2-row/5-passenger SUV, and has no pretense of trying to stuff a tiny third row into its shape. That's a good thing, because the GLE offers more rear-seat legroom than an X5 and edges its German rival in cargo capacity, too. Behind the rear seats is 38.2 cubic feet; folding the seats opens up a significant 80.3 cubic feet. Driver and passenger are treated to a good view out thanks to the higher seating position. Below the standard 8-inch display is a button-centric module for audio, phone and navigation features to supplement the rotary controller between the seats.</p>, <p>A styling update two years ago softened some of the GLE's boxy lines, but the 2018 GLE exterior remains tough yet handsome. We particularly like the angled C-pillar behind the rear doors, and the LED taillights make a statement at night, along with the LED-accented headlights during the day. For an AMG look without the extra AMG price, there's an exterior package that offers body styling found in the performance models. Also available is the Night Package, which includes AMG styling and gloss-black accents for that edgier appeal.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE comes nicely equipped, as you'd expect from a vehicle starting upwards of $50,000. Highlights include a power tailgate, sunroof, dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers and selectable drive modes (Comfort, Sport, Slippery). For added convenience and safety, you also get keyless start, rearview camera, crosswind assist and active brake assist, which can warn of an impending collision and automatically apply the brakes. Features include an AM/FM/CD/HD Radio with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, displayed on an 8-inch color screen. The GLE gets five years’ access to the mbrace service, which gives remote access via phone or smart device. Standard upholstery remains MB-Tex.</p>, <p>There's no shortage of ways to make your Mercedes GLE SUV even more luxurious, safe, sophisticated and unique. At the least, we recommend the Premium 1 Package, a good value that bundles navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a harman/kardon audio system and active safety features like blind-spot monitoring and lane-keeping assist. Also available are heated and cooled front seats, in-car Wi-Fi, a Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system and massaging front seats. A safety system uses radar and cameras to watch for vehicles and objects at intersections, and Pre-Safe Plus prepares the vehicle if it senses a collision from behind.</p>, <p>The 2018 GLE's standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 that makes 302 horsepower. Rear-wheel drive (RWD) is standard and all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. The AWD GLE 550e plug-in hybrid pairs a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor and lithium-ion battery, and can travel 10 miles on electricity alone. The battery can be charged in a couple of hours, and since it has a robust gasoline engine on board, you won't be stranded if the battery runs out of juice. The battery can also be charged by the gas engine when driving. Both the GLE 350 and GLE 550e use a well-regarded 7-speed automatic transmission. If a high-performance SUV is your thing, check out the GLE AMG models, which we review separately.<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.5-liter V6 (GLE 350 &amp; GLE 350 4MATIC)<br/> 302 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm<br/> 273 lb-ft of torque @ 3,500-5,250 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 18/23 mpg (RWD), 18/22 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 + electric motor (GLE 550e 4MATIC plug-in hybrid)<br/> 436 horsepower (total)<br/> 479 lb-ft of torque (total)<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy, est.: 38/50 MPGe (gas + electric)</p>, <p>The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE midsize-luxury SUV starts just over $53,000 when you include the $995 destination charge; add another $2,500 if you want 4MATIC all-wheel drive. The GLE 550e plug-in hybrid SUV starts over $67,000, though it is eligible for about $4,000 in federal tax incentives. These prices can easily rise by thousands with options. At its starting price, the GLE starts slightly lower than the BMW X5 but above other rivals like the Lexus RX, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> and RDX, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/mkx/">Lincoln MKX</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/xt5/">Cadillac XT5</a>. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Mercedes GLE's resale value is expected to hold up well over the years, but still trail the Lexus RX.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class leads the mainstream side of the Benz <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> lineup; the mil-spec-based Gelandewagen G-Class is something of a specialty item. Available with either a twin-turbo V6 or twin-turbo V8 engine, the GLS-Class offers the kind of <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> trappings one expects from a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> SUV, but with a practical side that is right up there with a more mainstream <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV. The GLS-Class can seat seven passengers in comfort, it can tow 7,500 pounds, and with the V6 it even gets an acceptable 22 mpg on the highway. Its generous standard equipment includes a 9-speed automatic and air suspension that aren't even available on many competitors, and its “Mercedes-ness” makes it an excellent Interstate companion. There's also a fire-breathing AMG GLS 63 model, which is covered separately.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class offers up big-league towing and 7-passenger comfort, all in a luxury SUV that doesn't share its underpinnings with a lower-end model, like the Cadillac Escalade/Chevy Tahoe duo.</p>, <p>If you aren't quite so brand-conscious, competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/acadia/">GMC Acadia</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/grand%20cherokee/">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> offer many of the same features you can get in the GLS for less money. Additionally, not only can the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/escalade/">Cadillac Escalade</a> tow more, it also comes in a long-wheelbase version with excellent cargo and seating room.</p>, <p>After a thorough update last year, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class carries over virtually unchanged, with the exception of additional wheel designs available on the GLS 450.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is supremely confident on slippery roads thanks to the Dynamic Select modes on the drivetrain, which includes a Slippery setting. The settings are so good at controlling and maintaining traction that it may be too easy to forget that the laws of physics still apply; don't get overconfident. If you order the off-road package, Dynamic Select gets an Off-Road+ setting that enables a low-range gearbox and center differential lock for off-pavement driving. While it can't take on the truly rough stuff like you could in a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/wrangler/">Jeep Wrangler</a>, it's better than a lot of other competitors. All the while, you're surrounded by the kind of leather-bound comfort you'd expect from a Mercedes-Benz. The twin-turbo V6 is more than adequate in terms of acceleration and passing, and of course the twin-turbo V8 is exceptionally satisfying. The new 9-speed automatic transmission remains a delightful companion to both engines.</p>, <p>DYNAMIC SELECT<br>
 The Dynamic Select system adjusts the drivetrain in the GLS-Class to maximize traction depending on road conditions. If the pavement gets slick, a Slippery setting helps ensure maximum grip. The Off-Road+ setting makes this big SUV surprisingly capable in the rough stuff as well.<br>
<br>
 SURROUND VIEW SYSTEM<br>
 Big vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class can be hard to maneuver, but the available Surround View system makes it a lot easier. This 360-degree camera system gives you a bird's-eye view of the car, meaning there's no excuse for bad parking.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Nobody should feel cramped in a <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a>, so there's good legroom for all seven passengers in the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, even in the third row. Granted, there's not a lot of cargo space behind that third row, but if you fold the seats down you'll have plenty of room for all your stuff. Last year's updates helped increase the luxury quotient even further. There's a nicely shaped 3-spoke steering wheel, and the large infotainment screen that includes COMAND and can be equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Customization options include a wide palette of colors and schemes, plus high-end Designo selections.</p>, <p>There's no mistaking the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class as coming from any other manufacturer; however, its upright lines and squared shoulders definitely give it a last-generation appearance despite last year's general softening of the lines. Mercedes did manage to soften the headlights, grille and front bumper to resemble something closer to the GLC-Class, and we like the new, more modern LED taillights and subtly reshaped rear side glass. There are Designo paint schemes available, as well as a range of different alloy wheels.</p>, <p>The cachet of the Mercedes-Benz badge on the nose of the 2018 GLS-Class is part of the roughly $70,500 price tag, but there is more as well. Of course you get things like cruise control, a power driver's seat with memory, a rearview camera, and an audio system with a 6-disc CD/DVD changer and Bluetooth audio streaming. Also included are remote start, a power tailgate, power-folding mirrors, and dual-zone climate control. Safety features include crosswind stabilization and systems that monitor for driver drowsiness or an impending collision. Mercedes' remote-application mbrace comes with five years of complimentary service.</p>, <p>Options get grouped into packages, such as the Driver Assistance Package, which includes blind-spot alert, brake assist, Pre-Safe anti-collision system, active cruise control and active lane keeping. Pick the Premium package and you'll get niceties like illuminated doorsills, push-button ignition, navigation and more. One clever feature is the Active Curve System package, which includes adaptive shocks and a curve-system stability control that is just about as close to autonomous driving as Mercedes' lawyers will let the engineers get. Like many luxury manufacturers, leather is actually an option, with your choice of regular or super-soft Nappa leather. The Bang &amp; Olufsen surround-sound system is a must for audiophiles.</p>, <p>The 2018 GLS4450 comes with a twin-turbo V6 engine putting out 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, stats that were solidly V8 territory not too long ago. However, there is a V8 in the GLS 550, a 4.7-liter twin turbo that puts out 449 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. All-wheel drive is standard on both models, as is an excellent 9-speed automatic transmission that shifts smoothly enough that you may not even notice. All GLS-Class models require premium fuel, with the V6 the thriftier of the two as it sips a gallon every 22 miles.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 (GLS 450)<br>
 362 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm<br>

<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>If you want a 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS 450 4Matic, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the base model is about $70,500, including the $995 destination charge. The V8 power of the GLS 550 adds more than $25,000 to that price, with its base price just under the $96,000 mark; it comes with more equipment at that price, not just a bigger engine. That's not cheap, especially when you consider that options can push the price into 6-digit territory. Then again, they're competitive against the Cadillac Escalade and Range Rover Sport. Even with options pushing the price of a GLS 550 $100,000 and beyond, it's still fair against the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/lx/">Lexus LX</a> 570.

---------http://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-amg-c-class/2018
[<p>The Mercedes-AMG C-Class models are the high-performance alter-egos of Mercedes' popular compact-luxury car. Like the standard C 300 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/c-class/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), these fire-breathing variants -- C 43, C 63 and the range-topping C 63 S -- are available as a sedan, coupe or <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/convertible/">convertible</a>. And as with the standard C-Class, these AMG versions drip with class, style, technology and impressive safety features. The difference lies in these models' power and handling. The V6-powered C 43 has impressive performance at a still-attainable price, while the C 63 models pack V8 engines and prices that start in the mid-$70,000 range. Unlike <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>'s M3 and M4, no manual transmission is offered, but in every other respect the Mercedes-AMG C-Class can match or exceed the performance of its German rival.</p>, <p>If you're already drawn to the C-Class's elegant design, quality craftsmanship, laudable technology and enviable badge, but also crave a serious bump in power and performance, this Mercedes-AMG is for you. In addition to the standard 5-passenger sedan, stylish 4-passenger <a alt_o_t="Coupes" href="/coupe/">coupes</a> and convertible versions are offered.</p>, <p>If you're a traditionalist who must have a manual transmission in your high-performance compact-luxury car, you'll have to go with the fabled BMW M3/M4 or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>'s upstart ATS-V. If enhanced practicality is as important to you as style, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> just introduced an S5 version of its sleek yet spacious Sportback.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-AMG C-Class trio -- C 43, C 63 and C 63 S -- all available in the form of a sedan, convertible or coupe, carry over for 2018 with no major changes.</p>, <p>If you want a sizable step up in power and acceleration for about $11,000 more than an equivalent C 300 4Matic, the Mercedes-AMG C 43 is your car. In addition to two more cylinders, this model's turbo V6 adds 121 horsepower for a total of 362. That's enough for a 4.6-second 0-60-mph time -- enough to blow away many sports cars and certainly any typical sedan. If your motto is "go big or go home," and your bank account can afford the nearly $70,000 starting price, then it’s the V8-powered Mercedes-AMG C 63 or even more potent C 63 S. With 469 and 503 horsepower, respectively, these are the C-Class wolves in sheep's clothes. They'll blast to 60 mph in four seconds or less. But the real beauty of these AMG C-Class models is that they also stick like glue yet provide a mostly civilized ride when you're not ripping around corners.</p>, <p>MERCEDES-AMG C 43<br>
 We call this the Goldilocks model because of its "just-rightness." It grants a big performance increase over a C 300, but without the premium price tags of the higher-powered C 63 and C 63 S. With standard 4Matic all-wheel drive, it's more reassuring in foul weather vs. the rear-drive C 63 variants.<br>
<br>
 ACTIVE SAFETY SYSTEMS<br>
 While these AMG models prioritize performance, they also come with all the impressive safety features of a standard C-Class. Among them are collision alert and the ability for the car to automatically apply the brakes if a collision appears eminent, and another system called Attention Assist that monitors for driver drowsiness.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Not surprisingly, the cabins of Mercedes-AMG C-Class models closely mirror those of the standard models. That's a good thing, as this elegant interior is among the finest in its class. If not for less space, you might think you're in Mercedes' flagship S-Class. Subtle and not-so-subtle elements stand out, such as the red seatbelts fitted in the C 43. Being AMG models, they also come with a performance-oriented steering wheel and instrumentation. As with their non-AMG counterparts, the <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> seat five passengers, while the Mercedes-AMG C-Class coupe and convertible accommodate four, trading the 3-person rear bench for a pair of sculpted seats.</p>, <p>The 2018 C-Class AMG models stand apart from their C 300 brethren in relatively modest ways. Each has its own unique grille, exterior accents and badging, but for the most part they retain the flowing yet muscular design of the standard C-Class sedan, coupe and convertible, which to our eyes is among the most elegant in compact-luxury cars. One of the easiest ways to spot the difference is in back: Look for the quad exhaust housings. Within the AMG lineup, the C 63 models have a more muscular, ridged hood, while the red-hot C 63 S has telltale red brake calipers.</p>, <p>The extra money spent on these AMG models over the standard C-Class brings additional features as well as performance. Included are blind-spot monitoring, a stiffer sport-suspension system with 3-stage variable damping, AMG sport exhaust and a dynamic cornering-assist system. Amenities include dual-zone climate control, power sunroof, heated and power-operated front seats, and hands-free power trunk. Standard tech includes a 7-inch high-resolution dash with rotary command knob, AM/FM/HD Radio, dual USB ports, Bluetooth connectivity and five years of mbrace Connect service that grants remote access to the car from a phone or computer. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration will cost you extra.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the C 63 models adds further performance features like a limited-slip differential and "Race Start" launch-control function. Options are extensive and varied. There are things you expect -- navigation, leather interior, premium audio (the Burmester system is a dream) --  and maybe a few things you don't, like Wi-Fi connectivity, an illuminated Mercedes star in the grille, and the in-cabin fragrance system that has wafted down from the S-Class. Available active-safety systems/driving aids include radar cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and a system that helps you parallel park. Optional mbrace packages offer concierge services, emergency assistance and more.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-AMG C-Class sedan, coupe and convertible come in three strengths: fast, faster and fastest. The first, the C 43, uses a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 that makes a stout 362 horsepower. All that power is routed to all four wheels, what Mercedes calls 4Matic, and uses a 9-speed automatic transmission. The rear-wheel-drive C 63 gets a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 good for 469 horsepower and a 7-speed automatic transmission. The C 63 S adds even more firepower to that V8, stoking it to send 503 horsepower and enabling 0-60-mph blasts of 3.9 seconds. All engines use an Eco start/stop system that turns off the engine at idle in an effort to save fuel. Restarts can be rough, but the system can be deactivated.<b><br>

Coupe variants start marginally higher, while the convertible models are a steeper climb, adding several thousand dollars to those prices. Loaded with options, these prices can stretch into the $80,000-$90,000 range. At these prices, the Mercedes-AMG models are slightly above the few competitors in this realm.

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLA45 is the least expensive AMG model you can buy. This isn't surprising, since the CLA250 on which it's based (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/cla/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) is the least expensive <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> you can buy. Yet, like its less powerful cousin, the CLA45 is no less a "real" AMG, despite its low price tag. With 375 horsepower from its turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, it actually outpowers many V6-powered AMG43 models, and standard all-wheel drive ensures 0-60 times around the 4-second mark. No, it's not very roomy inside, and there are a few cheaper-feeling pieces of plastic in there as well, but the CLA45 nonetheless manages to provide real AMG-style performance at a reasonable price, even undercutting its closest competitor, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/rs%203/">Audi RS 3</a>.</p>, <p>If you've fallen in love with the shape of the CLA250, but your fast-paced lifestyle demands more power, then the CLA45 is the car for you. Its all-wheel drive makes the most of that power, and the aggressive styling announces your Civic-sized Mercedes means business.</p>, <p>If you think $50,000 should buy you a bigger car, you'll be better served by making the small stretch to the larger (but slower) Mercedes-AMG C43. Additionally, considering the tiny rear seat in the CLA, you might be better served by a sports car like the $53,000 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayman/">Porsche Cayman</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLA45 offers a new Performance Studio Package that bundles a Dinamica steering wheel with a yellow 12-o'clock marking, 19-inch wheels, performance seats and special yellow-highlighted trim.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLA45 uses a highly turbocharged 4-cylinder engine to make its 375 horsepower. That is a lot of power, more than the twin turbo in the company's V6 used in the AMG C43, so the CLA45 also comes standard with 4Matic all-wheel drive to help tame the beast under the hood. Mercedes-Benz says the CLA45 springs from a standstill to 60 mph in about 4.1 seconds, and our seat-of-the-pants impression suggests that's no lie. Unfortunately there's a bit of lag, something you don't notice much when hammering the CLA45 around at full-throttle, but try to cruise and there's a lack of punch off the line. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission works well, but we've felt smoother gearshifts in other manufacturers’ setups, specifically <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a>'s. The CLA45 ferociously tackles corners, and the steering feels spot-on. Ride quality, however, suffers thanks to the stiff suspension.</p>, <p>PANORAMA ROOF<br>
 Panoramic roofs are a love-or-hate kind of thing. They let in a lot of light, but they also add weight. In this case though, we'll take the slight weight hit in favor of opening up the CLA45's snug interior, and adding a smidge of headroom.<br>
<br>
 CLA45 ENGINE<br>
 The hand-built engine in the CLA45 is a gem. With only 2.0 liters of displacement, Mercedes-Benz has managed to turbocharge the bejeezus out of it, and the resulting 375 horsepower is the most of any production 4-cylinder anywhere.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Like the regular CLA250, the Mercedes-AMG CLA45 doesn't offer a lot of rear-seat room. Instead, concentrate on the front seating area, where there's a lot to like. Aside from the occasional use of price-sensitive materials, the aesthetic is what we've come to expect in modern Mercedes-Benz cars, with first-rate assembly. While it shares its basics with the regular CLA, there are distinct differences. The front seats, for example, are AMG-specific, with deeper bolsters and an overall sportier design. The steering wheel features Alcantara grips, and the gear selector is on the center console, instead of the column-mounted stalk on the CLA250.</p>, <p>The basic CLA250 looks like a shrunken version of the larger CLS <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>. The CLA45 takes that shape and adds the expected AMG cues: a more aggressive grille and larger air intakes on the lower bumper, rocker-panel extensions, a more aggressive rear end with a trunk spoiler and diffuser under the rear bumper. The AMG wheels and badging are almost superfluous at that point. New this year is a Performance Studio Package, which adds special black-and-yellow 19-inch wheels; yellow accents on the front bumper, mirrors, diffuser, air vents and sill inserts; and a grille with twin louvers in high-gloss black.</p>, <p>As expected, the Mercedes-AMG CLA45 comes standard with a bunch of performance hardware, including the turbocharged engine, all-wheel drive and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Beyond that there are 14-way-power seats with memory, push-button start, dual-zone climate control, an 8-inch infotainment screen with USB, Bluetooth, and a knob-type controller. On the safety side, there are eight airbags and a rearview camera. To help prevent you from trying out the airbags, the CLA45 comes standard with active brake assist to warn you about impending collisions and even hit the brakes for you, and attention assist to let you know when you're getting drowsy.</p>, <p>Options mostly come bundled in packages on the 2018 CLA45. A Multimedia Package combines Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, COMAND navigation and voice control. The Driver Assistance package adds active cruise control and lane-keeping assist; add in the Premium Package to get blind-spot assist, keyless entry, heated front seats and more. Leather is an option, with the seats covered in convincing-enough MB-Tex vinyl otherwise. An AMG Dynamic Plus package adds adjustable shocks, a limited-slip differential, higher top speed, and a Race mode for when you really want to push the CLA45's limits, safely under controlled conditions, of course.</p>, <p>The 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder under the hood of the 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLA45 is the most powerful 4-cylinder engine from any automaker, anywhere. With 375 horsepower routed through a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic to all four wheels, the littlest AMG lives up to its billing. Hand-built like its larger V8 cousins, it lacks for very little, especially considering the CLA's relatively feathery weight. Surprisingly, fuel economy remains pretty good, with up to 30 mpg on the highway. Some of the credit surely goes to the slippery shape of the car itself. Not surprisingly, the Mercedes-AMG requires premium gasoline.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (CLA45 AMG 4Matic)<br>
 375 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 350 lb-ft of torque @ 2,250-5,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/30 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLA45 starts at about $51,300, including the $925 destination charge. That's not cheap -- the much bigger, but slower, AMG C43 starts a couple thousand higher -- but the CLA45 is a pretty wicked little beast. Add options and, of course, you'll be looking at a higher price, getting close to the $60,000 mark if you're not careful. Still, that's competitive with the likes of the Audi RS3, the CLA45's primary rival. Before buying, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their CLA45. The good news is that in the long run the CLA45 should hold onto its value fairly well.</p>]

[<p>If you’re going to be a bear, be a grizzly. If you’re considering one of Mercedes-Benz’s 4-door CLS “coupes,” make it the AMG-built CLS 63 S. It’s the alpha version of Mercedes’ handsome CLS models, and it’s powered by a hand-built twin-turbo V8 that produces 577 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via an AMG MCT 7-speed automatic transmission, propelling this luxurious sport sedan to 60 mph in a scant 3.5 seconds. The design of the CLS 63 S compromises rear-seat room and trunk volume a bit, but the shape of this 2nd-generation sedan has held up well to the test of time, and it remains well suited to take on challengers such as the Audi RS 7. The <a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/cls/2018/">non-AMG 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS models are reviewed here</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re completely smitten with power and style, but need a back seat on occasion, the 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S should be on your radar. This Mercedes makes a statement with how it looks and how it drives, not how it carries back-seat passengers.</p>, <p>If you think a large sedan should accommodate four full-size adults comfortably while also boasting a large trunk, the CLS is not for you. Consider a Mercedes-Benz E- or S-Class instead, or perhaps a BMW 7 Series, Genesis G90 or Cadillac CT6.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S is unchanged for 2018. Its replacement, the 2019 Mercedes-AMG CLS 53 — a new CLS powered by an inline-6 with a turbocharger and an electric supercharger — makes its debut late in 2018.</p>, <p>In the 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S, with its rear-biased 4Matic all-wheel-drive system and tight suspension with electronically controlled damping, you tend to forget you’re in a big sedan. In Sport handling mode, automatic brake intervention minimizes understeer, that tendency of a car to go straight when you want it to turn. A start/stop system saves fuel by shutting the engine off at traffic lights, but this can be switched off by the driver. On the road, the CLS 63 S gobbles up the miles with ease, and its hand-assembled twin-turbo V8 makes light work of mountain grades and high-speed passing maneuvers. EPA highway fuel economy is rated at 22 mpg, a respectable figure given the otherworldly thrust of this Mercedes sedan, which competes favorably with the Audi RS 7, BMW M6 Gran Coupe and Porsche Panamera.</p>, <p>AMG GAUGES<br>
 With red indicators and silver metallic bezels, the AMG-exclusive gauges are especially handsome. In Warmup mode, oil and coolant temperatures are displayed, and in Race mode, a RaceTimer can record lap times on a dedicated racing circuit. While the timer probably won’t be used all that often, you’ll want to show this trick feature to your friends.<br>
<br>
 THAT GLORIOUS V8<br>
 Hand-assembled in Affalterbach, Germany, the 5.5-liter bi-turbo V8 engine gives the CLS 63 S its raucous personality and phenomenal capabilities. Thanks to direct injection, multispark ignition, and increased fuel-injection pressure, 577 horsepower is on tap with a simple dip of the driver’s right foot.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The CLS 63 S is opulent inside, thanks to semi-aniline leather upholstery, 14-way power front sport seats (with memory), attractive multicolor ambient lighting, and conveniences such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Also, there’s a handy central controller with a high-quality feel, plus an 8-inch information display and five (not four) different types of wood trim. In addition to excellent ergonomics, the cabin has deeply bolstered seats that offer good cornering support while managing to be comfortable over the long haul. But be warned: Rear headroom and legroom are not abundant.</p>, <p>By all accounts, the standard CLS is a stunning car, a coupe-like sedan with an arching roofline. The Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S ups the aggression with a signature double-crossbar grille, a deep air dam (with mesh air intakes) and sculpted side sills that have matte silver inserts. Completing the visual upgrades are a rear valance that frames four AMG tailpipes, plus a black diffuser and a functional rear spoiler.</p>, <p>For improved grip and agility, the CLS 63 S has a 1.6-in.-wider front track and a more rigid rear subframe, plus additional wheel camber. There’s also a limited-slip rear differential, for improved acceleration out of tight corners. Inside, the leather-covered front seats offer 14-way power adjustability, and the center console extends back between the two rear seats. In addition to brushed aluminum pedals and aluminum shift paddles, the 2018 CLS 63 S has illuminated AMG door sills, a performance steering wheel, a rearview camera, Collision Prevention Assist Plus, and a powerful Harman Kardon audio system.</p>, <p>Beyond AMG ceramic brakes ($8,950), the CLS 63 S is available with carbon-fiber and Black Piano Lacquer wood trim ($2,850), matte-black forged AMG wheels ($500), an AMG carbon-fiber engine cover ($1,500), and even an illuminated 3-pointed star on the grille ($450). A Driver Assistance Package ($2,250) features Distance Plus with Steering Assist, plus Lane-Keeping Assist and Blind-Spot Assist. If you want only the Blind-Spot Assist and Lane-Keeping Assist, they comprise the optional $875 Lane-Tracking package. With the $2,200 Premium Package, you get an electronic trunk closer and power-folding mirrors, plus vented front seats and Keyless Go, Mercedes’ keyless vehicle operating system.</p>, <p>Only one engine is available in 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S, and it’s a good one: a hand-assembled 5.5-liter twin-turbo V8 that produces 577 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. This aluminum-block powerplant, with twin turbos nestled in the vee of the engine, sends power to all four wheels via AMG’s 7-speed Speedshift automatic. Top speed is limited to 186 mph.<br>
<br>
 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8<br>
 577 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br>
 590 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,500 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 16/22 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 S starts at around $110,000; that climbs close to $150,000 when the car is fully loaded with options including those pricey ceramic brakes. Buyers should cross-shop this potent German luxury sedan against the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera Turbo and Audi RS 7. Worth noting: A replacement for the CLS 63 S, the CLS 53, arrives by the end of 2018, powered by a turbocharged and electric-supercharged 3.0-liter inline-6 with 429 horsepower.

[<p>The Mercedes-AMG E-Class is the evil twin of the German brand’s well-regarded midsize-luxury cars. While the standard E-Class is available in four body styles -- sedan, <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a>, cabriolet and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/wagon/">wagon</a> -- the 2018 Mercedes-AMG E-Class is solely offered as a sedan or wagon. From there, you have the choice of the high-performance E 43 (sedan only) or bonkers E 63 S (sedan and wagon). The epitome of “sleepers,” these twin-turbo V8 models can launch the E 63 S from 0-60 mph in under 3.5 seconds. Have you ever seen a station wagon do that? Far more than just covert performers, these Mercedes-AMG models boast the technology and amenities of the standard E-Class (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/e-class/2018/">reviewed separately</a>), plus all-wheel drive to keep rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/s6/">Audi S6</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/m5/">BMW M5</a> on notice.</p>, <p>If you want your next Mercedes E-Class to pack a wallop of power and exclusivity, turn to these models developed by AMG, Mercedes’ in-house performance division. For the pinnacle of practicality and exclusivity, there’s the E 63 S Wagon -- a 603-horsepower station wagon.</p>, <p>Mercedes-AMG power comes at a price. The E 43 sedan will set you back over $70,000, and the E 63 S sedan and wagon start over $105,000. Though the E 63 S has the new BMW M5 beat in horsepower, the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> edges it acceleration.</p>, <p>The E 63 S sedan and wagon models join the 2018 roster, capping the recently revamped E-Class lineup. With 603 horsepower, they are the most powerful E-Class variants of all time.</p>, <p>If your notion of a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> is a midsize-luxury sedan that is first and foremost pleasant and comfortable, you haven’t been in an AMG-tuned model. While they feature the looks and creature comforts of Mercedes’ stalwart sedan and wagon, these models bring a gun to a knife fight with high-powered engines and performance tuning that enable them to make the most out of their potency. In reality, the Mercedes-AMG E 43 sedan is more than most drivers will ever need. It can do 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds and costs some $30,000 less than an E 63 S model. But it’s only money, and if your wallet is willing, know there’s nothing quite like the throbbing of the hand-built German V8 that powers the E 63 S sedan and wagon. They’ll tear to 60 mph in 3.3 and 3.4 seconds, respectively, all while serving commuter duty with grace and refinement thanks to a smooth 9-speed automatic transmission and easy steering. If grace and refinement are the last things you want, they even have a “drift mode” (see below).</p>, <p>DRIFT MODE<br/> Yes, we now live in a world where <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> intentionally allows/encourages experienced drivers to drift their E-Class sedan or wagon. Exclusive to the E 63 S, it defeats the all-wheel-drive system by sending 100 percent of power to the rear wheels, allowing you to do your best Tanner Foust impersonation.<br/> <br/> TONS OF TECH<br/> While it’s the horsepower figures that get the headlines for these AMG E-Class models, they also offer a ton of driver-assistance, safety and tech features. From various ways to prevent or lessen an accident to future-ready Car-to-X communication, the 2018 Mercedes-AMG E-Class is a tech powerhouse.<br/> </p>, <p>It shouldn’t be a surprise that the 5-passenger interiors of the AMG E-Class variants closely match those of the standard models. Still, AMG-specific details help these Mercedes performance models stand out even on the inside. Red trim throughout the cabin, for instance, more than hints at the flashes of anger under the hood. Being higher-priced models, these AMG-specific E-Class variants are filled with more creature comforts. You’ll still have to pay for real leather in an E 43 model, however. The 2018 E 63 Wagon offers SUV-like cargo capacity that maxes out at 64 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. Unlike the standard E-Class wagon, there is no rear-facing 3rd-row seat. With its ability to go 180 mph, that’s probably a good thing for the carsick-prone among us.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG E-Class sedan and wagon retain the same crisp lines as the standard models, but are emboldened with aggressive cues. The AMG <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> sit slightly lower, and all models have AMG body styling with unique fascias. One of the beautiful things about these high-powered AMG models is their ability to blend in with their counterparts, until they leave them in the dust. From that vantage, look for the telltale quad-tailpipe exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>Starting with the least expensive 2018 AMG E-Class model, the E 43 sedan, you can expect a strong roster of standard features. In addition to its powertrain enhancements, you’ll get power-operated and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, a foot-activated hands-free trunk, sunroof, and LED headlights and rain-sensing windshield wipers. The standard infotainment system bundles the twin 12.3-inch instrument cluster and center display, navigation, wireless phone charging and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration. Standard safety features include automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, parallel/perpendicular parking assist, and crosswind assist to stabilize the car in high winds.</p>, <p>In addition to the even higher-powered engines, the 2018 E 63 S models include Race and Drift modes, leather interior, and front seats with heat and ventilation, Burmester premium audio system and power rear-window sunshade (sedan only). As with the standard E-Class, myriad options can add to the E-Class’ essence and capability. Among them are among the best massaging front seats to be found in an automobile and a roster of active driving features such as active blind-spot monitoring that can guide you away from a crash, evasive steering assist to prevent hitting a pedestrian and active lane-keeping assist. On the deceleration front, the E 63 S can be had with carbon-ceramic brakes that will set you back nearly $9,000.</p>, <p>Two different AMG-performance engines can be had in the 2018 Mercedes-AMG E-Class. The E 43 Sedan uses what Mercedes calls an “AMG-enhanced” twin-turbo V6 that makes nearly 400 horsepower. Under the hood of the E 63 S Sedan and Wagon is a hand-built twin-turbo V8 that makes over 600 horsepower. All models use a 9-speed automatic transmission optimized for performance, and all models have all-wheel drive (AWD) as standard. In addition to its better capability in cold-weather states, all-wheel drive is key to putting the power in these high-power Mercedes to the ground. Perhaps ironically, these models have an automatic start/stop system that cuts engine power at idle to save fuel. If you don’t like constant restarts of the engine, the system can be defeated.<br>

That’s a roughly $20,000 walk from a base Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The gap between the E 43 and top-line E 63 S, however, is even larger. The 2018 E 63 S Sedan will set you back over $105,000, while the E 63 S Wagon is closer to $108,000. Add options, and you can mount thousands more to these tabs. These prices are certainly eye-popping to most everyday car shoppers, but they’re actually about the norm for <a alt_o_t="Luxury Cars" href="/luxury-car/">luxury cars</a> with this caliber of performance. The Audi S6, which competes with the E 43, for example, starts around $73,000, while the all-new 2018 BMW M5, the foe of the E 63 S, starts over $103,000.

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG G-Class is the extreme version of what is already Mercedes’ most extreme SUV. The G-Class is made for serious off-roading thanks to hardware like triple-locking differentials and a truck-like frame. Initially made for military duty, today you’re more likely to see Mercedes’ flagship SUV in the hands of a celebrity rather than a soldier. Still, proving no vehicle can’t be blessed by Mercedes’ high-performance division, AMG takes the standard G-Class (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/g-class/2018/">reviewed separately</a>) to new heights. The G 63 boasts a 563-horsepower, hand-built V8, while the nearly $225,000 G 65 packs a monstrous V12. Rivals are few, but among them the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bentley/bentayga/">Bentley Bentayga</a> matches cylinders and has a far more comfortable ride, while an all-new G-Class is set to arrive next year.</p>, <p>If you want the ultimate combination of <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a>, power and off-road capability, the 2018 Mercedes-AMG G-Class is a machine like no other. In G 65 form, it is one of only two V12 <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> on the market (the other being the Bentayga), and easily the most off-road capable.</p>, <p>The flip sides of the Mercedes-AMG G-Class’ extreme capabilities off-pavement are a harsher ride quality and less on-pavement dynamics than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayenne/">Porsche Cayenne</a>. A Bentley Bentayga is more comfortable and faster, too.</p>, <p>With an all-new G-Class set to go on sale in late 2018, changes are few to this existing model. Among them are two new exterior paint colors and the AMG Performance Studio Package available on the G 63 model.</p>, <p>The Mercedes G-Wagen is already something of a juxtaposition: an SUV with hardcore off-road ability, yet still capable of swift acceleration. That’s what happens when you stuff a powerful engine under the hood. With the AMG models, Mercedes’ G-Class is even more extreme. The G 63 can blast from 0-60 mph in 5.3 seconds, a half-second quicker than the standard <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> G 550 (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/g-class/2018/">reviewed separately</a>). You’d think 563 horsepower would be enough, but for those times when it’s not, the G 65 comes packing a V12 with 621 horsepower and gargantuan 738 lb-ft of torque. In reality, the extra power is more about bragging rights: It’s only a tenth of a second quicker to 60 mph. Beyond sheer power, both high-performance G-Class variants benefit from AMG-enhanced brakes, suspension and other hardware. The laws of physics still apply, and even these tricked-out models won’t hang with a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> in the turns. But when the pavement ends they retain the ability go where others can’t.</p>, <p>UNAPOLOGETIC ATTITUDE<br>
 While most luxury SUVs only hint softly at their off-road ability, the 2018 G-Class screams it proudly from the highest peak. You won’t find a sedan-like ride or ultra-quiet cabin in this high-performance adventure SUV, but you will find a beast that creates envy from Malibu to Moab.<br>
<br>
 V12-POWERED AMG G 65<br>
 The idea of wedding the track-performance genius of AMG with a nearly 40-year-old SUV might seem like lunacy, but we like it. The twin-turbocharged V12 provides more power than any off-roader could ever want while upping the exclusivity factor to 11.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Though brutish on the outside, the 5-passenger interior of the Mercedes-AMG G-Class is another story. This is still a Mercedes, after all. Its cabin is almost entirely handcrafted, featuring premium leather on the seats and dash. Polished wood and chrome accents abound. Controls are a fine mix of utilitarian (the three prominent locking-differential buttons displayed front and center) and elegant (a crisp, 8-inch tablet-style command screen). Unique AMG distinctions can be found in the steering wheel and nubby gear shifter. The G's squared shape means headroom is practically unlimited, but taller occupants may wish for more legroom. Cargo capacity is generous: over 45 cubic feet behind the 2nd-row seats and over 75 with them folded.</p>, <p>While even Range Rovers have softened their lines, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/mercedes-benz/g-class/2018/">2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class</a> retains the boxy, upright look it has had for decades. Aerodynamic it's not, but the G-Wagen's design is honest, masculine and pragmatic. These AMG variants stand out with their body styling elements like side sills, a unique front bumper and polished exhaust outlets that peek out the side in front of the rear wheels. At just 187.5 inches long, the G is actually shorter than the Mercedes GLE <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUV</a>. Instead of an upward-rising tailgate, the G-Wagen has a big, old-school swing-out door. LED daytime running lights, electrically folding mirrors and a digital instrument cluster add touches of modern, but for the most part the G remains the boxy beast it's always been. You’ll either be enthralled or repelled by its machismo.</p>, <p>For the roughly $145,000 base price, the Mercedes-AMG G 63 includes a handcrafted V8 engine and a roster of off-road hardware like a 2-speed transfer case and front, rear and center locking differentials. While those terrain-conquering features may never be used, other features like blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control and the brake-hold feature likely will. Other amenities include Nappa leather upholstery, sunroof, front seats that are heated and ventilated, heated rear seats and dual-zone climate control. The 8-inch infotainment system bundles navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility and a 12-speaker/450-watt harman/kardon audio system.</p>, <p>In addition to four more cylinders and much more bragging rights, the 2018 Mercedes-AMG G 65 adds 21-inch wheels, AMG sport front seats and diamond-pattern leather upholstery. Options for both models include a heated steering wheel, rear-seat entertainment system and a variety of exterior and interior accents. Several packages are also available, including the AMG Night Package that makes the G-Class even more menacing with darkened exterior elements. If in-car Wi-Fi is on your wish list, opt for the mbrace Entertain package.</p>, <p>Have we mentioned that the Mercedes-AMG G-Class has a choice of high-powered, hand-built engines? To recap, the G 63 uses a twin-turbo V8, while the big-dog G 65 packs a twin-turbo V12. Each transmits its prodigious power via an AMG-enhanced 7-speed automatic transmission. For all its high-performance attributes, the Mercedes-AMG G-Class is a real-deal off-roader with low-range gearing, and front, rear and center locking differentials. Ironically, the G 63 has a tow rating of 7,700 pounds like the standard G-Class, but the V12 G 65 is rated at 7,000 pounds. As you might guess (and probably don’t care), fuel efficiency isn’t exactly robust. In fact, it’s pretty miserable. The G 63 attempts some miserliness with an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle, but it still can’t break 15 mpg on the EPA scale. The G 65 tops out at 13 mpg.<br>

 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8 (G 63)<br>
 563 horsepower @ 5,500<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 11/13 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the 2018 Mercedes-AMG G-Class luxury SUV starts at $143,795 for the G 63 -- nearly $20,000 beyond the standard G 550. Adding four cylinders for the V12-powered G 65 is significantly more, with that top-line G-Wagen starting just shy of $225,000. Exclusivity and power have their price. At these figures, the Mercedes-AMG G-Class is one of the most expensive SUVs you can buy -- more than a variety of high-end SUVs that range from the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Range Rover Autobiography to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/tesla/model%20x/">Tesla Model X</a>. Still, it’s not quite the most expensive. The Bentley Bentayga ultra-luxury SUV has a bottom line that starts north of $230,000. In the years to come, expect more ultimate SUV rivals from the likes of <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lamborghini/">Lamborghini</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/rolls-royce/">Rolls-Royce</a>. For now, make sure you check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to get an idea of what you should be paying.

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 is the wild-child brother of the standard GLA 250 compact SUV (see separate review). Though they look like twins, the AMG GLA couldn't be more different in attitude, mission and price. For the uninitiated, AMG is the performance division of Mercedes, and it was born to turn existing models into firecrackers. In the GLA's case, that means stroking a turbocharged 4-cylinder to an incredible 375 horsepower, which grants 4.3-second 0-60-mph bursts. Upgrades also come to the transmission, all-wheel-drive system, suspension and other hardware. While <a href="https://www.kbb.com/mercedes-benz/gla/2018/">the standard GLA</a> faces rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q3/">Audi Q3</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x1/">BMW X1</a>, the AMG GLA has its own seat at the table. At over $51,000, the AMG GLA's niche nature is also reflected in its price premium.</p>, <p>If you already like the GLA compact-luxury SUV's looks, size and amenities, but want nearly double the horsepower and all the performance upgrades that come with a Mercedes-AMG, the GLA 45 is your ticket. Because it's based on Mercedes' entry-level <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV, this performance SUV is also quite the sleeper.</p>, <p>At over $51,000, this high-powered GLA's starting price is over $17,000 more than a base GLA, a substantial bump for a small-luxury-crossover SUV. And while there's no lacking in power, the AMG GLA, like the standard model, can feel twitchy on the highway.</p>, <p>As with the standard model, the Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 gets a freshening for 2018 like restyled front and rear aesthetics, and updated instrument cluster with new number design. A 360-degree camera is available, as is Android Auto compatibility.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 is similar in spirit to its CLA 45 compact 4-door sibling, which uses the same engine. While that subcompact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> can sprint to 60 mph a hair faster, the GLA has a higher seating position and the practicality that comes with a sport ute. Compared to other AMG models, the GLA 45 feels youthful and at times frenetic. Wringing 375 ponies from a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine is a loud affair, and for better or worse is linked to a turbocharged rush. Also for better or worse, it rather begs you to be a deviant. We must confess to loving the initial rush of acceleration, though its stiff suspension and boosted personality can take its toll if all you crave is a comfortable ride after a long day's labor. With its tidy size and shorter wheelbase, the AMG GLA 45 can feel nervous at higher speeds.</p>, <p>AMG DYNAMIC PLUS PACKAGE<br>
Call this the "go-big-or-go-home" option on the AMG GLA. This package bundles even sportier suspension with 2-stage damping, limited-slip front differential, "race mode" in drive settings and a raised top speed to 167 mph.<br>
<br>
THAT ENGINE<br>
This is one little powerhouse, literally. It may only be 2.0 liters in displacement, but the performance wizards at AMG have cajoled it to make 375 horsepower -- the most powerful 4-cylinder engine in production, Mercedes boasts.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As with the standard GLA, the AMG version features a 2-row/5-passenger setup that can best be described as cozy. Front-seat passengers are treated to supportive 14-way-power seats, but space -- especially legroom -- is stingy in the rear. While the AMG GLA's main mission is one of performance, like the standard model it has more than a semblance of utility. Fold the seats and it creates 43-plus cubic feet of cargo space. Genuine leather can be had in place of the faux MB-Tex upholstery, but it costs extra. For an even racier feel, Recaro performance front seats are also optional.</p>, <p>The AMG GLA certainly has the same basic form as the standard GLA -- more of stylish, high-riding <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> than traditional SUV -- but a few unique aesthetics point to this one's performance credentials. This compact-performance-crossover SUV has aerodynamic lower bodywork, quad exhaust outlets and an AMG-specific grille. The AMG Night Package throws gloss-black treatments across the body, and if for some reason you want your <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV to have a boy-racer vibe, a rear wing spoiler is available -- with bright yellow accents, no less. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard, as is a power tailgate.</p>, <p>Out the gate, the 2018 Mercedes-AMG GLA 45 comes with a handcrafted engine and a litany of high-performance hardware, from upgraded brakes to a sport exhaust. Other notable features include 14-way-power front seats, power tailgate, dual-zone climate control, and brake assist, in which the car can automatically apply the brakes if it senses a collision. Along with a prominent center screen, other infotainment highlights include AM/FM/CD/HD Radio audio system with dual USB ports and Bluetooth connectivity. The AMG GLA 45 also comes with five years of the mbrace Connect Package, which grants remote access to vehicle functions from your phone.</p>, <p>In addition to performance upgrades, the GLA 45 can be outfitted with a panoramic sunroof, navigation, hands-free tailgate, heated front seats and harman/kardon premium audio. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration are also available, but cost extra. Driver-assist and active safety options include adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist, surround-view camera and Park Pilot, which assists with parallel parking. In-vehicle Wi-Fi is also available, as are various interior and exterior aesthetic packages.</p>, <p>The heart of the 2018 AMG GLA 45 is a small but mighty, handcrafted 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that makes 375 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All this force is transmitted through a 7-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission. Unlike the regular GLA in which front-wheel drive is standard and 4Matic all-wheel drive is optional, all AMG GLA versions have the 4Matic system, and an AMG-enhanced one at that with torque-vectoring. The AMG GLA uses an Eco Start/Stop system that shuts off the engine at idle, such as stoplights. If you find the restarts too abrupt or just don't like the act of your engine stopping, the system can be defeated at the press of a button.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>

That's a significant premium over the standard model, but it’s the second-least expensive Mercedes-AMG model, right after the AMG CLA 45. Fully loaded, the AMG GLA 45 can eclipse the $70,000 mark, a lot of coin for a small-luxury SUV. As <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> doesn't offer an RS Q3 in America and there currently is no high-powered M version of a BMW X1, the AMG GLA 45 sits in a class unto itself among high-performance subcompact-luxury-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>. Before buying yours, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. As for the AMG GLA's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>, as it's a rather small-volume, niche vehicle, number crunchers haven't predicted its residuals.</p>]

[<p>Introduced just last year, the 2-passenger 2018 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT is the German luxury brand’s flagship sports car sitting one notch above the legendary Mercedes SL Roadster. Offered as a coupe or convertible, the new AMG GT is a sophisticated supercar, with everyday civility, rear-wheel drive, an automatic transmission and a turbocharged V8 engine with as much as 577 horsepower. Four models are available with prices starting around $113,500, while the GT R Coupe tops the range at $158,000. Although there are AMG versions of the Mercedes SL with as much or more power, the AMG GT is lighter, harder-edged and it has a more aggressively tuned and better balanced all-aluminum chassis, which gives it superior handling than the softer and more relaxed SL models. Other competitors include the Porsche 911, Aston Martin Vantage and the new Chevy Corvette ZR1.</p>, <p>You’ll like the 2018 Mercedes AMG GT if you’re looking for a sexy 2-seat sports car with big power, thrilling acceleration and the visceral hardcore intensity of a supercar along with the comfort, features and refinement that allow it to be enjoyed every day. It’s an impressive combination of speed, luxury and style.</p>, <p>If your supercar must have all-wheel drive, the rear-wheel-drive Mercedes AMG GT isn’t for you. Porsche offers all-wheel drive on the 911, and it is standard on the Audi R8 and Acura NSX. Also, Mercedes does not offer the AMG GT with a manual transmission, which may bother some driving enthusiasts.</p>, <p>Although the Mercedes AMG GT was all-new just last year, for 2018 Mercedes has updated the sports car’s front-end design with a new more aggressive grille, and it has expanded the range to include four new models, the GT C and GT R Coupes and the GT and GT C Roadsters.</p>, <p>Few cars pack the intensity and performance of the 2018 Mercedes AMG GT. Although it’s civilized enough to be driven daily, and it’ll get you to the office with a smile on your face and endorphins in your bloodstream, this sports car begs for the open road, or even the racetrack. Our AMG GT C test vehicle packed a 550-horsepower twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8, which rumbled like a funny car and provided enough acceleration to impress John Force himself. Mercedes says the 2-seater can sprint from 0-60 mph in just 3.6 seconds, and the 577-horsepower AMG GT R Coupe is even quicker. The 7-speed automatic transmission clicks off gears with a firm hand and it’s quick to respond to your commands when you use the paddle shifters. The driver can select from four modes, including Comfort and Sport+, each manipulating the GT’s throttle response, chassis, stability control and exhaust sound. The steering is quick and the suspension is tuned firm, even in Comfort mode, for razor-sharp reflexes.</p>, <p>COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS<br>
 Using radar, this standard high-tech safety system scans the road ahead looking for obstacles in your path. If it detects a collision is likely, and the driver applies the brakes it automatically maximizes the level of stopping power to prevent the collision or reduce its severity. If the driver does not take action, the system will brake for you at speeds below 65 mph.<br>
<br>
 AIRSCARF VENTILATED HEADRESTS<br>
 This ingenious system is standard on all new AMG GT Roadsters. Through a vent in the seat just below the headrest it blows heated air on your neck, head and shoulders. There’s even a 3-stage temperature control and the airflow adjusts to your driving speed. It works, and when it’s used in combination with the GT’s heated seats, the Mercedes can be enjoyed top down even in the coldest of climates.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes AMG GT is no pretender; this is a true sports car with a driver-focused interior, simple analog gauges and a low seating position. And there isn’t much room inside. If you shop at the big-and-tall stores you’re probably not going to fit comfortably. The seats are narrow and unnecessarily hard, which gives the AMG GT a race-car feel, but some more padding would be nice. The seating position is excellent, but visibility is heavily compromised by a short windshield and thick pillars, which can hide pedestrians dangerously. Fit/finish is excellent, and the infotainment system is easy to use once you get the hang of it. There's also plenty of cargo space, with a 10.1-cubic-foot trunk.</p>, <p>People don’t just stare at this car, they are drawn to it like preteens to Taylor Swift. They gawk, point and take pictures with their phones. Smile, you’re on Instagram. The 2018 Mercedes AMG GT is striking. With its low long hood and short deck, it’s imposing and impressive, and it looks expensive, but it’s also more approachable than many other more exaggerated exotics. Although the Mercedes AMG GT was all-new just last year, for 2018 Mercedes has updated the car’s front-end design with a new more aggressive grille that riffs off the nose of the company’s gullwing 300SL race cars of the 1950s. Nice touch.</p>, <p>With a base price over $113,000 you'd expect the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT to be generously equipped, and you'd be right. Leather upholstery is standard, as are heated power seats with memory, a wind-blocker to help minimize wind-mussed hair and Mercedes' Airscarf neck-level heating system. Also standard is Mercedes-Benz's COMAND system with navigation, Bluetooth and satellite radio, driver-adjustable modes for the engine and suspension, many safety driver aids like Collision Prevention Assist Plus and Pre-Safe. Also notable are heated seats, dual-zone climate controls, parking sensors, a rearview camera, rear-axle steering, a quick power top on Roadster models, LED headlights and an active rear spoiler that deploys and retracts at various speeds.</p>, <p>Our AMG GT C wore almost $20,000 in optional equipment including an AMG Carbon Ceramic Braking system that costs almost $9,000. Other options consisted of a carbon-fiber engine cover to impress your friends at the local Cars and Coffee, a Burmester High End Surround Sound System and Mercedes Distronic Plus adaptive cruise-control system, which can keep a preset safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Mercedes also offers multiple wheel designs, Blind-Spot Assist, lane-departure warning, red brake calipers, carbon-fiber packages to dress up the exterior or interior, heated power-folding outside mirrors, colored seatbelts, keyless entry and engine start and illuminated doorsills.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Mercedes AMG GT is powered by a twin-turbocharged all-aluminum 4.0-liter V8 engine with the turbochargers mounted in the vee of the engine block. And every AMG GT gets a 7-speed automatic transmission. But engine output does vary among the models. The engine makes 469 horsepower in the standard AMG GT Coupe and Roadster. In the AMG GT S Coupe, it gets bumped up to 515 horsepower. In the AMG GT C models, it gets cranked up to 550 horsepower and in the GT R Coupe it’s maxed out at 577 horsepower. If you’re concerned about fuel economy, you’re shopping the wrong car. We averaged 15.2 mpg after a week of mixed driving and every AMG GT is subject to a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.<br>

AMG GT prices start around $113,500 including a $995 destination charge, while the GT R Coupe tops the range at $158,000. Our GT C Roadster had a base price of $157,000 and topped $180,000 with options and the gas-guzzler tax. Thousands more can easily be applied to these figures with even more options, which makes the AMG GT among the priciest Mercedes-Benz models you can buy. With such a wide range of models and prices, the 2018 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT competes with luxury and ultra-luxury coupes and convertibles ranging from the Porsche 911 to the Bentley Continental.

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is the flagship of the German luxury brand, and arguably the benchmark full-size sedan to which others aspire. For decades the S-Class has served as the transportation of choice for the world's wealthy, with each generation building on its reputation of impeccable quality, hushed manners and ample power. Prestige comes standard. Known mostly as a sedan, the S-Class is even more over the top in 2-door form as a massive coupe or cabriolet. Mercedes-AMG variants (reviewed separately) bring substantial performance, while those seeking extravagance on another level will get it in spades in the ultra-luxurious Maybach variants. A new V6-powered base model arrives for 2018 with a lower price, but at nearly $91,000, it's anything but cheap.</p>, <p>You know you've arrived. If the rest of the world hasn't caught on, they surely will when they see you in a new S-Class. This flagship Mercedes is a rolling testament to monetary success. Aside from prestige, the 2018 S-Class remains a fantastic car both to drive and to be driven in.</p>, <p>If the S-Class' nearly 6-figure cost gives you pause, you might consider the all-new Lexus LS, Genesis G90, Acura RLX or Volvo S90, all of which can be had for far less. The S-Class' archrival BMW 7 Series also begins about $10,000 less. Also all-new is the Audi A8, which promises a higher level of self-driving capability.</p>, <p>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class lineup gets a mid-cycle refresh for 2018 that includes a new V6 base model called the S 450, while S 560 models receive a new, more powerful V8. A host of active safety and driver-assistance features also come to the S-Class, bringing Level 2 autonomous-driving capabilities. All models receive interior and exterior updates, and the world-first Energizing Comfort system that aims to bring comfort, vitality and even joy to the driver via climate, fragrance and seat massage.</p>, <p>No matter which S-Class you choose, it's like piloting prominence on wheels. The question is to what degree do you want it? Starting with the new S 450, even in base form the 362-horsepower V6 has more than adequate muscle to hustle this full-size luxury sedan. The 0-60-mph mark arrives in just around five seconds, which not long ago was sports-car territory. Still, there's something natural about a V8 S-Class, and the 463-horsepower S 560 has all the scoot you'll likely ever need. Yet for those who need more -- in so many ways -- there's the V12-powered Mercedes-Maybach S 650, which drips with locomotive-like torque. Power aside, the non-AMG S-Class isn't all that lithe, and it's not for flinging about. It is at its best quietly shuffling driver and passenger about with serenity and stretching. Better yet, let it do the driving. We did just that escaping Manhattan. With the adaptive cruise and steering-assist systems on, the S-Class literally drove us up the Henry Hudson Parkway, pacing the vehicle ahead, even when it came to a complete stop, and steering as needed. As if that weren't enough, it gave a massage while doing so. Later, in higher-speed situations and along narrower roads in Connecticut, the S-Class tended to drift in lanes more than we liked, so we intervened. We're not quite at the point where the cars can replicate human drivers, but the S-Class is another step forward in that march.</p>, <p>ENERGIZING COMFORT CONTROL<br>
Called a world-first feature, this system aims to refresh, relax or invigorate the driver through six programs. Select one, and the S-Class plays mood music, adjusts the climate control and in-cabin fragrance system optimal settings, and activates the seat massage. One of them even guides you through stretching exercises behind the wheel.<br>
<br>
4-PLACE SEATING<br>
If you're more inclined to be chauffeured in an S-Class sedan, this is the option for you. It replaces the 3-person rear bench with two individual seats with power adjustment, including a footrest for the right seat. Similar to first-class seating in a jet, each seat has a folding tray table and even heated and cooled cup holders.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Ultra-luxury sedans from Rolls-Royce and Bentley withstanding, the S-Class cabin remains one of the most opulent available. (And in Mercedes-Maybach form, it can even make a case against those fabled British land yachts.) Just about every touch point is covered in quality material made from leather, wood or metal. Even the aroma of the cabin itself is special, thanks to the standard Air Balance fragrance system with a replaceable vial of olfactory serum in the glove box. The standard 12.3-inch central display is impressive, and doubly so if you add the twin screen next to it as the instrument cluster. The 2018 S-Class sedan offers laudable rear-seat room, and even more can be had in the long-wheelbase Mercedes-Maybach, which boasts two individual rear seats. By their nature, the S-Class coupe and convertible are tighter in back but still respectable for a 4-seater. One of the few complaints we have is the lack of sliding sun visors.</p>, <p>The S-Class receives minor exterior updates for 2018, but as a whole retains its stateliness-on-wheels motif. It's big, elegant and still relatively conservative -- not a bad thing in our eyes. Not one for huge grilles or unnecessary exterior extravagances, the S-Class' remains handsomely understated. New for 2018 are freshened bumpers, "triple-torch" headlights and LED taillights with what Mercedes calls a "stardust" effect. All models receive a new grille that was formerly reserved for V12 S-Class models. At 206.5 inches in length, you'll want to make sure the garage has been adequately prepared for this Mercedes’ arrival. At just under 200 inches, the S-Class coupe and Cabriolet are slightly smaller yet still grand for a 2-door car. Larger still is the Mercedes-Maybach, whose extended wheelbase translates to a total length of nearly 215 inches.</p>, <p>In its least expensive state as the S 450, the Mercedes S-Class sedan boasts a lot of car for what is still a lot of money. Included are air suspension, heated 16-way-power front seats, leather upholstery, power trunk operation, soft-close doors, dual-zone climate control and five years of Mercedes' mbrace Connect service that lets you check on and control certain functions via your phone. Standard infotainment includes a 12.3-inch central screen, navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a great-sounding Burmester audio system. A host of safety features comes standard, including lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking and a system that monitors for driver drowsiness.</p>, <p>From a rear-seat refrigerator to in-car Wi-Fi and massaging seats, there's barely enough room on the Internet to list the available options for an S-Class. We'll attempt to highlight some of the most relevant, such as the Driver Assistance Package that bundles a host of semi-autonomous driving features that will pace the car in front of you and even steer. Another recommendation is the Premium Package that bundles surround-view camera, ventilated and massaging front seats, hands-free trunk opening, power rear sun blinds and parking assistant. Other options range from heated steering wheel and armrests to sporty AMG-line styling.</p>, <p>Three engines are available for the 2018 S-Class, not including the AMG performance models (reviewed separately). Starting with the new S 450 is a twin-turbo V6 that comes standard in rear-wheel-drive (RWD) form or optional all-wheel drive (AWD), which Mercedes calls 4Matic. S 560 models receive a new V8, a twin-turbo 4.0 that replaces the previous 4.7-liter V8. Those, too, can be had in RWD or AWD form. A V12 engine remains available in the Mercedes-Maybach 650, which is rear-drive only. No diesels are in the offering, but a new plug-in hybrid S-Class is in the works. That model, the S 560e is set to go on sale in mid-2019.<br/> <b><br/> </b>3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 (S 450)<br/> 362 horsepower @ 5,500-6,000 rpm<br/> 369 lb-ft of torque @ 1,800-4,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/28 mpg (RWD), 18/28 mpg (AWD)<br/> <b><br/> </b>4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 (Mercedes-Benz S 560 and Mercedes-Maybach S 560)<br/> 463 horsepower @ 5,250-5,500 rpm<br/> 516 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000-4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/27 mpg (AWD, S 560), 16/25 mpg (AWD Mercedes-Maybach S 560)<br/> <b><br/> </b>6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 (Mercedes-Maybach S 650)<br/> 621 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 738 lb-ft of torque @ 2,300-4,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A</p>, <p>With the introduction of the new S 450, owning a Mercedes S-Class just got a little less expensive but by no means easy. With a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of just under $91,000, the S-Class' starting price remains farther out of reach than the starting prices of rivals such as the BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS and Jaguar XJ. Costs climb significantly as you climb trims and add options. The V8-powered S 560, for example, starts around $100,000, while an S-Class Coupe is upward of $120,000 and an S-Class Cabriolet will set you back over $130,000. Then there are the ultra-luxurious Mercedes-Maybach models, which start around $170,000 for an S 560 sedan and nearly $200,000 for the V12-powered Mercedes-Maybach S 650. Whichever model you're thinking of, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Mercedes. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class' resale value is expected to be fair, but trail the higher residuals of the Lexus LS and Porsche Panamera.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz SL is the flagship roadster from the German luxury brand. With roots dating back six decades, the SL boasts high-end class, gracious performance and a distinguished history. Today’s SL, though, is thoroughly modern. It features robust technology and amenities, with the ability to automatically keep you in lanes while massaging your back. This 2-seat convertible stands out against potential competitors such as the Porsche 911 and Jaguar F-Type not just for its more substantial size and comfier driving manners, but in that it’s essentially two cars in one. Thanks to a retractable hardtop, the SL transforms from coupe to convertible in seconds. At nearly $90,000 for a base V6 model, the SL also guarantees envy and exclusivity.</p>, <p>If power and prestige are as important to you as comfort and luxurious accouterments, they all converge in the 2018 Mercedes SL. Equally beneficial is a retracting hardtop roof that morphs the SL from secure coupe to wind-in-your-hair convertible. Even higher-power Mercedes-AMG models are available (and reviewed separately).</p>, <p>If a price that begins near -- and can easily exceed -- six figures doesn’t already deter you from the Mercedes-Benz SL, you may reconsider if you crave a purer sports car rather than a grand tourer. If that’s the case, the Porsche 911 and Jaguar F-Type offer more edge.</p>, <p>There are only minor updates for the 2018 Mercedes-Benz SL. Among them are a standard rearview camera for SL 450 models and an AMG sport steering wheel in leather/Dinamica that’s standard across the model line.</p>, <p>Despite having two seats and a long hood that packs a turbocharged V6 or V8, the Mercedes-Benz SL isn’t a sports car per se. Yes, it can rip from 0 to 60 mph in the 4-second range, but razor-sharp handling isn’t its calling card, nor has it ever been. This is a grand touring machine with grace, presence and power. This flagship Mercedes convertible is as much about luxury and comfort as it is performance. It won’t out-handle a Porsche on a mountain road, but for weekend trips and -- let’s be honest -- even everyday driving, you’ll likely appreciate its sense of ease far more. The SL’s optional Active Body Control virtually eliminates body roll, while driving aids like adaptive cruise control with steering pilot take some of the stress out of commuting. The standard 9-speed automatic transmission is among the more refined of its type that we’ve tested. The standard 4-mode Dynamic Select system makes a notable difference in the behavior and feel of the transmission, steering and throttle, especially when switching from Comfort to Sport+.</p>, <p>BITURBO V6 ENGINE<br>
 Upgraded in power just last year, the V6-powered 2018 SL 450 closes the gap between it and the V8-powered SL 550. Moreover, it’s $24,000 less than a base 550. Among SL models, it’s a Mercedes-Benz bargain.<br>
<br>
 MAGIC SKY CONTROL<br>
 This feature, a $2,500 option, remains one of the coolest tricks we’ve seen on a car. At the touch of a button, Magic Sky Control instantaneously alters the transparency of the SL’s glass roof panel, changing from light to dark to let in or keep out sunlight depending on your preference.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The SL roadster has yet to receive the lavish, flush-mounted switchgear and massive display screens of its siblings like the S-Class Cabriolet, but it’s luxurious nonetheless. Sixteen-way power-operated seats with sun-reflecting leather upholstery are supportive and functional. Even those over 6-feet tall can be comfortable, a rarity in roadsters. Cabin storage is at a premium, but there’s plenty in the trunk -- a usable 13.5 cubic feet that can accommodate two golf bags (you are driving this to the country club, right?). Back inside, we recommend treating yourself to the Airscarf system that blows warm air on your neck. It gives further reason to drop the top on a chilly evening.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz SL is among the rare convertibles that look equally good with the top up or down. That’s because its retractable top is made of metal instead of fabric. In the up position, the SL looks like a traditional coupe. Lowered, it’s a sun-seeking status statement. Even with the top up, there’s a sense of airiness thanks to a standard glass panorama roof. Up front, the Mercedes SL honors its forebears with a long, sleek hood and a taut tail. An update for 2017 freshened the front-end styling, keeping the latest SL looking sharp and elegant.</p>, <p>As expected of a luxury convertible costing nearly $90,000, even a base Mercedes-Benz SL 450 comes highly equipped. Notable standard features include leather upholstery, heated and 16-way power seats, dual-zone climate control, power trunk, universal garage remote, and 19-inch wheels. The Mercedes SL’s COMAND infotainment system bundles a central high-res display with navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and a 600-watt harman/kardon audio system with 6-disc CD player, dual USB inputs and Bluetooth streaming. Standard safety systems include eight airbags, rollbars that instantly deploy in a rollover, a system that monitors for driver drowsiness, and another system that can automatically stop the car if a frontal collision appears imminent. In addition to a V8 engine, SL 550 models have massaging front seats that are also ventilated, the Airscarf neck-heating system, hands-free power trunk, and power-operated soft-close doors.</p>, <p>As is the norm for a European luxury car, there are numerous ways to enhance the 2018 Mercedes SL-Class. Standout stand-alone options include the Magic Sky Control (see Favorite Features), a wood and leather steering wheel, and a wonderful Bang &amp; Olufsen audio system. An in-car Wi-Fi system is also available. Packages include driver-assistance features like blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and active lane-keeping assist. Optional on the SL 450 (and standard on the SL 550) is the Premium Package with massaging and ventilated seats, hands-free trunk, Airscarf, and a parking-assist system that can parallel park the car.</p>, <p>The Mercedes SL 450 uses a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 that makes 362 horsepower and enables 0-60-mph runs of 4.9 seconds. That’s quicker than most drivers will ever need, but for those craving a traditional V8, the SL 550 houses a 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 good for 449 horsepower and a 0-60-mph run of 4.3 seconds. Even faster are the Mercedes-AMG variants, the top of which has a 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12. Those variants are reviewed separately. The SL 450 and SL 550 use a 9-speed automatic transmission, and keep tradition with standard rear-wheel drive. To save fuel, a start/stop system shuts off the engine at idle, such as at stoplights. If you find the restarts annoying, the system can be deactivated with the press of a button.<br>

That’s hardly cheap, but quite a bit less than a V8-powered Mercedes SL 550, which begins at $113,295. Of course, add some options and these prices can easily rise by thousands. There are few direct rivals to the SL, but for comparison a Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet, which features a fabric top vs. the Mercedes’ hardtop, starts over $104,000. On the higher end of the scale, a Maserati GranTurismo convertible starts over $150,000, while a Bentley Continental begins over $220,000. On the lower end are the Jaguar F-Type and the SL’s own smaller brother, the Mercedes-Benz SLK, also a hardtop convertible. Before indulging in your luxury convertible, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Mercedes SL’s resale value isn’t particularly good, and at these prices its depreciation is sizable after just a few years.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/mini/clubman/2018
[<p>The 2018 Mini Clubman is the next size up from the Hardtop, the smallest car in the marque’s portfolio. It’s even bigger than the 4-door Hardtop -- about a foot longer and a few inches wider. Much of that length is in the wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear axles), which translates to a smoother ride. The extra width also benefits interior volume and handling stability. So the Clubman has space, but stays low to the ground (unlike the Countryman), which is where anyone who wants to enjoy this excellent chassis needs to be. Like other Mini vehicles, the Clubman is more upscale than the usual Fords and Hondas, which is reflected in the pricing. It also comes with a dizzying number of options.</p>, <p>The idea of a Mini -- with its entertaining chassis and inimitable style -- has great appeal, but you also need sufficient space for kids, kin, kits and/or caboodles. Not that the 2018 Clubman is minivan-sized, but it does bring an appreciable amount of practicality to complement its cornering talents.</p>, <p>…you’re a frequent rear-seat passenger. Among the Clubman’s few downsides is a back seat that’s not so well shaped or well cushioned. Pricing can also inflate quickly from its $26,000 starting point. The cheaper VW Golf SportWagen has more space and standard power, plus optional all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>A rearview camera and rear parking sensors are now standard throughout the range. As is a driver-attentiveness assistant. There’s been a revision and rationalization of the fuel gauge and some switchgear. And Apple CarPlay smartphone integration becomes part of the optional Technology package.</p>, <p>The new Mini Clubman has matured from its original incarnation, but is still lively and engaging. In regular form, this is one of the best-handling front-drive setups around, with an eagerness to transition from left to right to left again. All-wheel drive can still retain most of this agility. Acceleration with the 3-cylinder version is merely adequate, though; it takes nine seconds to saunter from a standstill to 60 mph. For buyers wanting all-wheel drive, this isn’t the best engine to pair with it. At the other end of the spectrum, the John Cooper Works version has a thrilling amount of zip to go with its stiffer sport suspension. Most people will find the Cooper S Clubman hits many right notes in terms of power, ride quality, refinement, equipment and price.</p>, <p>POWERED REAR DOORS<br/> There are powered tailgates on wagons, SUVs and <a alt_o_t="Minivans" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/minivans-new/2000010764/">minivans</a>, but this is the first time we've seen powered swing-out doors. Not only are they handy, they’re cool to watch. Even more impressive, they can open automatically with a mere motion of a foot -- great for when your hands are full.<br/> <br/> INDIVIDUALITY AND COMMUNITY<br/> Thanks to the styling, driving experience and the scope for personalization, Mini cars have character and a special appeal. It attracts a certain buyer, people who tend to be more gregarious and outgoing than average. This has resulted in a camaraderie and regular get-togethers like Mini Takes the States.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Clubman is classified as midsize by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). So despite the company name, there should be no qualms about adequate space. Even an adult male of average size could sit in the back and not complain about room for head or knees. Cargo space is similarly accommodating, with 17.5 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expanding to 47.9 cubic feet when they’re folded down. The cabin’s refined vibe comes courtesy of soft-touch plastics, premium switchgear and decent sound deadening. The touch/rotary controller below the center display is derived from BMW, Mini’s parent company.</p>, <p>Up front, the Mini Clubman wears the usual house design, while the back is distinguished by a pair of doors that swing out barn-style. Mini ditched the previous generation’s awkward rear-hinged door on the passenger side for four proper doors this time around. The hotter S model sports a special front-end treatment as well as dual exhaust pipes with chrome tips, while the hottest JCW Clubman has bespoke front and rear fascias, plus a racy red stripe across the grille.</p>, <p>The entry-level 2018 Clubman has a 3-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual transmission. Things improve from there with 16-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, selectable driving modes (Eco, Normal, Sport), keyless ignition, simulated leather upholstery, ambient cabin lighting, plus an infotainment system with a 6.5-inch color display, app support, Bluetooth audio streaming, USB port, and voice control. The Cooper S has a gutsier engine, sport seats, bigger wheels, fog lights, and black Leatherette seats. The Clubman JCW has the most powerful engine and an array of performance extras.</p>, <p>Mini claims 10 million permutations to make each of its cars as individual as possible. Among the many extras are hood stripes, LED fog lights, dual-pane sunroof, head-up display, premium harman/kardon audio system, and choices of alloy wheel designs. Apple CarPlay is part of the Technology package, but that also brings other desirable items like navigation, head-up display, 8.8-inch touch screen, and parking sensors up front. Then there’s the consideration of which engine to have and whether all-wheel drive is required. The transmission is an easier decision; an automatic is available in all trims.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Clubman is available in base, Cooper S and John Cooper Works models. Base versions have a turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder engine, connected to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Cooper S Clubman has a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. Its 189 horsepower goes through either the 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. The JCW Clubman also uses a 2.0-liter turbo-4, but it’s tuned here for 228 horsepower. With a standstill-to-60-mph time of six seconds flat, it's the fastest of the three. All engines require premium fuel. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard. All-wheel drive (AWD) is optional on base and Cooper S models, but standard with the JCW.<br>

Quite alluring for such style, fun and practicality. However, prices rise quickly. The more powerful Cooper S costs about $29,500, while the range-topping JCW Clubman ALL4 starts at just under $37,000 -- beyond BMW X1 territory. And that’s before options, which can add thousands more. Such is the cost of owning something as distinctive as a Mini. There are slightly larger, more practical cars like the Honda Civic and Mazda3 hatchbacks, or the Volkswagen Golf SportWagen, all for thousands less, but they can’t offer the flair and community that come with a Mini. Before racing to the dealer, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. The Clubman's resale value is expected to hold up quite well.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/mini/convertible/2018
[<p>When Mini returned to the U.S. market more than 15 years ago, it single-handedly transformed our perception of subcompact cars, proving they could be aspirational fashion statements and not just penalty boxes. Now, the 2018 Mini Cooper is practically a car line unto itself, boasting multiple engine configurations, 2-door and 4-door body styles, and even a convertible. All the engines are turbocharged, and from the lowly base model all the way to the zippy John Cooper Works editions, they're fun to drive. Sure, other subcompact cars out there like the Honda Fit, Kia Rio, Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic cost thousands less and are arguably more practical. But none of those cars offer the customization, premium appeal, driving delight and outright charm inherent in every Mini.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Hardtop makes it easy and fun to stand out from the crowd. Offering tons of charm at a price starting at about $22,500, the Mini Cooper is already cleverly packaged and cool. The equally enjoyable Convertible is one of the least expensive ways to enjoy open-air motoring.</p>, <p>Even the 4-door model with its 5-passenger seating isn't particularly roomy in the back, so if you regularly transport many adults, the Mini isn't a good call, as implied by its name. Additionally, this BMW sub-brand starts higher than other subcompacts, and the price escalates quickly with options.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Cooper lineup benefits from enhancements Mini has made to all its cars for the new year. All get a rearview camera and parking sensors, for example, and there's a new fuel gauge, and other detail changes.</p>, <p>Even the base Mini Cooper Hardtop 2 Door with its turbocharged 3-cylinder engine is enjoyable to drive. Granted, by today's standards 7.3 seconds to 60 mph isn't exactly fast, but it's quick enough, and the turbocharged 4-cylinders in the Cooper S or, even better, the John Cooper Works edition are even quicker, whether you choose the automatic or the short-throw 6-speed manual transmission. All Minis benefit from a suspension that's set up for fun driving, with quick steering and a tossable chassis that makes carving back roads genuinely enjoyable. Of course, getting to those back roads means driving down the highway, and here the Mini falters a bit. That quick steering that's so fun on a mountain road makes the Mini feel twitchy and nervous on the highway. The sporty suspension results in a rough ride. And there's no avoiding the road noise at speed.</p>, <p>SMILES PER GALLON<br/> The 2018 Mini Cooper, like its predecessors, has a long tradition of doing more with less, and that includes fuel economy. All Mini models achieve fuel economy in the 30-mpg range, and the miserly 3-cylinder in the base 2018 Cooper Hardtop hits the 38-mpg mark.<br/> <br/> 3-IN-1 CONVERTIBLE ROOF<br/> The Mini Convertible is actually three cars in one. With the top closed, it's a coupe, and opened fully it’s a convertible. But in addition, there's a half-open mode that offers a sweet and airy in-between that slides the front portion of the fabric back like a panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Cooper Hardtop and Convertible have just the right blend of modern technology and retro kitsch. The big center display has the 6.5-inch infotainment screen, and below it are toggles and switches that look retro, but control modern functions. The front seats are thankfully one area where Mini has left things modern, and these comfy chairs are complemented by clever packaging and even an available head-up display on the windshield. Hardtop 2 Door and Convertible models can seat two in the rear, while the 4 Door can seat three across, although the center position is a tight fit.</p>, <p>Mini says the Cooper's stance looks like a bulldog, but in the low-and-squat way, not snorting and drooling. It's also why the Cooper handles so well. The 2 Door and 4 Door Hardtops are conventional hatchbacks, while the Convertible's meager cargo area is accessed with a tailgate that can be used for tailgating. An "easy-load" feature lifts the lower portion of the fabric roof to create a wider opening, although it's hard to get it back in place, so maybe just pack light. The Hardtop 4 Door is about six inches longer than the 2 Door, at a tidy 157.4 inches.</p>, <p>A rearview camera is standard this year on all Mini models. It adds to the turbocharged 3-cylinder engine, 6-way manually adjustable Leatherette seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 6.5-inch Visual Boost Screen audio and information system, and automatic climate control on hardtop models. Convertibles get a power top. Sportier Cooper S models get a more powerful 4-cylinder turbo engine, sporty seats, run-flat tires, LED fog lights, larger wheels and tires and bigger brakes, and add features like a hood scoop. The high-performance John Cooper Works editions get an even more powerful version of the 4-cylinder, even bigger brakes and a stiffer sport suspension.</p>, <p>Minis are almost endlessly customizable when it comes to interior and exterior aesthetics, and with Mini boasting more than 10 million different combinations, we'll just let you play with the online configurator. Instead, note that you can also get a 6-speed automatic transmission for all models, in addition to a navigation system, head-up display that projects driving information onto the windshield, an excellent harman/kardon premium audio system, and adjustable shocks to cut down on some of the harsh ride. An Active Driving Assistant features adaptive cruise control, plus it can warn of an impending forward collision, and even apply the brakes.</p>, <p>With just a turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder engine under the hood, the base Mini Cooper still gets 134 horsepower, which isn't bad at all. If you upgrade to the Cooper S you'll get a 189-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, and that same engine in the John Cooper Works edition offered on the 2-door Hardtop and Convertible puts out 228 horsepower, making it the most powerful Mini you can get. Every engine routes power to the front wheels, either through a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic. While it's true that Minis sip fuel, it's a good thing, since all of them require premium-grade gas.<br>

Convertible base prices start at more than $27,500; the S Convertible at more than $31,000; and the JCW starts at nearly $37,500. Options inflate those prices more quickly than you'd expect. Other compact hatchbacks like the Honda Fit, Kia Rio, Chevrolet Sonic and Hyundai Accent and Veloster cost less, but they aren't really direct competitors, either.

---------http://www.kbb.com/mini/countryman/2018
[<p>As the largest member of the Mini family, the 2018 Cooper Countryman combines the brilliant driving dynamics of its smaller companions with a roomy and versatile interior. Befitting its off-road image, the Countryman also has more ground clearance than the other Mini models. From its iconic styling to its retro interior, the Countryman displays a level of refinement and capability uncommon in a Mini. Fresh from its redesign last year, the Countryman appeals to Mini fans with a more adventurous side, those who may be considering a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/compass/">Jeep Compass</a> but would rather stay with the British brand. The Countryman also now offers a plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model with a 65-MPGe rating.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Countryman delivers Mini style, comfort and driving enjoyment in a larger package that is more amenable to the needs of families on the go. The upscale interior and amenities will impress, as will options such as the John Cooper Works package and available all-wheel drive.<b></b></p>, <p>The Countryman is a unique prospect in that it doesn’t ride as comfortably as most compact-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> and costs significantly more than similarly equipped rivals. You’ll find better off-road performance from a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jeep/">Jeep</a> SUV, and a larger dealer network as well.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Countryman gains a few new features this year. The Head-up Display switch has been relocated to the touch screen, and the fuel gauge is redesigned. Along with a John Cooper Works package, a new Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid joins the line.</p>, <p>Even with its added size and ground clearance, the Countryman delivers all the go-kart-like moves expected of a car wearing the Mini badge. The steering is quick and responsive, the handling like running on rails. It takes only a few moments on a winding mountain road to fall in love with this car. While the standard 3-cylinder engine is fine for daily commutes, you’ll really want the added power from either the 2.0-liter turbo or the new plug-in hybrid. With 189 and 221 horsepower respectively, both engines offer a more engaging drive with really no penalty in fuel economy. And of course, there’s the 228-horsepower John Cooper Works option, but that pushes the price up another $8,000. In the S model, we found a nicely composed vehicle with strong acceleration, a rather stiff ride and, when fitted with all-wheel drive, the sure-footedness of a mountain goat wearing cleats.</p>, <p>SECOND-ROW SEATING<br/> Unlike the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mini/hardtop/">Mini Hardtop</a>, the Countryman offers a roomy and comfortable rear seat. With plenty of legroom, even taller occupants will feel at home, and the 40/20/40 seat not only slides fore and aft, it can be folded, reclined or tilted as well.<br/> <br/> MINI TECH<br/> Along with its advanced navigation, head-up display, available Apple CarPlay and wireless charging pad, the Countryman also features cool details like a programmable LED ring that mirrors audio volume changes, mimics the tachometer’s movement and works in conjunction with the forward-collision systems.<br/> </p>, <p>Mini’s Countryman is based on a larger platform than its predecessor, making the cabin roomier than ever before. The second row has four inches more legroom, and its seat slides, reclines and folds, and offers a 40/20/40-split to accommodate people and cargo. Materials’ quality and tech features are first-rate. Options like quilted leather seating, panoramic sunroof, smartphone charging, a head-up display and a new navigation system bring the Countryman more in line with <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> models than mainstream ones. But there's still plenty of Mini in this Countryman, with accent lighting, oversized displays and toggle switches.</p>, <p>In the Mini world, the Countryman looks least like the archetype 2-door Hardtop. But that doesn't mean it doesn’t look like a Mini at all; it's as if the Mini were stretched and lifted. The 2018 Countryman has a more expressive face, a longer hood and longer rear end. The cargo-area features include a power tailgate and a fold-out picnic cushion. You may see Countrymen roam the streets, but chances are you haven't seen many that are identical. According to Mini, there are more than 10 million ways to customize a Mini, and a large percentage of buyers do just that.</p>, <p>The Countryman comes standard with a 3-cylinder engine, a 6-speed manual transmission and front-wheel drive (FWD). A panoramic sunroof (which can be deleted if you don't want it) and dual-zone climate control come with every Mini, as do the sliding rear seats. All Countrymen also come with eight airbags, 17-inch wheels, automatic headlights, Bluetooth, rearview camera and rear park distance control, Attentiveness Assist, automatic rain-sensing wipers, a 6.5-inch screen with Mini Connected, and Mini's selectable Green, Normal and Sport driving modes.</p>, <p>Countryman buyers can opt for the 4-cylinder engine, an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive (AWD). While some options are available as stand-alone items, most are part of packages. Some packages are the Cold Weather Package (including heated seats), Premium Package (where you can get power seats and power tailgate), Technology Package (key features are the navigation system, Apple CarPlay, wireless smartphone charging and head-up display), Sport Package (with 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and fog lights, sport seats and dynamic damper control) -- or you can get the Fully Loaded Package, which includes it all.</p>, <p>The idea of a 3-cylinder engine powering a Mini <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV may ring some alarm bells, but the 1.5-liter turbo-3 that comes standard with the Countryman has more horsepower than the engine in the 2016 base model, and almost as much torque as the previous Cooper Countryman S. It isn't quick, but it's faster than you'd think. It's backed by a 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic or 8-speed automatic, all of which are programmed to wring out every bit of this engine's power. Most will likely choose the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, to get more power and somewhat comparable fuel economy. With the four, you can choose a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic with or without paddle shifters. The new plug-in hybrid uses the 2.0-liter engine paired with an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor for a combined 221 horsepower.

[<p>When Mini returned to the U.S. market more than 15 years ago, it single-handedly transformed our perception of subcompact cars, proving they could be aspirational fashion statements and not just penalty boxes. Now, the 2018 Mini Cooper is practically a car line unto itself, boasting multiple engine configurations, 2-door and 4-door body styles, and even a convertible. All the engines are turbocharged, and from the lowly base model all the way to the zippy John Cooper Works editions, they're fun to drive. Sure, other subcompact cars out there like the Honda Fit, Kia Rio, Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic cost thousands less and are arguably more practical. But none of those cars offer the customization, premium appeal, driving delight and outright charm inherent in every Mini.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Hardtop makes it easy and fun to stand out from the crowd. Offering tons of charm at a price starting at about $22,500, the Mini Cooper is already cleverly packaged and cool. The equally enjoyable Convertible is one of the least expensive ways to enjoy open-air motoring.</p>, <p>Even the 4-door model with its 5-passenger seating isn't particularly roomy in the back, so if you regularly transport many adults, the Mini isn't a good call, as implied by its name. Additionally, this BMW sub-brand starts higher than other subcompacts, and the price escalates quickly with options.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Cooper lineup benefits from enhancements Mini has made to all its cars for the new year. All get a rearview camera and parking sensors, for example, and there's a new fuel gauge, and other detail changes.</p>, <p>Even the base Mini Cooper Hardtop 2 Door with its turbocharged 3-cylinder engine is enjoyable to drive. Granted, by today's standards 7.3 seconds to 60 mph isn't exactly fast, but it's quick enough, and the turbocharged 4-cylinders in the Cooper S or, even better, the John Cooper Works edition are even quicker, whether you choose the automatic or the short-throw 6-speed manual transmission. All Minis benefit from a suspension that's set up for fun driving, with quick steering and a tossable chassis that makes carving back roads genuinely enjoyable. Of course, getting to those back roads means driving down the highway, and here the Mini falters a bit. That quick steering that's so fun on a mountain road makes the Mini feel twitchy and nervous on the highway. The sporty suspension results in a rough ride. And there's no avoiding the road noise at speed.</p>, <p>SMILES PER GALLON<br/> The 2018 Mini Cooper, like its predecessors, has a long tradition of doing more with less, and that includes fuel economy. All Mini models achieve fuel economy in the 30-mpg range, and the miserly 3-cylinder in the base 2018 Cooper Hardtop hits the 38-mpg mark.<br/> <br/> 3-IN-1 CONVERTIBLE ROOF<br/> The Mini Convertible is actually three cars in one. With the top closed, it's a coupe, and opened fully it’s a convertible. But in addition, there's a half-open mode that offers a sweet and airy in-between that slides the front portion of the fabric back like a panoramic sunroof.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mini Cooper Hardtop and Convertible have just the right blend of modern technology and retro kitsch. The big center display has the 6.5-inch infotainment screen, and below it are toggles and switches that look retro, but control modern functions. The front seats are thankfully one area where Mini has left things modern, and these comfy chairs are complemented by clever packaging and even an available head-up display on the windshield. Hardtop 2 Door and Convertible models can seat two in the rear, while the 4 Door can seat three across, although the center position is a tight fit.</p>, <p>Mini says the Cooper's stance looks like a bulldog, but in the low-and-squat way, not snorting and drooling. It's also why the Cooper handles so well. The 2 Door and 4 Door Hardtops are conventional hatchbacks, while the Convertible's meager cargo area is accessed with a tailgate that can be used for tailgating. An "easy-load" feature lifts the lower portion of the fabric roof to create a wider opening, although it's hard to get it back in place, so maybe just pack light. The Hardtop 4 Door is about six inches longer than the 2 Door, at a tidy 157.4 inches.</p>, <p>A rearview camera is standard this year on all Mini models. It adds to the turbocharged 3-cylinder engine, 6-way manually adjustable Leatherette seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 6.5-inch Visual Boost Screen audio and information system, and automatic climate control on hardtop models. Convertibles get a power top. Sportier Cooper S models get a more powerful 4-cylinder turbo engine, sporty seats, run-flat tires, LED fog lights, larger wheels and tires and bigger brakes, and add features like a hood scoop. The high-performance John Cooper Works editions get an even more powerful version of the 4-cylinder, even bigger brakes and a stiffer sport suspension.</p>, <p>Minis are almost endlessly customizable when it comes to interior and exterior aesthetics, and with Mini boasting more than 10 million different combinations, we'll just let you play with the online configurator. Instead, note that you can also get a 6-speed automatic transmission for all models, in addition to a navigation system, head-up display that projects driving information onto the windshield, an excellent harman/kardon premium audio system, and adjustable shocks to cut down on some of the harsh ride. An Active Driving Assistant features adaptive cruise control, plus it can warn of an impending forward collision, and even apply the brakes.</p>, <p>With just a turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder engine under the hood, the base Mini Cooper still gets 134 horsepower, which isn't bad at all. If you upgrade to the Cooper S you'll get a 189-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, and that same engine in the John Cooper Works edition offered on the 2-door Hardtop and Convertible puts out 228 horsepower, making it the most powerful Mini you can get. Every engine routes power to the front wheels, either through a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic.

[<p>Mitsubishi already had the compact-SUV segment surrounded with the Outlander and Outlander Sport, but the all-new 2018 Eclipse Cross finally gives it a player on the inside. Priced and sized to better compete with the CR-V, RAV4, Rogue and the rest, the 5-passenger Eclipse Cross is set to battle those Goliaths with a lower starting price, distinctive styling and one of the segment’s best warranties. Below-average predicted resale values will be a barrier for big-picture buyers, but the Eclipse Cross is not without its charms.</p>, <p>Bold style, excellent warranty coverage and a better-than-some tech offering are three key strengths for the Eclipse Cross.</p>, <p>Shoppers interested in the 2018 Eclipse Cross as a lower-priced alternative to segment leaders could ultimately be let down by the low predicted resale values. It’s not as roomy as most of the others, either.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is an all-new model.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi vehicles have long delivered above-average driving feel, and the Eclipse Cross continues the tradition. It isn’t the peppiest SUV in its segment, but good pedal and steering feel help to deliver a satisfying driving experience overall. A small turning radius makes it easy to negotiate tight parking lots, but the vehicle’s sleek profile inhibits rear visibility when backing out. This is less of a problem on the range-topping SEL, which features a multi-view rear camera and rear cross-traffic alert, among other helpers. The 1.5-liter turbo-4 delivers adequate oomph for highway merging and passing, but nothing more than that.</p>, <p>MITSUBISHI CONNECT<br>
 Debuting on the 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross, the subscription-based Mitsubishi Connect telematics system offers a wide array of services including automatic collision notification, remote door lock/unlock, and parental notifications including location, speed and curfew alerts.<br>
<br>
 WARRANTY<br>
 Mitsubishi offers one of the best warranties in the business: a 5-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty that’s fully transferable to subsequent owners, plus 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain coverage.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is among the smaller entries in the compact-SUV segment, but it’s pretty well packed with an appealing collection of standard and available features. While cargo and passenger room are both below the category averages, a sliding/reclining/split-folding rear seat helps to reshape the interior according to the needs of the day. Available feature highlights include a panoramic sunroof, heated rear seats, a head-up display and an upgraded infotainment system that features a console-mounted touch-pad controller like those found more often on luxury models. We found the passenger cabin attractive and comfortable overall.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is an unusually styled entry in the compact-SUV segment, a distinction that’s sure to be among the vehicle’s biggest draws for some, and a non-starter for others. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all. Compared to its more upright competitors, the Eclipse Cross’s sloping rear gives it a profile slightly more reminiscent of the sportier, coupe-like SUV variants gaining traction in luxury segments.</p>, <p>At its starting sticker price of $24,425, the front-wheel-drive 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross ES features a 7-inch touch-screen audio system, rearview camera, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, automatic climate control and alloy wheels.</p>, <p>In addition to a variety of cosmetic upgrades inside and out, a fully loaded 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross SEL includes all-wheel drive, leather seating, power driver’s seat, heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, upgraded 7-inch display with touch-pad controller, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support, Mitsubishi Connect telematics services, 710-watt/9-speaker Rockford Fosgate audio system, multi-view camera system, head-up display and passive entry/push-button start. A full suite of driver-assist and safety technologies includes blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-change assist, auto high beams, forward-collision mitigation and adaptive cruise control. For all that and more, you’re looking at a sticker price just north of $32,000.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is offered with one 4-cylinder engine, one continuously variable automatic transmission and essentially one drive system. While the Eclipse Cross ES base model is available in front-wheel drive (FWD), the balance of the lineup is offered exclusively with Mitsubishi’s Super All-Wheel Control all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. The Eclipse Cross is rated to tow up to 1,500 pounds.</p>, <p>1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder<br>

[<p>Among the many subcompact cars one can buy, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/mitsubishi/mirage/2018/">2018 Mitsubishi Mirage</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> and Mirage G4 sedan wouldn’t be our first picks. Why? Because while perks like a frugal 3-cylinder engine and the availability of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto impress, in just about every other category that matters the Mirage comes up short, especially when compared to such established competitors as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/rio/">Kia Rio</a>. The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage’s styling is far from memorable, the interior materials hard and unwelcoming, the engine weak and the latest driver-safety assists nowhere to be found. On the plus side, the Mirage’s ride is comfortable, its CVT works better than most and it does have a large trunk.</p>, <p>If you like the 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage’s styling and long warranty, and aren’t put off by its hard interior plastics, non-folding rear seat (G4 sedan) and 12.5-second zero-to-60-mph time, then by all means have it.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi’s 2018 Mirage hatchback is fairly inexpensive, but so is the better-built, better-equipped Nissan Versa. A Ford Fiesta will give you better performance, features and comfort, as will a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a> and Kia Rio. For the money, even a nice used compact would make a better choice.</p>, <p>The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage ES gains a new touch-screen audio with Bluetooth and a rearview camera. The G4 gains a much-needed trunk pass-through, while a driver’s-seat armrest is added to the SE/GT and Mirage G4 SE.</p>, <p>Our <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/mitsubishi/mirage%20g4/2018/">2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4</a> sedan exhibited a smooth ride and strong brakes. Unfortunately, the steering’s on-center feel is so poor we physically had to return the wheel to center or run the risk of continuing in whichever direction the Mirage was last pointed. On rough pavement, the Mirage’s suspension is quite bouncy and the car leans heavily even in moderate corners. Fuel economy is good so long as you’re not in a hurry to get where you’re going. Any sense of urgency, however, requires constant full-throttle maneuvers that quickly torpedo those rosy EPA numbers. The 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine isn’t big on power; with a mere 78 ponies it requires a leisurely 12.5 seconds to achieve 60 mph.

Because while perks like a frugal 3-cylinder engine and the availability of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto impress, in just about every other category that matters the Mirage comes up short, especially when compared to such established competitors as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/rio/">Kia Rio</a>. The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage’s styling is far from memorable, the interior materials hard and unwelcoming, the engine weak and the latest driver-safety assists nowhere to be found. On the plus side, the Mirage’s ride is comfortable, its CVT works better than most and it does have a large trunk.</p>, <p>If you like the 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage’s styling and long warranty, and aren’t put off by its hard interior plastics, non-folding rear seat (G4 sedan) and 12.5-second zero-to-60-mph time, then by all means have it.</p>, <p>Mitsubishi’s 2018 Mirage hatchback is fairly inexpensive, but so is the better-built, better-equipped Nissan Versa.

Unfortunately, the steering’s on-center feel is so poor we physically had to return the wheel to center or run the risk of continuing in whichever direction the Mirage was last pointed. On rough pavement, the Mirage’s suspension is quite bouncy and the car leans heavily even in moderate corners. Fuel economy is good so long as you’re not in a hurry to get where you’re going. Any sense of urgency, however, requires constant full-throttle maneuvers that quickly torpedo those rosy EPA numbers. The 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine isn’t big on power; with a mere 78 ponies it requires a leisurely 12.5 seconds to achieve 60 mph.

[<p>With seating for seven, the highest crash-test ratings and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is an affordable compact SUV that’s perfect for families on a tight budget. One of the few small-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> available with a third row, the new Outlander is offered in five trims, each available with all-wheel drive. Additionally, a new plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model makes it the only SUV in its class to offer such an electrified powertrain. Prices start under $25,000 for a front-wheel-drive base ES model with a 166-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and rise to around $33,000 for a GT with a stronger V6. The new Outlander competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue/">Nissan Rogue</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/journey/">Dodge Journey</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sorento/">Kia Sorento</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a>.

The Outlander GT gets a standard multi-view camera and heated steering wheel. New to the lineup is the Outlander PHEV plug-in hybrid, which comes with all-wheel drive and can travel up to 22 miles on electricity alone.<b></b></p>, <p>With 166 horsepower, the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander has about the same amount of power as a Nissan Rogue, but quite a bit less than a Honda CR-V. The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine is backed by an excellent CVT automatic transmission, and delivers surprisingly strong off-the-line acceleration and up to 30 mpg out on the highway. Unfortunately, those who haul a full complement of passengers and cargo won’t be impressed by the 4-cylinder’s passing power or uphill climbing ability. For these situations, the GT model’s much more powerful V6 and 6-speed automatic transmission are indispensable. The V6 also offers more grunt off the line and comes with the more advanced all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. Unfortunately, unlike the 4-cylinder, it requires more expensive premium fuel. On the road, we found the new Outlander’s ride on the firm side, its steering somewhat numb on-center and its handling acceptable, but still not on par with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>.</p>, <p>FORWARD-COLLISION MITIGATION<br/> If this system determines a frontal collision with another car or pedestrian is imminent, it will warn the driver and automatically apply the brakes to reduce the severity of the collision or avoid the impact all together.

Flipping and folding the second row is easy thanks to a system of straps and levers and it offers easy entrance to the very small third row. Fold down both rows and you create over 63 cubic feet of cargo space. The plug-in hybrid Outlander has two rows and seating for five, as the rear area of its subfloor houses one of its two electric motors.</p>, <p>Simple and understated, the design of the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander doesn’t stand out in a class that includes the more aggressively styled Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Still, the Mitsubishi’s look is clean and attractive, with a BMW-like character line down it flanks and an angular nose that hints of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/nx/">Lexus NX</a> SUV. Cool features include the electric windshield-wiper de-icer that helps keep ice and snow from building up on the wipers, while power-folding side mirrors and standard 18-inch wheels and tires add an upscale feel. The Outlander’s lack of a clumsy roof rack also adds to its sleek profile. The new Outlander PHEV is distinguished by distinctive badging and what looks like an additional fuel door on the right side that hides the charge port.</p>, <p>The standard 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is available in five trims: ES, SE, LE, SEL and GT. The Outlander PHEV is offered in two trims: SEL and GT. Base ES models come with a 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth, heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels. A better choice is the SE, which includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, dual USB ports, heated front seats and push-button start. We also recommend the LE model, which includes a sunroof and safety features like blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The SEL is the same price as the LE, and while it doesn’t have a sunroof, it does add an 8-way power driver’s seat, leather interior, power tailgate and auto-dimming rearview mirror. GT models include S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) and a V6 engine, a Rockford Fosgate audio system, auto on-off headlights, power-folding mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and paddle shifters. In addition to their advanced plug-in hybrid powertrain and all-wheel drive, the Outlander PHEV models include DC Quick Charging capability and, in the GT model, AC power outlets the rear seat and cargo areas to power electric devices.</p>, <p>Among the impressive options available in the 2018 Outlander are its forward-collision-mitigation system, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning, three advanced safety features that can help prevent an accident. Thankfully, you don't have to buy a pricier top-end GT model to obtain these features -- they’re available in the SEL trim, bundled in the Touring Package. The $4,000 package also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icer, the Rockford Fosgate audio system, power-folding side mirrors, auto on-off headlights, a power tailgate, a heated steering wheel and power sunroof.

All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on ES, SE and SEL trim levels.</p>, <p>The 2018 Outlander ES, SE, LE and SEL models use a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 166 horsepower and powers either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (AWD). The ES gets a simplified AWD system, while all others use Mitsubishi’s Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup. The 2.4-liter engine runs on regular-grade gasoline and has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. The Outlander GT uses a 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 224 horsepower and comes standard with S-AWC. That more powerful engine requires more expensive premium gasoline and has a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. All Outlanders are equipped with automatic transmissions, either a CVT in 4-cylinder versions or a 6-speed automatic when equipped with the V6. The Outlander PHEV plug-in hybrid electric vehicle uses a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and two electric motors. It’s a sophisticated system that enables you to run on electricity alone up to 22 miles, or by using the electrified powertrain in conjunction with the gasoline engine. With such a system, the gas engine automatically kicks on when the batteries are depleted. Total range slots in at 310 miles. Recharging the battery can take around 8 hours on a standard 120-volt outlet or roughly half that on a 240-volt line. Additionally, there’s DC Fast Charging that lets you charge to 80 percent capacity in 25 minutes. Don’t be fooled by the gasoline engine’s 117 horsepower rating -- the combined gasoline/electric powertrain put out substantial torque figures.<br>

The new Outlander PHEV is distinguished by distinctive badging and what looks like an additional fuel door on the right side that hides the charge port.</p>, <p>The standard 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is available in five trims: ES, SE, LE, SEL and GT. The Outlander PHEV is offered in two trims: SEL and GT. Base ES models come with a 7-inch touch screen, rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry, Bluetooth, heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels. A better choice is the SE, which includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, dual USB ports, heated front seats and push-button start. We also recommend the LE model, which includes a sunroof and safety features like blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The SEL is the same price as the LE, and while it doesn’t have a sunroof, it does add an 8-way power driver’s seat, leather interior, power tailgate and auto-dimming rearview mirror. GT models include S-AWC (Super All-Wheel Control) and a V6 engine, a Rockford Fosgate audio system, auto on-off headlights, power-folding mirrors, rain-sensing wipers and paddle shifters. In addition to their advanced plug-in hybrid powertrain and all-wheel drive, the Outlander PHEV models include DC Quick Charging capability and, in the GT model, AC power outlets the rear seat and cargo areas to power electric devices.</p>, <p>Among the impressive options available in the 2018 Outlander are its forward-collision-mitigation system, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning, three advanced safety features that can help prevent an accident. Thankfully, you don't have to buy a pricier top-end GT model to obtain these features -- they’re available in the SEL trim, bundled in the Touring Package. The $4,000 package also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icer, the Rockford Fosgate audio system, power-folding side mirrors, auto on-off headlights, a power tailgate, a heated steering wheel and power sunroof. All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on ES, SE and SEL trim levels.ouring Package. The $4,000 package also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icer, the Rockford Fosgate audio system, power-folding side mirrors, auto on-off headlights, a power tailgate, a heated steering wheel and power sunroof. All-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on ES, SE and SEL trim levels.</p>, <p>The 2018 Outlander ES, SE, LE and SEL models use a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 166 horsepower and powers either the front wheels (FWD) or all four (AWD). The ES gets a simplified AWD system, while all others use Mitsubishi’s Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) setup. The 2.4-liter engine runs on regular-grade gasoline and has a towing capacity of 1,500 pounds. The Outlander GT uses a 3.0-liter V6 engine that makes 224 horsepower and comes standard with S-AWC. That more powerful engine requires more expensive premium gasoline and has a towing capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. All Outlanders are equipped with automatic transmissions, either a CVT in 4-cylinder versions or a 6-speed automatic when equipped with the V6. The Outlander PHEV plug-in hybrid electric vehicle uses a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and two electric motors. It’s a sophisticated system that enables you to run on electricity alone up to 22 miles, or by using the electrified powertrain in conjunction with the gasoline engine. With such a system, the gas engine automatically kicks on when the batteries are depleted. Total range slots in at 310 miles. Recharging the battery can take around 8 hours on a standard 120-volt outlet or roughly half that on a 240-volt line. Additionally, there’s DC Fast Charging that lets you charge to 80 percent capacity in 25 minutes. Don’t be fooled by the gasoline engine’s 117 horsepower rating -- the combined gasoline/electric powertrain put out substantial torque figures.<br>

[<p>While Mitsubishi’s 2018 Outlander Sport compact-crossover <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> might not be as popular as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a>, it does represent a very good value. Affordable, nicely equipped and solidly constructed, the 2018 Outlander Sport gives buyers a shot at driving something a bit less commonplace without risking worry about long-term reliability. Upper-level trims offer such amenities as a Rockford Fosgate audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There’s also Mitsubishi’s advanced all-wheel-drive system, dubbed All-Wheel Control (AWC), that offers an added measure of security in snowy climates. However, where many competitors offer such driver assists as collision mitigation, lane-departure warning and high-beam assist as standard equipment, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mitsubishi/">Mitsubishi</a> only offers them as options on the most expensive trim.</p>, <p>If you’re having a hard time finding a compact-crossover SUV that’s not so commonplace, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/mitsubishi/outlander%20sport/2018/">2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport</a> might just catch your eye. It offers lots of features, handsome styling and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty for added peace of mind.</p>, <p>A small dealer network and poor resale values have the 2018 Outlander Sport taking a back seat to the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. The Subaru Crosstrek and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> offer better off-road ability, and all the above-mentioned vehicles offer more advanced driver-assist systems, some as standard equipment.</p>, <p>For 2018 Mitsubishi’s compact Outlander Sport SUV offers a new touch-screen display featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The SEL offers a new Touring Package with forward-collision warning and lane-departure warning. A mild rework of the front and rear bumpers rounds out the changes of note.</p>, <p>The 2018 Outlander Sport may have a new face and features, but deep down it is still the same vehicle that debuted back in 2011. That’s a problem as most of its primary competitors now run on much more modern platforms with more advanced features. That said, the public seems to be okay with “old” because the Outlander Sport is Mitsubishi’s best-selling model. The reason has to do with packaging. In the Outlander Sport, you’ll get a stylish, comfortable compact SUV offering a wide range of trims, engines and options. There’s even a 5-speed manual transmission on the base front-wheel-drive model. And while its driving characteristics and fuel economy fall short of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a>, the Outlander Sport is a very stable vehicle made even better by Mitsubishi’s advanced all-wheel-drive system. We think the best powertrain is the 168-horsepower, 2.4-liter engine offered on the SE and SEL trims.</p>, <p>ROCKFORD FOSGATE AUDIO SYSTEM<br/> Available on the SEL grade, the optional 710-watt, 9-speaker Rockford Fosgate audio system is a music lover’s dream come true. A separate subwoofer provides plenty of bass, and the system can be teamed with a 40-gigabyte hard drive for added music storage.<br/> <br/> GREAT WARRANTY<br/> Like <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/kia/">Kia</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a>, Mitsubishi offers a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty on every Outlander Sport, meaning you will have your car paid off or maybe even traded in before the warranty expires.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Outlander Sport gets a new center-console design with more padding to protect your knees. A new 7-inch touch screen graces ES trims, while SE and SEL models get a 7-inch smartphone-link display. The light-gray interior color option helps brighten up what can usually be a somber black interior at this price. Comfortable front seats are supportive over a long drive, but the rear seats will make 6-footers feel cramped. Behind the second row is a pretty small cargo area, offering just 20 cubic feet of space, although it opens up considerably when you fold down the rear seatbacks.</p>, <p>The 2018 Outlander Sport gets a revised front and rear bumper design with new LED running lights and new accent pieces. It’s an aggressive design that looks good here. The rest of the vehicle has remained largely unchanged over the years, with the exception of molding around the wheelwells. The proportions are spot-on, and the compact size -- it's about eight inches shorter than a CR-V -- makes it easy to maneuver around tight urban parking lots. An optionally available roof rack can carry larger items that won't fit inside.</p>, <p>The base <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mitsubishi/outlander%20sport/">Mitsubishi Outlander Sport</a> ES offers some solid features for its roughly $21,250 price, including leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, LED taillights, automatic climate control, 18-inch alloy wheels, steering-wheel-mounted cruise control and audio buttons, a 4-speaker/140-watt AM/FM/CD system with 7-inch touch screen and rearview camera. A multicolor information display reads out fuel consumption, outside temperature and other data. Safety systems include hill-start assist, stability control and seven standard airbags, plus a driver's-side knee airbag. Mitsubishi vehicles also come with a new-car warranty that includes 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain.</p>, <p>Skip the base 2.0-liter engine and get the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, which offers more power and torque with only a minor penalty in fuel economy. Otherwise, features get added as you work up the trim ladder. The SE model adds fog lights, push-button ignition, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while the SEL takes that and adds leather seating, HID headlights and power-folding side-view mirrors. The SEL Touring package adds a panoramic glass roof, Rockford Fosgate audio system, lane-departure warning, forward-collision mitigation and auto high beams. All-wheel drive is available on all models. </p>, <p>The base engine in the 2018 Outlander Sport is a forgettable 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with only 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. It comes with a 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission, but it's overwhelmed by this little SUV, which comes in front- or all-wheel drive (FWD, AWD). Instead, get the available 2.4-liter 4-cylinder. At 168 horsepower it's no powerhouse, but it doesn't have to work as hard to get the Outlander Sport moving, so it's quieter as well as offering more punch. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is the only option, but it mimics a standard transmission with "shift" points, and it was smooth enough. An AWD system is available on all models, offering peace of mind for slippery-road conditions.<br>

The automatic-equipped LE trim moves the price closer to $23,500, while the SE trim pushes the price closer to $24,000. The SEL starts just under $25,500 and tops out around $29,000 when equipped with AWD and the Touring package. AWD adds about $1,400 to any Outlander Sport model.

---------http://www.kbb.com/nissan/370z/2018
[<p>The 2018 Nissan 370Z is a tricky proposition. On the one hand, here is a 2-seat sports car that can be used every day, with the reliability and tolerability that implies. Try looking elsewhere for those qualities and the alternatives offer less power, like the Mazda MX-5 Miata, or cost much more, like the Porsche 718 Cayman/Boxster. On the other hand, the 370Z is almost past its sell-by date (despite sports cars having longer shelf lives than regular vehicles), with a new model rumored to be in the pipeline. In the meantime, the Nissan 370Z comes in coupe and Roadster (convertible) forms, with the coupe also available as a high-performance Nismo version.</p>, <p>Old-school driving thrills are the order of the day. This is a well-balanced rear-drive machine with a 6-speed manual transmission as standard. The V6 engine is punchy, the suspension is precise. And admittedly this is subjective, but the 370Z looks as sharp as it drives.</p>, <p>Technology is important. Sadly, the 2018 370Z is a bit behind the times in this respect. It’s not until the higher trims that a USB port and a rearview camera become available. The controls aren’t so well calibrated, either, with grabby brake pedal action and a notchy manual gear shift.</p>, <p>The 370’s looks are updated, with dark treatments of the headlights and taillights. A darker rear lower fascia joins a fresh design of 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. Engine management has been tweaked for better throttle response. And versions with the manual transmission receive a high-performance clutch.</p>, <p>Despite a few faults, the 2018 Nissan 370Z has an engaging character that demands a certain level of involvement. And the more you put into something, the more you get out of it. The driver feels (and hears) what’s happening with the tires, learns the ideal engine notes signaling when to change up or down a gear, and applying the right amount of brake pressure soon becomes second nature. Get it on a mountain road and the Z is in its element. Yet it’s also comfortable enough to handle the weekday commute, at least in its regular form. The Nismo (short for Nissan Motorsport) version is far more hardcore, but the 2018 model has new Dunlop high-performance tires that Nissan claims are quieter than the previous Bridgestones by one decibel. That’s not a lot, but it’s a step in the right direction.</p>, <p>SYNCHROREV MATCH<br>
 The Nissan 370Z was one of the first cars to match engine speed with road speed on the downshift. While this feature is more commonplace now, it's still a boon for drivers who haven't mastered the heel-toe technique. Don't worry, old-schoolers, it can be turned off.<br>
<br>
 CHASSIS TUNING<br>
 The 370Z uses a double wishbone suspension setup at the front, just like Mercedes-Benz cars, for example. This means a fine combination of suppleness and precision. So while it repays an attentive driver with fun, it doesn’t force itself on someone who wants to have a more relaxed journey.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 370Z is not luxury-car quiet, but more bearable on a daily basis than might be expected for a fairly affordable 2-seater. Active noise cancellation helps to hush the interior without adding heavy sound-deadening materials. The three gauges in the center of the dash are reminiscent of the original Z from the 1970s, and they move with a steering column that adjusts for height only. Even so, the Z offers decent ergonomics, comfortable seats, sufficient trunk area for a couple of golf bags (in coupe form, at least), and handy stowage space that includes a compartment behind the passenger seat.</p>, <p>The 2018 370Z coupe has that classic profile of a long hood and rearward-leaning cabin with a roof that slopes sleekly down to the tail. Overall, the car is quite short and wide, but any stubbiness is offset by the low roof, sharp shapes, well-judged lines, and flared fenders. It all works in its own aggressive way. The higher-performance Nismo version includes aerodynamic aids like a larger front spoiler and rear wing. The Roadster's power-operated top stows quickly beneath a hard cover.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan 370Z Coupe comes in base, Sport, Sport Tech, Touring, and Nismo Tech models. 370Z Roadsters are available in base, Touring and Touring Sport trims. All models come with automatic climate control, Bluetooth, steering wheel audio and cruise controls, keyless entry/ignition, xenon headlights and a 6-speaker audio system. Touring models add power-adjustable heated seats, navigation, and leather/simulated suede upholstery; Sport models come with bigger wheels and a rear spoiler. The Nismo model has more power, a stiffer suspension, sport seats, and various aerodynamic additions. Safety features include stability control, active head restraints and six airbags.</p>, <p>The main option for the 2018 370Z is the 7-speed automatic transmission. To get more equipment means stretching the budget to a higher trim level. So, if choosing a manual transmission, consider Sport trim for the rev-matching feature. This will also bring 19-inch alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential and a Bose audio system. Otherwise there are various factory- and dealer-installed accessories available as stand-alone options. An Aerodynamic Package adds a front wind deflector and rear spoiler.</p>, <p>The gutsy 3.7-liter V6 engine in the 370Z could easily have been one of our favorite features. The regular version develops 332 horsepower; the Nismo gets a useful bump to 350 horsepower. Either way, the Z is quick, powerful and responsive. Drive goes to the rear wheels either through a standard-issue 6-speed manual transmission or an optional 7-speed automatic. Sport, Sport Tech and Nismo trims have the SynchroRev Match function with their manual transmissions. For a sports car with this much muscle, fuel economy is pretty good, but Nissan recommends using premium gasoline in both versions of this engine.<br>

The high-performance Nismo Coupe starts at $46,575 in Tech trim. The 370Z Roadster is priced from just under $43,000. A loaded Roadster Touring Sport with an automatic transmission breaks the $50,000 barrier, which brings us into territory occupied by V8 versions of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger, none of which are slouches. However, avoid the higher-priced trims and the Z is a reasonably priced sports car. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to make sure you're getting the best deal in your area. The Nissan 370Z should hold its value well over the long term.</p>]

[<p>Comfortable, sporty and sophisticated, the 2018 Nissan Altima has been improved with new safety technology and features. Every new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/altima/">Nissan Altima</a> now comes with standard Automatic Emergency Braking and Forward Collision Warning. A popular family sedan, the Altima sedan is available in four trim levels, and unlike many competitors, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> offers a choice between a fuel-efficient 4-cylinder and a potent V6. Prices start around $24,000 for an Altima 2.5 S with the standard 179-horsepower 2.5-liter engine, but the 2.5 SR model adds a significant list of features and performance for just $1,000 more. Prices climb to over $36,000 for the V6-powered Altima 3.5 SL. With 270 horsepower, it’s one of the most powerful <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> in the midsize-family-sedan class. Both engines work with a smooth continuously variable automatic transmission. Competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord/">Honda Accord</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry/">Toyota Camry</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fusion/">Ford Fusion</a>, Chevy Malibu, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/sonata/">Hyundai Sonata</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/optima/">Kia Optima</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a stylish and comfortable family-friendly sedan with a solid reputation for reliability and value, you’ll like the 2018 Nissan Altima. Drivers wanting a little more performance will like the 2.5 SR trim level, which adds a manual mode to the automatic transmission, paddle shifters, a sport-tuned suspension and larger 18-inch wheels and tires. </p>, <p>Nissan does not offer a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> version of the 2018 Altima. If you’re looking for ultimate fuel efficiency in the midsize-sedan class, check out the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry%20hybrid/">Toyota Camry Hybrid</a>, Ford Fusion Hybrid and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord%20hybrid/">Honda Accord Hybrid</a>. Also, the Altima is not available with all-wheel drive like the Ford Fusion and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/legacy/">Subaru Legacy</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018, Nissan has simplified the Altima’s lineup; the 2.5 and 3.5 SR trim levels are no longer available.<b> </b>Also, Automatic Emergency Braking and Intelligent Forward Collision Warning are now standard on all Altimas and the top-of-the-line Altima 3.5 SL receives standard Intelligent Cruise Control, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>From behind the wheel, the 2018 Nissan Altima is one of our favorite midsize sedans. It’s comfortable, with a smooth ride and a quiet interior, and it feels solid and substantial. Unlike some of its competition, the Altima is also engaging to drive with good steering feel and response, although the Ford Fusion and Mazda6 are still more fun to drive. The 2.5 SR trim improves the Altima’s handling, adding a sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels and tires, but it still rides well. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is strong with 179 horsepower. It’s also refined and works well with the automatic transmission, although it can get a bit loud if you rev it past 5,000 rpm. The 270-horsepower V6 in the 3.5 SL model delivers excellent acceleration and passing power, although it’s still out-muscled by the 301-horsepower Toyota Camry XSE V6 and the turbocharged 325-horsepower Ford Fusion Sport.</p>, <p>SAFETY SHIELD TECHNOLOGY<br>
 For 2018, Automatic Emergency Braking is now standard on all Nissan Altimas. The system first warns the driver of a possible collision. If the driver does not act to avoid the accident, the system will apply the brakes for the driver. Intelligent Forward Collision Warning is also standard. Several other active-safety systems are also available, including Intelligent Cruise Control and Blind Spot Warning.<br>
<br>
 ACTIVE UNDERSTEER CONTROL<br>
 This system is standard on all 2018 Nissan Altimas. It improves both the performance and overall safety of the sedan by lightly braking the inside front wheels during cornering, which enhances traction and the sedan’s ability to turn. Its operation, in combination with the Altima’s traction-control and stability-control systems, is completely undetectable by the driver.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>While not as roomy inside as a Honda Accord or Kia Optima, the 2018 Nissan Altima is a comfortable place for four adults, and its interior is both stylish and sophisticated. There’s plenty of room for five with good legroom in back, although headroom is snug in the rear if you’re over 6-feet tall. Up front the seats are comfortable for a variety of body shapes, whether outfitted in the standard cloth or optional leather. Visibility is excellent, and the placement of all controls is intuitive. The Altima’s spacious 15.4 cubic feet of trunk space is about average for the class, and a 60/40-split fold-down rear seat is standard.</p>, <p>Nissan’s new Altima bears a strong family resemblance to the rest of the company’s car line, with Nissan’s familiar V-shaped grille design and sleek headlight housing. Around back, the Altima’s rear sports an expressive bumper, and taillight housings that extend horizontally into the trunk door. The 2.5 SR variant is distinguished with a subtle integrated spoiler. All models feature a pair of chrome exhaust housings for an athletic vibe. Overall, we'll call the Altima's shape handsome and on the conservative end of the sedan spectrum. It may not pop as much as others, but the design should hold up well in the years ahead.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Altima is available in five trims, from the base 2.5 S to the top-line 3.5 SL. Spring for the least expensive and you'll get an automatic transmission (optional on some rivals) and basic amenities like power doors, windows and air conditioning, along with push-button ignition, keyless entry and Bluetooth connectivity. The base audio system is a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD player with auxiliary input but no USB port. We suggest spending the extra money to step up to the Altima 2.5 SR or 2.5 SV, which include a power driver’s seat and larger alloy wheels. Automatic Emergency Braking and Intelligent Forward Collision Warning are standard on all models.</p>, <p>Continuing to climb through the Nissan Altima’s trim levels brings amenities like power front seats, leather interior, 17- or even 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power moonroof and LED headlights. Many extras are bundled into packages and vary by trim. Highlights include a navigation system with upgraded 7-inch touch screen, a cold-weather package with heated front seats and steering wheel, and technology packages with everything from blind-spot monitoring and dynamic cruise control to Cross Traffic Alert. Audio buffs can delight their ears with a 9-speaker Bose premium sound system. The top 3.5 SL model even includes rear air-conditioning vents and remote start.</p>, <p>Unlike many rivals that offer hybrid, diesel and various turbocharged gasoline powerplants, the Altima keeps it simple with two offerings: a 4-cylinder in 2.5 models and a V6 in the 3.5. Both use a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Nissan’s 2.5-liter is made more efficient thanks to active grille shutters, revised engine compression ratio and less internal friction, all of which contribute to its nearly 40-mpg highway estimate. V6 models, meanwhile, still post a respectable 32 mpg, and both engines run just fine on regular unleaded to keep operating costs down.<br>

[<p>Nissan’s largest and most expensive SUV, the luxurious 2018 Nissan Armada is perfect for families looking for a full-size, 3-row SUV that seats eight passengers and has the power to tow up to 8,500 pounds. All-new just last year, the Armada is attractive, comfortable and with a starting price of around $47,000 it’s less expensive than a Chevy Tahoe, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/gmc/yukon/">GMC Yukon</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/expedition/">Ford Expedition</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sequoia/">Toyota Sequoia</a>. It also costs $22,000 less than the similar <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx80/">Infiniti QX80</a>. Under the hood is a burly 390-horsepower 5.6-liter V8 that gives the Armada more power than the <a alt_o_t="Trucks" href="/pickup-truck/">trucks</a> from GM, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a>. Three trim levels are available, SV, SL and Platinum. Every Armada gets a 7-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> offers 4-wheel drive with a low-range for an additional $2,900.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Armada is basically an Infiniti QX80 with $20,000 lopped off its sticker price. The two trucks are exactly the same size, use the same chassis, suspension, engine, transmission and they look pretty much the same. If you want an <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> on a Nissan budget you’ll like the new Armada.<b></b></p>, <p>If you’re looking for the smoothest ride in the class, you may not like the 2018 Nissan Armada. Its suspension doesn’t soak up the urban landscape quite as well as the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia. While large enough for adults, the Armada’s 3rd-row legroom also lags behind the Expedition, Sequoia and the Chevy Suburban.</p>, <p>For 2018, the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/armada/">Nissan Armada</a> gets considerable infotainment upgrades, and it becomes the first truck in its class to offer a high-tech rearview mirror. The system uses a camera mounted on the rear of the vehicle and an LCD monitor built into the glass of the standard rearview mirror. Nissan calls it Intelligent Rear View Mirror, and it’s standard on the top Platinum trim level.</p>, <p>With its spacious interior and big V8-horsepower, the 2018 Nissan Armada is a fantastic road-trip vehicle. On highways, this 3-row SUV is smooth and quiet and the driver’s seat is well shaped and firm enough to keep you well supported on long drives. Our test vehicle, a Nissan Armada Platinum, also featured a heated steering wheel and heated and cooled front seats and its navigation system was easy to program. Around town the Armada’s significant size makes it a handful to park, and some may find its steering heavy and its ride overly firm. Acceleration is strong and the rumble from the big V8’s exhaust is entertaining, but not loud enough to be intrusive or obnoxious. The 7-speed automatic transmission is smooth and responsive, and 4-wheel-drive models feature a low range for improved off-road performance. With its ample 9.1 inches of ground clearance the Armada isn’t exactly a Baja racer, but it’s surprisingly capable in the dirt.</p>, <p>INTELLIGENT AROUND VIEW MONITOR<br/> Standard on the SL and Platinum trim levels, Nissan’s Intelligent Around View Monitor is like a rearview camera on steroids. It not only shows you what’s behind the SUV, but additional cameras on the side and front of the vehicle give you a bird’s-eye 360-degree view of the Armada and its surrounds.<br/> <br/> SECOND-ROW CAPTAIN’S CHAIRS<br/> A popular option on full-size <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the 2018 Nissan Armada are 2nd-row captain’s chairs. Although they drop the truck’s seating capacity from eight to seven, the two individual seats are more comfortable than the 3-across bench and they really improve 3rd-row access. This is a very affordable option at just $450. Unfortunately, it’s available only on the top Platinum trim level.<br/> </p>, <p>With its abundance of wood trim and modern amenities the interior of the 2018 Nissan Armada is luxurious and comfortable. It’s built with precision. Fit/finish is excellent and all controls feel sturdy and substantial. The Nissan Armada SUV has three rows and seating for eight. Top-line Platinum models offer a pair of captain's chairs and a center console in the second row, reducing seating capacity to seven. Room is generous in the first and second rows but tight in the third. The front seats are large and the Armada boasts a commanding view out front, but rearward visibility is limited. The center console features an 8-inch touch screen.</p>, <p>Rugged yet sophisticated, the Armada's new design evokes the luxury-meets-utilitarian style of its Infiniti QX80 sibling and even some Range Rovers. There's nothing small or dainty about this SUV, which can tip the scale at nearly three tons when equipped with all the trimmings. Base models roll on 18-inch wheels, while SL and Platinum Armada models go big with 20-inchers. This is Nissan’s largest SUV ever, but the Armada’s cohesive design hides that size well, with windows that appear to stretch nearly the length of the vehicle and strong bulging fenders. A smattering of chrome dresses its flanks without getting overly ornate, and sizable fender vents add a sporting flair.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Armada full-size SUV is available in three trims: SV, SL and Platinum. A base SV model comes nicely equipped with dual-zone climate control, 8-inch infotainment system with navigation, 13-speaker Bose AM/FM/CD/USB/Satellite audio system with Bluetooth connectivity, rearview camera, power-adjustable front seats, and front/rear parking sensors. If you want some nicer amenities, especially leather seating, we recommend at least an SL model, which also includes Nissan's handy Around View rearview-camera system, power liftgate, power-folding 3rd-row seats, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and remote keyless entry with 2-driver memory system, which is great for spouses who share the vehicle.</p>, <p>Stepping up to the Platinum Armada brings features that are optional on the SL, including moonroof, intelligent cruise control, blind-spot detection, backup-collision intervention, forward emergency braking and the Predictive Forward Collision Warning System. That top model also comes with lane-departure warning/prevention, heated and cooled front seats, heated 2nd-row seats and a rear-seat entertainment system with dual 7-inch displays, wireless headphones and DVD player. That model can also be had in the 7-passenger configuration. Four-wheel drive is offered on all three trims.</p>, <p>The 2018 Armada SUV is powered by Nissan's big Endurance 5.6-liter V8. The engine puts out 390 horsepower, which makes it the most powerful standard engine in this class. The Armada comes standard in rear-wheel-drive (RWD) form, with 4-wheel drive (4WD) optional. This naturally aspirated (non-turbo) engine is quite thirsty, topping out at just 19 mpg for RWD models and 18 for 4WD variants. A 7-speed automatic transmission is standard. The 2018 Armada's towing capacity is 8,500 pounds -- more than the Sequoia's 7,400, nearly matching that of the Chevy Tahoe, and less than the 9,200 pounds of the Ford Expedition, which uses a turbocharged V6.<br>

Mid-trim SL models start around $51,500, and the top-of-the-line Platinum trim bows right around $60,000. Adding 4WD to any model is an extra $2,900. All-in, a 4WD Platinum Armada can approach $65,000. The Armada undercuts the starting prices of the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon siblings, as well as the Ford Expedition. It is only slightly less than the starting price of the Toyota Sequoia. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Armada.

---------http://www.kbb.com/nissan/frontier-crew-cab/2018
[<p>Starting under $20,000, the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> Frontier is an affordable, comfortable and capable midsize pickup that’s ready for a hard day’s work or a weekend of play. Two body styles, two bed lengths, two wheelbases, two transmissions and two engines are available including a beefy 4.0-liter V6 that makes 261 horsepower. All Crew Cab models get the V6, while King Cab buyers can also choose a more fuel-efficient 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine. Five trim levels are available: S, SV, SL, the 2-wheel-drive-only Desert Runner and the Pro4X, which is only available with 4-wheel drive. Both engines are offered with a 6-speed manual or a dated 5-speed automatic transmission. The new Frontier faces stiff competition from its rivals the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> Colorado, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a> Canyon and Toyota Tacoma, all of which offer better fuel economy and more amenities.</p>, <p>With such an extensive lineup of body styles, powertrains and trim levels, there’s a 2018 Frontier to fit every budget and lifestyle. And that’s one of the reasons Nissan’s pickup has been so popular for so long. The new Frontier is perfect for those looking for an affordable work truck, a comfortable daily driver or a rugged off-roader.</p>, <p>If you’re interested in a diesel-powered truck, the Nissan Frontier is not what you are looking for. Chevy offers a 2.8-liter turbodiesel engine in the Colorado, and GMC offers the same engine in the Canyon. Chevy’s new Colorado ZR2 and Toyota’s Tacoma TRDPro are also more off-road capable than the Frontier Pro4X.</p>, <p>This year every 2018 Nissan Frontier gets a standard rearview camera. The base S model now includes standard air conditioning, cruise control, Bluetooth and a 5.0-inch color display. Also new is the Midnight Edition package, which includes a gloss-black grille, 18-inch gloss-black aluminum wheels and other blacked-out trim. It’s available on the Crew Cab SV 4x2 and 4x4 automatic-transmission models.<b></b></p>, <p>This is a very comfortable truck. The 2018 Nissan Frontier features large, well-shaped seats and its suspension doesn’t throw you around. Even over a rough road with an empty bed, the Frontier has a car-like quality that you’ll appreciate as the years of ownership pass. Our very likable test truck was a Frontier King Cab in the base S trim. No frippery and very little glitter. It was white with a gray interior. Good basic transportation, a work truck with a 152-horsepower 4-cylinder engine and a well-geared 5-speed manual transmission that was easy to shift -- the light clutch effort kept it from being a left-leg buster in stop-and-go traffic. Power was adequate around town, although with a full load, you better plan way ahead when passing or merging onto the highway. Unfortunately at speed, there's wind noise from around the large outside mirrors. Engine and road noise intrude as well.</p>, <p>PRO4X<br>
 The new Nissan Frontier Pro4X model boasts some serious off-road cred. Well beyond just 4-wheel drive, the Frontier Pro4X packs a heavy-duty suspension, Bilstein high-pressure performance gas shock absorbers, skidplates protecting the fuel tank, oil pan and transfer case; 16-inch wheels, 265/75R16 All-Terrain tires and an electronic locking rear differential.<br>
<br>
 4.0-liter V6 ENGINE<br>
 Although the 152-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is marginally more fuel efficient, the Frontier’s capability and the truck’s entertainment value increase exponentially with the 4.0-liter V6. With 261 horsepower the V6 gives the Frontier more payload capacity, more towing ability and more speed. The larger, more powerful engine also masks some of the sins of the Nissan’s antiquated automatic transmission.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>No one is going to confuse the dated and overtly simple interior of the 2018 Nissan Frontier for the cabin of a Bentley, but it’s comfortable, functional and in line with the pickup’s intended purpose. Open the rear-hinged doors of the King Cab model and you'll find a pair of cramped seats that are useful for children and short rides. If you plan on carrying passengers frequently, opt for the Crew Cab model with its traditional doors and adult-sized 3-passenger bench. The rear seats on all Frontier models flip up for more space, and the front-passenger seat can fold flat, creating an impromptu workstation. Leather replaces cloth on higher trim levels.</p>, <p>In the age of oversized hulking grilles and chrome galore, the new 2018 Nissan Frontier may be a little conservative-looking for some. With its flared wheelwells and an attractive choice of aggressively styled wheels, we find it to be attractive in a handsome, get-the-job-done kind of way. It’s simple-looking, but purposeful and it has a masculine quality all trucks should possess, especially in Desert Runner and PRO-4X trims, which wear off-road equipment like chunky tires and skidplates, as well as available roof racks and crossbars. A long bed is available on Crew Cab models, giving it the same bed length as the smaller-cabin King Cab.</p>, <p>Most buyers of the new Nissan Frontier will skip the least expensive King Cab S model with manual transmission. It’s a very basic truck lacking power windows, although air conditioning, cruise control, an AM/FM/CD stereo and Bluetooth are now standard. If you want power windows and mirrors, or a USB-equipped audio system, you'll have to move up to the more civilized SV trims, which also include NissanConnect with mobile apps such as Facebook, and streaming audio like Pandora and iHeartRadio. The Crew Cab SL adds leather seats, Rockford Fosgate audio and a standard V6 engine.</p>, <p>For 2018, Frontier SV models offer a popular SV Value Truck package that includes an auto-dimming mirror, spray-in bedliner, Utili-track tie-down system, dual-zone climate control, an upgraded audio system, heated front seats and rear parking sensors. The 2-wheel-drive (2WD) Desert Runner adds attitude as well as Bilstein off-road shocks and off-road wheels and tires, while the 4-wheel-drive (4WD) PRO-4X models add an electronic locking rear differential and skidplates. Crew Cab PRO-4X models offer a Premium Package with power-adjustable leather seats and heated outside mirrors, while SL and SV models can get a power moonroof. Campers should check out the bed tent available from Nissan dealers.</p>, <p>Standard on the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/nissan/frontier%20king%20cab/2018/">2018 Nissan Frontier King Cab</a> models is a 152-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine.

With a robust 261 horsepower it provides some scoot. With it, a 6-speed manual is standard and a 5-speed automatic is available. The 4-cylinder model is no slouch, offering a respectable tow rating of 3,500 pounds, and 2WD V6 models can tow up to 6,500 pounds. All 2018 Nissan Frontiers run on regular gasoline.

Instead check out the mid-level SV trim on either King Cab or Crew Cab models. They start around $24,000 for King Cab 4-cylinder models, or about $27,000 if you want a V6-powered King Cab. The long-wheelbase Crew Cab Frontier SV with 4WD starts around $30,500. While its starting price undercuts rivals, the Nissan's pricing becomes more in line with the competition as you climb trims, though it's still below that of a loaded Tacoma or diesel-powered Colorado or Canyon. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Frontier pickup truck. As the years go by, we expect the Frontier to hold its value well, but still not top that of the Tacoma.</p>]

[<p>Although <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> has introduced a new, lower-priced trim this year, at just over $100,000 the 2018 Nissan GT-R isn’t exactly what we’d call an affordable sports car. Then again, if you compare the GT-R’s performance specs and technology to cars built by <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ferrari/">Ferrari</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lamborghini/">Lamborghini</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/aston%20martin/">Aston Martin</a>, suddenly the $100K price tag looks pretty darn good. Touting a raucous twin-turbo V6 pumping out 565 horsepower (600 horsepower in the track-ready Nismo version) mated to an advanced all-wheel-drive system, the GT-R has earned its station as one of the world’s great performance machines. Keep in mind, however, both the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> Z06 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> deliver similar performance, cost less and are much easier to get hold of.</p>, <p>If you live in a place where Porsches are as common as Uber, the 2018 Nissan GT-R affords the opportunity to drive a seldom-seen performance machine. With a sub-3-second sprint to 60 and top speed of 196 mph, even when the GT-R is spotted, it won’t be for long.<b></b></p>, <p>The GT-R can be a bit brutish, lacking the polished refinement of more expensive exotics from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/jaguar/">Jaguar</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> and even <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a>. If you can live without all-wheel drive, the Chevy Corvette Z06 delivers impressive performance for less money and even offers a convertible version.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan GT-R performance coupe adds a new, lower-priced Pure model to the lineup. Apple CarPlay is now standard, and a new Kuro Night trim is offered on the Premium trim.</p>, <p>With a quick tap of the center-console’s starter button, the 2018 Nissan GT-R’s twin-turbos burble to life. Engaging the built-in Launch Control yields a zero-to-60-mph run under three seconds, a time made attainable by the brilliant 6-speed automatic and its steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. Pushing the GT-R to its limit is easy thanks to the numerous electronic and mechanical chassis systems designed to keep the car firmly in the driver’s control. These same systems keep the GT-R planted in the tightest of curves, allowing it feats of stability that would see most rear-drive cars fishtailing out of control. However, while you’ll find features like the Brembo brakes and adjustable suspension equally useful in everyday driving, the GT-R is not as comfortable on the street as an <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/r8/">Audi R8</a>, a Chevy Corvette or a Porsche 911.</p>, <p>TWIN-TURBO V6 ENGINE<br/> Nestled beneath the 2018 GT-R’s hood is a hand-built 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6 with an impressive 565 horsepower (600 ponies in the Nismo version). So proud are the Nissan workers who assemble the engine they put their name on every one that leaves the factory.<br/> <br/> VALUE<br/> If there were a formula for deriving some measure of performance enjoyment per dollar spent, we’re pretty sure the 2018 Nissan GT-R coupe would score high. With a price topping out around $185,000, the GT-R is cheap compared to cars like the $250,000 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lamborghini/huracan/">Lamborghini Huracan</a> LP 610-4 or the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ferrari/488%20gtb/">Ferrari 488 GTB</a> that pushes past the $256,000 mark.<br/> </p>, <p>Nobody will mistake the 2018 Nissan GT-R for a luxury car, but this performance-oriented interior isn't without its charms. The big red start button draws your attention, situated on the center console between the two leather-appointed seats. Three switches on the dash control ride and handling settings, and the 8-inch display can show virtually every data point a car nerd could dream of seeing. Technically there are two rear padded spots with seatbelts, but the reality is that they're for occasional use at best, and should really be relegated to carrying extra cargo, since the trunk is on the small side.</p>, <p>Nissan’s GT-R coupe isn't the sleekest supercar, but it makes up for its lack of pulchritude with an over-the-top aggressiveness. Put another way: It looks like it wants to beat you up and steal your lunch money. Yet it's not for show, as all the odd angles, rounded contours and crisp edges are in the name of aerodynamic efficiency, and the resulting 0.26 coefficient of drag proves that Nissan knows what it's doing. Other elements, like the enormous front-fender vents, help provide front downforce. Staggered-width 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels further aid the GT-R’s stability.</p>, <p>There are now four <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/gt-r/">Nissan GT-R</a> models for 2018: Pure, Premium, Track Edition and Nismo. Base Nissan GT-R Premium models come loaded though, with power leather front seats, a rearview monitor, dual-zone climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen nav system, and 11-speaker Bose audio. The Pure models delete the Bose sound system and titanium exhaust. The GT-R Nismo offers a more powerful engine, better suspension, reinforced body and additional brake cooling, while the Track incorporates a number of the Nismo’s suspension and exterior components but keeps the less powerful engine.</p>, <p>The most alluring Nissan GT-R options come as option packages, and mostly on the Premium model. A Cold Weather Package adds all-season tires and special coolant mixture to help this exotic handle cold climates better, while three Interior Packages add hand-stitched semi-aniline front-seat interior treatments in Red, Rakuda Tan or Black.</p>, <p>There are two versions of the same engine available for the 2018 Nissan GT-R. First up is the standard 565-horsepower 3.8-liter V6. This compact powerhouse uses twin turbochargers and high-tech construction techniques to squeeze as much power as possible from its family-car displacement. If somehow that's still not enough, the GT-R Nismo packs 600 horsepower. Both engines connect to a 6-speed dual-clutch sequential automatic transmission capable of snapping off shifts in milliseconds; it's way faster than you ever could manage with a manual, and the paddle shifters on the steering wheel are the epitome of engaging driving.<br>

The all-conquering GT-R Nismo will set you back roughly a cool $177,000, give or take a few hundred bucks, and the Track Edition is a more palatable $130,000. However, despite the initial involuntary eye-pop of seeing a Nissan with a $177,000 price tag, the reality is that this car is a serious performance bargain compared to exotics like the Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches it routinely embarrasses in performance comparisons. On the flip side, the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 starts even lower, and with 650 horsepower and nearly equivalent acceleration and performance numbers, is not only a better bargain, but it offers better day-to-day refinement as well.

[<p>The 2018 Nissan Kicks is a brand-new vehicle, and among the latest crop of affordable, fresh-faced subcompact crossover SUVs. The de facto replacement for the oddball Juke, the Kicks is a far more appealing gateway into Nissan’s SUV lineup. Starting under $19,000 and rising only a few thousand beyond that, the new Nissan Kicks is a standout value even among high-value rivals like the Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona and Chevrolet Trax. Unlike those competitors, the Kicks doesn’t offer all-wheel drive, nor is it all that powerful. But the Kicks is surprisingly comfortable for its size and boasts a class-leading 36 mpg on the highway. Throw in impressive standard safety features, and the Kicks is a smart choice for youthful drivers or as a city runabout.</p>, <p>If you want a small crossover SUV that is stylish, efficient and practical, all at a price around $20,000, put the Nissan Kicks on your must-drive list. Like the new Toyota C-HR and Mazda CX-3, the Kicks also comes standard with automatic emergency braking<b></b></p>, <p>If you want all-wheel drive for enhanced traction, you’ll have to step up to a Rogue Sport or opt for a rival like the Hyundai Kona or Mazda CX-3. Those small crossovers also are more powerful -- especially a turbocharged Kona -- and more fun to drive. They also offer more amenities like a power-adjustable driver seat and a moonroof.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Kicks is an all-new vehicle. A collaboration between Nissan’s design studios in California and Brazil, the Kicks has standout exterior style, standard automatic emergency braking, and must-have tech like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. At under $19,000, the Kicks is Nissan’s least-expensive SUV.</p>, <p>Few will mistake the new Nissan Kicks for being fast or even all that fun to drive, but it is more than adequate for urban duties and basic commuting. While it only has 125 horsepower under the hood, the Kicks is a light vehicle, so there isn’t much mass to move. The Kicks is relatively nimble and surprisingly comfortable given its size. A small turning radius makes U-turns and parking maneuvers a breeze. Like many other Nissans, the 2018 Kicks uses a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). CVTs provide high fuel economy, but tend to drone as they don’t have set shift points like a traditional automatic. There are no steering wheel paddles or even a manual mode to replicate gear shifts. The Kicks does have a quasi-secret Sport mode (a tiny, nondescript button on the back of the transmission selector), but we found it didn’t make much difference in acceleration. At freeway speeds, the Kicks can be a little jittery, especially on uneven pavement. It’s fine for shorter highway trips, but wouldn’t be our first choice for a cross-country trek.</p>, <p>BOSE AUDIO SYSTEM<br>
Available on top-trim Kicks SR models is the first-of-its-kind Bose Personal Plus premium sound system. Among its eight speakers are two in the driver’s seat headrest that truly give whoever’s behind the wheel the best seat in the house.<br>
<br>
STANDOUT STYLE<br>
Nissan was among the first automaker to make the D-pillar behind the rear windows into a style statement in vehicles like the Murano and Maxima. The Kicks crossover SUV is the latest to adopt it, and can further stand out with a contrast-color roof that’s as affordable ($150) as it is stylish.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Nissan has a knack for making comfortable and roomy interiors, and the 5-passenger Kicks is the latest to showcase those attributes. Like other vehicles in Nissan’s lineup, it has NASA-inspired “zero-gravity” seats that are indeed quite comfortable. One of the Kicks’ best aspects is a built-in armrest on the right-hand side of the driver’s seat, a rarity in new vehicles and especially one at this price-point. All models come with a central 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system to operate audio, phone connectivity, and more. There isn’t a lot of storage space up front for smaller items like phones and purses, but there is commendable room in back for sports gear and shopping bags. With the rear seats up there is 25.3 cubic feet of storage, and folding them creates over 53 cubic feet. Those figures put the Kicks among tops in its class, though it doesn’t reach the numbers or flexibility of Honda’s HR-V. At 33.2 inches, rear-seat legroom is also notably less than the Honda’s 39.3 inches.</p>, <p>To our eye, the new Nissan Kicks is among the best looking subcompact SUVs. It’s handsome overall and has enough interesting features to give it flair without going overboard. It’s far less polarizing than the Juke, Nissan’s former entry-level SUV. All Kicks models feature a “floating roof” design, thanks to darkened window pillars. On SV and SR trims, the Kicks can be ordered with a white or black roof for only $150. It’s possibly the best stylistic value out there. Base S models ride on 16-inch steel wheels, while SV and SR trims have better-looking 17-inch aluminum alloys. Roof rails come standard across the line for added practicality, and SR models have a nifty rear roof spoiler.</p>, <p>Nissan’s Kicks is available in three grades: S, SV and SR. At its least-expensive, the 2018 Nissan Kicks includes basics like air conditioning and cruise control, and nice-to-have features like push-button start, three USB ports, extendable sun visors, and driver’s side armrest. A significant feature is forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, which can apply the brakes if the driver doesn’t in an impending collision. The basic infotainment system consists of a 7-inch touch-screen display and a 6-speaker AM/FM audio system with USB inputs, Bluetooth streaming, and Apple Siri Eyes Free.</p>, <p>For $1,700 more, we recommend stepping up to the Kicks SV. It adds another vital active-safety feature -- blind-spot monitoring -- along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, 17-inch wheels, heated side mirrors, automatic climate control, rear-seat vents, and cargo cover. Top-line SR models add LED headlights, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, fog lights, and Nissan’s Around View Monitor with a 360-degree bird’s-eye view. Aside from accessories and the option of a black or white roof, there’s only one major option package, and it’s only available on the Kicks SR. The Premium Package adds the Bose audio system, heated front seats with upgraded material, and a security system.</p>, <p>The Nissan Kicks uses a small 4-cylinder engine paired with a CVT automatic transmission. Unlike rivals such as the Hyundai Kona and Kia Soul, no upgraded engine option is offered. Also unlike other small SUV rivals -- but similar to the Toyota C-HR and Kia Soul -- the Kicks is only available with front-wheel drive (FWD). If you want all-wheel drive (AWD) for improved traction in cold-weather states, you’ll have to look to a rival or one of the Kicks’ bigger brothers like the Rogue or Rogue Sport. Though it isn’t very powerful or all that exciting, the Kicks’ powertrain returns high fuel-economy figures.<br>

The more recommendable Kicks SV model is also budget-friendly, slotting in at $20,665. Even a loaded Kicks won’t break the bank -- an SV model with the contrast roof option and sole Premium Package comes in at $22,415. At these prices, the Kicks is a highly attractive compact crossover-utility vehicle that undercuts most rivals. About the only competitor that goes for less is the Kia Soul.

As it is an all-new model with no history, the Nissan Kicks’ resale value is still to be determined.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/nissan/leaf/2018
[<p>The all-new 2018 Nissan Leaf may not garner the same headlines as the 2018 Chevrolet Bolt when Chevy announced a 238-mile range for it. Still the Japanese automaker has made tremendous strides to address the previous Leaf’s shortcomings, namely its range and styling. More than 200,000 Leafs have been sold since it was introduced in 2011 and is by far the highest-volume pure electric sold to date. By giving the car a more conventional look and boosting range to 150 miles, the Leaf is moving into the realm beyond automotive novelty to a practical, alternative-power vehicle that can address most motorists’ needs. But there’s even more to the story of the company turning over a new Leaf -- Nissan has actually cut prices while offering unique technology to boot. The new model represents a win-win for both Nissan and consumers alike.</p>, <p>As the recipient of the 2018 World Green Car award, the new Nissan Leaf will fit your needs if you’re looking to get off the fossil-fuel habit and want an electric that still costs less than an average vehicle even without the federal $7,500 tax credit. The 150-mile distance between recharging does much to reduce the range anxiety associated with the original.</p>, <p>The new Leaf probably won't cut it as your only vehicle in the household. While it will go farther between plug-ins, the time it takes to replenish the battery even with quick charging still makes the car marginal at best as a road-tripper. If semi-regular trips out of town are part of your lifestyle, you’re probably better off with a plug-in hybrid.</p>, <p>The design is all-new. The 2018 Leaf is slightly larger, more conventional-looking and thanks to a 40-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, the range is increased by 40 percent, moving from 107 to 150 miles. This is nearly double of the initial 84-mile range of the first Leafs.</p>, <p>With its longer range, the Nissan Leaf may entice doubters to try an EV for the first time. What they will discover is instantaneous power delivery from the motor. The Leaf is snappy right off the line and has excellent mid-range passing power. The driving experience is best described as serene. There’s no engine noise, or for that matter, the whine associated with electric motors that you might have experienced with earlier electrics. You might hear some far-off wind and tire noise, but that’s about it. The redesign also has netted a vehicle that feels more substantial than the original. The steering is light, which is in keeping with the Leaf’s primary mission of urban and freeway commuting. While the Leaf is not a performance car by any stretch of the imagination, its low center of gravity and stance give it a planted feel that translates to driver confidence. It acts and drives like a real car and not a science project.</p>, <p>ePEDAL<br>
The Nissan Leaf makes use of aggressive regenerative braking that allows you to drive the car with just the accelerator. Back off and the car will come to a complete halt and stay there until you depress the accelerator again. The layout includes a conventional brake pedal, but once you master ePedal, you’ll discover the joys of one-pedal driving.<br>
<br>
NISSAN PRO-PILOT ASSIST<br>
This system, offered on SV and SL models as part of the technology package, includes adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist that allow you to relax as you cruise along the highway. As long as you stay in a particular lane and ProPilot is engaged, you don’t really have to steer, the car will do that for you, although you do need to keep your hands on the wheel. It’s a step toward more autonomous technology you’ll see on later Leafs and other Nissans.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Along with the exterior makeover, Nissan has upgraded the quality of its interior. Workmanship and materials are top-notch -- there are plenty of soft-touch surfaces and large, easy-to-read-and-use displays. The dash itself has been redesigned into a gliding-wing shape with a prominent touch screen that measures five inches on S models and seven inches on SV and SL versions. A large analog speedometer is flanked on the left by a supplemental digital display that can be configured to show range and other vehicle systems’ status. The gear selector is a joystick mounted in the center console, and there are conventional buttons for the climate controls in the middle of the dash, along with USB ports and power points. The Leaf retains its 5-passenger seating, though the middle position in the rear is best for short trips only. There is a hump in the rear floor that provides access to the battery pack and which compromises foot room. S and SV models feature cloth seats while the range-topping SL offers leather upholstery. The front buckets are comfortable and supportive, and there’s plenty of utility to be had from the folding 60/40-split rear seats.</p>, <p>Accused of looking more like an amphibian than a car, Nissan’s Leaf has undergone quite a metamorphosis in its redesign. The 2018 model looks more like a conventional hatchback or crossover SUV, with a split rear C-pillar that gives it a floating-roof look similar to the larger Murano. The bug-like headlights, which were actually aerodynamic elements, have been narrowed and dropped lower in the fenders and are now fitted with LED units in higher-trim models. The front sports Nissan’s signature V-motion chrome bar but instead of a grille, there’s a black panel with blue mesh-like highlights beneath. The hatch covering the plug access has been redesigned to be larger and better integrated into the hood and front fascia cutlines. The plug panel itself now sits at a 45-degree angle making it easier to insert and remove the charging cord. While it looks more like a regular car, that fact that the design is unique to the Leaf will help identify it as an EV.</p>, <p>The all-new 2018 Nissan Leaf is again available in S, SV and SL trims. Base models come with 16-inch wheels, a 40-percent boost in range and a 37-percent increase in power, as well as the ePedal technology and emergency automatic braking. SV models include 17-inch wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel, adaptive cruise control, and NissanConnect with Navigation and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility. Top-line SL models include LED headlights, heated outside mirrors, leather seating, 8-way-power driver seat, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, premium 7-speaker Bose audio system, blind-spot monitoring, around-view camera, driver-attention alert and rear cross-traffic warning.</p>, <p>On base S models, you can opt for a quick-charge port and portable-charge cable that has adapters for conventional 120- and 240-volt outlets. An All Weather Package on the S and SV includes heated seats and steering wheel, heated outside mirrors and rear heating ducts. The SV Tech option includes LED lighting, 8-way-power seats, the portable-charge cable, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot warning, electric parking brake, lane-keeping assist, rear cross-traffic warning and ProPilot and steering assist as well as full-speed range and hold on the adaptive cruise control. The SL Tech package includes ProPilot and Steering Assist, full-range adaptive cruise, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and Intelligent Lane Intervention.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Leaf uses a 110-kW AC synchronous electric motor powering the front wheels. Output is rated at 147 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. The 40-kWh lithium-ion battery pack has an EPA-rated range of 150 miles. Fast-charging can get the Leaf to an 80-percent charge in 40 minutes. Nissan backs the battery pack with an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty.<br>

The SV model starts at $32,490, or about $1,700 less than the previous one. The top-line 2018 Leaf SL goes for $36,200 or about $590 less. All prices exclude $885 delivery. Buyers are still eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit, plus any state and local incentives, which for the base S could push the price down to $22,490 or less. More power, longer range and the new tech should have a positive impact on the Leaf’s resale value. While the 2018 Chevrolet Bolt offers longer range, it’s also more costly at $37,495 for the base model before the federal tax credit.

---------http://www.kbb.com/nissan/maxima/2018
[<p>As Nissan flagship sedan, the 2018 Maxima successfully blends the company’s love for for both styling and performance. Wearing one of the most radical designs ever to grace Nissan’s “4-door Sports Car,” the Maxima definitely has what it takes to turn heads. A 300-horsepower V6 and taut chassis place the Maxima’s driving dynamics closer to those of the the new Kia Stinger, and a cut above sedans like the Honda Accord and Chevrolet Impala. Yet, for all its performance rumblings, the Maxima’s long list of standard and available equipment makes it feel more like a premium-level luxury car. If the 2018 Maxima has any shortcomings, it would be its minimal rear-seat accommodations and front-wheel-drive layout, the latter often a deal-killer for die-hard enthusiasts.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a 4-door sedan priced under $35,000 that can deliver the kind of performance and attention-grabbing good looks usually reserved for brands like Audi and Mercedes-Benz, the 2018 Maxima should hold strong appeal.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a sporty sedan that also has a large rear seat, optional engine choices and more traditional styling, a Dodge Charger or Kia Stinger makes a better choice. A Toyota Avalon or Chevrolet Impala is much better at hauling people, but nowhere near as much fun to drive.</p>, <p>For 2018, Nissan adds Android Auto to the Maxima’s suite of connectivity options, joining Apple CarPlay and NissanConnect. The Maxima SR Midnight Edition carries over this year, as do forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking, two features made standard late in the 2017 model run.</p>, <p>While the “4-Door Sports Car” tagline may sound appealing, don’t mistake the 2018 Nissan Maxima for a bargain-basement BMW substitute. Instead, we like to think of the Maxima as a sporty entry-level luxury sedan that has more to offer than your run-of-the-mill Camry or Accord. Power from the Maxima’s 300-horsepower V6 is routed to the front wheels by means of a CVT automatic transmission, not exactly the favorite formula of purists. Still, the Maxima’s CVT is one of the best in the industry, aided in its performance aspirations by a set of steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters and its “D-Step” simulated gearshift logic. Torque steer does make itself known if you stomp the accelerator hard, but it’s a minimal event that rarely shows up once the Maxima is up to speed. The Maxima’s suspension delivers a comfortable ride and admirable cornering abilities, but the steering can feel vague at times, being somewhat numb in the feedback department.</p>, <p>INTELLIGENT FORWARD-COLLISION WARNING (I-FCW)<br>
 Now standard on every Maxima, Nissan’s Intelligent Forward Collision Warning system goes beyond standard systems that alert the driver to a slowed or stopped vehicle by actually looking two cars ahead. The system helps anticipate a possible emergency and react accordingly.<br>
<br>
 ANDROID AUTO<br>
 Joining the already standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto allows the rest of the smartphone world to join in the convenience of being able to mirror a smartphone through the car’s infotainment system. This feature gives full access to apps like Pandora, Google Maps and music through the Maxima’s large touch-screen display.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Despite its flagship status, the 5-passenger Nissan Maxima is actually a little smaller inside than the Nissan Altima sedan, which is slightly shorter. However, the Altima can't compare to the Maxima's upscale atmosphere. The diamond pattern on the accent trim extends to the seats and door panels on upper-level models. The stitched and soft-touch dash and doors impart a premium feel, as does the 8-inch infotainment system with its console-mounted multifunction knob. The driver and front passenger easily get comfortable thanks to power seats and tilt-telescope steering, but the rear seat's lack of head- and legroom may leave tall passengers complaining.</p>, <p>Nissan has packed a lot of styling onto the Maxima sedan. Nissan's V-Motion grille treatment dominates the front end, and like it or not, you sure know what's coming your way. Similarly, there's a lot of styling on the sides. The Maxima's roof, for example, appears to float over the rest of the body thanks to some clever paintwork. The sides are sculpted with intersecting character lines, and even the rear of the car, normally a weak point in styling, gets highlighted with sculpted taillights, twin chrome exhausts and a chrome lip over the license plate.</p>, <p>All 2018 Maxima sedans are the same under the hood, sporting a 3.5-liter V6 engine with 300 horsepower and a CVT automatic transmission. Also standard are LED headlight and taillight accents. Even base-model Maxima S sedans come with NissanConnect, an 8-inch touch-screen navigation and infotainment system with voice command, Google search, Bluetooth, two USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. Also standard are an 8-way-power driver's seat, cruise control, push-button ignition and keyless entry, and a rearview camera. The color 7-inch information screen between the main gauges is standard on all models. Safety equipment includes forward-collision warning and emergency braking.</p>, <p>Nissan adds features through the 2018 Maxima's four higher trim levels instead of options packages. With its leather upholstery, heated front seats and heated outside mirrors with LED turn signals, and front and rear parking sensors, even a Maxima SV is a highly recommendable vehicle. SL and Platinum models get a dual-panel panoramic moonroof, upgraded audio systems, blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control. The sporty SR loses the panoramic roof but gains bigger wheels/tires, while the luxury-like Platinum also gets moving-object detection, a driver-attention alert system and surround-view camera.</p>, <p>There's only one engine choice available for the Nissan Maxima, but it's a good one: a 300-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 connected to an Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). It manages decent fuel economy, all while delivering smooth and quiet power to the front wheels. CVTs have come a long way, and Nissan's D-Step shift logic mimics the operation of a traditional automatic by letting the revs rise and fall when at full throttle. A Sport mode livens feel by adjusting throttle response, steering effort and transmission tuning. Given its 300 horsepower, we're impressed that the Maxima doesn't suffer from aggressive torque steer, a peculiar side-to-side wiggle felt in the steering wheel that's common in powerful front-wheel-drive cars. Note that premium unleaded is recommended for the Maxima.<br>

If you want leather seating and a more supportive driver's seat, spend the roughly $2,000 more for a Maxima SV. The rest of the lineup climbs into the high $30,000s, and the top-line Maxima Platinum starts over $40,000. At these prices the Maxima starts higher than a Chevrolet Impala and Acura TLX, but the Nissan boasts more standard grunt. It nearly mimics the starting prices of the Toyota Avalon, Kia Cadenza and Hyundai Azera, which also offer a V6 as standard. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Maxima. The Nissan Maxima's resale value is expected to fare pretty well, in line with that of the Avalon and above that of the Impala, Cadenza and Azera.</p>]

A Top Safety Pick by the <a alt_o_t="Insurance" href="/car-insurance/">Insurance</a> Institute for Highway Safety, the Murano competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/edge/">Ford Edge</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/santa%20fe%20sport/">Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</a> as well as many 3-row SUVs like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-9/">Mazda CX-9</a>. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> offers the Murano in four trim levels, S, SV, SL and Platinum. Each is powered by a Nissan’s tried-and-true 3.5-liter V6, which makes 260 horsepower, and a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard across the line, but all-wheel drive is offered for an additional $1,600.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a 5-passenger SUV that’s reliable and powerful, spacious and comfortable, fuel-efficient and well-appointed you’ll like the new 2018 Nissan Murano. Buyers also like its long list of standard and available safety features and its swoopy styling, which makes many other SUVs look like cardboard boxes.</p>, <p>If the 2018 Nissan Murano is exactly what you’re looking for, except you need the additional seating capacity of a third row, check out the larger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/pathfinder/">Nissan Pathfinder</a>, which is mechanically and conceptually very similar to the Murano except it seats seven. If you desire a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>, check out the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander%20hybrid/">Toyota Highlander Hybrid</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018 all new Muranos get Automatic Emergency Braking, Intelligent Forward Collision Warning and NissanConnect with navigation and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. The Murano SL gets standard Intelligent Cruise Control, a Motion-Activated Power Liftgate and heated rear seats and steering wheel. There’s also more center-console storage and Platinum models get a standard Dual Panel Moonroof.</p>, <p>First, you’ll appreciate the Murano’s smooth ride. This SUV feels solid and its suspension soaks up rough roads without knocking you around or spilling your half-caf non-fat mochachino. Then the Nissan’s precise steering, and the satisfying pull and off-the-line power of its big V6 engine will reveal themselves. The 3.5-liter V6 pumps out a healthy 260 horsepower and it works well the SUV’s Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission with D-Step Logic, a technology that mimics the shift points of a traditional stepped automatic while delivering the efficiency only a CVT can attain. Around town the Murano is athletic and maneuverable, with stable handling, but it’s also a great road-tripper with a quiet interior and wonderfully shaped seats, which feel good even after an 800-mile run through three states. While the Murano is not set up for off-road adventuring, its AWD system and nearly seven inches of ground clearance make it ideal for tackling deep snow.</p>, <p>AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING<br>
 This important safety system is now standard on every new Nissan Murano. It monitors the road ahead for vehicles or objects blocking your path. If a potential collision is detected, it will alert the driver with audible and visual warnings. If the driver fails to respond, the system can apply the brakes to reduce the speed of impact or hopefully avoid the collision.<br>
<br>
 AROUND VIEW MONITOR<br>
 Nissan’s 360-degree Around View Monitor is nothing short of ingenious. It’s like a rearview camera on growth hormone. It uses cameras mounted around the vehicle to give you a bird’s-eye view of the SUV and its surroundings, helping you negotiate tight places, parallel park and avoid backing over or into objects.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The men and women who created the new Nissan Murano’s cabin are a bunch of talented individuals, as it’s one of the best interiors in a very crowded class. Fit/finish is excellent and the materials are rich and upscale. The seats are large and perfectly shaped and supportive. Choose the optional and expansive panoramic sunroof, and the interior is washed in natural light as if it were a back-porch sunroom. Behind the rear seat is over 30 cubic feet of space, and flipping the rear seat flat offers over 65 cubic feet, which is less than you get in the Ford Edge.</p>, <p>You won’t miss the 2018 Nissan Murano in the strip-mall parking lot. Up top is a “floating roof,” leading the way is the “V-Motion” front end, at both front and rear are “boomerang” lights that wrap into the fenders, along the sides are curves so pronounced they presented engineering challenges in forming the stamping tools that make them. Aerodynamic details include a lower shutter grille, front and rear spoilers, rear-tire air deflectors, rear-suspension fairings and even a fuel-tank shape optimized for efficient airflow. There isn’t one square inch that isn’t artfully folded and molded.</p>, <p>Standard equipment for the new 2018 Murano base S trim level includes Advanced Drive-Assist Display with a 7-inch screen, navigation, an 8-inch touch screen, Automatic Emergency Braking, Bluetooth, RearView Monitor, Nissan Intelligent Key with push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, tilt/telescoping steering column, three 12-volt outlets, cloth seating surfaces and reclining rear seatbacks with center armrest. The AM/FM/CD audio has MP3/WMZ CD capability and six speakers, and there are SiriusXM Satellite Radio, speed-sensitive volume control, steering-wheel audio and cruise controls. Also standard is Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) with Traction Control System (TCS), plus 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, a full complement of occupant-protection features and NissanConnect with Mobile Apps.</p>, <p>The 2018 Murano SV adds 8-way driver and 4-way front-passenger power seats, remote start, leather-wrapped steering wheel, fog lights and roof rails. Our recommendation, the SL, adds leather-appointed seating, 11-speaker Bose audio, Blind Spot Warning, Motion-Activated Power Liftgate, Intelligent Cruise Control, Around View Monitor with Moving Object Detection, a Bose premium audio system, heated front seats, heated outside mirrors and driver’s-seat memory. The Platinum level adds 20-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, climate-controlled front seats, heated rear seats, power-folding 2nd-row seats and a heated steering wheel with power tilt, telescoping and memory. Stand-alone option packages include a Premium Package and a Moonroof Package.</p>, <p>A 3.5-liter V6 with 260 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque powers the 2018 Nissan Murano. The transmission is Nissan’s Xtronic continuously variable automatic, with D-Step Logic. The result is a smoothness common to CVTs, but with the feel of a traditional stepped automatic. In operation, the 2018 Murano is smooth, quiet and silky and has plenty of ready response and power for any reasonable driving situation. The Murano is also available with either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) for those who must occasionally deal with bad weather and slick roads. Fuel consumption is remarkably thrifty, with both the FWD and AWD Murano models EPA-rated at 21-mpg city and 28-mpg highway.<br>

The top Platinum version costs $43,000 and has no available options. It’s maxed out at 43 large. We think the SL trim, at around $39,000, includes most of the equipment preferred by most potential buyers. All-wheel drive adds $1,600 to any trim level. Those prices place the Murano in line with much of its competition. Before heading to the <a alt_o_t="Dealership" href="/car-dealers-and-inventory/">dealership</a> to buy your Murano, be sure and check the KBB Fair Purchase Price to find out what others are paying. As for <a alt_o_t="Residual Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">residual value</a>, we expect the Murano to maintain Nissan’s record of being higher than the average when compared to its likely market competitors.</p>]

[<p>Introduced at a time when Ford and GM dominated the full-size van market, Nissan’s NV van for 2018 now finds itself up against a host of newer, European-inspired designs. To its credit, the Nissan NV manages to combine the best of old and new, offering a taller cargo bay than Chevrolet’s Express Van and a potent V8 engine not available on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster. As a work van, the NV can be configured to suit all manner of businesses, while in passenger form it can accommodate up to 12 people. The NV’s body-on-frame design and rear-wheel drive allow it a 9,400-pound tow rating, a number bested only by the aging Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana vans.</p>, <p>If you need your next work van to have a modern design but old-fashioned V8 power and towing ability, Nissan’s NV for 2018 has you covered. Need more? How about a $30,000 base price and an unbeatable 5-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a more fuel-efficient diesel option and/or all-wheel drive, only the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter offers both. You can get a diesel engine and more modern conveniences on the Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster, plus a range of body lengths and wheelbase options.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Nissan NV cargo and passenger vans gain more standard features including a rearview camera, 5-inch color display plus Bluetooth streaming for phone and audio. The base S trim now comes with power window, power locks and remote keyless entry.</p>, <p>Provided you’re not hauling the NV’s maximum payload limits, Nissan’s 4.0-liter V6 proves a surprisingly capable choice. Standard on the NV1500 and NV2500 HD cargo vans, this engine delivers slightly less horsepower than the V6 engines in the Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster but has more torque. While the NV’s V6 is good for light-to-medium jobs, those with big projects in mind require the hauling power of Nissan’s 5.6-liter V8. Optional on the NV2500 HD and standard on the larger NV3500 HD model, the engine’s 375 horsepower and 387 lb-ft of torque permit it a payload of up to 3,540 pounds and the ability to tow up to 9,400 pounds. Fuel economy is far from best in segment, however, and while its ride is fairly composed, responsive steering and agile cornering are not the NV’s strongest attributes. You’ll get better traction from a front-drive Ford Transit or all-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, but the latter costs significantly more.</p>, <p>HIGH-ROOF OPTION<br>
 We don’t think the high-roof NV is going to win any awards for streamlined beauty, but it may pick up a couple medals for functionality. The roof’s additional height permits occupants to stand upright while working inside the truck, expanding the NV’s total interior volume to a massive 420.5 cubic feet.<br>
<br>
 INTERIOR FLEXIBILITY<br>
 With a need to be attractive to construction workers and catering services alike, the NV’s cargo hold is a fairly blank canvas outfitted with plenty of mounting points and electrical connections to allow easy customization. Passenger versions offer 324 different seating configurations.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Space is the 2018 Nissan NV's selling point, and there's plenty of it. Cargo models have seats for the driver and front passenger, with the rest of the bay ready to haul goods or get customized for business needs. For those needing the most space, models with the high-roof option expand cargo volume to 323.1 cubic feet, a nearly 90-cubic-foot addition vs. the 234.1 cubic feet in standard-roof models. Passenger models of Nissan's full-size van can accommodate up to 12 people. Seats in the three back rows can be removed or slid to create space for people and gear.</p>, <p>Form follows function in the Nissan NV, with the big van's slab-sided nature and overall large girth the keys to its ability to hold lots of stuff. Standard-roof models look like rectangles on wheels, while those with the high roof appear more like high-top sneakers. The high-roof option is reserved for NV2500 HD and NV3500 HD cargo models. Both cargo and passenger models have a sliding door on the passenger side for loading cargo and people, while the back doors have a 243-degree opening range for easier loading. Unlike some rivals, the NV comes in only one length: 240.6 inches.</p>, <p>A base version of Nissan’s 2018 NV1500 cargo van includes air conditioning, dozens of cargo mounts, pre-wiring for electrical upfitting, a tilt (but not telescoping) steering wheel, 17-inch steel wheels, AM/FM/CD stereo with 5-inch color touch screen, front side and side-curtain airbags plus Bluetooth connectivity. Also standard are power windows, power door locks and remote keyless entry. Cruise control is standard on all but the NV 1500 cargo van. Base-passenger models include seating for 12 with a dozen rear heating and cooling vents, eight cup holders/three bottle holders, four speakers for the audio system and side-curtain airbags covering all four rows.</p>, <p>Upgrades for the 2018 Nissan NV cargo and passenger vans include navigation, dual-zone air conditioning (passenger models), and a rear-window defroster. The SL top-line trim for cargo models includes an 8-way-power driver's seat, chrome bumpers, grille and door handles and a vehicle security system. In addition to the high-roof option, cargo models can be equipped with a rear glass door and side privacy windows. Higher-trim versions include a rear sonar system to aid reversing the big van, while top-line passenger models come with leather-appointed seats that are heated in front.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan NV comes with a 261-horsepower V6 engine that’s adequate for most duties. Optional on other models and standard in top trims is Nissan's 5.6-liter V8 good for 375 horsepower that offers satisfying thrust. Both engines run on regular unleaded gasoline, with the V6 connected to a 5-speed automatic and the V8 to a 7-speed transmission. All Nissan NV vans are rear-wheel drive. Maximum towing capacity for the V6 is 6,900 pounds (6,200 for passenger models), while the V8 tops out at 9,400 pounds (8,700 for passenger models). The EPA does not supply fuel-economy ratings for vehicles over 8,500 GVWR. The diesel offerings in the Sprinter and Ram rivals are more efficient, while smaller cargo vans like the Nissan NV200 use less-thirsty 4-cylinder engines.<br>

A well-equipped cargo version can reach over $38,000, while a loaded passenger version can top $45,000. At its base price, the Nissan NV Cargo undercuts the entry prices of the GMC Savana, Chevy Express and Ram ProMaster, and is several thousand less than a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.

[<p>Built for small businesses that don’t need a massive fleet, the 2018 Nissan NV200 van provides affordable transportation that’s easy to drive and economical to operate. Although not as large or sophisticated as the Ford Transit Connect or Ram ProMaster City, the NV200 can still haul 122 cubic feet of goods. The versatile cargo area can also be configured by upfitters to better serve the needs of its owner. The NV200’s small size makes it easy to park and maneuver in city traffic, and when the day is done, it can easily be stored in a residential-size garage. At just under $23,000, the NV200 bests its competition by few hundred to a few thousand dollars, as does its 5-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a small van as inexpensive to operate as it is to own, the compact 2018 Nissan NV200 is probably worth a look. Fuel-efficient and nimble, the NV200 is easy to live with, offering unique features like a passenger seat that folds flat to double as a desktop.</p>, <p>If you need more hauling ability than the NV200’s 1,480-pound limit, a Ford Transit Connect or Ram ProMaster City makes a better choice. All of the NV200’s competitors can be ordered with additional seating for passengers, with seating for up to eight people in the Mercedes-Benz Metris.</p>, <p>For 2018, the NV200 gains a 5-inch color audio display and rearview monitor. Also now standard are a USB port, Bluetooth for phone and music streaming, and a text-messaging assistant.</p>, <p>Beyond its low price, the Nissan NV200’s most appealing attribute is how easy it is to drive. The small size, car-like suspension and tight 36.7-foot turning radius permit the NV200 access to spaces larger vans and pickups wouldn’t dare attempt. Single-lane U-turns are no problem for this little van, and parallel parking is a snap thanks to the standard rearview monitor. The NV200’s large windshield offers excellent visibility and big side mirrors somewhat compensate for the large blind spots created by the solid side panels (side windows are optional). While the NV200 is easy to drive, it’s no powerhouse. The little 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine’s 131 horsepower is fine for low-speed cruising, and the CVT automatic makes the most of the engine’s power and fuel economy, but a loaded NV200 will definitely strain at speeds over 60 mph.</p>, <p>LONG WARRANTY<br>
 Nissan’s NV200 offers a best-in-class 5-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty besting its rivals from Ford, Ram and Mercedes. It’s the kind of added peace of mind fleet managers rarely enjoy.<br>
<br>
 60/40-SPLIT REAR CARGO DOORS<br>
 The NV200’s 60/40-split rear doors are a clever design. More functional than a traditional 50/50 setup, the offset allows a larger opening closer to the curb and a smaller door on the driver’s side that, when open, is less likely to impede traffic or bicyclists.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The NV200's interior places function over style. Though tidy on the outside, the NV200 hides 122.7 cubic feet of volume in its cargo bay and boasts a low, flat floor that makes loading a breeze. The cargo bay can hold standard 40 x 48-inch pallets. Payload maxes out at 1,480 pounds, below that of the Ford and Ram. Up front are two bucket seats, with the driver's seat offering a right armrest for added comfort. The passenger seat folds flat to create a desk or workbench, or more room for longer items. Audio and climate controls are simple but easy to use.</p>, <p>As a box on wheels, the NV200’s styling -- or lack thereof -- isn't its biggest priority. Function again trumps form. Accessibility is easy thanks to dual sliding side doors and 60/40-split rear French doors that open 180 degrees. At just over 21 inches, the cargo load floor is about two inches lower than that of the Transit Connect and slightly lower than that of the ProMaster City. At 186.3 inches, the NV200 is just a few inches longer than a Nissan Sentra sedan. Unlike the Transit Connect, however, the NV200 does not offer a choice of lengths.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan NV200 remains available in two trims: S and SV. The base S model comes with air conditioning, cargo-bay floor protector, cargo-area work light, manually adjustable front seats with vinyl wear patches, power windows, power door locks, Bluetooth, and an AM/FM/CD audio system with a USB and rearview monitor. As it's only about $950 more, we recommend the higher-trim SV model. It adds cruise control, a 12-volt power outlet in the rear, six D-rings mounted to the cargo floor, power heated exterior mirrors, satellite radio and wheel covers. All new NV200 models come with a 5-year/100,000-mile warranty.</p>, <p>Both trims of the Nissan NV200 can be had with rear-door windows, something we recommend for better visibility and overall safety. A window is also available on the passenger-side sliding door. Rear sonar sensors are optional to make backing up easier and safer, and a rearview camera is available on the NV200 SV. Cruise control can be had on base models, and both trims offer Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity. SV trims can be further upgraded with the NissanConnect navigation and mobile app system that includes a 5.8-inch touch screen, voice recognition and USB input.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan NV200 makes do with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that produces 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. A gearless continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) sends that power to the front wheels. With its latest CVT, the Nissan NV200 returns impressive fuel economy of up to 26 mpg on the highway and 25 mpg combined. The Nissan's powertrain is thrifty and runs on regular unleaded gasoline, but it's also weaker than the engines found in the Ford Transit Connect and Ram ProMaster City. If you require even more grunt -- and up to 5,000-pound towing capacity -- check out the larger Mercedes-Benz Metris.<br>

For slightly more -- $23,730 -- we suggest the SV model, which adds cruise control, a rear power outlet and upgraded exterior bits. Fully loaded, a Nissan NV200 still slots in below $25,000. The Ford Transit Connect cargo van starts over $24,000, while the Ram ProMaster City starts beyond $24,000. The Chevrolet City Express, mechanically similar to the Nissan NV200, starts at $23,850. With its new Worker base trim, the highly recommendable Mercedes-Benz Metris cargo van starts under $27,000 and is significantly more powerful and larger, yet can still be parked in a residential garage. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their new cargo van. We predict the NV200's resale value will be decent, on par with that of the Ford Transit Connect.</p>]

[<p>Introduced at a time when Ford and GM dominated the full-size van market, Nissan’s NV van for 2018 now finds itself up against a host of newer, European-inspired designs. To its credit, the Nissan NV manages to combine the best of old and new, offering a taller cargo bay than Chevrolet’s Express Van and a potent V8 engine not available on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster. As a work van, the NV can be configured to suit all manner of businesses, while in passenger form it can accommodate up to 12 people. The NV’s body-on-frame design and rear-wheel drive allow it a 9,400-pound tow rating, a number bested only by the aging Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana vans.</p>, <p>If you need your next work van to have a modern design but old-fashioned V8 power and towing ability, Nissan’s NV for 2018 has you covered. Need more? How about a $30,000 base price and an unbeatable 5-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a more fuel-efficient diesel option and/or all-wheel drive, only the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter offers both. You can get a diesel engine and more modern conveniences on the Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster, plus a range of body lengths and wheelbase options.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Nissan NV cargo and passenger vans gain more standard features including a rearview camera, 5-inch color display plus Bluetooth streaming for phone and audio. The base S trim now comes with power window, power locks and remote keyless entry.</p>, <p>Provided you’re not hauling the NV’s maximum payload limits, Nissan’s 4.0-liter V6 proves a surprisingly capable choice. Standard on the NV1500 and NV2500 HD cargo vans, this engine delivers slightly less horsepower than the V6 engines in the Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster but has more torque. While the NV’s V6 is good for light-to-medium jobs, those with big projects in mind require the hauling power of Nissan’s 5.6-liter V8. Optional on the NV2500 HD and standard on the larger NV3500 HD model, the engine’s 375 horsepower and 387 lb-ft of torque permit it a payload of up to 3,540 pounds and the ability to tow up to 9,400 pounds. Fuel economy is far from best in segment, however, and while its ride is fairly composed, responsive steering and agile cornering are not the NV’s strongest attributes. You’ll get better traction from a front-drive Ford Transit or all-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, but the latter costs significantly more.</p>, <p>HIGH-ROOF OPTION<br>
 We don’t think the high-roof NV is going to win any awards for streamlined beauty, but it may pick up a couple medals for functionality. The roof’s additional height permits occupants to stand upright while working inside the truck, expanding the NV’s total interior volume to a massive 420.5 cubic feet.<br>
<br>
 INTERIOR FLEXIBILITY<br>
 With a need to be attractive to construction workers and catering services alike, the NV’s cargo hold is a fairly blank canvas outfitted with plenty of mounting points and electrical connections to allow easy customization. Passenger versions offer 324 different seating configurations.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Space is the 2018 Nissan NV's selling point, and there's plenty of it. Cargo models have seats for the driver and front passenger, with the rest of the bay ready to haul goods or get customized for business needs. For those needing the most space, models with the high-roof option expand cargo volume to 323.1 cubic feet, a nearly 90-cubic-foot addition vs. the 234.1 cubic feet in standard-roof models. Passenger models of Nissan's full-size van can accommodate up to 12 people. Seats in the three back rows can be removed or slid to create space for people and gear.</p>, <p>Form follows function in the Nissan NV, with the big van's slab-sided nature and overall large girth the keys to its ability to hold lots of stuff. Standard-roof models look like rectangles on wheels, while those with the high roof appear more like high-top sneakers. The high-roof option is reserved for NV2500 HD and NV3500 HD cargo models. Both cargo and passenger models have a sliding door on the passenger side for loading cargo and people, while the back doors have a 243-degree opening range for easier loading. Unlike some rivals, the NV comes in only one length: 240.6 inches.</p>, <p>A base version of Nissan’s 2018 NV1500 cargo van includes air conditioning, dozens of cargo mounts, pre-wiring for electrical upfitting, a tilt (but not telescoping) steering wheel, 17-inch steel wheels, AM/FM/CD stereo with 5-inch color touch screen, front side and side-curtain airbags plus Bluetooth connectivity. Also standard are power windows, power door locks and remote keyless entry. Cruise control is standard on all but the NV 1500 cargo van. Base-passenger models include seating for 12 with a dozen rear heating and cooling vents, eight cup holders/three bottle holders, four speakers for the audio system and side-curtain airbags covering all four rows.</p>, <p>Upgrades for the 2018 Nissan NV cargo and passenger vans include navigation, dual-zone air conditioning (passenger models), and a rear-window defroster. The SL top-line trim for cargo models includes an 8-way-power driver's seat, chrome bumpers, grille and door handles and a vehicle security system. In addition to the high-roof option, cargo models can be equipped with a rear glass door and side privacy windows. Higher-trim versions include a rear sonar system to aid reversing the big van, while top-line passenger models come with leather-appointed seats that are heated in front.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan NV comes with a 261-horsepower V6 engine that’s adequate for most duties. Optional on other models and standard in top trims is Nissan's 5.6-liter V8 good for 375 horsepower that offers satisfying thrust. Both engines run on regular unleaded gasoline, with the V6 connected to a 5-speed automatic and the V8 to a 7-speed transmission. All Nissan NV vans are rear-wheel drive. Maximum towing capacity for the V6 is 6,900 pounds (6,200 for passenger models), while the V8 tops out at 9,400 pounds (8,700 for passenger models). The EPA does not supply fuel-economy ratings for vehicles over 8,500 GVWR. The diesel offerings in the Sprinter and Ram rivals are more efficient, while smaller cargo vans like the Nissan NV200 use less-thirsty 4-cylinder engines.<br>

[<p>Popular with families looking for a comfortable and spacious 3-row SUV, the 2018 Nissan Pathfinder offers high safety ratings and an extended list of safety features including automatic emergency braking and a blind-spot monitor. Now based on a sedan-like platform vs. a truck chassis, the new 2018 Nissan Pathfinder is more comfortable and more efficient than past iterations. With its mighty 284-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 engine and optional all-wheel drive, it competes well in a crowded SUV market that includes the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-9/">Mazda CX-9</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/explorer/">Ford Explorer</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/atlas/">Volkswagen Atlas</a> and Chevy Traverse. Four trim levels are available, S, SV, SL and Platinum with prices starting just under $31,000 for an S with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive can be added to any trim level for an additional $1,700.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a spacious 7-passenger SUV that’s quick, comfortable and easy to drive, the 2018 Nissan Pathfinder is a smart choice. The Pathfinder is filled with family-friendly features, and this year new active safety features like standard automatic emergency braking make the new Pathfinder even more appealing.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Pathfinder is powered by a conventional V6 engine. If you’re looking for a hybrid-powered SUV in this class, check out the Toyota Highlander, which is the only <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> in the segment. Also, the Pathfinder seats a maximum of seven, while the new Chevy Traverse offers seating for eight.</p>, <p>The new Pathfinder was heavily revised just last year with more power and safety. For 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> has continued the improvements, making automatic emergency braking standard along with a new system call Rear Door Alert. This clever system can help remind drivers of anything they may be forgetting in the back seat, including children and pets.</p>, <p>Last year Nissan significantly increased the horsepower of the new Pathfinder’s 3.5-liter V6 engine and the result is a powerful SUV that’s quick off the line and has no problem getting up to speed. Even at 70 mph, the Pathfinder has plenty of passing might in reserve, so it’s easy to get by the 18-wheeler that keeps creeping into your lane. Around town the 7-passenger Pathfinder returns a smooth ride and sedan-like handling. As with many Nissans, the Pathfinder uses a continuously variable transmission that for the most part does a good job mimicking a traditional automatic. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is the standard setup, while an All-Mode 4x4-i intelligent all-wheel-drive (AWD) system is optional on all trims. The system enhances traction and offers a full-lock setting for use on rough or slippery terrain. Thusly equipped the Pathfinder is capable of very light off-roading, and its hill-descent control eases the vehicle down steep slopes.</p>, <p>REAR-DOOR ALERT<br/> This clever system can help remind drivers that they may be forgetting something in the rear seat, including children, pets and valuables. If the system detects that a rear door is opened prior to driving, and it is not opened again at the end of the trip, the system can remind drivers that they may be leaving something behind.<br/> <br/> AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING<br/> This important safety system is now standard on every new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/pathfinder/">Nissan Pathfinder</a>. It monitors the SUV’s proximity to the vehicle ahead, giving the driver audible and visual display warnings if a potential collision is detected. If the driver fails to respond, the system can apply the brakes to reduce the speed of impact or hopefully avoid the collision.<br/> </p>, <p>All Nissan Pathfinders seat seven across three rows, with the second row a 3-person bench and the third row a pair of smaller seats. Legroom is generous in the first two rows, but the last row is tight for adults. Last year Nissan revamped the Pathfinder’s interior and improved its ergonomics with a redesigned center console and a larger 8-inch touch screen. Instead of the finicky, all-touch infotainment systems used in some other <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, you can easily tune the Pathfinder’s radio or adjust the volume by twisting a dial. Seating is comfortable, and the driver’s seat is height adjustable for shorter drivers.</p>, <p>Last year Nissan gave the Pathfinder a nip, tuck and a little front-end augmentation, and the SUV’s new curves and chromed-out V-Motion grille make it look younger and more vivacious. The overall shape is still conservative, even for this class, but it’s attractive, well-proportioned and it won’t look dated before you make your last payment. Roof rails add functionality, and the optional dual-panel moonroof does a great job opening up the cabin, even for 3rd-row passengers. The power-operated tailgate that's standard on higher trims is now motion-activated, meaning it can be opened with the swipe of a foot.</p>, <p>The Pathfinder remains available in four trims: S, SV, SL and Platinum. The least expensive 2018 Pathfinder S model comes with a V6 engine, tri-zone climate control, 8-inch touch-screen display with rearview-camera display, push-button ignition, 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat, 18-inch aluminum wheels, forward emergency braking and Rear Door Alert. Bluetooth wireless connectivity and a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with two USB inputs and HD Radio are also standard. In addition to airbags all around and traction- and stability-control systems, one notable safety feature is the Easy Fill Alert that beeps the horn when you fill the tires to the correct air pressure.</p>, <p>Stepping up from the base Pathfinder S to the SV trim level is recommendable for both its standard features and many options. Included are an 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat, automatic headlights, auto-dimming rearview mirror and rear sonar parking assist. Navigation, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and 13-speaker Bose audio system are also available on the SV. SL models come with the Around View monitor, power tailgate, blind-spot monitoring, leather interior and heated front seats and steering wheel. Top-line Platinum models include intelligent cruise control, navigation, panoramic moonroof and 20-inch wheels. A trailer towing package is available on all models except the S, and a rear-seat entertainment package is offered on the Platinum model.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Pathfinder SUV comes with an all-aluminum double-overhead-cam 3.5-liter V6 and a continuously variable automatic transmission. The V6 makes 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, which makes this the most powerful Pathfinder in the truck’s 30-year history. The engine happily runs on regular gasoline to keep down operating costs and has the grunt to tow up to 6,000 pounds. The standard setup remains front-wheel drive with all-wheel drive optional on all trims.<br>

Stepping up to the more recommendable Pathfinder SV trim is about $34,500. All-wheel drive is a $1,700 option. Go full-boat on a loaded, all-wheel-drive Pathfinder Platinum and you can touch $50,000. These prices are similar to those of the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/santa%20fe/">Hyundai Santa Fe</a>.

[<p>A comfortable and fuel-efficient compact SUV, the perennially popular 2018 Nissan Rogue is the brand’s best-selling model and it’s one of just a few compact <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> available as a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>. Offered in three trim levels, S, SV and SL, Rogue prices start just over $25,000, which is competitive for the segment that includes class-leading <a alt_o_t="Compact SUVs" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUVs</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a> as well as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a>. All models, including the Rogue Hybrid, are offered with front-wheel drive (FWD) or the more winter-capable all-wheel drive (AWD). Under the hood is a 170-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine matched with a smooth continuously variable automatic transmission. While the Rogue doesn't own hard cornering like a Mazda CX-5, or tow like the new Ford Escape, it more than excels in its day-to-day excellence.</p>, <p>Stylish both inside and out, the 2018 Nissan Rogue offers families and road-tripping adventurers exceptional comfort, space and value. The Rogue Hybrid is one of the most fuel-efficient SUVs in this class.</p>, <p>Some may find the 2018 Nissan Rogue to be light on horsepower compared to the more powerful Honda CR-V, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a> and turbocharged versions of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a> and Ford Escape. Also, the Rogue isn't expected to hold its value quite as well as the resale leaders: Subaru Forester, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Kia Sportage.</p>, <p>For 2018, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> has added Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity to all new Roque models. Nissan’s ProPilot Assist autonomous technology is also available for the first time on the Rogue. It helps drivers stay in their lane, navigate stop-and-go traffic and keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. A motion-activated tailgate has also been added to the SV trim level. And with 3rd-row seating gone as an option, the Rogue now comes only in 2-row, 5-passenger form.</p>, <p>Nissan’s special sauce with the 2018 Rogue is its size. It’s perfect. The SUV is large enough to feel spacious inside and substantial on the road, but it’s also nicely compact, so it’s easy to park and it doesn’t feel like a barge around town. The Rogue’s ride quality is excellent, and it gives the SUV an overall relaxed gait, which most buyers in this segment will appreciate. Also, the Rogue’s cabin is quiet, even at highway speeds it keeps the sounds of the outside world outside. Visibility is excellent and the Nissan’s maneuverability is admirable, although the Mazda CX-5 is quite a bit more fun to drive. The hybrid model’s 176 horsepower isn't a significant boost over the non-hybrid's 170, but the immediate response supplied by the Hybrid's battery gives it crisper low-end performance from stoplights. It should also be noted that the Rogue Hybrid's fuel economy is significantly better than the non-hybrid Rogue.</p>, <p>EZ FLEX SEATING SYSTEM<br/> With this optional system, every seat in the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue/">Nissan Rogue</a>, aside from the driver’s seat, folds down to accommodate cargo. Yes, even the front-passenger seat fold rearwards, which makes it possible to haul long items like an 8-foot ladder or a serious surfboard.<br/> <br/> SAFETY SHIELD TECHNOLOGIES<br/> Nissan loads up the 2018 Rogue with advanced safety systems. Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Safety Alert are standard on all models. The Rogue SL, which is the top trim level, gets standard Lane Departure Warning, Intelligent Lane Intervention, Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection and Intelligent Cruise Control.<br/> </p>, <p>The Rogue’s interior only amplifies Nissan’s reputation for high-quality, stylish cabins. There are soft-touch surfaces, tight tolerances and attractive illumination. The leather-wrapped fully adjustable flat-bottom steering wheel feels good in your hands, and its NASA-inspired “Zero Gravity” front seats -- leather-clad in SL models -- are supportive and comfortable. Legroom and headroom are good in the first and second rows, with an EZ-Flex 40/20/40-split 2nd-row bench seat that tilts and slides fore and aft in non-hybrid models. Cargo room for the non-hybrid Rogue is generous, less so in the hybrid, but the seats fold nearly flat, despite the battery’s location behind the second row.</p>, <p>In a sea of me-too SUVs that pack the visual punch of a sheet of blank white paper, the 2018 Nissan Rogue is a standout with youthful appeal and dynamic detailing. The Rogue’s "V-motion" grille treatment, edgy headlights and "boomerang" taillights give the SUV plenty of modern design elements without it feeling overly ornate or tragically insecure. Wheel diameters can climb to 19 inches and Nissan offers a motion-activated power rear liftgate on the Rogue. Standard on SL models and optional on SVs, the power liftgate responds to a kick-motion beneath the rear bumper to power the liftgate open or closed.</p>, <p>There are few surprises in the standard equipment of the base Rogue S: basic audio with Bluetooth phone/streaming and USB, a 5-inch color display, a rearview camera, EZ-Flex seating, and the flexible Divide-n-Hide rear-cargo-storage system. Also, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Safety Alert are standard on all models. Value comes into play on the Rogue SV models. SV highlights include a power-adjust driver's seat, 6-speaker audio, heated front seats and outside mirrors, dual-zone climate control, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic alerts, plus privacy glass and roof rails. With a Rogue SL, you'll enjoy leather seating, Bose audio, NissanConnect with 7-inch touch-screen navigation, the Around View monitor, a heated steering wheel, and the motion-activated power liftgate.</p>, <p>Option packages on the 2018 Nissan Rogue include the popular SV Sun and Sound Touring Package, which adds a laundry list of features including a panoramic sunroof, navigation and an around-view monitor to the Rogue S model. The SL Premium Package adds a power panoramic moonroof and LED headlights to the Rogue SV, and the SL Platinum Package acquires 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an electronic parking brake, Nissan’s new ProPilot autonomous system and the peace-of-mind of Intelligent Cruise Control. Last and highest, the SL Platinum Reserve Interior reupholsters your Rogue SL in exclusive tan leather with quilted inserts and unique stitching, and the popular Midnight Edition package adds black trim and wheels.</p>, <p>Nissan's adequate 170-horsepower inline-4 carries over in the 2018 Rogue, as does the Rogue Hybrid's fuel-pinching gasoline/electric hybrid setup. Both configurations send power to the driven wheels via Nissan's Xtronic continuously variable automatic transmission with driver-selectable Normal, Sport and Eco modes. The Rogue Hybrid is capable of automatically shutting off the engine and just running on the SUV's compact lithium-ion battery in order to keep the vehicle's fuel-economy numbers healthy.<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.5-liter inline-4<br/> 170 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 175 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 26/33 mpg (FWD), 25/32 mpg (AWD)<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.0-liter inline-4 + electric motor (Hybrid)<br/> 176 horsepower (peak output w/gasoline and electric combined)<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 33/35 mpg (FWD), 31/34 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The pricing structure for the 2018 Nissan Rogue is very direct: S (base), SV (more standard features -- this level is our strongest recommendation) -- and SL (top-of-the-line). A base Rogue S model (no Hybrid at this level) has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $25,750 including a $975 destination charge. The gasoline-only Rogue SV begins around $27,000, with the SV Hybrid starting about $1,000 higher. At the top tier, the Rogue SL is $32,000, with about a $1,200 premium for the Rogue SL Hybrid. You can add all-wheel drive to any model for $1,350. These prices run fairly close to comparable competitors, with the exception of the feature-richer Kia Sportage. Before you can make your best deal, check the KBB Fair Purchase Price for a better idea of what Rogues are going for in your neighborhood. At the end of the road, your resale value will be good, but not Forester/CR-V/RAV4/Sportage strong.<br>

[<p>Smaller and less expensive than its larger Rogue sibling, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/nissan/rogue%20sport/2018/">2018 Nissan Rogue Sport</a> is designed to appeal to young singles and older empty-nesters. As a subcompact SUV, the Rogue Sport offers a nice balance of features, price, accommodations and good fuel economy. Although missing the Rogue’s available 3rd-row seat and larger cargo bay, the Rogue Sport features the same dash, and by default most of the same high-tech infotainment and safety features. The Rogue Sport’s rear seat isn’t as versatile as the Honda HR-V’s Magic Seat, but it is larger than that of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a>. And while we love the idea of a pint-sized Rogue, the Sport is lacking in power and some must-have options, such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a subcompact SUV that offers good fuel economy, a comfortable interior and a low price, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/nissan/rogue/2018/">2018 Nissan Rogue</a> should be on your shopping list. Available all-wheel drive expands the Rogue Sport’s weekend possibilities, as well as increases confidence when driving in winter.</p>, <p>If you plan of doing any kind of serious off-roading, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/renegade/">Jeep Renegade</a> Trailhawk or a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> makes a superior pick. Looking for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto? The Chevy Trax and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/niro/">Kia Niro</a> have it. Need more power? Check out Hyundai’s turbocharged Kona.</p>, <p>Introduced just last year, the 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport sees only minor tweaks to its optional equipment. The SV Premium and All-Weather packages are combined to form the SV Technology package, while the SL Premium package acquires the contents from the previous Platinum package.</p>, <p>In car language, adding "sport" to the name is something like making a "fun-size" candy bar: all the same flavor in a smaller package. That's certainly the case in the 2018 Rogue Sport. With 141 horsepower under the hood, a continuously variable automatic transmission, and a suspension that's tuned to be neither too soft around corners nor too firm around town, the Rogue Sport walks the right line between comfort and control, and acceleration and fuel economy. Acceleration isn't stunning, considering that 141 horsepower has to haul around 3,225 to 3,380 pounds of Rogue Sport, depending on model. But aside from passing on the freeway the drivetrain showed little resistance to the usual duties of getting around town. At freeway speeds noise levels were nicely controlled as well, allowing easy conversation. The Rogue Sport benefits from its bigger sibling by feeling more substantial than many competitors, without feeling bulky.</p>, <p>AROUND-VIEW CAMERA<br/> If one camera looking backwards is a good idea, then a gaggle of cameras providing a bird’s-eye view of all fours sides is an exceptional one. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> pioneered this technology and we’re glad to see them offering it even on entry-level models like the Rogue Sport.<br/> <br/> DIVIDE-AND-HIDE CARGO<br/> Using a set of solid plastic movable shelves, the Rogue Sport’s cargo area can be customized to whatever configuration best suits your needs. You can create a 2-tier loading floor, or move the front floor panel to a vertical position to create a box-like area perfect for storing loose items.</p>, <p>As the 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport is basically a three-quarter version of the larger Rogue, it’s no surprise the interior layouts are pretty much the same. The dash, instrument cluster, steering wheel and door panels are mirror images of one another, creating a well-organized if not somewhat generic design that serves its purpose. Front-seat legroom is also identical, but the rear seats come up a bit short in both headroom and legroom. However, compared to its competition, the Rogue Sport’s interior dimensions are right in line, with an acceptable 22 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats up, and 61.6 with them folded down.</p>, <p>Visually, we like the Rogue Sport’s exterior design. It looks more sporty and modern than the larger Rogue upon which it is based. Familiar Nissan styling cues such as the V-motion grille and sleek wraparound taillights are in place, as are the attractive black wheel-arch moldings and lower plastic cladding. A dramatic up-kick at the rear-quarter-panel glass gives a rather sinister look, as do the available 19-inch alloy wheels. Compared to most competitors in this segment, the Rogue Sport is slightly larger, nearing the dimensions of larger compact <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/compass/">Jeep Compass</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a>.</p>, <p>The base 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport S comes standard with Bluetooth phone integration with Siri eyes-free, a rearview camera and Nissan's clever Easy Fill Tire Alert, which honks the horn once the tire pressure has reached the correct level. You also get air conditioning, manual cloth seats, remote keyless entry, and cruise control. Also standard are 16-inch alloy wheels and LED accents in the headlights. The only engine is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, connected to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT).</p>, <p>The mid-level Rogue Sport SV adds larger 17-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, push-button start, a 6-way-power driver's seat, and dual-zone climate control; a premium package adds blind-spot detection and the around-view monitor. The top-level SL gets 19-inch wheels, fog lights, remote start, Nissan's Around-View Monitor bird's-eye-view camera system, navigation, leather on the shifter, and heated steering wheel and seats. Option packages include the SL Premium package that adds a power moonroof, LED low beams, intelligent cruise control, lane-departure warning and prevention, and emergency braking with pedestrian detection on SL models. Unfortunately, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not currently available on the Rogue Sport.</p>, <p>You can have any engine you want in Nissan’s 2018 Rogue Sport, as long as it is Nissan's 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 141 horsepower. It's routed to either the front wheels (FWD) or all four wheels (AWD) through a continuously variable automatic transmission. The all-wheel-drive system on this SUV, however, is set up for foul weather and dirt roads, not true off-roading. The little engine delivers decent power, and even though it's not what we'd call quick, pretty much everything in this class suffers from the same complaint. Fuel economy is good, although it trails the EPA estimates for the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a>.<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.0-liter inline-4<br/> 141 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 147 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/32 mpg (FWD), 24/30 mpg (AWD)</p>, <p>The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a base 2018 Nissan Rogue Sport S starts just over $22,600 when you include the $975 destination charge. The SV starts close to $24,200, and the SL is just shy of $27,300. That's for front-wheel drive; the all-wheel-drive system adds $1,350 to each model. A fully loaded <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue%20sport/">Nissan Rogue Sport</a> SL with AWD will run about $28,600. A loaded AWD Rogue Sport SL with the Premium package will run more than $31,650. Base prices are on par with the Mazda CX-3 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/trax/">Chevrolet Trax</a>, but that's a couple thousand more than a loaded Honda HR-V. Before buying, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what others in your area are paying for their Rogue Sport. As for resale, we expect the Rogue Sport to hold values better than the Chevrolet Trax, just below those of the Mazda CX-3 and Jeep Renegade and well below the Honda HR-V.</p>]

[<p>A roomy compact sedan, the fuel-efficient 2018 Nissan Sentra is perennially popular with first-time car buyers and budget-minded consumers looking for a sporty 4-door. Now in its seventh generation, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> offers the new Sentra in a wide range of models including the fun-to-drive SR Turbo and the Sentra Nismo, which is a factory-tuned sports sedan with 188 horsepower. Not much smaller than the midsize <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/altima/">Nissan Altima</a>, the Sentra seats five and features a long list of available luxuries and the latest safety features including adaptive cruise-control and autonomous-braking systems. Most models are available with a manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic transmission. Prices start around $17,000 for the base Sentra S, but we recommend stepping up to at least the better-equipped Sentra SV for about $20,000. Competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a> and Chevy Cruze.</p>, <p>More spacious than many of its rivals, the 2018 Nissan Sentra is large for its class, which is one of the reasons it’s consistently one of America’s best-selling cars. Shoppers also appreciate the new Sentra’s well-earned reputation for reliability, comfort and style. Plus it's fun-to-drive personality and impressive fuel efficiency.</p>, <p>The new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/sentra/">Nissan Sentra</a> is available only as a 4-door sedan. If you’re looking for a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a>, check out the Honda Civic, VW Golf, Mazda3 or Chevy Cruze. Enthusiast drivers should also look at the better-performing VW Golf GTI and Golf R, the Honda Civic Si and Type R and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus%20st/">Ford Focus ST</a> and RS.</p>, <p>For 2018 Nissan has made Automatic Emergency Braking standard on all models except those with a manual transmission and the Sentra Nismo. A Rearview Monitor and 5-inch color screen are now standard on all models including the base Sentra S. The Sentra SV gets 16-inch wheels and standard dual-zone climate control. Other trim levels also get a boost of standard equipment.</p>, <p>The Sentra’s ride is comfortable and visibility is excellent. The interior is also pleasingly spacious and comfortable. It’s a pleasant sedan in the city, but it’s not a car you would hesitate to road-trip through a few states either. Its interior is quiet on the highway, and its highway fuel economy is impressive. It’s easy to average over 35 mpg. Power is sufficient, but a drive in the mountains with a few on board will make you wish for more. With 188 horsepower speed comes easier for the Sentra SR Turbo and Sentra Nismo. These turbocharged models are quick and much more fun to drive. However, even in Nismo trim the Sentra’s handling is not the best in this class. The Sentra still uses an antiquated rear-suspension design that keeps it from turning corners as well as the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and Ford Focus, which are more athletic. The Sentra’s steering does feel good, however, and its brakes provide plenty of strong stopping power.</p>, <p>ACTIVE UNDERSTEER CONTROL<br/> This system is standard on all Sentras except the base Sentra S with the manual transmission. It’s also used on the Nissan Altima. It improves both the performance and overall safety of the vehicle by lightly braking the inside front wheels during cornering, which enhances traction and the sedan’s ability to turn. Its operation is completely undetectable by the driver.<br/> <br/> SAFETY SHIELD TECHNOLOGIES<br/> The 2018 Sentra is one of Nissan’s most affordable <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>, but it still offers an impressive list of active safety systems. Automatic Emergency Braking is now standard on all automatic-transmission-equipped models except the Sentra Nismo. Intelligent Cruise Control, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert are also available.<br/> </p>, <p>Inside, the 2018 Sentra offers one of the largest interiors in its class. In fact, according to the EPA's classification system, there's so much room inside the Sentra it's actually a midsize. There’s room for five, ample rear-seat legroom and large trunk capacity of 15.1 cubic feet. A 60/40-split fold-down rear seat is standard. The front seats are comfortable, and the interior layout is simple and intuitive. High-quality materials include soft-touch door armrests, which improve comfort on long drives. Our test car’s piano-black accents were a nice touch and the 5-inch color LED info screen between the main gauges was useful.</p>, <p>Unlike its little brother, the frumpy <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a> sedan, the 2018 Sentra is well proportioned and attractive. Its design closely mimics the shape of Nissan’s larger Altima sedan with athletic curves and a subtle flare of its wheel wells. Although it’s more conservative than some other designs in the class, the Sentra’s sculpted flanks and dramatic headlights and grille treatment keep it from being boring, while the touches of bright trim around the greenhouse, grille and door handles give it an upscale presence. SL and SR trim levels feature LED low-beam headlights as well. Nissan’s wheel designs are also attractive and the Sentra Nismo gets dark chrome, unique side sills, aggressive front and rear bumper covers and a red stripe.</p>, <p>The most basic 2018 Nissan Sentra is the S, and it comes with a 6-speed manual, three driving modes -- Eco, Normal and Sport -- and standard air conditioning. It's also equipped with Bluetooth phone and audio integration, a USB port, keyless entry and truck release, electroluminescent gauges, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, auto headlights, and an audio system with four speakers. For extra cargo space, the rear seatbacks fold in a 60/40 split. Starting this year all new Sentras with the automatic transmission get Automatic Emergency Braking, and the automatic is standard on SV, SR and SL models.</p>, <p>The 2018 Sentra SL is the top dog, but the Sentra SR also comes with the LED low-beam headlights, larger 17-inch alloy wheels and keyless ignition, and it can be equipped with the same upgraded audio system that includes a 5.8-inch screen and navigation. SR and SL models also get heated outside mirrors, and the SL gets a moonroof and leather upholstery. Other available luxuries include Nissan Voice Recognition for audio and navigation and a long list of safety systems including Intelligent Cruise Control, Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The Sentra Nismo gets sports seats, red interior accents and a racy suede-and-leather-covered steering wheel.</p>, <p>For 2018 Nissan’s Sentra comes with two engine choices. S, SV, SR and SL use a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder that, with only 130 horsepower (124 horsepower with the automatic transmission), is among the least powerful in the class. The SR Turbo gets a turbocharged 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine that bumps output to a more respectable 188 horsepower. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) works its magic to get the Sentra up to speed with little fuss, and passing power is fine as long as you plan a heartbeat ahead. There is a 6-speed manual transmission available, but only on the base model, the SR Turbo and the Sentra Nismo, and it actually hurts fuel economy, rather than helping it.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/nissan/titan-crew-cab/2018
[<p>After a successful launch last year, the larger, more powerful 2018 Nissan Titan pickup continues to make inroads in a market largely dominated by the domestic manufacturers. Offered in a variety of configurations including Single Cab, King Cab and Crew Cab, the Titan looks to lure buyers away from the Ford F-150, Ram 1500 and Chevy Silverado, as well as the aging Toyota Tundra. A powerful V8 engine remains the only powertrain choice, putting the Titan at a bit of a disadvantage when compared with the Ram’s diesel-engine offering or the F-150’s available turbocharged V6 engines. However, the Titan does offer a number of innovative features, the popular off-road PRO-4X trim and the best full-size pickup truck warranty in the industry.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a truck with a great warranty, the 2018 Nissan Titan’s 5-year/100,000-mile powertrain coverage is standard for both individual owners and fleet sales. The Titan also carries a “Made in America” stamp.</p>, <p>While it may look big and bad, Nissan’s half-ton pickup still can’t match its rivals in the area of features, technology, fuel economy or towing. Unlike the Ram, the Titan doesn’t offer a diesel-engine option, although you can get one in the larger Titan XD (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/nissan/titan-xd-crew-cab/2018/">reviewed separately</a>).</p>, <p>Following last year's introduction, the 2018 Nissan Titan carries over largely unchanged. The promised V6 engine never materialized, leaving owners seeking better fuel economy to look elsewhere. A new Midnight Edition package is offered on Crew Cab SV and SL grades.</p>, <p>Powered by a 390-horsepower, 5.6-liter V8, the 2018 Nissan Titan pickup feels powerful and confident. Nissan has done a good job of insulating the Titan’s interior from road and wind noise, although punching the accelerator does allow the V8’s satisfying growl to penetrate the cozy cabin. The Titan’s 7-speed automatic does an excellent job of maximizing power and fuel economy, and we had no issues with its timing when it came to choosing the right gear for the right situation. Regrettably, in the areas of handling, maneuverability and steering effort, the Titan falls short of the benchmarks set by the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500. And, while the V8 engine is more than up to the task for hauling and towing, in actual everyday work situations we found the 5.6-liter engine didn’t feel as effortless as the twin-turbocharged V6 in the F-150.</p>, <p>DAMPED TAILGATE<br>
 The Titan’s dampened tailgate is standard on every model. The design keeps the gate from slamming down as it nears the full open position, then assists when raising the tailgate to the close position.<br>
<br>
 WARRANTY<br>
 The Titan’s 5-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty is the best in the industry, at least when comparing it to other gasoline-engine warranties. The additional time and mileage coverage may prove irresistible to fleet managers as well as individuals who tend to quickly put a lot of miles on their trucks.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The interiors for the Single Cab, King Cab and Crew Cab are similar in design, but vary in their passenger accommodations. Lower trims can seat up to six passengers thanks to a 40/20/40-split front bench, but most buyers will opt for a pair of front bucket seats, lowering total capacity to five. Interior materials and amenities range from a cloth-and-vinyl basic work truck to the plushness of a luxury car. The top-line Platinum Reserve Titan features supple leather, heated and ventilated front seats and open-pore wood finishes. The 60/40-split rear seats can be flipped up to create a secure, wide and tall space in the rear of the cab.</p>, <p>Compared to the first generation, the 2018 Titan seems bigger, bolder and brasher. From the honeycombed grille to the headlight housings and mirrors, everything seems to have gone up a size -- or three. It should be obvious that the Titan is a substantial rig. The half-ton Titan is 228.1 inches long -- which is still over a foot shorter than the Titan XD that is built on a different, more robust chassis. The Crew Cab models feature a standard 5.5-foot bed, while the King Cab and Single Cab variants offer bed lengths of 6.5 and eight feet, respectively.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Titan half-ton truck is available in five trims: S, SV, PRO-4X, SL and Platinum Reserve. The least expensive S version is pretty basic but does include cruise control, air conditioning, power windows, manual-sliding rear window and a 6-speaker audio system with 5-inch display with Bluetooth connectivity and USB input. Most buyers would do well to step up a trim or two. SV versions provide the option for front bucket seats, which also allow for height adjustment. They also include trailer-sway control, power-adjust mirrors, upgraded cloth interior, SiriusXM satellite radio and chrome accents.</p>, <p>Keep moving up trims and you can get a leather interior, climate-controlled front seats, safety features like blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, upgraded 7-inch infotainment system with navigation, Rockford Fosgate premium audio system, sonar-based front and rear parking assist, and the helpful AroundView bird's-eye-camera system. Off-road enthusiasts might dig the PRO-4X model that includes Bilstein shocks, all-terrain off-road tires, electronic locking rear differential and skidplates. Midnight Editions gain 20-inch black wheels, charcoal interior and various body-color and black-finished trim pieces.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Titan offers just one engine -- a stout 5.6-liter gasoline V8. This big V8 is connected to a 7-speed automatic transmission and can be had in standard rear-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel drive (4WD). The engine makes a hearty 390 horsepower, but beware of its thirst. Titan 4x2 models are rated to tow up to 9,740 pounds, while 4-wheel-drive versions max out at 9,560 pounds.<br>

The base King Cab starts around $34,000 and adding 4-wheel drive raises the price to around $39,000. The Crew Cab runs from a low of $36,725 to just over $57,350 for the top-line Platinum Reserve edition. Crew-cab versions of the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 begin slightly less, but come with a V6 as standard vs. the Titan's V8. A crew-cab Chevy Silverado with a V6 starts slightly above the Titan. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. Initial resale values after the first year suggest the Titan will remain competitive with the Ford F-150 and Chevy Silverado, but fall well short of the values held by the Toyota Tundra.</p>]

Unlike the Ram, the Titan doesn’t offer a diesel-engine option, although you can get one in the larger Titan XD (<a href="https://www.kbb.com/nissan/titan-xd-crew-cab/2018/">reviewed separately</a>).</p>, <p>Following last year's introduction, the 2018 Nissan Titan carries over largely unchanged. The promised V6 engine never materialized, leaving owners seeking better fuel economy to look elsewhere. A new Midnight Edition package is offered on Crew Cab SV and SL grades.</p>, <p>Powered by a 390-horsepower, 5.6-liter V8, the 2018 Nissan Titan pickup feels powerful and confident. Nissan has done a good job of insulating the Titan’s interior from road and wind noise, although punching the accelerator does allow the V8’s satisfying growl to penetrate the cozy cabin. The Titan’s 7-speed automatic does an excellent job of maximizing power and fuel economy, and we had no issues with its timing when it came to choosing the right gear for the right situation. Regrettably, in the areas of handling, maneuverability and steering effort, the Titan falls short of the benchmarks set by the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500. And, while the V8 engine is more than up to the task for hauling and towing, in actual everyday work situations we found the 5.6-liter engine didn’t feel as effortless as the twin-turbocharged V6 in the F-150.</p>, <p>DAMPED TAILGATE<br>
 The Titan’s dampened tailgate is standard on every model. The design keeps the gate from slamming down as it nears the full open position, then assists when raising the tailgate to the close position.<br>
<br>
 WARRANTY<br>
 The Titan’s 5-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty is the best in the industry, at least when comparing it to other gasoline-engine warranties. The additional time and mileage coverage may prove irresistible to fleet managers as well as individuals who tend to quickly put a lot of miles on their trucks.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The interiors for the Single Cab, King Cab and Crew Cab are similar in design, but vary in their passenger accommodations. Lower trims can seat up to six passengers thanks to a 40/20/40-split front bench, but most buyers will opt for a pair of front bucket seats, lowering total capacity to five. Interior materials and amenities range from a cloth-and-vinyl basic work truck to the plushness of a luxury car. The top-line Platinum Reserve Titan features supple leather, heated and ventilated front seats and open-pore wood finishes. The 60/40-split rear seats can be flipped up to create a secure, wide and tall space in the rear of the cab.</p>, <p>Compared to the first generation, the 2018 Titan seems bigger, bolder and brasher. From the honeycombed grille to the headlight housings and mirrors, everything seems to have gone up a size -- or three. It should be obvious that the Titan is a substantial rig. The half-ton Titan is 228.1 inches long -- which is still over a foot shorter than the Titan XD that is built on a different, more robust chassis. The Crew Cab models feature a standard 5.5-foot bed, while the King Cab and Single Cab variants offer bed lengths of 6.5 and eight feet, respectively.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Titan half-ton truck is available in five trims: S, SV, PRO-4X, SL and Platinum Reserve. The least expensive S version is pretty basic but does include cruise control, air conditioning, power windows, manual-sliding rear window and a 6-speaker audio system with 5-inch display with Bluetooth connectivity and USB input. Most buyers would do well to step up a trim or two. SV versions provide the option for front bucket seats, which also allow for height adjustment. They also include trailer-sway control, power-adjust mirrors, upgraded cloth interior, SiriusXM satellite radio and chrome accents.</p>, <p>Keep moving up trims and you can get a leather interior, climate-controlled front seats, safety features like blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, upgraded 7-inch infotainment system with navigation, Rockford Fosgate premium audio system, sonar-based front and rear parking assist, and the helpful AroundView bird's-eye-camera system. Off-road enthusiasts might dig the PRO-4X model that includes Bilstein shocks, all-terrain off-road tires, electronic locking rear differential and skidplates. Midnight Editions gain 20-inch black wheels, charcoal interior and various body-color and black-finished trim pieces.</p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Titan offers just one engine -- a stout 5.6-liter gasoline V8. This big V8 is connected to a 7-speed automatic transmission and can be had in standard rear-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel drive (4WD). The engine makes a hearty 390 horsepower, but beware of its thirst. Titan 4x2 models are rated to tow up to 9,740 pounds, while 4-wheel-drive versions max out at 9,560 pounds.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/21 mpg (2WD &amp; 4WD), 15/20 mpg (PRO-4X)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Titan Single Cab 2WD has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just over $31,000 for the S model, while 4WD models start just over $34,000. The base King Cab starts around $34,000 and adding 4-wheel drive raises the price to around $39,000. The Crew Cab runs from a low of $36,725 to just over $57,350 for the top-line Platinum Reserve edition. Crew-cab versions of the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 begin slightly less, but come with a V6 as standard vs. the Titan's V8. A crew-cab Chevy Silverado with a V6 starts slightly above the Titan. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. Initial resale values after the first year suggest the Titan will remain competitive with the Ford F-150 and Chevy Silverado, but fall well short of the values held by the Toyota Tundra.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> Titan XD offers more power and towing ability than the standard Titan pickup, thanks in part to its more robust frame and available 5.0-liter Cummins turbodiesel engine.

From its zero-gravity heated and quilted leather seats to the 360-degree Around View monitor, the Titan can pamper as well as it performs. The Titan is a big truck and you’ll notice it upon first climbing behind the wheel. However, like driving any big truck, you quickly get used to it. The Cummins turbodiesel V8 offers plenty of power for accelerating and towing, although its forward progression is more linear than rocket-like.

 Cummins builds some of the best diesel engines in the world, and the 5.0-liter turbodiesel V8 in the Titan XD is no exception. With 555 lb-ft of torque, the Titan XD feels locomotive-like in its ability to tow and haul, and it gets slightly better fuel economy than its gasoline V8 counterpart.<br>
<br>
 AROUND VIEW MONITOR<br>
 Nissan’s Around View monitor provides a 360-degree view of the area outside the truck. This feature is not only helpful when parking, but can be useful in the wilderness by showing low obstacles in the Titan’s path or when hooking up a trailer without the assistance of a spotter.<br>

The V8 turbodiesel is the most significant option. Other options include 20-inch wheels, spray-in bedliner, integrated gooseneck hitch and trailer-sway control (both standard on all but the S), a 110-volt outlet in the truck bed and trailer-brake controller. Extendable, heated auto-dimming tow mirrors are also offered. Inside, Titan XD buyers can opt for heated/cooled leather power seats, 7-inch color touch screen, 12-speaker audio, satellite radio, navigation, Siri Eyes Free and a DVD entertainment system.</p>, <p>There are two engines offered in the Titan XD, a standard 390-horsepower 5.6-liter double-overhead-cam V8 with direct injection.

For comparison, the least expensive Ford F-150 SuperCrew with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine and 12,100 pounds of towing capacity is about $46,000. To tow 12,000 pounds with a Chevy Silverado 1500 Crew Cab costs at least $47,000.

For comparison, the least expensive Ford F-150 SuperCrew with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine and 12,100 pounds of towing capacity is about $46,000. To tow 12,000 pounds with a Chevy Silverado 1500 Crew Cab costs at least $47,000. On the other end of the spectrum, an F-250 Crew Cab with the turbodiesel V8 and 14,000 pounds of towing capacity starts around $46,000. Be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2018 Nissan Titan XD. As for resale, the Titan XD is holding its own against the Ford F-150 and F-250, and doing slightly better than the Ram 1500/2500 models.</p>]

[<p>With a base price below $13,000, the 2018 Nissan Versa is an affordable, comfortable and economical subcompact sedan with a roomy interior, large trunk and popular features. It’s also the least expensive new car available in the United States, undercutting its competition that includes the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio, Toyota Yaris iA, Chevy Sonic, Ford Fiesta and Mitsubishi Mirage. A 5-speed manual transmission is standard on the Versa S, but move up to the Versa S Plus and you get an automatic transmission, Bluetooth, a rear spoiler and cruise control for an additional $2,200. Buyers can also step up to the Versa SV, which is the top of the range. All models are powered by a 109-horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine, which is light, even for this class, while the Ford Fiesta and Honda Fit both offer better driving dynamics.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for the lowest possible price you’ll like the 2018 Nissan Versa. It’s not only the least expensive new car for sale in the United States, but it’s extremely fuel efficient and its roomy interior can seat five passengers. Its 14.9-cubic-foot trunk space is also large for its class.</p>, <p>The Versa is available only as a sedan. If you’re looking for a small, affordable and fuel-efficient hatchback, check out the 2018 Nissan Versa Note, which is reviewed separately. Some may find the Versa sedan’s very low starting price attractive, but know that the base model comes with a manual transmission, manual crank windows and manual door locks.</p>, <p>For 2018 the new Nissan Versa Sedan gets a few small upgrades. Nissan has added standard adjustable front headrests, map lights and variable intermittent windshield wipers to all trim levels. There’s also a new exterior color, Deep Blue Pearl.<b></b></p>, <p>Looking at its base price, it’s easy to expect the 2018 Nissan Versa to be as rough-riding as a stage coach and just as noisy. Slow too, and with a driver’s seat that feels like a milk crate. Wrong. Our Versa SV test vehicle was a pleasant surprise from behind its leather-wrapped steering wheel. It’s comfortable, quiet for its class, and it feels substantial going down the road. No, it’s not going to pamper you like a new Mercedes or thrill you like a supercar, but the Versa is agile and its little 4-cylinder engine has just enough power to move the little sedan with zip. There’s good steering feel, plus a tight turn radius that makes parking this small sedan a snap, excellent visibility, comfortable and supportive seats, and good head- and legroom. The continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) is extremely smooth and increases fuel economy compared to the 5-speed manual.</p>, <p>GENEROUS REAR-SEAT LEGROOM<br>
With its expansive 102.4-inch wheelbase, which is long for the subcompact class, the 2018 Nissan Versa offers an impressive amount of rear-seat legroom. It measures 37 inches, which is more than you get in most of its competitors including the Chevy Sonic, Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio.<br>
<br>
HIGH FUEL ECONOMY<br>
The 2018 Nissan Versa may not be as powerful or fun-to-drive as some of its rivals, but its fuel economy is impressive. Models with the Xtronic CVT are rated 31 mpg in the city and 39 mpg out on the highway. Those numbers make it more fuel efficient than the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Chevy Sonic.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The interior of the 2018 Nissan Versa is comfortable, ergonomically sensible and nicely assembled. It’s also one of the most spacious in its class. Rear passengers get 37 inches of legroom, three inches more than in the Chevy Sonic. Headroom is also generous. Even the trunk is big with its 14.9 cubic feet, which expands when you fold the rear seatbacks on higher trims. The design isn't fancy, and the controls and materials are all basic. The three knobs that control the air conditioning and heat are well-sized, and the infotainment system is easy to use. The tilt/telescope steering wheel and height-adjustable seat made getting comfortable easy.</p>, <p>From some angles it’s easy to confuse the 2018 Nissan Versa with the larger and more expensive Nissan Sentra and Altima sedans. The Versa, with its long 102.4-inch wheelbase and 175.4-inch overall length, is big for the subcompact class, and it looks aspirational with its chrome grille surround, our test car’s chrome door handles and its body-color outside mirrors. The Versa's tall doors make entry and exit easier, and the long rear doors simplify installing a child safety seat. You get nicer-looking alloy wheels on higher-end SL and SV models, and fog lights are part of the optional SV Special Edition Package, which is available only on the top SV trim level.</p>, <p>The basic 2018 Nissan Versa is pretty basic, but it does come with air conditioning, power mirrors, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD/aux audio system, tilt steering wheel, trip computer, Bluetooth for your phone, front disc/rear drum brakes, 15-inch steel wheels with covers, vanity mirrors and a rear defroster. It also comes with a 5-speed manual transmission and hand-cranked manual windows. If you want such features as power windows, power door locks, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver's seat, or even a remote trunk release, you'll have to step up to a higher trim level, such as the S Plus or SV trims.</p>, <p>Climbing the model ladder is the best way to get more stuff on the 2018 Versa. Mid-level SV models get a 6-way-adjustable driver's seat, split-folding rear seats, better interior fabric, and an upgraded audio system that includes a USB input. Top-of-the-line SV models get push-button start, NissanConnect with navigation and mobile apps, and 15-inch alloy wheels. All Versa models above basic S get the CVT automatic transmission. The SV Special Edition is the only option package this year, and for just $500 it adds streaming audio through Bluetooth, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 5.0-inch color display audio, variable-speed windshield wipers, fog lights and SiriusXM satellite radio. Also available is a set of black alloy wheels for $495.</p>, <p>The only engine available in the front-wheel-drive 2018 Nissan Versa sedan is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder with 109 horsepower. That's not a lot of power, but the Versa's not a lot of car, either. Besides, with the CVT automatic transmission it gets an impressive 39 mpg on the highway according to the EPA. If you get the basic Versa S you get a standard 5-speed manual transmission but we suggest skipping it and moving up to the S Plus model with the automatic if you can.<br>
<br>
1.6-liter inline-4<br>
109 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
107 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/36 mpg (5-speed manual), 31/39 mpg (CVT automatic)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Versa S has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $12,875 including the $885 destination charge, making it the least expensive new car available in the U.S. But the price climbs quickly; move up to the Versa S Plus to get the Xtronic automatic transmission and the price jumps to about $15,000. However, even if you get the top-line Versa SV, you'll still pay less than $17,000, which is pretty good for a fully loaded new car. By comparison, the Kia Rio has a more powerful engine and a longer warranty, and starts around $15,000; same with the Chevy Sonic, Hyundai Accent, Toyota Yaris and Ford Fiesta. Whatever you decide, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their Versa. Strong resale value is another characteristic of the Versa, where it's a best-in-class leader.</p>]

[<p>A spacious subcompact, the fuel-efficient 2018 Nissan Versa Note is a popular hatchback with small families, first-time buyers and commuters on a tight budget. Although it’s mechanically similar to the less expensive Nissan Versa sedan, the Versa Note hatchback offers quite a bit more cargo space and a sportier appearance. Nissan offers the new Versa Note in three trim levels, S, SV and SR. All are powered by a 109-horsepower 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine and a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). Although it’s one of the least powerful cars in its class, it’s also one of the more affordable with a starting price under $16,500. The Versa’s more powerful competition includes the similarly priced Ford Fiesta, the Honda Fit at around $17,000, and the Chevy Sonic, which starts close to $19,000.</p>, <p>Last year, for the fifth consecutive year, we named the Nissan Versa Note to the KBB.com <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-reviews-and-news/top-10/best-back-to-school-cars-2017/2100004482/">10 Best Back-to-School Cars</a> list because it is surprisingly roomy and impressively versatile with appealing options and a low starting price. It also gets impressive fuel mileage with a 39-mpg EPA rating on the highway.</p>, <p>If you’re after a sporty drive that’s as entertaining and engaging as it is thrifty and practical, you may not like the new Nissan Versa Note. With only 109 horsepower, the Versa Note isn’t much of a thrill-maker and its handling is adequate at best. The Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta and Chevy Sonic are much more fun to drive.</p>, <p>For 2018, the SL trim level is discontinued and the S Plus trim level becomes the S trim. The top SR trim level adds standard Intelligent Key with Push Button Ignition, Nissan Vehicle Immobilizer System and Easy Fill Tire Alert. The mid-grade Versa Note SV adds the same new features as part of the SV Special Edition Package.</p>, <p>An easy car to drive, the 2018 Nissan Versa Note is comfortable, agile and its tight exterior dimensions make it easy to park. Visibility is excellent, and the Nissan’s steering is light but offers little feel. On the road, the Versa’s 109-horsepower 4-cylinder engine could be a bit smoother than it is at high rpm, but it delivers adequate acceleration without using much fuel, and the CVT transmission, which helps fuel efficiency, works well enough in most situations. The Versa’s ride is compliant, even over rough roads. But when compared to cars like the Honda Fit and Ford Fiesta, the Versa Note comes up short. Where those cars are fun, such as in corners, the Nissan is less engaging to drive and it leans hard in the turns and gives up grip easily. The Versa Note’s performance is sufficient for most drivers looking for an inexpensive and reliable runabout; it’s just not a very sporty drive.</p>, <p>LARGE CARGO CAPACITY<br/> This is small car at just 163 inches long, but the new Nissan Versa Note offers an impressive 18.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its rear seats. That’s quite a bit more than many of the Nissan’s competition including the Chevy Spark, Ford Fiesta and the Honda Fit.<br/> <br/> EASY FILL TIRE ALERT<br/> This clever system is like a built-in tire gauge. First it alerts you to an underinflated tire. Once you begin to fill the tire, the Versa’s flashers come on to confirm the process has started. Then the horn chirps to let you know the tire has reached the correct air pressure.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Versa Note hatchback shares much of its interior with the Nissan Versa sedan. Well assembled, ergonomically agreeable and comfortable, the Versa Note’s interior is also one of the most spacious in its class. Rear passengers get 37 inches of legroom, three inches more than in the Chevy Sonic. Headroom is also generous. Its cargo area is big too, with its 18.8 cubic feet and that expands when you fold the rear seatbacks. Although the overall design isn’t very fancy and the materials and accommodations are pretty basic, the infotainment system is easy to use and the tilt/telescope steering wheel and height-adjustable seat make it easy to get comfortable.</p>, <p>Inside, the new Nissan Versa Note is virtually identical to the Versa sedan, but not on the outside. In fact, the exterior design of the two models could not be more different. Where the Versa sedan is staid and slab-sided, Nissan’s designers had a little fun with the Versa Note hatchback giving it artfully sculpted doors, short overhangs and a sizable rear spoiler. We especially like the hatchback’s beak, which incorporates the "V-Motion" grille treatment also seen on the Nissan Altima, Sentra and GT-R. From a practical standpoint, the tall profile means it's easy to get in and out, and the wide rear doors make it easy to install a child seat.</p>, <p>The base 2018 Versa Note S Plus is a little thinner on standard equipment than we might expect, even at its low base price. There's air conditioning, plus power mirrors, a 4-speaker AM/FM/CD/Aux audio system, tilt wheel, trip computer, Bluetooth, front disc/rear drum brakes, and 15-inch steel wheels with covers. The CVT is standard, and the 1.6-liter 4-cylinder is the only engine available. However, missing from the standard-equipment list are power windows, power door locks, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver's seat, or even a remote trunk release, though all are available on the higher-priced SV trim.</p>, <p>Like most cars these days, options come with successively higher trim levels, rather than stand-alone packages. The next-step SV adds power windows and door locks, a USB input for the audio system, keyless entry, cruise control and a rearview camera. The top SR offers aluminum-alloy wheels and a sportier exterior appearance that includes fog lights, a push-button ignition, a touch-screen audio system with navigation, and the around-view monitor system. Stand-alone options include premium paint colors, and an SV Special Edition Package that adds aluminum wheels and fog lights to that model.</p>, <p>The only engine available for the new 2018 Nissan Vera Note is a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 109 horsepower. That's not a lot by today’s standards, and it's connected to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that's tuned for fuel economy, not performance. The upshot is that if you're looking for a budget race car, you'll be disappointed. However, if you're looking for a powerful-enough commuter, the Versa Note's 39-mpg highway rating will definitely keep you interested.<br>
<br>
 1.6-liter inline-4<br>

 107 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 31/39 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Nissan Versa Note S anchors the lineup with a base Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $16,500 including the $885 destination charge. The mid-range and much better-equipped SV, which we recommend over the S model, is about $17,000, while the top Versa Note SR is about $2,000 more. Those prices are in line with competitors like the Kia Rio, Honda Fit and Ford Fiesta...and that's a problem, as all three offer more features, more power and a better driving experience, at roughly the same price.

---------http://www.kbb.com/porsche/718-boxster/2018
[<p>Sexy and swift, the 2018 Porsche 718 Boxster is a turbocharged 2-seater with exquisite design and dynamic performance. At a starting price of under $59,000 it’s also Porsche’s least expensive convertible. Two models are available, the 300-horsepower Boxster and the 350-horsepower Boxster S. Both are rear-wheel drive with a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine mounted in the middle of its chassis for ultimate balance and handling. Its mid-engine layout also allows for two trunks, one in the front and one in the back, giving the Boxster a surprising amount of cargo space. Its rivals include the similar Porsche 718 Cayman, which is essentially a coupe version of the Boxster, as well as the BMW Z4, Audi TT, Mercedes-Benz SLC, Jaguar F-Type and the more powerful Chevy Corvette.</p>, <p>Don’t be seduced by the larger engines and higher horsepower offered in some of the new Boxster’s rivals. The Porsche is a serious performance machine. Even the base model will accelerate to 60 mph in less than 5.0 seconds, and its athleticism is unmatched in the class. The Boxster is also polished and sophisticated, with a smooth ride, refined controls and a comfortable interior.</p>, <p>If the questionable security of a fabric roof isn’t for you, the BMW Z4 and Mercedes SLC have folding retractable hardtops, which offer superior protection from bad guys as well as weather. If all-wheel drive is on your wish list, check out the Audi TT, which is more than $10,000 less than the Porsche.</p>, <p>All-new just last year, the Porsche Boxster is essentially unchanged for 2018. Porsche has made the first year of scheduled maintenance complimentary, and it has fitted an improved carbon cabin filter to keep out particles, pollen, odors and dust from the air even more effectively. When the top is up, of course.</p>, <p>Your favorite twisting back road and a 2018 Porsche 718 Boxster. The top is down, the sun is shining and the sports car’s tachometer needle is dancing around its 7,500-rpm redline. Is this heaven? No, but it’s the closest thing money can buy. The new Boxster may be an "entry-level" Porsche, but there's nothing entry-level about its performance or refinement. It’s quick, agile and incredibly engaging to drive, but the Boxster also manages to be comfortable and even luxurious. Its 2-place interior is surprisingly roomy and its two trunks can handle more than you’d expect. A base model with the 300-horsepower 2.0-liter engine and manual transmission will push the performance envelope farther than most drivers will even venture, and the turbocharged engine delivers power urgently and without lag. Opt for Porsche's 7-speed automatic PDK, and you'll get a transmission that's so smooth you may not perceive gear shifts. Switching drive modes to Sport changes the Boxster's personality, making it more aggressive and quicker off the line.</p>, <p>TURBOCHARGED ENGINE<br>
 Last year Porsche switched the Boxster’s engine from a horizontally opposed, naturally aspirated 6-cylinder to a turbocharged horizontally opposed 4-cylinder, and predictably the Porsche faithful cried foul. But the change increased the 2-seater’s power and performance significantly. Output has jumped from 265 horsepower to 300 in the Boxster and from 315 to 350 in the Boxster S.<br>
<br>
 PDK AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION<br>
 Although both Boxster models come standard with a 7-speed manual transmission that is a joy to operate, its optional automatic transmission is one of the best. Called PDK, short for Porsche Doppelkupplung, which is German for “dual clutch,” the 7-speed automatic shifts gears quicker than any human can and is a great match for the Boxster’s turbocharged engines. The popular option costs $3,200.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You sit low in the new Porsche 718 Boxster just as you should in a 2-seat sports car. The driving position is perfect as you reach out and wrap your hands around its thick, leather-covered 3-spoke steering wheel. The instrumentation is simple and the large tachometer is front and center exactly where it should be. Nothing is out of place and everything looks and feels expensive. The key is to the left of the steering wheel, a Porsche tradition, and there’s an abundance of aluminum trim and soft leather. The sport seats are supportive, split by a narrow armrest and jet-like transmission tunnel and, above that, a 7-inch touch-screen audio and communication system.</p>, <p>Originally modeled after Porsche’s race-winning 550 Spyder from the 1950s, the car made famous by actor James Dean, the 2018 Boxster manages to be both retro and modern at the same time. Much like the more expensive Porsche 911, the Boxster’s sleek profile, voluptuous curves and deeply sculpted side sills offer raw supercar sex appeal, but there’s nothing vulgar or sophomoric about its design. No oversized wings. No unnecessary scoops. It’s a shape of function born of speed. The 718 Boxster is at its best with the fabric roof down, but it’s by no means ungainly with it up. The more powerful Boxster S stands out with larger 19-inch wheels, and a twin tailpipe that, like the base model, peeks out the center rear.</p>, <p>Aside from the prestige of owning a Porsche and the ability to dispense of most other cars at will, a 2018 718 Boxster comes with a power-operated fabric roof, HomeLink garage-door opener, front and rear parking sensors with rearview camera, and black, tan or gray interior with seats in partial leather. The standard infotainment system includes a 7-inch touch screen and 6-speaker/110-watt audio system with AM/FM/Satellite/HD Radio with CD/DVD drive, 11-gig internal storage and inputs for USB and SD cards. Bluetooth phone connectivity is standard. Boxster S models include a more powerful engine, larger wheels and a higher top speed (177 mph).</p>, <p>A 2018 Boxster can be highly personalized. From the color of the cabin’s leather to 14- or even 18-way-power seats, carbon-ceramic brakes or torque-vectoring technology, dozens of options are available both a la carte and as part of packages. The Sport Exhaust System provides an even more thrilling soundtrack, as do the Bose or Burmester audio systems. Navigation is available, as are climate-controlled seats and a heated steering wheel. Optional driving aids include adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring, while the Sport Chrono Package includes the Sport+ mode for sharper performance, central-mounted analog/digital stopwatch, and launch control on automatic-transmission models. For 2018 Porsche’s interior trim options now include leather seat centers in deviating colors and contrasting stitching on the seats, dash, sills and steering column.</p>, <p>Two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines are available for the 718 Boxster. Standard models use a 2.0-liter that, while smaller than the outgoing 6-cylinder, makes more power. The 718 Boxster S has a 2.5-liter turbo-4 that generates 350 horsepower. Because the engine is mounted in the middle and is a flat, or "boxer" design, this Porsche has excellent balance. Boxsters are rear-wheel drive, and power transmission to the wheels is immediate and delightful. In an effort to save fuel, Boxsters use an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle. If you find it too abrupt, as we did in city traffic, it is defeatable with the touch of a button.<br>

Of course, this is just the start. Add options, and you can easily lift these prices by thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars. At its starting price, the new Boxster is more expensive than the Mercedes-Benz SLC, BMW Z4 and Audi TT, and below a Jaguar F-Type. A 460-horsepower Chevrolet Corvette Stingray convertible starts around $61,000 and outmuscles the Boxster S.

[<p>As it’s the most affordable member of the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> family, one might think the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/porsche/718%20cayman/2018/">2018 Porsche 718 Cayman</a> might also be the least capable, but that would be a grave misjudgment in character. Newly redesigned last year, the 718 Cayman and 718 Cayman S deliver exceptional performance thanks to a powerful set of horizontally-opposed turbocharged engines, improved suspension, steering and brake calibrations as well the latest in driver-assist technology. With a price starting around $56,500, the 718 Cayman sits in a sweet spot formerly dominated by domestic cars like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/mustang/">Ford Mustang</a> GT350. Although the price quickly rises once options are added in, for those willing to go with a bare-bones Porsche, the 718 Cayman won’t disappoint.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a true driver’s car that shines brightest when the road begins to twist and turn, the 2018 Porsche 718 Cayman is it. Although not as fast as a Chevy Corvette or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/gt-r/">Nissan GT-R</a>, the 718 Cayman carries the Porsche pedigree, which for many is a bargain at this price.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a performance car with a growling V8 or blistering zero-to-60-mph runs, the 718 Cayman probably won’t excite you. Adding even the most basic upgrades quickly pushes the 718 Cayman’s price well beyond the price of a loaded Ford Mustang GT350 or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/camaro/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> SS.</p>, <p>After a complete remake this year, the 2018 Porsche 718 Cayman <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> offers only a few new cosmetic additions.</p>, <p>When it comes to cornering, the mid-engine 718 Cayman and 718 Cayman S are two of the world’s greatest performers. Quick and agile, the 718 Cayman demonstrates remarkable stability and balance, responding without hesitation to even the slightest driver input regardless if it’s during a feverish twisting uphill run, or a simple lane change on a freeway. As part of its rebirth, Porsche engineers improved on the 718 Cayman’s ridged core structure by widening the rear track, stiffening the damper settings and retuning the suspension to be more responsive during aggressive driving. The Cayman’s electromechanical steering is lifted directly from the 911 Turbo, while larger brakes all around deliver impressive stopping power. Those looking to push their 718 Cayman to the limit will want to opt for the multi-mode Porsche Active Suspension Management system that, on the Cayman S, offers a low-riding Sport-spec mode, as well as a revised Sport Chrono Package and Porsche Torque Vectoring.</p>, <p>PDK TRANSMISSION<br>
 Old die-hards may grumble at the idea of a Porsche with an automatic transmission, that is until they experience the marvelous PDK automatic in the 718 Cayman. This dual-clutch transmission offers faster shifts and better acceleration times than its 6-speed manual counterpart, and even gets better fuel economy.<br>
<br>
 PORSCHE TORQUE VECTORING (PTV)<br>
 Working in conjunction with the anti-lock braking system and mechanical rear differential, Porsche Torque Vectoring works to improve traction and agility both while in a turn and when exiting corners.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Well-finished and smartly presented, the passenger compartment of Porsche’s 2018 718 Cayman possesses a stylish and user-friendly environment that still places an emphasis on a cockpit-oriented design. The functional sport steering wheel inspired by the 918 Spyder and supportive leather-covered sport seats reinforce its driver-focused character, while the thoughtfully-laid-out dash boasts better-positioned air vents and a 7.0-inch central touch screen for the standard Porsche Communications Management system that features proximity sensors and gesture control.</p>, <p>Last year’s comprehensive but focused restyle has the 718 Cayman more closely resembling its soft-top 718 Boxster sibling. Only the forward luggage-compartment cover, roof and windshield carry over. Sharper edges, bolder lighting elements and more prominent side air intakes -- the better to feed and cool new turbocharged powerplants -- give the new Caymans a more intense visual presence set off by an aggressive rear-quarter treatment featuring an auto-extending spoiler and single or dual exhaust outlets. While the Cayman rolls on an 18-inch wheel/tire package, the Cayman S features a more-aggressive 19-inch upfit.</p>, <p>Both the 718 Cayman and Cayman S feature a solid roster of standards headed by comfortably supportive and leather-covered sport buckets with power-adjustable backs, a tilt/telescoping steering column, single-zone climate control, 6-speaker Sound Package Plus audio system with SiriusXM and HD Radio, Porsche Communications Management system and front/rear Park Assist. In addition to eight airbags, the new 718 Caymans come with a wide range of electronic stability aids, tire-sealing compound plus an air compressor in place of a spare tire, and complimentary roadside assistance for the duration of the limited warranty.</p>, <p>In typical Porsche style, the 718 Cayman and Cayman S offer a huge selection of optional upgrades and personalization touches. On the performance-related front, the cars can be upfitted with a multifunction GT steering wheel, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Torque Vectoring, the Sport Chrono Package, Adaptive Cruise Control with Porsche Active Safety, Lane Change Assist and Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes. Complementing a bounty of available interior and exterior cosmetic touches, both models offer LED headlights, dual-zone climate control, Navigation and Porsche Connect modules, a selection of seat upgrades with up to 18-way-power adjustability plus Bose and Burmester premium audio systems.</p>, <p>The 2018 718 Cayman and 718 Cayman S are powered by a pair of turbocharged flat-4-cylinder engines. Fitted with driver-selectable Stop/Start systems, both the base 2.0-liter and the S-spec 2.5-liter with a 911 Turbo-style variable-geometry force feeder boast more power -- 300 and 350 horses, respectively -- while generating greater torque at lower revs than the previous generation’s 2.7-liter and 3.4-liter engines. Each delivers even quicker acceleration regardless of transmission with just a modest fuel-economy decrease. All PDK-equipped Caymans also boast a Sport button that further sharpens throttle response and quickens shift times.<br>

Adding extras like the PDK automatic, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Torque Vectoring, the Sport Chrono Package and a Navigation Module will kick the bottom line up by almost $10,500, and loading a Cayman S with optional convenience/cosmetic elements can move it perilously close to 6-figure territory.

[<p>As the unique and premier sports car in the world, the 2018 Porsche 911 is an automotive and cultural icon. Just as it has since the mid-1960s, it remains the German automaker’s flagship, its showcase for style, technology and ultimate performance. Today the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> is available in three body styles and eight distinct models, some with all-wheel drive and powerful turbocharged 6-cylinder engines, which are mounted in the rear. While most sports cars only seat two, the Porsche 911 has a small back seat that is surprisingly useful, as well as a sizable front trunk or “frunk.” Prices start around $92,000 for a 911 Carrera <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">Coupe</a> with 370 horsepower and top out at almost $295,000 for the 700-horsepower 911 GT2 RS. The 911 competes with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/f-type/">Jaguar F-Type</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/aston%20martin/vantage/">Aston Martin Vantage</a>, Mercedes-AMG GT, as well as supercars from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ferrari/">Ferrari</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lamborghini/">Lamborghini</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mclaren/">McLaren</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an exotic sports car that makes a statement and always says the right thing, you’ll like the 2018 Porsche 911. With a unique blend of speed, technology, refinement, timeless style, exceptional build quality and daily practicality, many feel the Porsche 911 is the best all-around sports car in the world.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for the absolute most speed for the money, the Porsche 911 doesn’t deliver. Chevy’s Corvette, which has been the 911’s rival for over 50 years, delivers similar performance as the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/porsche/">Porsche</a> at a radical discount. The new Corvette ZR1 even packs 755 horsepower, which dwarfs the 911’s max output.</p>, <p>Porsche significantly updated the 911 for the 2017 model year, so little changed for 2018 in terms of equipment and options other than a new (optional) Powerkit that bumps Carrera S and 4S models from 420 horsepower to 450 horsepower — matching the power output of the GTS. All 2018 Porsche 911 models now come with free scheduled maintenance for the first year, which should cover the first oil change. In other news, the automaker expanded the 911 range with three new models: The new 911 Carrera T targets enthusiasts with a lightened chassis and several performance upgrades. The GT3 Touring is a wingless, and manual-transmission-only, version of the track-ready GT3. Lastly, the 911 GT2 RS debuts as a 700-horsepower flagship.</p>, <p>The 2018 Porsche 911 is fast enough to get you arrested anywhere in the world, but comfortable enough to be driven every single day. Last year Porsche replaced its naturally aspirated engines with twin-turbo versions that deliver even greater thrust and improved fuel efficiency. Sure the purist <i>porschefisti </i>protested, but the benefits are undeniable and the engines sound as sexy as they should. A 7-speed manual transmission is available in most models, but the 7-speed PDK twin-clutch automatic is equally enjoyable, thanks to its lightning-quick shifts and easy drivability. The standard Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) system uses active dampers to both smooth out the ride and tackle corners, without compromising its famous precision. Optional rear-wheel steering helps to both increase maneuverability in parking lots while improving stability at high speeds. And the Sport Chrono package includes a Drive Mode Selector on the steering wheel to select different performance settings.<br>
<br>
The new-for-2018 911 Carrera T boasts thin glass, reduced acoustic insulation, and minimalist lightweight racing pull straps (instead of traditional door handles) to save weight. The diet sheds about 40 pounds, but dynamically it drives nearly identical to the standard Carrera. Some may note a more vocal engine soundtrack, which is credited to standard Sport Exhaust. Expert drivers will be able to wring more performance out of the Carrera T, thanks to more aggressive transmission gearing (with the manual gearbox) and a limited-slip differential.<br>
<br>
The new-for-2018 GT3 Touring is a street-legal racecar with a high-revving 500-horsepower non-turbocharged engine -- the only naturally aspirated engine in Porsche’s model range. Mated to a standard 6-speed manual gearbox (standard Carrera models have a 7-speed manual, but Porsche drops the overdrive ratio on the GT3), the powerplant is an absolute turbine-like jewel. With rear-wheel drive, sport-tuned suspension, aggressive tires, and oversized brakes, the GT3 Touring delivers impressive levels of performance without sacrificing too much in terms of ride quality. Unlike the standard GT3, which boasts a massive rear wing that blocks much of the view to the rear, the Touring model accomplishes similar aerodynamic tricks with discreet appendage tweaks and an active rear spoiler that drops out of sight when not needed. The GT3 Touring is a high-performance sports car for those who like to travel in stealth mode.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the new 911 GT2 RS is one of the quickest street vehicles the automaker has ever built -- it laps the famed Nürburgring racetrack quicker than Porsche’s 918 supercar. With 700 horsepower, it accelerates from 0-60 mph in just 2.7 seconds -- validating its nearly $300,000 asking price. Limited production numbers and a lofty window sticker make the GT2 RS one very rare sports car.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>FRONT AXLE LIFT SYSTEM<br>
Although the Porsche 911 is less prone to scraping over driveways and speed bumps than other cars in this class, it’s still a low-slung sports car. This optional hydraulic system, which costs $2,590, raises the front axle 1.5 inches at the push of a button to increase ground clearance at speeds up to 37 mph.<br>
<br>
PORSCHE CERAMIC COMPOSITE BRAKES<br>
The power of Porsche brakes is legendary, but this optional system is the ultimate and it’s one of the 911’s most expensive options at $8,520. It’s worth it. Porsche replaces the 911’s cast-iron brake rotors with larger cross-drilled and vented carbon-fiber-reinforced units, which are almost impossible to overheat, even on the racetrack.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>In most sports cars you feel like you’re sitting on the floor, looking up at the world. Not in the 911. In the Porsche you sit upright, in a very natural driving position, with excellent visibility in all directions. It’s one of the reasons the Porsche 911 can be driven every day as well as comfortably cross-country. Build quality is exceptional. Some find the Porsche’s control layout a bit button-heavy, but you soon realize the ergonomics is simple and the controls are exactly where they should be, although Porsche still places the 911’s ignition to the left of the steering wheel, which takes some getting used to.</p>, <p>Some people think the Porsche 911 has looked the same since 1965. Some people think this is a good thing. Some people think the evolution of the 911’s shape has created the most recognizable sports car in the world. As other supercars have become vulgar, often pornographic and at times caricatures of themselves, the new Porsche 911 remains simply aspirational. It’s a sexy machine with wide hips and a sinister stance, but retains an unmistakable understated elegance lost on the Porsche’s more radically styled competitors. It turns heads, but never draws a sneer. And the valet always keeps it up front.</p>, <p>Along with the new turbocharged engines, every 2018 911 comes with Porsche Active Stability Management suspension and a year of scheduled maintenance. The 911 Carrera and Targa 4 and Turbo models offer all-wheel drive (AWD) as standard fare. There are also eight airbags, a wide array of electronic stability aids, and high-performance brakes comprising 4-piston calipers and 13-inch ventilated rotors. Other standard features on the new Porsche 911 include 4-way-power front seats with manual fore/aft adjustment, partial leather upholstery with a faux-suede headliner, xenon headlights for high and low beams, dual-zone climate control, new touch-screen LCD infotainment (with Apple CarPlay), and a 9-speaker audio system with USB input and Bluetooth phone connectivity.</p>, <p>It's not possible to get into every option available for the 2018 Porsche 911. There’s a rear-wheel steering system that enhances low-speed maneuverability and high-speed stability, and a front-axle lift system that lifts the nose of the car 1.5 inches to clear low-speed obstacles like steep driveways. Other optional features include multi-adjustable ventilated front seats, 12-speaker Burmester audiophile system, ceramic-composite brakes, Sport Chrono package that includes launch-control programming (PDK transmission only) and overboost function, and Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC), which essentially eliminates body roll through a multitude of sensors and hydraulic motors while also providing a more compliant ride in normal driving conditions.</p>, <p>The 911's classic flat-6 "boxer" engine comes in three sizes, but in different power outputs. The 911 S models get more power, while 911 4 models get all-wheel drive, unless it's already standard as it is on the 911 Turbos. It all breaks down like this: 370-horsepower 3.0-liter for Carrera, Carrera T, Carrera 4, Carrera Cabriolet, Carrera 4 Cabriolet, Targa 4; 420-horsepower 3.0-liter for Carrera S, Carrera 4S, Carrera S Cabriolet, Carrera 4S Cabriolet, Targa 4S; 540-horsepower 3.8-liter for 911 Turbo, 911 Turbo Cabriolet; 580-horsepower 3.8-liter for 911 Turbo S, 911 Turbo S Cabriolet; 500-horsepower 4.0-liter for GT3, GT3 Touring; and 700-horsepower 3.8-liter for GT2 RS. The Turbos are all all-wheel drive (AWD), while the GT3 and GT2 RS are rear-wheel drive (RWD) only. Premium fuel is required for all models.<br>

[<p>In the elite world of high-performance luxury SUVs, it’s hard to beat what the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayenne/">Porsche Cayenne</a> is offering. After 15 years in production, the Cayenne just seems to improve with age, and even with an all-new 2019 Cayenne waiting in the wings, the 2018 model is still every bit the equal of rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover%20sport/">Land Rover Range Rover Sport</a>. Porsche being Porsche, the Cayenne is offered in a number of variations, ranging from the eco-friendly Cayenne S E-Hybrid plug-in to the 570-horsepower Turbo S, the latter a decidedly un-eco-friendly choice. Of course, Porsche does luxury as well as it does performance, so buyers can expect nearly unlimited choices when it comes to interior configuration, color and content.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a 5-passenger SUV that thinks it’s a 2-passenger sports car, the 2018 Porsche Cayenne has your name written all over it. From its varied engine offerings to its impressive luxury options, the Cayenne is designed to delight anyone lucky enough to drive one, and impress all of those watching.</p>, <p>Not everyone can afford a 6-figure SUV. For those a little less well off, a more affordable performance-luxury SUV such as the 7-passenger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx60/">Infiniti QX60</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> might be more prudent. The cost of maintenance for the Cayenne can also be eye-popping.</p>, <p>With an all-new Cayenne waiting to debut this fall, the 2018 Porsche Cayenne carries over largely unchanged. </p>, <p>The word "slow" has never been used to describe a Porsche Cayenne. Neither have the words “uncomfortable” or “imprecise” or “unrefined.” Cayennes are simply impressive from behind the wheel. Each is a blast to drive. In fact, even the Cayenne S E-Hybrid is a bona-fide hoot, zipping to 60 mph in only 5.4 seconds, yet returning an estimated 47 MPGe in hybrid electric mode. The Porsche Cayenne GTS, with its turbocharged V6, rockets from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds. The 570-horsepower Turbo S hits 60 mph in about 3.5 seconds. That’s crazy quick. However, there's much more to the Cayenne than outright speed. Cornering precision is beyond what you should rightfully expect from any SUV, and the 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission is tuned to perfection. And it’s all delivered with the refinement of a world-class luxury car.</p>, <p>PORSCHE TORQUE VECTORING PLUS<br>
By sending additional power to the outside wheel while cornering, Porsche’s Torque Vectoring Plus helps improve the Cayenne’s agility as well as its grip on the pavement. Combined with an advanced suspension setup, Torque Vectoring Plus is a big reason why this SUV doesn’t drive like an SUV.<br>
<br>
CERAMIC COMPOSITE BRAKES<br>
When a vehicle can go as fast as a Porsche Cayenne, it’s nice to know the stopping power of ceramic brakes is an option. Ceramic brakes provide better stopping power, less fade and longer rotor life. In the case of the Cayenne, they also come with pretty bright yellow calipers and a $9,000 price tag.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As one would expect from a luxury SUV bearing the Porsche emblem, the Cayenne’s interior is second to none. The artistry and aesthetics flow into a functional environment as only Porsche can manage, combining finely stitched leathers, sumptuous wood inlays and metal accents to create a stunning interior every bit the equal of a 911 or Panamera. Rear passengers enjoy a sliding and reclining rear seat, and can view movies on a pair of LCD screens attached to the backs of the front-seat head restraints. Regrettably, the dash layout is littered with tiny buttons and numerous switches that can be confusing to operate, especially when it comes to using the navigation setup. </p>, <p>Although the 1st-generation Cayenne was popular, it was never going to win any beauty contests. However, this second generation, introduced in 2011, has set the standard for athletic-looking SUVs with its sports-car stance and proportions. From any angle the Cayenne’s muscular curves scream its speed-and-performance mission. A quick field guide to identifying Cayenne models focuses on the brakes: Silver denotes the Cayenne S and Cayenne S E-Hybrid, and red the high-performance Turbo and GTS models. Turbo S models get the yellow ceramic-brake option as standard. Turbo models also get four exhaust pipes.</p>, <p>The 2018 Porsche Cayenne comes in six trims: base, S, S E-Hybrid, GTS, Turbo and Turbo S. Regardless of choice, all Cayenne models feature standard all-wheel drive, a height-adjustable power liftgate, 10-speaker audio with 7-inch touch screen, water-repellent front side glass, rain-sensing wipers and a full complement of power accessories. A fuel-saving stop/start function is also standard, as are six airbags, a full suite of electronic stability aids, and roadside assistance while under warranty.</p>, <p>The Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control lets Porsche Cayenne owners take their SUV's handling to the next level. It adjusts the anti-roll bars in real time to add stiffness to the suspension in response to conditions and whatever drive mode you have selected. A 1,000-watt, 16-speaker Burmester audio system is available for audiophiles, and in-vehicle connectivity includes an Aha Radio smartphone application, which offers a variety of customizable news, music and social networking services. Of course, there's also that $9,000 brake system.</p>, <p>All 2018 Porsche Cayenne models come standard with an 8-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. However, there are seven distinct engines to choose from. The standard Cayenne comes with a strong 3.6-liter V6 engine offering 300 horsepower; however, it's worth the extra money for the turbocharged versions, either the 420-horsepower Cayenne S or the 440-horsepower Cayenne GTS. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid employs a 333-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6 coupled to a synchronous electric motor, which brings the total horsepower figure to 416. At the top of the line are the Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S delivering a whopping 520 and 570 horsepower, respectively, from a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8.<br>

Cayenne S E-Hybrid models are priced just under $81,000. The three high-performance models up the price considerably, with the 440-horsepower Cayenne GTS starting at about $99,600, the 520-horsepower Cayenne Turbo a bit over $119,000, and the mack daddy Cayenne Turbo S at just about $163,000. Those prices are higher than BMW and Mercedes-Benz rivals, but slightly less than the Land Rover Range Rover Sport, at least at the low end. Check KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price below to see what others in your area are currently paying, and at resale time, the Cayenne should do well, but not quite as well as the BMW X5 and the 7-Passenger Audi Q7.</p>]

[<p>A <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUV</a> with big horsepower and athletic handling, the 2018 Porsche Macan offers families an impressive mix of utility and invigorating performance. All-wheel drive is standard while the Macan’s wide range of available engines offers as much as 440 horsepower.

The 2018 Macan is also now fitted with an improved carbon filter to keep more particles, pollen, odors and dust from inside its interior.</p>, <p>From behind its thick leather-wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel the 2018 Porsche Macan is a wonderful blend of SUV and sports car. It’s one of the sportiest <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> available, and it’s an engaging drive from the instant you fire up its turbocharged engine. Even the "slowest" model is fast. The 4-cylinder base model is able to rush to 60 mph in just over six seconds. The Macan S and GTS shave another second off that time, while the range-topping Macan Turbo goes 0-60 mph in as little as 4.2 seconds. Not all that long ago, that was 911 territory. Porsche’s all-wheel-drive system maximizes traction and allows the SUV to corner hard enough to strain your neck muscles. But the Macan isn’t all speed and thrills, it’s also comfortable and rides well. From the driver’s seat the Macan feels like it was carved from granite, but toss it into a corner and it somehow feels light on its feet. That’s a neat trick.</p>, <p>ACTIVE AERODYNAMICS<br>
 Porsche sweats the details, especially when it comes to performance. An example is the Macan’s active aerodynamics. Porsche has equipped the Macan’s front grille with a shutter door that closes on relaxed drives when cooling requirements are low to improve aerodynamics and fuel economy. When more power is demanded by the driver, the shutter opens to improve airflow to cool the engine.<br>
<br>
7-SPEED PDK AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION<br>
 Called PDK, short for Porsche Doppelkupplung, which is German for dual clutch, the 7-speed automatic transmission is a marvel of engineering. It’s smooth and effortless around town, it shifts gears quicker than any human can, and it’s a great match for the Macan’s turbocharged engines. It also has a manual mode so you can utilize the Macan’s paddle shifters.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Inside, the Macan surrounds you with high-quality materials, an abundance of aluminum trim and a dynamic layout of controls and buttons. The key is to the left of the steering wheel, a Porsche tradition. Don’t worry, you get used to it. The instrumentation is clear and simple, but the rev counter is in the center as it is in Porsche’s sports cars. Don’t worry, you get used to it. Seat comfort is excellent. The seats are firm and well bolstered for performance driving. The buttons on the console that run alongside the shifter look complicated but they’re not. Second-row legroom is stingy, however, as is cargo space. The Macan’s 17.7-cubic-foot cargo floor is small for the class, although it expands to 53 cubic feet by dropping the 40/20/40-split/folding 2nd-row seatbacks.</p>, <p>With its tapered nose, low roofline and fast backlight, the 2018 Macan bears a strong resemblance to the larger <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/porsche/cayenne/">Porsche Cayenne</a> as well as the brand’s Panamera sedan. It looks tough with a butchy bad-boy stance and a hunkered-down attitude. All trim levels boast bi-xenon headlights and fog lights, while the GTS and Turbo models have unique, more aggressive front fascias. GTS models also have a matte-black finish on the side blades and a more dynamic color scheme. They also sit 10 mm lower than Turbo models. The Macan Turbo, meanwhile, can be identified via its front spoiler lip and squared-off quad exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>The 2018 Macan base model costs thousands less than the Macan S but still comes nicely equipped. On hand are tri-zone climate control, lane-departure warning system, rearview camera with front and rear parking assist, power-folding side mirrors, power-operated liftgate, and 18-inch wheels. A fresh infotainment system is highlighted by a 7-inch multi-touch screen with AM/FM/HD/satellite radio with CD/DVD player, USB/aux inputs and Bluetooth connectivity. In addition to a more powerful V6 engine, Macan S models also have rain-sensing windshield wipers and tinted and thermally insulated glass. For 2018 Porsche has also added a year of complimentary scheduled maintenance.</p>, <p>More powerful still, Macan GTS models have 20-inch wheels, suspension setting and other performance upgrades, while the top-line Macan Turbo boasts navigation, Bose audio, Alcantara roof lining, adaptive seats and active suspension. Option packages range from a sweet Burmester audiophile system to a panoramic roof, and Porsche Connect Plus module with wireless Internet access, Google Earth integration and Apple CarPlay, plus a rear-entertainment system and heated/ventilated front seats. Customization options abound, as do performance upgrades that include Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus, $8,150 carbon-ceramic brakes and the recommendable Sport Chrono Package with Sport Plus mode, launch control and dash-mounted analog/digital stopwatch.</p>, <p>The base model is the first Macan to use a 4-cylinder, a turbocharged 2.0-liter that makes 252 horsepower, enough to zip this performance SUV from 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds (or 6.1 with the Sport Chrono package). At just over 3,900 pounds, this is also the lightest Macan. All others use a twin-turbo V6 engine -- a 3.0-liter in S and GTS models and a larger 3.6-liter in the Turbo models. All Macans use a 7-speed PDK automatic transmission and are all-wheel drive. For better fuel efficiency, they have an auto start/stop system that switches off the engine at traffic stops. Start-ups can be abrupt, and thankfully the system is defeatable. A V6 Macan can tow up to 4,409 pounds.<br>

And adding the Performance Package to that, with its 40 more horsepower, adds another $10,000 to the bottom line. At these prices, the Macan is among the priciest of the compact-luxury vehicles. The Audi Q5, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/glc/">Mercedes-Benz GLC</a> and BMW X3 start several thousand below a base Macan, as do the Jaguar F-Pace and the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio.

---------http://www.kbb.com/porsche/panamera/2018
[<p>Despite numerous naysayers, the 2018 Porsche Panamera continues to win over converts, while simultaneously pushing the competition to produce similar 4-door supercars. Porsche expands an already abundant lineup with the new Panamera Sport Turismo wagon featuring a longer roof and more attractive rear-end styling. Also new is the Turbo S E-Hybrid, a plug-in hybrid that brings a whole lot of mean to the hybrid’s green. With power ranging from 330 to 680 horsepower, the 2018 Panamera is easily the equal of cars like the BMW M6 Gran Coupe, Mercedes-Benz CLS and Audi RS 7, none of which yet offers a hybrid powertrain option. Couple this big sedan with decades of Porsche racing and performance innovations, and you get one very desirable 4-door.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a high-end performance sedan with a bit of an edge in both the styling and powertrain departments, one of the many Panamera models will likely pique your interest. The Panamera’s rear seat can comfortably fit two adults, while the Sport Turismo offers station-wagon-like accommodations.</p>, <p>Looks are important, so if the Panamera’s elongated 911 silhouette doesn’t float your boat, no amount of performance bragging rights is likely to make you fall in love. If you need room for five and a secure trunk, an Audi RS 7 or Mercedes-Benz AMG S63 would be our pick.</p>, <p>Porsche’s 2018 Panamera performance sedan gains two new models: the wagon-like Sport Turismo and the Turbo S E-Hybrid, a plug-in hybrid that pushes engine output to a staggering 680 horsepower.</p>, <p>Compared to the first-generation Panamera, the 2018 car is superior in every area that matters. The steering is remarkably precise, made even better when one tacks on options such as the Sport package that brings launch control and rear-wheel steering. Despite its length, the Panamera takes corners like a champ, aided again by a host of electronic upgrades including Porsche’s Torque Vectoring technology and an adaptive air suspension. Power can be routed to either the rear wheels or all four, the former the choice of most purists, the latter a better option for novice drivers and those regularly dealing with snow. Gear changes are left to Porsche’s excellent PDK twin-clutch 8-speed automatic, while horsepower ranges anywhere from 330 ponies on the base Panamera to a mind-numbing 680 horsepower generated by the Turbo S E-Hybrid’s 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 and electric motor setup.</p>, <p>BURMESTER AUDIO<br>
 Easily one of the world’s finest automotive audio systems, the Burmester 3D High End Surround Sound system was developed exclusively for use in Porsche automobiles. A touch-screen controller handles commands governing output to the system’s 21 speakers. You can even direct sound to the seat of your choice.<br>
<br>
 4D CHASSIS CONTROL<br>
 Porsche’s 4D Chassis Control monitors the car’s driving dynamics in all three spatial dimensions, allowing the Panamera’s computer brain to synchronize the car’s suspension and chassis systems for the optimal mix of handling and ride comfort.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Porsche Panamera features a handsome interior filled with pleasing shapes and rich accents. The seats are amazingly comfortable, with multiple adjustments to help almost any driver find a comfortable position. The Sport Turismo adds more headroom in back where two 6-foot occupants can still find ample legroom. High-tech features abound, but the most noticeable is a massive navigation screen so clear it puts some HD TVs to shame. A large center tachometer is flanked by a configurable screen that can be optioned to include all manner of functions, from displaying road maps to an infrared image of the road ahead.</p>, <p>Porsche’s Panamera sports sedan for 2018 shares not a single panel with the original car, yet it is immediately recognizable. The hood and front fascia are squared up a bit, with stronger character lines to make the Panamera a bit more menacing. The familiar curved hatchback rear end is still in place, but the rear fenders are wider, as is the car itself. The 2018 Panamera is only about an inch longer than the first-gen car, but it looks bigger and more substantial. Familiar features like the LED headlights are here, as are new toys such as the 4-position adaptive rear spoiler.</p>, <p>For the price, one would expect the Porsche Panamera 4S to come well equipped, and one would be correct. There’s a panoramic glass moonroof plus front and rear parking sensors, 19-inch wheels, 8-way power-adjustable and heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, navigation and a 10-speaker premium audio system. The Turbo model adds LED headlights, 20-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, 14-speaker Bose audio, full leather interior, power-adjustable steering column, Alcantara roof lining, 14-way-power front seats and heated rear seats. Performance equipment includes Porsche Stability Management System (PSM) and the integrated 4D Chassis Control unit.</p>, <p>The list of possible option combinations is nearly limitless. Among the more notable upgrades are a 21-speaker Burmester audio system, rear-seat center-console touch screen, adaptive cruise control, adaptive LED headlights, Sport Package (air suspension, Sport Chrono package, rear-axle steering and sport exhaust), ceramic-composite brakes, a heated steering wheel, 18-way-adaptive sport seats, ventilated front and rear seats, infrared night-vision camera, Lane Change Assist, Lane Keep Assist, massaging seats and 4-zone automatic climate control with separate air-temperature, blower-intensity and air-distribution adjustments for each seat. Porsche will also customize the Panamera’s interior to any color you like.</p>, <p>For 2018, there are 15 Panamera trims and five engine choices. The 2018 Panamera (4, 4 Sport Turismo and 4 Executive) is powered by a 3.0-liter turbo V6 good for 330 horsepower. The 4S models are powered by a 440-horsepower twin-turbocharged direct-injection 2.9-liter V6, while the Panamera Turbo receives a 550-horsepower twin-turbocharged direct-injection 4.0-liter V8 with cylinder deactivation. The E-Hybrid uses the same 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 paired with an electric motor for a combined output of 462 horsepower, while the Turbo S E-Hybrid pairs the 4.0-liter V8 with an electric motor producing 680 horsepower. All five engines send power to either the rear wheels (RWD) or all four (AWD) via a PDK 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.<br>

The Panamera 4 starts around $90,650 while the new 4 Sport Turismo jumps to $97,250. The 4S starts closer to $104,050, while the Turbo pushes the price closer to $151,000. E-Hybrid pricing starts around $100,650 with the S E-Hybrid at nearly $185,500. Adding numerous option packages and add-ons can push the price well past the $200,000 mark. An Audi S7 or a BMW 6 Series Gran Sport starts a few thousand less than the Panamera, while the Turbo’s pricing is well above the starting price for the Audi RS 7, BMW M6 Gran Sport and Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG 4Matic. On the flip side, an Aston Martin Rapide S starts around $200,000 and goes up from there.

---------http://www.kbb.com/ram/1500-crew-cab/2018
[<p>Available in a wide variety of configurations, including five body styles, the 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ram/">Ram</a> 1500 is an extremely capable and comfortable full-size pickup that’s ready to work, tow or play. Buyers can choose from three engines, including a Hemi V8 and a 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6 that delivers 29 mpg on the highway. Buyers can also choose between 2- and 4-wheel drive. For 2018 the Ram 1500 is offered in 11 trim levels, many with cool names like Big Horn, Rebel, Sport and Night, with prices starting around $28,000 for the standard-cab Tradesman model. The standard 3.6-liter gas V6’s 305 horsepower and the Ram’s unique coil-spring multi-link rear suspension give it the smoothest ride in the full-size pickup class, which also includes the Chevy Silverado, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a> Sierra, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> Titan, Toyota Tundra and the best-selling <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> F-150.</p>, <p>If you want a capable, comfortable and luxurious full-size pickup that looks tough, rides smooth and packs plenty of power, you’ll like the new 2018 Ram 1500. Until the Ford F-150 diesel comes out this fall, the Ram is the only half-ton truck to offer diesel power, which delivers class-leading fuel economy, and its Hemi V8 is one of the most powerful engines available in the segment.</p>, <p>If you’re shopping for the ultimate tow rig, the 2018 Ram 1500 will disappoint. Both the Ford F-150 and Chevy Silverado have higher towing capacities. The Ford also offers more tow technology, like an advanced trailer-back-up assistance system, and the Chevy’s 6.2-liter V8 is larger and more powerful than the Ram’s optional Hemi.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Ram 1500 has been improved with a switch in the truck bed to activate LED bed lights. A rearview camera is now standard on all models and the 8.4-inch touch screen has been improved with greater resolution, pinch-to-zoom, 4G LTE onboard Wi-Fi, HD Radio, Android Auto and Apple Car Play.</p>, <p>With its unique coil-spring and multi-link rear suspension, the 2018 Ram 1500 rides as comfortably as a car. It isn’t as sporty as the Ford F-150, but the Ram’s ride is smooth and relaxed with little jiggle and no trucky bounce. The Ram’s steering and road manners are among best-in-class, too. The base 3.6-liter gas V6 makes 305 horsepower and gives the truck plenty of acceleration and passing power. The 8-speed automatic transmission is also among the best in the class with smooth shifts and manual control. The Ram’s optional 5.7-liter Hemi V8, also used in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a> muscle car, packs 395 horsepower and an intoxicating V8 rumble, but if fuel economy is your highest priority you’ll like the Ram’s 3.0-liter EcoDiesel. It delivers 29 mpg on the highway, which is impressive, and has a total fuel range of over 700 miles. The optional air-spring suspension can level a loaded bed, make cabin entry easier and increase ground clearance for off-roading.</p>, <p>RAMBOX CARGO-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<br>
 Incorporated in the Ram’s bedsides, the optional RamBox bins are large, lockable and lighted. They’re durable for tools and designed to drain water so you can throw in wet clothes and gear, or better yet, toss in some ice and make the world’s coolest built-in beer cooler. Perfect for the big game.<br>
<br>
 PARK SENSE FRONT-PARK-ASSIST SYSTEM<br>
 Most people would rather wrestle A.J. Styles than park a full-size pickup in a crowded mall parking lot. This optional system fixes that problem with six parking sensors mounted in the Ram’s front bumper. Get too close to another car or object and it warns you with audible chimes and graphics.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Roomy and comfortable, the interior of the 2018 Ram 1500 features large seats and simple, easy-to-use controls. Ram uses a unique rotary shifter for the truck’s automatic transmission. It looks a bit weird at first, but it works great and frees up space on the console for storage and cup holders. There are also large knobs for radio volume and tuning. The Ram’s large 8.4-inch touch screen makes up most of the dashboard, and offers simple menus and clean graphics. It’s improved this year with better resolution, and the Ram's Uconnect infotainment system adds onboard Wi-Fi and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.</p>, <p>The new 2018 Ram 1500 is the best-looking full-size truck in this class. Bold and brash with big-rig style, the Ram is more curvaceous than the hard-edged Ford and Chevy. It looks imposing and has presence, but its proportions are sporty and its detailing is sophisticated. Check out the subtle rear spoiler built into its tailgate. That’s pretty cool. The Ram pickup line ranges from a basic regular cab to quad cab and crew cab with your choice of short or long beds. The brashest of the Rams is the Rebel, which includes blacked-out elements, beefy all-terrain tires and other macho bits. Higher-end Rams get big chrome grilles.</p>, <p>With 11 trims, the 2018 Ram full-size truck spans from basic work truck to loaded hauler that could be mistaken for a luxury truck. At its most basic in Tradesman form, the new Ram comes with a locking tailgate, automatic headlights, a tilt -- but not telescoping -- steering wheel, air conditioning, and a basic 6-speaker radio with USB and auxiliary inputs. Note that you'll have to crank your own window and manually adjust the mirrors. If you want more than a very basic work truck, we recommend climbing trims or opting for a quad-cab or crew-cab version, which includes more amenities. A rearview camera is also standard.</p>, <p>With numerous options and packages from which to choose, the 2018 full-size Ram 1500 truck can be fitted to suit practically any individual and a variety of budgets. One item we recommend is the Uconnect Access infotainment system with its 8.4-inch touch screen and user-friendly interface. Additional options include a heated steering wheel, 10-way-power driver’s seat, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 115V household power outlet, LED bed lighting and air suspension. Since the steering wheel does not offer a telescoping function, taller or shorter drivers should consider adding the power-adjustable pedals. And don’t forget to consider the EcoDiesel engine and the RamBox cargo system.</p>, <p>Three engine choices are offered for the 2018 Ram 1500. The base engine is a 3.6-liter Pentastar gasoline V6 with 305 horsepower and an EPA highway fuel-economy rating of up to 25 mpg. The well-known 5.7-liter Hemi V8 cranks out 395 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque, but the fuel economy is, not surprisingly, only average at best. The 3.0-liter turbocharged EcoDiesel V6 may be the best choice, with 240 horsepower, 420 lb-ft of torque and laudable fuel economy. This turbodiesel is unique to half-ton trucks. All engines are available with 2-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel drive (4WD). An 8-speed automatic transmission is standard with the gasoline and diesel V6 engines and optional with the Hemi V8, which otherwise uses a 6-speed automatic.<br>
<br>
 3.6-liter V6<br>
 305 horsepower @ 6,400 rpm<br>
 269 lb-ft of torque @ 6,175 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/25 mpg (2WD), 16/23 mpg (4WD)<br>
<br>
 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6<br>
 240 horsepower @ 3,600 rpm<br>
 420 lb-ft of torque @ 2,000 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (2WD), 19/27 mpg (4WD)<br>
<br>
 5.7-liter Hemi V8<br>
 395 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br>
 410 lb-ft of torque @ 3,950 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 15/22 mpg (2WD, 8-speed automatic), 13/18 mpg (4WD, 6-speed automatic), 15/21 mpg (4WD, 8-speed automatic)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As a basic 2-wheel-drive regular-cab Tradesman model, the 2018 Ram 1500 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $28,490 including a $1,395 destination fee. Prices go up depending on trim level and cab/bed configuration. Plan to spend about $35,000-$40,000 for a mid-trim truck, which includes the Express, Big Horn, Sport and Harvest trim levels. The popular Ram Rebel model costs about $46,500 with 2-wheel drive. All-in as a 4-wheel-drive Limited model, the Ram 1500 can surpass $60,000. At these prices the Ram is in line with its Ford, Chevy and GMC rivals, and beneath the starting price of a Toyota Tundra, which has more standard equipment and a standard V8. It also undercuts the all-new Nissan Titan. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new truck. The Ram 1500's resale value is expected to continue to trail that of the F-150 and the class-leading Toyota Tundra.</p>]

The Ford also offers more tow technology, like an advanced trailer-back-up assistance system, and the Chevy’s 6.2-liter V8 is larger and more powerful than the Ram’s optional Hemi.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Ram 1500 has been improved with a switch in the truck bed to activate LED bed lights. A rearview camera is now standard on all models and the 8.4-inch touch screen has been improved with greater resolution, pinch-to-zoom, 4G LTE onboard Wi-Fi, HD Radio, Android Auto and Apple Car Play.</p>, <p>With its unique coil-spring and multi-link rear suspension, the 2018 Ram 1500 rides as comfortably as a car. It isn’t as sporty as the Ford F-150, but the Ram’s ride is smooth and relaxed with little jiggle and no trucky bounce. The Ram’s steering and road manners are among best-in-class, too. The base 3.6-liter gas V6 makes 305 horsepower and gives the truck plenty of acceleration and passing power. The 8-speed automatic transmission is also among the best in the class with smooth shifts and manual control. The Ram’s optional 5.7-liter Hemi V8, also used in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/dodge/challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a> muscle car, packs 395 horsepower and an intoxicating V8 rumble, but if fuel economy is your highest priority you’ll like the Ram’s 3.0-liter EcoDiesel. It delivers 29 mpg on the highway, which is impressive, and has a total fuel range of over 700 miles. The optional air-spring suspension can level a loaded bed, make cabin entry easier and increase ground clearance for off-roading.</p>, <p>RAMBOX CARGO-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<br>
 Incorporated in the Ram’s bedsides, the optional RamBox bins are large, lockable and lighted. They’re durable for tools and designed to drain water so you can throw in wet clothes and gear, or better yet, toss in some ice and make the world’s coolest built-in beer cooler. Perfect for the big game.<br>
<br>
 PARK SENSE FRONT-PARK-ASSIST SYSTEM<br>
 Most people would rather wrestle A.J. Styles than park a full-size pickup in a crowded mall parking lot. This optional system fixes that problem with six parking sensors mounted in the Ram’s front bumper. Get too close to another car or object and it warns you with audible chimes and graphics.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Roomy and comfortable, the interior of the 2018 Ram 1500 features large seats and simple, easy-to-use controls. Ram uses a unique rotary shifter for the truck’s automatic transmission. It looks a bit weird at first, but it works great and frees up space on the console for storage and cup holders. There are also large knobs for radio volume and tuning. The Ram’s large 8.4-inch touch screen makes up most of the dashboard, and offers simple menus and clean graphics. It’s improved this year with better resolution, and the Ram's Uconnect infotainment system adds onboard Wi-Fi and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.</p>, <p>The new 2018 Ram 1500 is the best-looking full-size truck in this class. Bold and brash with big-rig style, the Ram is more curvaceous than the hard-edged Ford and Chevy. It looks imposing and has presence, but its proportions are sporty and its detailing is sophisticated. Check out the subtle rear spoiler built into its tailgate. That’s pretty cool. The Ram pickup line ranges from a basic regular cab to quad cab and crew cab with your choice of short or long beds. The brashest of the Rams is the Rebel, which includes blacked-out elements, beefy all-terrain tires and other macho bits. Higher-end Rams get big chrome grilles.</p>, <p>With 11 trims, the 2018 Ram full-size truck spans from basic work truck to loaded hauler that could be mistaken for a luxury truck. At its most basic in Tradesman form, the new Ram comes with a locking tailgate, automatic headlights, a tilt -- but not telescoping -- steering wheel, air conditioning, and a basic 6-speaker radio with USB and auxiliary inputs. Note that you'll have to crank your own window and manually adjust the mirrors. If you want more than a very basic work truck, we recommend climbing trims or opting for a quad-cab or crew-cab version, which includes more amenities. A rearview camera is also standard.</p>, <p>With numerous options and packages from which to choose, the 2018 full-size Ram 1500 truck can be fitted to suit practically any individual and a variety of budgets. One item we recommend is the Uconnect Access infotainment system with its 8.4-inch touch screen and user-friendly interface. Additional options include a heated steering wheel, 10-way-power driver’s seat, rain-sensing windshield wipers, 115V household power outlet, LED bed lighting and air suspension. Since the steering wheel does not offer a telescoping function, taller or shorter drivers should consider adding the power-adjustable pedals. And don’t forget to consider the EcoDiesel engine and the RamBox cargo system.</p>, <p>Three engine choices are offered for the 2018 Ram 1500. The base engine is a 3.6-liter Pentastar gasoline V6 with 305 horsepower and an EPA highway fuel-economy rating of up to 25 mpg. The well-known 5.7-liter Hemi V8 cranks out 395 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque, but the fuel economy is, not surprisingly, only average at best. The 3.0-liter turbocharged EcoDiesel V6 may be the best choice, with 240 horsepower, 420 lb-ft of torque and laudable fuel economy. This turbodiesel is unique to half-ton trucks. All engines are available with 2-wheel drive (2WD) or 4-wheel drive (4WD). An 8-speed automatic transmission is standard with the gasoline and diesel V6 engines and optional with the Hemi V8, which otherwise uses a 6-speed automatic.<br>

Prices go up depending on trim level and cab/bed configuration. Plan to spend about $35,000-$40,000 for a mid-trim truck, which includes the Express, Big Horn, Sport and Harvest trim levels. The popular Ram Rebel model costs about $46,500 with 2-wheel drive. All-in as a 4-wheel-drive Limited model, the Ram 1500 can surpass $60,000. At these prices the Ram is in line with its Ford, Chevy and GMC rivals, and beneath the starting price of a Toyota Tundra, which has more standard equipment and a standard V8. It also undercuts the all-new Nissan Titan. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new truck. The Ram 1500's resale value is expected to continue to trail that of the F-150 and the class-leading Toyota Tundra.</p>]

[<p>Those with jobs requiring big power and big capability are well acquainted with the 2018 Ram 2500 and 3500 HD pickup truck. With its principal rivals being the Chevy Silverado HD and Ford Super Duty, the Ram HD’s qualifications land it mid-pack, providing more towing and payload ability than the Silverado, while not yet up to the top numbers posted by Ford’s biggest trucks. All three offer similar horsepower and torque ratings on their most powerful diesel engines, but the Ram is the only on that still offers the option of a manual transmission. Further separating the Ram HD from the competition is its multi-link rear suspension (2500) and powerful Hemi gas engine options.</p>, <p>Along with its impressive towing, payload and passenger capabilities, the 2018 Ram HD pickup line offers some of the most luxurious and comfortable cabins ever put in a truck. Of course, there are models for those who need their truck to take a beating, too.</p>, <p>If best-in-class resale and reliability ratings are a concern, you may have a hard time leaving the Ford or Chevy camp for Ram. If you’re seeking a diesel truck but don’t need the size or price of a heavy-duty pickup, a Ford F-150 or Nissan Titan XD makes a better option.</p>, <p>Changes to the 2018 Ram 2500 and 3500 HD pickups include the addition of a new luxury Limited Tungsten trim, updated 8.4-inch Uconnect infotainment system, standard rearview monitor, remote exterior switch for LED bed lights and a new Fleet Telematics Module for tracking efficiency.</p>, <p>When it comes to ability, Ram’s heavy-duty 2018 2500/3500 HD pickup trucks have more than enough muscle to back up their bold and rugged appearance. Models equipped with the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 can tow up to 13,900 pounds and when equipped with the larger 6.4-liter V8, a class-leading 16,320 pounds. Opt for the 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel in the 3500 and a 5th-wheel-equipped model can pull an astounding 31,210 pounds, a figure certified by using SAE J2807 testing criteria (if you’re a truck person, you’ll understand). The Ram 2500 HD’s unique 5-link, coil-spring rear suspension delivers an impressively smooth and controlled ride, while the various cabs, particularly on the Laramie and Limited trims, are simply some of the nicest, most comfortable and well-appointed in the industry. Ram 3500 HD models employ a Hotchkis leaf-spring rear suspension that can be augmented with supplemental airbags.</p>, <p>UCONNECT ACCESS<br>
 The Uconnect system in the Ram 2500/3500 HD gets even better this year, with improved resolution from the 8.4-inch touch screen and the addition of 4G LTE, pinch-to-zoom and available Sirius Guardian. The Uconnect system also offers an excellent voice-recognition system complementing a user-friendly interface.<br>
<br>
 IMPRESSIVE POWER AND TOWING CAPABILITY<br>
 If you have a lofty towing or payload number in mind, there’s a Ram HD truck and engine combo to match. Both Hemi-powered gasoline engines put up impressive stats, but only the diesel-powered Ram HD can handle a 15-ton trailer.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You might expect something with "Heavy Duty" in the name to be utilitarian, but the 2018 Ram HD pickups are surprisingly polished. If that's not enough, the higher-end Laramie and Limited models are downright luxurious, with leather-lined and climate-controlled seats, a heated steering wheel and high-quality interior materials. The long and deep center console is massive enough to swallow a larger laptop or multiple tablets; it can even hold a set of hanging files. Additional storage behind the reclining rear seats is one of the perks to be had with the Mega Cab. Crew Cab models feature convenient under-floor storage compartments.</p>, <p>When it comes to making a statement, it doesn’t get any louder than the exterior found on the 2018 Ram 2500/3500 HD trucks. Sharing family styling cues with the half-ton Ram 1500, the HD trucks appear more massive and muscular, with exaggerated grilles and a dual-rear-wheel-axle option. Cab choices include the 4-door Mega Cab offering copious rear-seat room. Depending on cab style, buyers can opt for a 6-foot 4-inch or 8-foot bed. The Ram HD Crew Cab with an 8-foot bed stretches nearly 22 feet in length, something to consider if your parking options are limited.</p>, <p>The base fleet-manager Tradesman form for the 2018 Ram 2500 and 3500 HD comes pretty sparsely equipped. There's a 40/20/40-split front bench seat with rear storage, air conditioning, vinyl flooring, cruise control, a driver-information center, automatic on/off headlights, a tilt steering wheel, even manual windows and door locks. The 6-speaker audio system features a USB port for digital music players, and all but the base audio system feature Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity. Safety features include six airbags and a full complement of electronic-stability aids.</p>, <p>We'll forgo the multiple bed-and-cab pairings available on the 2018 Ram HD, otherwise we'll be here all day. Instead, note that the Ram HD lineup offers tech-savvy options such as touch-screen navigation, conversational voice recognition, a 10-speaker premium sound system, backup sonar proximity sensors, power-adjustable pedals, heated 2nd-row seats, a power sunroof plus power-folding and heated trailer-tow mirrors. If you upgrade to the SLT, Big Horn, Laramie, Limited and Power Wagon models, an integrated trailer brake is also standard equipment.</p>, <p>Standard on the 2018 Ram 2500 and 3500 is a gasoline-powered 5.7-liter Hemi V8, with an upgrade to a 6.4-liter Hemi V8 available. These strong engines are good, but serious haulers and towers should pick one of the Cummins turbodiesel engines. Two versions of the Cummins inline-6 are available in both the 2500 and 3500, one with 660 lb-ft of torque (manual transmission), and another with 800 lb-ft of torque (automatic transmission). An even higher-output version exclusive to the 3500 puts out an incredible 900 lb-ft of torque. Gasoline-powered Ram HD models get only a 6-speed automatic, while the diesel buyers can choose between that or a segment-exclusive 6-speed manual transmission. Diesel models also feature exhaust braking for added stopping power. Two-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive is your choice.<br>

You have to move up to the SLT trim to get the 2500 Mega Cab for about $44,150. However, keep clicking options and you'll find yourself well past $75,000 for a fully loaded Limited. That's pretty spendy, but it's in line with competitive models from Chevy, GMC and Ford, which also span the low-$30,000-to-$70,000-and-above range. Whatever you decide, check out KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price tool to see what others in your area are paying for their heavy-duty Ram pickups. The downside is that the Ram HD trucks don't have the resale strength of their Ford, Chevy and GMC competition.</p>]

---------http://www.kbb.com/ram/promaster-cargo-van/2018
[<p>Unlike full-size rivals from Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Nissan, the 2018 Ram ProMaster van has the distinction of being front-wheel drive, which keeps the bulk of its weight over the driven wheels for good stability, particularly in slippery and wintry conditions. Equally important, the front-drive layout of this large commercial van translates to a sublimely low load floor and an easy step-in height, which is further complemented by a high ceiling. Available as a 1500, 2500 or 3500, Ram’s big van is easily configured to meet various business needs. As before, the ProMaster is powered by a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, or a 3.0-liter 4-cylinder EcoDiesel paired with a 6-speed automated manual that lets the driver choose gears if desired.</p>, <p>With its European origins as the proven Fiat Ducato, the Ram ProMaster impresses with its cavernous body and numerous available configurations. As a delivery vehicle, a work truck, or maybe even the basis for an RV conversion, the ProMaster -- aided by a tight turning radius and vertical cargo walls -- makes a lot of sense.</p>, <p>If you put form over function, the slab-sided van may not be for you. Its beauty lies in its capabilities. Also: If you’re looking for a passenger version, Ram does not offer one (although some companies are installing seats in window versions of the ProMaster).</p>, <p>For 2018, Uconnect 5.0 is now standard, along with optional navigation. Integrated Voice Command with Bluetooth, together with audio controls mounted on the steering wheel, is also standard for 2018, as is a rear backup camera on all ProMaster vans (except Chassis Cab and Cutaway models, which get a backup camera kit). Lastly, the right- and optional left-side sliding doors now have a window grate with optional fixed glass.</p>, <p>Don’t expect zippy acceleration and sizzling slalom times in the 2018 Ram ProMaster. In quality of ride, stability when loaded and ease of maneuvering in crowded parking lots, though, this van earns high marks. Large side windows and a massive windshield make for a great outward view, and the new standard backup camera means the windowless rear doors don’t create a problem. We appreciate this Ram’s tight 36-foot turning radius, which bests that of the Ford Transit by a substantial three feet. The 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 moves this van with reasonable alacrity, and the shifts of its conventional 6-speed automatic are smoother and better timed than those of the automated manual mated to the torquey diesel. Another benefit: The front-drive layout of the big ProMaster helps mitigate crosswind drift, although some KBB editors found the steering a bit vague.</p>, <p>FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE LAYOUT<br>
The front-drive layout of this big Ram van makes good sense. By concentrating the drivetrain up front and eliminating a traditional driveshaft, the cargo box can have a low load floor that makes loading tools, camping gear or even a motorcycle that much easier. Moreover, traction is improved in rain and snow.<br>
<br>
MULTIPLE MODELS<br>
With three wheelbases, two roof heights, and a choice of gasoline or diesel engines, the 2018 Ram ProMaster satisfies a variety of commercial needs. What’s more, its low step-in height makes life much easier for delivery drivers who get in and out of their vehicle several times a day.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>A big commercial van is more about utility and capability than comfort, but in this important area, the Ram ProMaster delivers. An available suspension-enhanced driver’s seat improves long-haul comfort, while available swiveling seats ease access to the rear. There are three wheelbase lengths, two roof heights, four body lengths, and up to 17 tie-downs. Factor in the racks, shelves and workbenches available from upfitters, and you can create a van for just about any purpose. To some KBB editors, the low load floor and high ceiling are justification enough to choose the ProMaster.</p>, <p>You’re forgiven if you think the Ram ProMaster looks like a toaster on wheels. Function, though, trumps aesthetics with full-size commercial vans. Moreover, these big Ram vans have been sold in the U.S. since 2014, so we’re now accustomed to their purposeful design. You can order your box in three weight ratings (1500, 2500, 3500), three wheelbase lengths (118, 136, 159 inches) and with a low or high roof. An extended body is available on the 159-inch chassis, and there are Chassis Cab and Cutaway versions as well. Of note, the ProMaster is available with a single sliding cargo door on the passenger’s side, or with sliding doors on both sides. Both openings are wide enough to accept standard pallets.</p>, <p>The 2018 Ram ProMaster comes standard with a backup camera and Uconnect 5.0, plus a telescoping steering wheel, remote keyless entry, power windows and a 4-speaker radio with USB and auxiliary inputs. Safety-wise, it has electronic traction and stability control, Trailer Sway Control, six airbags and Hill Start Assist, which keeps the van from rolling backward on steep inclines. There’s also a 180-amp alternator, auxiliary oil coolers for the engine and transmission, plus air conditioning as a delete option. As with other commercial vans, the rest of the vehicle configuration is up to the Ram owner and the extensive upfitter industry.</p>, <p>Options include swiveling front seats, heated seats, a pneumatic-suspension driver's seat and 3-across seating with vinyl upholstery for carrying the whole crew. Other options: navigation, Bluetooth, backup sensors, cruise control, an engine-block heater, fixed glass (in the sliding doors), heated and power-adjustable mirrors, 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an overhead shelf and a driver-side sliding door. Available in-vehicle Internet access via Uconnect Web will help with business needs, and while many of these vans are equipped with all manner of accessories from upfitters, that’s usually arranged at the dealership and included in the entire deal.</p>, <p>The 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 we've liked in other Chrysler products is standard in the ProMaster. In this duty, it delivers 280 horsepower, 260 lb-ft of torque and acceptable performance. The available 3.0-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged EcoDiesel makes 174 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque at only 1,400 rpm. It promises low-end power and, according to Ram, class-leading fuel economy. The 3.6 is matched with a 6-speed automatic transmission; the EcoDiesel is available with an automated 6-speed manual that shifts by itself or lets the driver choose gears. We prefer the standard 3.6-liter V6 powertrain; it’s powerful enough in this application but shifts much more smoothly than the diesel.<br>

The ProMaster 2500 starts at $35,140, with the longer version adding $1,600. The window model comes in around $35,000. The maximum-duty 3500 starts at $37,940; add $2,750 for the extra-length version. That's competitive with the Nissan NV and new Ford Transit van, and considerably less than the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Worker Cargo Van, which begins at $33,995. As always, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for a 2018 Ram ProMaster. Work vans generally don't retain high residual values, and because the ProMaster is still relatively new, we’ll need some time to establish its resale value.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Ram ProMaster City compact van is part of a wave of commercial vehicles derived from Europe. In the Old World, it’s known as the Fiat Doblo and this size can negotiate streets that were built before the automobile was ever invented. Yet compact vans also have their place in the modern metropolises of the United States where bigger isn’t always better. That said, the ProMaster City leads rivals like the Chevrolet City Express and Ford Transit Connect with more horsepower, advantageous fuel consumption and capacity. Maximum cargo volume is 131.7 cubic feet, total payload is 1,886 pounds, and the wagon version can seat up to five. Downside? It’s not the most affordable.</p>, <p>…you’re a plumber, or an electrician, florist, HVAC technician, or some other small business that needs to operate in a big city. The ProMaster City is a class leader for payload and cargo capacity, while the passenger version makes an interesting substitute for a wagon or small SUV.</p>, <p>…you need to keep a tight rein on the company finances. The ProMaster City is not the cheapest new Class 1 van out there (that would be the Nissan NV200). And it’s still early days regarding long-term reliability and resale values.</p>, <p>Ram’s Uconnect 3 infotainment system with a 5-inch touch screen and Bluetooth joins a rearview camera as standard equipment. Grilles are now available for windows in the sliding side doors and rear doors.</p>, <p>From a standing start, the Ram’s 2.4-liter engine provides strong acceleration. The 9-speed automatic is sometimes a little slow to respond and isn’t as smooth as we’d like at low speeds, but it’s fine once everything gets going. Ride quality is surprisingly pliant and the van is wonderfully maneuverable. The turning circle is 42 feet and the brakes (discs up front, drums out back) are confidence-inspiring. The tall body results in some sway through the corners, but that’s not a deal-breaker. From the driver’s seat, the large windows and low hood contribute to good outward vision, and the seats are comfortable and supportive. If there’s a gripe, it’s that the poorly positioned steering wheel could make it difficult for taller drivers to find their ideal driving position.</p>, <p>LOW LOAD FLOOR<br>
 Workers’ backs will be happy and days off due to injury should be few and far between, thanks to the ProMaster City van’s low cargo floor, which is only 21.5 inches off the ground. This takes a lot of the strain out of loading and unloading.<br>
<br>
 INTEGRATED DOOR LATCH AND LOCK<br>
 Smart thinking resulting in a minimum of effort, that’s the ingenious combined door latch and lock in the ProMaster City. To lock, simply push down on the handle. Pulling up on the handle unlocks, while pulling all the way up opens the door.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The ProMaster City comes out ahead of the Ford Transit Connect and Nissan NV200 in terms of comfort and general ergonomics. The front seats are easy to get in and out of, making this small commercial vehicle ideal for quick-fire deliveries. The shelf above the windshield is handy for stowing paperwork. The Tradesman has a cargo area length of 87.2 inches, a width of 60.4 inches (48.4 between the wheelwells) and a height of 51.8 inches. The wagon has rear-passenger legroom of 36.8 inches, which is about an inch shorter than that of a typical midsize sedan.</p>, <p>The 2018 ProMaster City probably won’t cut a dash through the smarter parts of town as it rolls along on 16-inch steel wheels, but its European roots give it some flair. And anyway, the overall design emphasizes practicality over prettiness, as shown by its height of six feet and two inches. The Tradesman (cargo) version has a slightly different front end to the wagon. It can also have panels, windows or a combination of the two. All versions have 60/40 rear doors that open a highly useful 180 degrees onto a low load floor.</p>, <p>Anyone who spends every working day in this van will be thankful for Bluetooth phone connectivity, one-touch power windows up front, rearview camera, air conditioning, cargo-area lighting and tie-down loops, 4-speaker audio system, remote keyless entry, and an airbag for the driver’s knees. The wagon version comes with extra airbags to protect rear passengers.</p>, <p>Apart from a few indulgences like heated front seats and satellite radio, the options list remains firmly utilitarian. Buyers may choose daytime running lights, sliding side doors (cargo version only), roof rack, full-size spare wheel/tire, Wi-Fi, rear parking sensors, cargo-partition package, and a rear wiper/washer/defroster package. The Taxi Cab package (wagon only) includes those rear-window amenities plus 2nd-row power windows and vinyl upholstery. A trailer towing package has a Class III hitch receiver along with 4-pin and 7-pin wiring harnesses. The electronic vehicle-tracking system could be a great help with logistics.</p>, <p>The front-wheel-drive Ram ProMaster City has a decent amount of muscle in the engine bay, which is easily called into service even if this compact van is carrying a full load. The 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine makes 178 horsepower and is connected to a 9-speed automatic transmission. Low gearing can get things moving quickly. Yet this combination makes good business sense, because having nine ratios also means low engine speeds for cruising. The ProMaster City simultaneously enjoys the best horsepower and fuel-consumption figures in its class. It runs on 87-octane regular gasoline and the tank holds 16 gallons.<br>

Spend another $1,650 for the SLT trim and gain color-coded bumpers, heated/power-folding side mirrors (also color-coded), an upgraded driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, navigation, and eligibility for a few options bundles. It’s virtually the same formula with the 5-seater Wagon version, starting at $26,390. These prices roughly parallel the Ford Transit Connect van/wagon, but it's about $2,000 higher than the cargo-only Nissan NV200.

Since it's relatively new to North America, the van's resale value remains to be seen.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/smart/fortwo-electric-drive/2018
[<p>Two years after debuting an all-new design, the 2018 2-seat Smart Fortwo makes a radical leap forward by jettisoning its gasoline engine, leaving only the all-electric version to serve the urban-commuter community. The Smart Fortwo comes in three trims: Pure, Passion and Prime, with the last two also offered in convertible form. However, with a $24,000 starting price (before any tax credits) and only a 58-mile range, buyers might find spending a bit more for a Nissan Leaf or Chevrolet Bolt gets them more distance, better safety features and an all-important back seat. There are also a number of compact gasoline-powered cars that cost much less than the Fortwo, but are as equally nimble in city traffic. </p>, <p>If you live where parking spots are considered coveted territory, the Smart Fortwo’s minute dimensions will certainly come in handy. The cabin is surprisingly roomy for two people and the tiny turning radius makes it easy to get in and out of tight spots, as well as maneuver through congested streets.</p>, <p>If you need room for more than one, prefer a car with verifiable crash-test results or need an electric vehicle that doesn’t need to recharge after just 58 miles, a Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt or Volkswagen e-Golf makes a better choice.</p>, <p>For 2018, Smart joins Tesla in offering only electric-powered cars. The Fortwo Coupe and Cabrio lose their gasoline engines, but everything else remains the same.</p>, <p>The all-electric 2018 Smart Fortwo’s instant power delivery results in quick acceleration from a dead stop, but compared with other electrics its actual performance is pretty slow. That’s because the Fortwo’s electric motor puts out the equivalent of 80 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque. With a range limited to 58 miles (57 on the Cabrio), the Fortwo doesn’t go very far on a charge, but then again in a small urban setting most owners probably won’t exceed the batteries’ ability in a day. If they do, recharging requires a minimum of three hours on a 240v charger. The added weight of the battery pack and its position low in the chassis help improve the Fortwo’s handling and stability, something you’ll appreciate if you have the guts to take it on the highway. With a 22.8-foot turning radius, the Fortwo has no issues executing a U-turn on a 2-lane road, and fitting it into parking spaces normally reserved for motorcycles or mopeds is oddly satisfying.</p>, <p>TRIDION CELL<br>
Daimler is renowned for its safety innovations, so the Fortwo’s Tridion safety cell should come as no surprise. Formed from high-strength steel, the cage ensures the tiny car can hold its own in the event of an accident, as demonstrated in crash tests using Mercedes-Benz cars outfitted with the same technology.<br>
<br>
TINY TURNING CIRCLE<br>
Have you ever spotted the perfect parking spot, only to have it taken by the time you executed a 3-point turn? Well, those days are gone thanks to the Fortwo’s minute 22.8-foot turning radius. A clearing in traffic is all you need to make a U-turn and snag the perfect spot.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Fortwo's cabin is surprisingly roomy for two, and its charming 2-tone color schemes make the interior feel spacious and welcoming. There are high-quality materials throughout, and the seats are more comfortable than you'd expect on longer drives. The interior isn’t perfect though, as the steering wheel doesn't offer tilt or telescoping adjustment, and there are storage cubbies but they aren't all that useful.</p>, <p>The Fortwo model line benefited from all-new styling that carries on to the 2018 coupe and convertible. The large, round headlights and happy-to-see-you smiling grille on such a short car give the Fortwo the look of an enthusiastic puppy. The wide Fortwo looks more substantial than the first generation did, yet is about as long as some motorcycles. In the Fortwo Cabrio, a clever cutout in the rear hatch tailgate lets you stow the roof bars when you want the full convertible experience with the top down and the bars off.</p>, <p>The base Pure model features automatic climate control, daytime-running lights, a multifunction steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity, rearview camera and cruise control as standard fare. Crosswind assist is also standard, and welcome on this short-wheelbase car. Power windows and power steering are standard, which you couldn't say about the Fortwo two years ago. The Passion adds heated mirrors, a height-adjustable driver’s seat and 15-inch alloy wheels. Prime trims get heated seats, fog lights, black leather upholstery, panoramic sunroof plus rain and light sensors.</p>, <p>Options vary by trim and include fog lights with cornering functions, smartphone cradle, heated seats, panoramic sunroof, a center armrest, a JBL audio system and 16-inch alloy wheels. A Sport Package adds a sport suspension. You can customize the Fortwo's color scheme, including the color of the Tridion cell and the grille. For even more customization, the Brabus Sport package has a lowered, retuned suspension and Brabus styling cues. Cabrio models offer a number of soft-top color choices. </p>, <p>The Fortwo is available in two body styles, coupe and cabriolet, with an 80-horsepower electric motor and only one transmission speed -- that’s right, no shifts. It’s utterly silent in operation. The battery pack remains somewhat small at 17.8 kWh, though it can be charged from zero to 80 percent in 2.5 hours on a 240-volt outlet.<br>

 Range on a full charge: est. 58 miles coupe/57 miles cabrio</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Smart Fortwo Pure Coupe’s Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starts at $24,550, but that’s before the $7,500 federal tax credit. The Passion jumps to just over $26,000 and the Prime just shy of $27,500. The Passion Cabrio is $28,750 and the Prime Cabrio $29,750. For comparison, the larger and longer-range Nissan Leaf starts around $30,000, and the Chevrolet Bolt at around $37,500. Non-electric minicars like the Chevy Spark and Mitsubishi Mirage start at a lower price -- below $14,000 -- have two rows of seats, more cargo area but pitiful resale value. Those who are looking at the Smart Fortwo, however, want something more than pure practical transportation. Do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Fortwo. It should also be noted that Smart cars have never been resale-value giants, and electric cars are <i>really</i> a tough resale.</p>]

[<p>Beloved by young driving enthusiasts looking for affordable thrills, the 2018 Subaru BRZ is a small, lightweight sports coupe with rear-wheel drive, a manual transmission and over 200 horsepower. It’s the only Subaru that isn’t all-wheel drive, and with pricing starting just over $26,000 it remains one of the least expensive ways for performance enthusiasts to have fun on a budget. It’s powered by a 2.0-liter version of Subaru’s flat, horizontally opposed 4-cylinder engine, a unique design that helps lower the coupe’s center of gravity and improve its handling. The Subaru BRZ competes with the Mazda Miata and mechanically and visually similar Toyota 86, but unlike the 2-seat Miata roadster, the BRZ is offered only as a closed coupe and it offers a small back seat.</p>, <p>If you’re a driving enthusiast looking for a visceral driving experience and strong performance at an affordable price, you’ll like the 2018 Subaru BRZ. The sexy little Subaru is one of the least expensive rear-wheel-drive coupes on the market, and its 205 horsepower may not sound like much but it’s plenty in this lightweight sports car.</p>, <p>Subaru doesn’t offer a BRZ convertible. If you want the sun on your cheeks, the Mazda Miata and Ford Mustang are your best bets at this price point. As fun as the BRZ is, it’s also a bit raw. Some enthusiasts may prefer the more refined and versatile VW Golf GTI or Ford Focus ST hatchbacks.</p>, <p>For 2018, Subaru has improved the BRZ’s infotainment and navigation system, and it has created the high-performance BRZ tS model with chassis tuning by STI, which is Subaru’s legendary in-house hot-rod shop. The special model features 18-inch wheels and improved handling over the standard BRZ. Only 500 will be built.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for neck-snapping, tire-smoking acceleration, the 2018 Subaru BRZ will disappoint. It’s quick, sprinting from 0-60 mph in a little over six seconds, but any V8-powered Camaro or Mustang with leave it sucking wind at any stoplight. The BRZ's real gifts are the way it corners -- and the way it makes you feel when you’re tossing it around. If carving roads, wringing out an engine for all its worth and manually shifting through gears is your idea of fun, you'll enjoy driving the BRZ. Sure, a 6-speed automatic is available and it even has a manual mode, but the 6-speed manual is perfectly geared and more appropriately in character for this lightweight little thrill ride. You can’t help smiling every time you rev the BRZ’s flat-4 to 7,000 rpm and fast-flick the shifter up another gear. Subaru has even tuned the BRZ's stability control so it allows you to slide the rear-wheel-drive coupe’s tail before it steps in to save you.</p>, <p>LCD MULTIFUNCTION DISPLAY<br>
 The 2018 Subaru BRZ Limited and tS models offer unique performance readouts on a 4.2-in. LCD multifunction display, which is positioned to the right of the coupe’s center-mounted tachometer. Drivers can geek out on lateral-g’s, accelerator-pedal position, braking force, steering angle, and oil and water temperature. There’s also an integrated stopwatch to record track lap times.<br>
<br>
FOLD-DOWN REAR SEAT<br>
 The back seat in the 2018 Subaru BRZ is small, although you can stuff a couple of friends back there for a pizza run. It also folds to expand the coupe’s small 6.9-cubic-foot trunk. With it folded the BRZ can carry two sets of golf clubs or, more importantly, an extra set of wheels and tires to the racetrack. Let’s see a Miata do that.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>You sit low in the 2018 Subaru BRZ in a well-bolstered bucket seat. The 3-spoke steering wheel, shifter and pedals are perfectly placed for performance driving. Even the tachometer is where it should be, directly in front of the driver, just as it is in a Porsche 911, so you can keep tabs on the coupe’s high-revving engine. There are seats for four, but the back seat is too small to be truly useful; the good news is that it folds flat to expand the trunk and BRZ’s cargo capacity. Ergonomics overall is strong, but the Subaru’s infotainment system, despite improvements, seems a bit dated.</p>, <p>At just 166.7 inches long, the 2018 Subaru BRZ is about 10 inches shorter than a Chevy Corvette. Still it’s over 10 inches longer than Mazda’s miniscule Miata, and it looks substantial with its wide stance and long hood. Although almost indistinguishable from the Toyota 86 and built in the same assembly plant, the BRZ gets its own bumpers and wheel designs. Standard twin tailpipes and an aluminum spoiler finish the tail end, and LED headlights are standard. The new BRZ tS model gets a larger carbon-fiber rear spoiler, which is manually adjustable to tune downforce on the racetrack, and it’s the first BRZ to wear 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>The 2018 Subaru BRZ remains available in two main trims: Premium and Limited. Premium models -- yes, that's the base form -- include Subaru's Starlink 6.2-inch touch-screen multimedia display with 8-speaker AM/FM/CD system with Bluetooth connectivity and USB/auxiliary ports, rearview camera, manual driver's seat with height adjustment, Torsen limited-slip differential, 17-inch wheels, cruise control, and leather-wrapped shift handle and tilt/telescoping steering wheel. BRZ Limited models add an Alcantara-and-leather interior with heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, LED fog lights, security system, push-button ignition, a 4.2-inch color instrument display, and red interior accents. The BRZ tS gets black leather and suede upholstery with red stitching.</p>, <p>The 2018 BRZ's option list is relatively short. If you want an automatic-transmission BRZ, you'll have to get the more expensive Limited trim and option it. Other add-ons include the Performance Package available on manual-transmission BRZs that bundles black alloy wheels, Brembo brakes and Sachs front and rear shock absorbers. The BRZ's options are nice, but in reality, even a base Premium model is recommendable as this coupe's dynamic performance is its biggest draw. For real buffs, the limited-production BRZ tS gets special suspension components, chassis bracing, 18-inch wheels and high-performance Michelin tires as well exterior enhancements and interior upgrades. Safety systems like dynamic cruise control, a blind-spot monitor and autonomous braking are not available.</p>, <p>Just one engine is available in the Subaru BRZ. It is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder that is horizontally opposed, or a "boxer" or "flat" design. This layout allows the engine to sit lower in the vehicle, which means a lower center of gravity and thus better handling. The manual-transmission version uses different cylinder heads, valves, camshaft, aluminum intake manifold and redesigned exhaust manifolds, which give it a slight increase in power and torque. Aside from the lower price, better engagement and slightly increased horsepower, another reason to opt for a manual model is it boasts a sweet red intake manifold. Pop the hood and check it out. All BRZs are rear-wheel drive, just as divinity intended a sports car should be. A 6-speed manual is standard, but a 6-speed automatic with a manual mode is available on the Limited model. Surprisingly, fuel economy is better with the automatic.<br>
<br>
 2.0-liter flat-4<br>
 200 horsepower @ 7,000 rpm (205 horsepower w/manual-transmission)<br>
 151 lb-ft of torque @ 6,400 rpm (156 lb-ft w/manual-transmission)<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/29 mpg (manual), 24/33 mpg (automatic), 20/27 mpg (BRZ tS)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>When you include the destination charge, the new 2018 Subaru BRZ has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $26,500 for a base Premium model. The higher-trim Limited BRZ starts near $28,500. If you want an automatic-transmission Subaru BRZ, you're looking at about $29,656, while the Performance Package for manual models is an extra $1,195. Aside from its Toyota twin the 86 that starts at about $27,250, direct competitors to the new BRZ are few. For comparison, though, the Chevy Camaro and Nissan 370Z start higher than the BRZ, while the Ford Mustang and Mazda MX-5 Miata are slightly lower. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying for their BRZ. Subarus have a reputation for strong resale value, and while it trails other Subaru models, the BRZ is expected to hold its value well in its relatively small segment.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Subaru Crosstrek is a rugged, all-wheel-drive <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> packed with value and an adventurous spirit. The Crosstrek is all-new for 2018, which marks its second generation after it became a surprise success in the automaker's lineup. Though it's based on a 5-door Impreza, the Crosstrek is very much its own model, blurring the lines between a hatchback and compact SUV thanks to its ample ground clearance, tough looks, and outdoor-oriented features like a standard roof rack. This all-new version is enhanced with more safety features and driving aids, better refinement and premium options. The Crosstrek isn't as powerful or as athletic as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/golf%20alltrack/">Volkswagen Golf Alltrack</a>, but its reputation for practicality, reliability and high <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> make this Subie a standout.</p>, <p>If you want an all-wheel-drive compact SUV that's as adventurous as it is economical, the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek hits the bull's-eye. It's an enticing automotive amalgamation, blending hatchback versatility, the higher ride height and enhanced visibility of an SUV, and sedan-like driving manners.</p>, <p>For all the things a Crosstrek is, it isn't all that powerful or athletic. If you prioritize fun-to-drive dynamics, check out a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a> subcompact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV or the slightly larger and pricier Volkswagen Golf Alltrack. If you seek a more traditional <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a> compact SUV, look to the Forester.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> is all-new for 2018. Following the Impreza on which it's based, the 2018 Crosstrek is built on a new platform that touts enhanced refinement and safety. Other improvements include standard tech like Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility and upgraded driver-assistance features.</p>, <p>The new Crosstrek is a step up from the outgoing model. Overall ride quality is more comfortable, and the drone of the engine and continuously variable transmission (CVT) has been tempered. One aspect we most appreciate is the quelling of throttle tip-in that's been an issue on past Subarus. That's the tendency to lurch from a stop if you're not easy on the accelerator pedal, but thankfully that has been addressed with the all-new Crosstrek. Power remains only adequate at best. The 4-cylinder engine's 152 horsepower is efficient for sure, but acceleration isn't a strong point, and high-speed passing requires plenty of open road. The Crosstrek has surprising off-road chops. In our test, the Subie's standard all-wheel drive and new torque-vectoring system easily ate up miles of unpaved roads. A manual transmission is available on base and mid-trims, but we didn't find it all that satisfying to use.</p>, <p>X-MODE WITH HILL DESCENT CONTROL<br/> Subaru's off-road system has now made its way into the Crosstrek. A push of a button optimizes the vehicle for descending steep, slippery slopes. Once engaged, you can take your foot off the brake pedal and focus on steering the Crosstrek down its intended path.<br/> <br/> CARPLAY &amp; ANDROID AUTO<br/> These Apple and Android smartphone interfaces are making their way into more and more <a alt_o_t="New Cars" href="/new-cars/">new cars</a>, but they're not always standard. In the new Subaru Crosstrek, they are. Even a base 2.0i model with manual transmission is ready to play with your Apple or Android phone.<br/> </p>, <p>Like the Impreza on which it's based the Crosstrek has two rows and seating for up to five passengers. We found the front seats perfectly acceptable after a long day's drive, but did wish for adjustable lumbar support. Rear-seat room is respectable considering this car's compact size, and the view out is better than average. One of the best things about this Subie's interior are its fold-flat seats. In this case, flat truly means that, as their angle is much flatter than the seats found in most rivals. As such, the Crosstrek makes the most of its cargo space, swallowing over 55 cubic feet of your shopping bags or outdoor gear.</p>, <p>This 2nd-gen Subaru uses an all-new platform, but its exterior design hasn't strayed far from the original. Compared to the previous edition, the new Crosstrek is slightly longer and wider. Among the biggest distinctions on the new model are its wider taillight housings and more prominent, upward-sloping side creases. Up front, the 2018 Crosstrek gets Subaru's "hawk-eye" headlight treatment and a tweaked grille. Roof rails are standard equipment, so go ahead and strap on that bike. Like its Outback big brother, the Crosstrek boasts an above-average 8.7 inches of ground clearance, enabling it to better tackle trails and snow.</p>, <p>The Crosstrek remains available in three trims: 2.0i (base), 2.0i Premium, and 2.0i Limited. The least-expensive Crosstrek includes all-wheel drive with active torque vectoring, cruise control, 17-inch wheels and a rearview camera. Also standard is Subaru's Starlink multimedia system with a 6.5-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, AM/FM stereo, USB port with iPod control, Bluetooth audio streaming, and an auxiliary jack. We think you're better off spending the additional $800 for a Premium trim. It adds heated front seats, fog lights, a windshield wiper de-icer and heated side mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a 6-speaker audio system, vanity mirrors on the sun visors, and it opens the door for more options.</p>, <p>The top-line Crosstrek Limited includes leather interior, a CVT automatic transmission as standard, power driver's seat, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, automatic single-zone climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen infotainment system with AM/FM/HD Radio, CD player, dual USB inputs and voice-activated controls, plus keyless access with push-button start, 18-inch wheels, and color multifunction dash display. A moonroof is optional on Premium and Limited trims, as is the EyeSight driver-assist and active-safety system with adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane-departure warning, and lane-keep assist package. Limited trims can also add a harman/kardon premium audio system, navigation, and reverse automatic braking.</p>, <p>All 2018 Crosstreks use a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder flat (horizontally opposed cylinders) engine. Now with direct injection, this revised engine has a slight bump in power over the outgoing one, but at 152 horsepower, it's still modest. Base and Premium trims come with a 6-speed manual transmission, but most buyers will choose the CVT automatic, which is optional on those trims and standard on the top-line Limited model. The Crosstrek's fuel economy remains impressive, especially considering it is all-wheel drive. Unlike some subcompact crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, the Crosstrek is rated to tow, though at 1,500 pounds, capacity is modest.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter flat-4<br/> 152 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 145 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/29 mpg (manual), 27/33 mpg (automatic)</p>, <p>The 2018 Subaru Crosstrek has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $22,710, including destination, for a base model with manual transmission. Again, we think you're better off spending $800 more for the better-equipped Premium model. If you want an automatic transmission on either of those models, as most buyers will, plan to spend an extra $1,000. Crosstrek Limited models begin at $27,210. Fully loaded, a Crosstrek can reach just beyond $30,000. Would-be rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a>, Mazda CX-3, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/juke/">Nissan Juke</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/trax/">Chevrolet Trax</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500x/">Fiat 500X</a> start slightly lower, but they also don't have all-wheel drive standard. Though a bit larger, the VW Golf Alltrack is a more direct rival to the Crosstrek, and it starts a few thousand higher. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying. As with other Subaru vehicles, the Crosstrek's resale value is expected to be among the highest in its segment.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Subaru Forester is one of over a dozen compact-crossover <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> vying for your attention, but it's the only one with standard all-wheel drive. That trait has long made Subarus the favored vehicles of cold-weather states, while the Forester's ample ground clearance and ability to venture off-pavement have made it popular with the adventure-minded. Those abilities set it apart from rivals like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a>, but they're not the only compelling reasons for the Forester. It can be outfitted with a robust suite of safety and driving aids, a turbocharged engine and, on lower models, it's among the last of its kind to offer a manual transmission. With its remarkable <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>, the Forester further stands out from the pack.</p>, <p>If you want a 5-passenger <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV with the surefootedness that comes with all-wheel drive (AWD) and has great visibility, laudable fuel economy and above-average ground clearance all at cost that's a good value up front and great in the long-term, you'll find it in the 2018 Forester.</p>, <p>Another defining trait of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a> is its boxer engine, which has a lower center of gravity but can sound raspy, especially at startup. If you want a <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">compact SUV</a> that's more fun to drive and is among the best-looking of its kind, try the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>.</p>, <p>The Forester Black Edition trim package arrives for 2018, bringing darkened aesthetics and paddle shifters, while models with the EyeSight driver-assist package get reverse auto braking and high-beam assist. Touring models receive the EyeSight Driver Assist as standard, with the turbo 2.0XT Touring models also gaining torque vectoring as standard.</p>, <p>Subaru’s 2018 Forester is the rare crossover SUV that’s equally adept on-road and off-road. The AWD system makes the most of the engine's oomph to deliver smooth, even power regardless of road conditions. In most models that power is delivered through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that helps keep fuel economy near the top of the class. Our one gripe is throttle tip-in -- initial accelerator response can be touchy, causing the Forester to feel like it's lurching. After a while you should get used to it, or you can opt for the 6-speed manual transmission. The Forester's suspension blends comfort and control without sacrificing either, with minimal body roll in corners but enough travel to absorb ruts when the asphalt ends. The electrically assisted power steering feels precise, and if you want extra power, the XT turbo models are downright quick, getting to 60 mph in about six seconds.</p>, <p>X-MODE WITH HILL DESCENT CONTROL<br>
 X-Mode, standard starting on the Premium trim with the CVT transmission, burnishes the Forester's off-road reputation. Press the corresponding button, and this Subie will optimize control of the throttle, AWD system, stability and traction control, and Hill Descent Control to maximize the Forester for tackling slippery surfaces and steep inclines.<br>
<br>
 EYESIGHT DRIVER-ASSIST SYSTEM<br>
 The 2018 Forester's available EyeSight system uses two color cameras to view the road ahead, allowing advanced safety features such as pre-collision braking, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and more.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With the addition of thicker glass, an acoustic windshield, new door seals and additional sound deadening under the floor last year, the latest Subaru Forester promises to be notably quieter than its predecessor. Soft-touch surfaces already helped make the Forester feel upscale, and the newly upgraded interior on the Forester Touring models ups that ante. The 2-row/5-passenger interior design is excellent thanks to its generous visibility and sensible design. The doors open wide, there's good rear-seat legroom, and there's a ton of cargo space: over 30 cubic feet behind the rear seats, and around 70 cubic feet with the seats folded.</p>, <p>With an exterior that also was updated last year, the 2018 Forester’s sleek headlights incorporate <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a>'s C-shaped LED motif and a fresh-looking hexagonal grille. The headlights also received a functional upgrade with an available steering-responsive feature that turns them with the steering wheel to give better views at night. The Forester rides 8.7 inches off the ground, ground clearance that makes it especially competent in snowy climates. Turbocharged XT models have a unique front end and a rear roof spoiler, while the new Black Edition -- actually available in four exterior colors -- has darkened alloy wheels and other exterior treatments.</p>, <p>The 2018 Forester is available in six trims, including the top two 2.0XT turbocharged models. At its most basic, a 2.5i includes AWD, the Subaru Starlink infotainment system with 6.2-inch display and 4-speaker AM/FM/CD system with HD Radio, Bluetooth connectivity and USB and auxiliary inputs. We recommend stepping up at least one trim to the 2.5i Premium, which adds a panoramic sunroof, 10-way-power driver's seat, reclining rear seatbacks and fold-down rear armrest with cup holders, upgraded infotainment system, alloy wheels, automatic climate control, roof rails and body-color side mirrors. That trim also opens a door to convenient options like a power tailgate.</p>, <p>Forester 2.5i Limited models bring leather seating and standard CVT automatic transmission, and add features that are optional on the Premium model such as blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, power tailgate and fog lights. Continuing the climb, Touring models bring 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control, heated steering wheel, one-touch folding rear seats and LED headlights. Other options include navigation, harman/kardon premium audio system, and the EyeSight suite of driver-assist and active safety features. If you must have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, you'll have to look elsewhere as it isn't available on the 2018 Forester.</p>, <p>Two engines remain available in the 2018 Forester, both of which are 4-cylinder “boxer” -- or flat -- engines. This setup allows the engine to be placed lower in the vehicle, which in turn creates a lower center of gravity and enhanced stability. Most Foresters are equipped with a non-turbo 2.5-liter that makes 170 horsepower, backed by either a 6-speed manual transmission or the Lineartronic CVT automatic. Forester 2.0XT SUVs offer more power thanks to a turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter engine. This smaller engine develops 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, routing it to all four wheels through a High-Torque Lineartronic CVT with multi-mode SI-Drive that can emulate six or eight virtual gear ratios. Neither model is particularly well-suited for towing, rated at only 1,500 pounds.<br>

 174 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm<br>

An automatic transmission costs $1,000 more. More recommendable is the better-equipped 2.5i Premium trim starting at $26,610 with a manual or $27,110 with the CVT. The 2.5i Touring trim begins just over $34,000. Turbo Forester models start at $30,410 for the 2.0XT Premium. At the top is the all-in 2.0XT Touring, at $37,005. At its starting price, the Forester is in line with the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/rogue/">Nissan Rogue</a>. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a> starts slightly less, as do the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/tucson/">Hyundai Tucson</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a> and new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/compass/">Jeep Compass</a>. Keep in mind that AWD on all these will cost extra. Check the Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Subaru Forester's resale value is expected to be at or near the top of the pack.</p>]

[<p>When it introduced an all-new Impreza last year, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a> kept only one thing from the old car: its Subaruness. That's still the story with the 2018 Subaru Impreza. With its standard all-wheel drive, sporty handling, and a funky-sounding flat-4 engine, it really couldn't be anything else. Yet everything about the Impreza is better than ever before. It's stiffer than its predecessors, with a more refined suspension and sharper steering, enough that even mid-level models are still fun to drive. The Impreza offers up good interior space as well, with a rear seat that can accommodate adults at last. With cutting edge EyeSight driver assist, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the Impreza is a competitive all-wheel-drive alternative to the Mazda3, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/elantra/">Hyundai Elantra</a> and many others.</p>, <p>If the foul-weather security of all-wheel drive is at or near the top of your shopping priorities, but you can't break your compact-car budget, then the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/impreza/">Subaru Impreza</a> is the only way to go. Even if you ignored its standard all-wheel drive, the Impreza would still be a cutting-edge choice, and comes as a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a>.</p>, <p>The Impreza's only engine puts out just 152 horsepower, meaning it's not particularly quick. While Subaru has improved fuel economy over the years, it still trails the class leaders, such as the Honda Civic.</p>, <p>The 2018 Impreza follows an all-new model last year, so changes are limited. Extremely limited in this case, as the only addition is headlights that turn on with the windshield wipers in Premium, Sport and Limited models.</p>, <p>There's no escaping it: The 2018 Subaru Impreza is lacking under the hood. The 2.0-liter 4-cylinder puts out 152 horsepower, but it has more than 3,000 pounds of Subaru to lug around, and it never feels sporty. It's a shame, because the chassis feels like it could easily handle more power. The steering feels lively and direct in your hands, and the suspension offers up surprising grip, even on lower-end models. On the highway or around town, it's also quieter than you might expect, thanks to the new chassis and impressive sound deadening. The engine can be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission, or a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that uses steering wheel-mounted paddles to simulate the feel of a traditional 7-speed automatic. However, while enthusiasts will gravitate to the manual, they'll also hope a more powerful engine makes it under the hood.</p>, <p>STANDARD ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br/> Picking all-wheel drive as a favorite Subaru feature is like picking red as a favorite <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> feature: It's a little obvious. Still, for the same price as many of the Impreza's competitors you get the all-weather security that comes with the system, and you won't find all-wheel drive at a lower price.<br/> <br/> EYESIGHT DRIVER ASSIST<br/> Subaru's EyeSight driver-assist technology works a little differently than many competitors, using stereo cameras to literally look down the road and enable active cruise control, collision avoidance, active lane keeping, and more. It's also available on nearly all Impreza models.<br/> </p>, <p>The gauges, infotainment and controls in the 2018 Impreza all look and feel more upscale than expected, with soft-touch surfaces, and a stitched look on the dash and doors. The controls are laid out logically as well, including the infotainment system -- don't like the latter, and you can just use the familiarity of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto instead. The comfortable front seats are finally matched with rear seats that can accommodate adults. Cargo space in the Impreza sedan is a smallish 12.3 cubic feet. The hatchback's 20.8 cubic feet of cargo space expands to 55.3 with the rear seats folded.</p>, <p>Subaru has managed to keep the Impreza instantly familiar while simultaneously making it longer, lower and wider than its predecessor. Credit the grille and headlight treatments, but the rear end and surface detail are all what we expect from Subaru's <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">compact car</a>. But it's integrated with a long roof and coupe-like design that's much more modern than the stubby car from a couple years ago. More important is the hatchback, which actually accounts for 60 percent of Impreza sales in defiance of the usual trend favoring <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a>. This hatchback is a looker, and it now shares its built-in roof rack attachments with the sedan.</p>, <p>The primary differentiator between the 2018 Subaru Impreza and its competition is standard all-wheel drive, even in the base model. That base model hits the essentials in other ways as well. The Impreza 2.0i includes a Starlink audio system that brings a 6.5-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There's also a rearview camera and air conditioning. In addition, there's standard cruise control and incline-start assist. The Impreza 2.0i comes with a 5-speed manual transmission with the CVT automatic as an option. On the rest of the lineup, the CVT is standard.</p>, <p>According to Subaru, the 2.0i Premium is the volume leader, adding a 7-speed manual shift mode for the CVT, better shocks, an updated audio system, and <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> touches like welcome lighting and illuminated power window switches. The Impreza Sport adds more aggressive wheels, tires and suspension settings, red stitching on the dash and doors, and a better audio system with an expanded touch-screen interface. Topping the lineup is the Limited, which features a 6-way-power driver's seat, a color LCD display in the instrument cluster, steering-responsive headlights and more. EyeSight is available as a stand-alone option -- get this -- as is a moonroof.</p>, <p>The only engine available in the 2018 Subaru Impreza is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. It's something of a mixed bag. On one hand, it offers up decent fuel economy, especially considering the standard all-wheel drive. That remains true whether you choose the 5-speed manual or CVT automatic transmission. On paper, those horsepower and torque numbers are competitive, but on the road, the little engine has more than 3,000 pounds of all-wheel-drive Subaru to contend with, and it always feels like it's struggling. The CVT's occasionally slow reactions only exacerbate the problem. We think the 175-horsepower flat-4 under the hood of the Legacy would make a great upgrade engine.<br>

The better-equipped Premium model starts around $22,150. For more luxury, the Impreza Limited starts just above the $25,000 mark. If you want a little more driving fun, the Sport model is about $23,000 if you want a manual transmission, or $23,600 with an automatic. Those prices are for sedans -- add about $500 if you want a hatchback. Load up a Limited with all the options and you're still looking at less than $30,000, making the Impreza easily competitive against the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a>, none of which offer all-wheel drive.

---------http://www.kbb.com/subaru/legacy/2018
[<p>The 2018 Subaru Legacy tends to fly under the radar, but a closer look reveals it is a smart choice for many sedan buyers, and the best choice for some. Like nearly every other Subaru, the Legacy's secret sauce is its all-wheel drive (AWD). While the Legacy has no lack of competitors in better-known rivals like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, only one other midsize sedan -- the Ford Fusion -- even offers AWD. With the Legacy, it's standard, which makes this Subaru a favorite in cold-weather states. Far from a one-trick pony, the Legacy also has an excellent reputation for efficiency, safety, reliability and resale value. It's also among the few midsize sedans left to still offer a 6-cylinder engine.</p>, <p>If you live where it regularly snows or traction is otherwise compromised, the 2018 Legacy is almost a no-brainer. Other appealing aspects include a starting price just over $23,000 that includes an automatic transmission and standard tech such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.</p>, <p>If ultra-high fuel economy is your priority, look to a hybrid version of the Camry, Accord, Fusion, Chevrolet Malibu, Kia Optima or Hyundai Sonata. If you want a manual transmission, try the Accord or Mazda6.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Subaru Legacy gains new Starlink infotainment systems that include standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and updated grille and interior aesthetics. Revisions to the engine-control unit (ECU) grant smoother acceleration, while other modifications have been made to reduce body roll and interior noise.</p>, <p>Like all Subarus, the 2018 Legacy uses a "boxer-type” engine, where the pistons are parallel to the ground, instead of in a V or vertical. This puts the weight of the engine lower, giving the Legacy surprisingly nimble handling. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder offers similar power as other 4-cylinder cars in this class, but the continuously variable transmission (CVT) actually makes it feel more responsive than you'd expect from 175 horsepower. Still, it's no rocket with that engine, and if you need more, the 3.6-liter 6-cylinder available in the Limited offers a more robust 256 horsepower that makes short work of passing and accelerating, albeit at the expense of fuel economy. Around town the Legacy is comfortable and quiet, with a relaxed ride, but it still handles quite well in corners. Kudos also to the driver's-seat position and outward visibility.</p>, <p>CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO, STANDARD<br/> These integration systems for Apple and Android phones are becoming increasingly popular on new cars, but they're not always standard. For the 2018 Subaru Legacy, they are, even on the lowest trim level.<br/> <br/> PIN-CODE ACCESS<br/> If you're an adventurous type who doesn't want to be encumbered by keys -- a surfer or runner, for instance -- this feature is for you. It allows you to leave the keys securely locked in the car and regain entry via a passcode on the door.<br/> </p>, <p>Upgraded for 2018, the Legacy sedan offers a contemporary, roomy and comfortable cabin for its five passengers. Updates this year include a new steering wheel and a new color choice: gray, in addition to the existing black and ivory. The Starlink touch-screen infotainment systems gain size -- 6.5 inches or 8.0 inches -- and speed thanks to a faster CPU. Our back appreciated the 10-way-power adjustable driver's seat and its impressive lumbar support that is standard on all but base models, while the rear seat has lots of legroom. At exactly 15 cubic feet, the Legacy's trunk is big.</p>, <p>The Legacy's exterior also gets a light makeover for 2018, most notably in the grille, which now has the Subaru logo and horizontal lines running through the middle. The Legacy remains on the conservative end of the midsize-sedan styling spectrum. It doesn't have the pizazz of a Kia Optima or the all-new Toyota Camry, but boasts its own sense of confidence and strength. We think it will hold up well over the years. The 2.5i Sport model goes for a slightly more aggressive vibe with a new trunk spoiler and gloss-black grille. Six-cylinder Legacy 3.6R Limited models include dual exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>The least expensive Subaru Legacy 2.5i model includes all-wheel drive with torque vectoring for optimal traction, 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat, folding rear seats, and a 4-speaker infotainment system with 6.5-inch screen, AM/FM stereo with USB input and Bluetooth connectivity, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. For $2,100 more, the 2.5i Premium is more recommendable, adding 10-way-power driver's seat, dual-zone climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, windshield-wiper de-icer, and upgraded infotainment system with 8-inch display, dual front and rear USB inputs, and 6-speaker audio system with CD player. This trim also offers navigation and Subaru's EyeSight driver-assist technology.</p>, <p>Continuing the trim climb, Legacy 2.5i Sport models add push-button start, 2-tone interior, power moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror, the PIN-code access system (see Favorite Features) and 18-inch wheels. Legacy Limited models venture into premium territory with leather interior, 12-speaker harman/kardon audio system, power front-passenger seat, heated rear seats, and blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert. Optional on all but the base models is the EyeSight system, which adds features like adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, and even a system that automatically brakes when in reverse to avoid a collision.</p>, <p>The standard engine in the 2018 Subaru Legacy is a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that puts out 175 horsepower. The upgrade, available only in top-line Limited models, is a 3.6-liter 6-cylinder with 256 horsepower. Both engines are known as "boxer" configurations, because the pistons are parallel with the ground, and the way they move in and out is similar to a boxer's fists. It's more than just a conversation piece though, as this configuration reduces vibration and lowers the Subaru's center of gravity for a more planted feel. The standard continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) uses a special shift algorithm, making it feel more like a regular automatic transmission. All models also include steering-wheel-mounted paddles that allow you to shift through six preset gear ratios.<br>

At $25,155, the better-equipped and more recommendable 2.5i Premium is a good value. Legacy Sport models start at $27,205, and the 2.5i Limited begins just shy of $30,000. If you want a 6-cylinder Legacy, it starts at $32,805 and can rise past $34,000 with the EyeSight package. The Legacy's starting price is just below that of front-drive rivals, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.

[<p>The 2018 Subaru Outback is an illustration of automotive metamorphosis, transforming over the years from rugged station <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/wagon/">wagon</a> to something more like an <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>. Whatever you label this 5-passenger hauler, it's been a hit for good reason. The Outback is quite possibly the most recommendable vehicle for the broadest range of buyers and tasks. It's spacious, efficient, comfortable, a great value in the near and long term, and -- thanks to standard all-wheel drive and excellent ground clearance -- can tackle almost any road or weather condition. Add in advanced safety features, driving aids and technology like CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility, and this Subie's recipe only improves. The Outback faces many rivals, from the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> Alltrack to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/edge/">Ford Edge</a>, but none have its jack-of-all-trades character.</p>, <p>The 2018 Outback is one vehicle that fulfills many needs. Whether you want a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV that's fuel-efficient, boasts sterling reliability and high <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>, or has impressive levels of inherent safety, the Outback does it all. In places like the Northwest, driving a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a> is almost a requirement.</p>, <p>If you want a rugged wagon with more athletic manners, check out the slightly smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/golf%20alltrack/">Volkswagen Golf Alltrack</a>. If you crave one with premium appeal and a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> badge, look to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/allroad/">Audi Allroad</a> or perhaps a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v60/">Volvo V60</a> Cross Country, both bringing turbocharged engines to the party.</p>, <p>Subaru's Outback gets a nice update for 2018 that includes more sophisticated infotainment systems with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility, revised front exterior styling and updates to the interior. Refinements like sound-insulating glass and retuned suspension make the Outback quieter inside and smoother on the road.</p>, <p>The Outback shares its platform with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/legacy/">Subaru Legacy</a>, so it's of little surprise that it feels like a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> on the open road, albeit one that rides higher off the ground. If anything, that attribute grants it improved ability to absorb bumps and road undulations, if not its ability to corner sharply. The 4-cylinder engine used in the majority of Outback models is merely adequate for acceleration and passing, and its standard continuously variable transmission (CVT) is efficient but won't snap off shifts like a traditional automatic. The 6-cylinder engine on upscale models packs good power but also commands a significantly higher price. The Outback's made-for-adventure appeal isn't just the stuff of commercials. With its 8.7 inches of ground clearance, fantastic all-wheel-drive system and dedicated X-Mode off-road function, the Outback has the chops to take you far beyond the dirt parking lot of the trail head.</p>, <p>X-MODE<br>
 X-Mode is a standard feature of all Outback models. It's designed to help this crossover SUV maintain its composure even under difficult off-road circumstances. On top of that, it includes Hill Descent Control, which takes over braking duties during steep descents.<br>
<br>
 STARLINK INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM<br>
 The Outback's infotainment systems have been upgraded for 2018, with improvements both expected and surprising. In the former camp, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration are now standard. Among the latter, new apps will guide you to everything from birding to parking.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>All Outbacks have a 2-row/5-passenger setup, and one of this Subie's best traits is its interior roominess. There's good legroom in the second row and excellent cargo capacity overall. With rear seats in place, there's 35.5 cubic feet for your gear. Fold the seats and it opens to a huge 73.3 cubic feet of mostly flat, usable space. Up front, the seats are comfortable and well-supported, and the view out is commanding. Controls are easy to see and access. Lower-trim models use cloth, while higher models are outfitted in leather. In Touring trim, the Outback can pass for a premium car.</p>, <p>The latest-gen Outback continues to cross over from a lifted wagon to a crossover SUV. Updates for 2018 embolden the Outback's attitude. Most notable is up front, where the Subaru's hexagonal grille now has the brand's logo and adjoining line spanning the center. The headlights also get a tweak, and available steering-responsive units are now offered. Complementing the Outback's outdoorsy appeal are roof racks and lower body cladding. Even the doorsills seem to demand you get out and get active: They're designed to act as a step so you can access the roof to strap on your bike, canoe or skis.</p>, <p>The Outback comes in four main trims: base, Premium, Limited and Touring. Even the least expensive Outback includes all-wheel drive with X-Mode for off-roading, an automatic transmission, 6-way manual-adjust driver's seat, automatic headlights, cruise control, 17-inch wheels and 6.5-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Bluetooth and Android Auto/Apple CarPlay connectivity. We recommend stepping up at least one level to the Premium, which adds an 8-inch screen, CD player, two more speakers (six total), dual-zone climate control, 10-way-power driver's seat, fog lights, heated front seats and four USB ports, including two in back. It also opens the door for more options.</p>, <p>By climbing trims or checking the options box, you can outfit your Outback with the highly useful safety and driver-assist system known as the EyeSight. The system bundles adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, pre-collision braking and even reverse automatic braking. The available power liftgate has a programmable maximum height, and there's a voice-activated navigation system. Also available is a leather interior trimmed with classy-looking faux wood on Limited models, along with an upgraded harman/kardon audio system.</p>, <p>Subarus use an engine configuration known as a "boxer," where the pistons are parallel to the ground; imagine a "V-type” engine, then widen the V until it’s a flat line. This layout lowers the center of gravity, which aids handling. There are two engines available in the 2018 Outback. The 2.5-liter standard 4-cylinder offers up 175 horsepower, while the 6-cylinder version has a much more robust 256 horsepower. Both send power through a continuously variable automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters for manual control, and all-wheel drive is standard. The AWD system includes X-Mode for low-speed traction, and Active Torque Vectoring for high-speed stability in corners. All 2018 Subaru Outbacks are rated to tow 2,700 pounds.<br>

One trim higher, at $28, 910, you'll get more creature comforts in the Premium trim. A top-line 4-cylinder Outback Touring model starts at $37,405, while a 6-cylinder Outback begins at $36,310 and can reach nearly $40,000 fully loaded. At these prices, the Outback undercuts the starting price of an automatic-transmission VW Golf Alltrack, a similar rugged wagon, and is lower than a more traditional 2-row crossover SUV like the Ford Edge. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sorento/">Kia Sorento</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/santa%20fe%20sport/">Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</a> are closer in line with the Outback's starting price, but they don't come with all-wheel drive (AWD) as standard.

[<p>With a starting price well below $30,000, the all-wheel-drive 2018 Subaru WRX sports sedan is a high-performance bargain. Two models are offered, the 268-horsepower WRX and the 305-horsepower WRX STI, which also gets a gargantuan rear spoiler for increased high-speed stability. Both are visceral and exhilarating, packing turbocharged versions of Subaru’s unique horizontally opposed 4-cylinder engine and a standard 6-speed manual transmission. A CVT automatic transmission is available, but only on the WRX. Updates for 2018 include revised styling, improved handling as well as increased safety and comfort. The WRX competes with the Civic Si sedan and hot hatchbacks like the Volkswagen Golf GTI and Ford Focus ST. The WRX STI does battle with the all-wheel-drive VW Golf R, the Ford Focus RS and the all-new Honda Civic Type R.</p>, <p>Unlike many cars in this class, the new Subaru WRX and STI are a blast to drive, rain, snow or shine, thanks to their sophisticated all-wheel-drive systems. If you like your speed balanced with 4-season usability, room for five and a sizable trunk, you’ll like these turbocharged sedans.</p>, <p>Both the WRX and STI are 4-door sedans. If you want the versatility of a hatchback, check out VW’s Golf GTI and Golf R, and Honda's new Civic Type R. The 305-horsepower WRX STI is also light compared to the 350-horsepower Ford Focus RS, which is also all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>Extensive updates for 2018 include a larger lower front grille, a retuned suspension for improved handing and ride comfort and more sound insulation for a quieter interior. Subaru has also added its EyeSight driver-assist safety technology to the WRX’s option list, and the STI gets 19-inch wheels and tires.</p>, <p>No other engine sounds like Subaru’s turbocharged 4-cylinder and you can hear the WRX’s signature <i>thrum</i> from a few blocks away. The 2.0-liter version in the WRX makes plenty of power and likes to rev to its 6,700-rpm redline. With the standard 6-speed manual transmission, which features tightly spaced gears and a short-throw shifter, it can accelerate to 60 mph in less than 6.0 seconds. The additional power from the STI’s 2.5-liter is obvious from the driver’s seat. It’ll squirt to 60 mph in about 4.7 seconds. Both cars are comfortable enough for the daily commute, but they’re quite visceral. You hear that horizontally opposed engine and feel the road’s surface. If that’s your thing, few cars are this fun to drive. Steering effort is high, but there’s plenty of feel, and the all-wheel-drive system provides astonishing grip for driving around guys in their more expensive German super sedans.</p>, <p>EYESIGHT SAFETY SYSTEMS<br>
 Subaru’s EyeSight Driver Assist Technology is now available on the WRX Limited with the CVT automatic transmission. EyeSight includes Lane Keep Assist, Active Cruise Control and a pre-collision system that will automatically begin braking for you to avoid a potential accident. Surprisingly, EyeSight isn’t available on the more expensive WRX STI.<br>
<br>
DRIVER CONTROLLED CENTER DIFFERENTIAL<br>
 Standard on the WRX STI is an improved version of Subaru’s unique Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD) all-wheel-drive system. With a button on the console, the system allows you to manipulate the center limited-slip differential and dial-in the power distribution between the front and rear wheels for different conditions.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>For 2018 Subaru has upgraded the WRX’s interior materials and added insulation and thicker side glass to keep more noise out. The optional heated Recaro sport seats are comfortable and hold you in place during hard cornering, but their bolsters aren’t overly aggressive. Visibility is excellent and it’s fun to look out over the sedan’s big hood scoop. A tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel is standard. The WRX seats five comfortably, but the Honda Civic Si has more rear legroom. All the controls are simple, well placed and attractive. Cool touches include a flat-bottom steering wheel and red stitching.</p>, <p>This year the WRX has received a larger lower grille that balances well with the sedan’s wide upper grille and functional hood scoop. Both the WRX and the STI get flared fenders, a defused rear bumper and four large exhaust pipes, but only the STI gets 19-inch wheels and the massive rear spoiler, which Subaru says aids downforce and stability. If you want the STI’s horsepower without that basket handle glued to its decklid, an optional “low-profile trunk spoiler” is available on the STI Limited. The STI also gets Brembo brakes with cross-drilled rotors and calipers painted yellow.</p>, <p>Standard features on the 2018 Subaru WRX include all-wheel drive, automatic climate control, cloth upholstery, a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 6.2-inch touch screen, a second 5.9-inch information screen and 17-inch wheels and tires. The STI costs considerably more and gets a significantly longer list of standard amenities including dual-zone climate controls, heated front seats, red seatbelts, LED steering-responsive headlights, auto on/off headlights and a more extensive infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touch screen. Its chassis is also upgraded with larger Brembo brakes with cross-drilled rotors and new 19-inch wheels and summer performance tires.</p>, <p>Several trim levels are available and add equipment accordingly. The WRX Premium gets 18-inch wheels, larger tires, fog lights, a more capable version of Subaru’s Starlink infotainment system with a 7.0-inch touch screen, a power sunroof along with heated front seats, and a windshield-wiper de-icer. The top-line WRX Limited adds push-button start and LED steering-responsive headlights. Optional packages can add a navigation system, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and audio upgrades. We recommend the new Performance Package, which adds power-adjustable Recaro sport seats, aggressive front brake pads for improved performance and red brake calipers.</p>, <p>That hood scoop doesn’t just look cool; it’s functional, feeding air to the intercooler, which cools the intake charge before it enters the WRX’s all-aluminum horizontally opposed 4-cylinder engine. This adds horsepower. In the WRX the engine displaces 2.0 liters and cranks out 268 horsepower at 5,600 rpm thanks to a turbocharger. In the STI the engine grows to 2.5 liters and its output follows, peaking at 305 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. Both engines are backed by a 6-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive, although a CVT automatic transmission is available on the WRX Limited trim level. Unfortunately, fuel economy is not very good. In mixed driving we averaged 16 mpg in an STI and 22 mpg in a WRX. The Subaru’s turbo engine requires premium fuel.<br>

The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starts around $27,500, including $860 for destination and delivery. The Honda Civic Si sedan costs less, but it’s only packing 205 horsepower and front-wheel drive. A WRX Premium with the optional Performance Package is an even stronger value as it has a significantly longer list of equipment and costs about $32,000. A fully loaded WRX Limited with the CVT automatic transmission will easily top $35,000. The more powerful WRX STI starts around $37,000, which is about the same as a new Civic Type R, Golf R or Focus RS. Be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price tool to ensure you get the best deal on your next car. Down the road, 5-year resale values for the 2018 WRX and STI should be topped only by the segment-leading Civic Si.</p>]

[<p>Elon Musk has overpromised and underdelivered with the 2018 Tesla Model 3, the highly anticipated electric sedan that should be rolling out of the Fremont, California, assembly plant at the rate of 5,000 cars per week but isn’t. Production woes aside, the base Model 3, which starts at $36,000 ($35,000 plus a $1,000 delivery charge) and has a range of 220 miles, is enticing -- even if a similarly priced (albeit more compact) 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV has a better range of 238 miles. Oh, and one other problem: The only Tesla Model 3 currently being built is the long-range version (310 miles), with a starting price of about $50,000. Not exactly an EV for the masses as intended.</p>, <p>If you’re smitten by technology and touch screens, if you prefer software updates to tune-ups, and if you like the idea of using electricity instead of fossil fuel, you’ll dig this Tesla.</p>, <p>If you’re thinking you can charge the Model 3 for free using Tesla’s Supercharger network (as you can with the Model S and Model X), think again. You’ll pay each time with the Model 3.</p>, <p>Tesla makes changes to vehicles (sometimes via software updates) whenever needed, not by model year, so it’s tough to say precisely what’s new for the Model 3 in 2018. This much we do know: Only long-range Model 3s (310 miles) with rear-wheel drive are being built right now, followed soon by a long-range dual-motor Model 3 with all-wheel drive. The standard Model 3 -- the one with 220 miles of range and that oft-quoted started starting price of $36,000 -- won’t be available until the end of 2018. Or maybe early 2019. Order online now and be prepared to wait.</p>, <p>With its large battery pack in the low and flat floor, plus a mostly steel chassis, the Model 3 tips the scales at a not-so-svelte 3,900 lb. But with most of that mass being low and between the axles, the Model 3 behaves like a proper sports sedan on a twisty road, aided by minimal body roll and a slightly rear-heavy 48/52 weight distribution. This Tesla is similar in size to a BMW 3 Series, and its single-speed electric motor (with an estimated 220 horsepower) is mounted in back between the driven rear wheels. From the driver’s perspective, the oddest trait of the 2018 Tesla Model 3 is the lack of a conventional instrument panel in front of the steering wheel. Instead, the Model 3 has a 15-inch multifunction touch tablet mounted horizontally atop the center stack and controlling/sharing everything from air conditioning and charging information to the audio and navigation systems. It takes some getting used to this layout, but the speedometer display is easy to read in the top left corner of the screen. Almost no buttons or switches are in sight, apart from window lifts and turn signals. The Model 3’s powertrain is so quiet that road noise from the tires is more pronounced than in other cars. Unlike in, say, the Nissan Leaf, the Model 3’s regenerative brakes aren’t tuned to bring the vehicle to a complete stop when you lift your foot off the accelerator pedal. Nevertheless, the 2018 Tesla Model 3 is pleasant to drive, firm but comfortably suspended and possessing a low cowl that provides a great forward view. What’s more, the panoramic glass roof (part of the optional Premium package) gives the 5-seat Model 3 cabin an airy feel.</p>, <p>OVER-THE-AIR UPDATABILITY<br>
When Tesla recently sought to improve the braking performance of Model 3s already in customer hands, it did so via an over-the-air update to the anti-lock tuning of the brakes. Stopping distances from 60 mph were reduced by nearly 20 feet. Impressive.<br>
<br>
TWIN THUMB SCROLLS<br>
Not a huge deal, but novel: Dual scroll wheels on the spokes of the Model 3’s thick-rimmed steering wheel allow the driver to power-adjust the tilt and telescoping functions while keeping hands on the wheel, right where they should be.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The design of the 2018 Tesla Model 3 interior is minimalist and handsome, almost Scandinavian. We like the symmetry of the dash, and the absence of switches and knobs is almost eerie, making it seem as if something’s missing. The front seats are supportive and offer plenty of headroom, but the 60/40 split rear bench suffers from a lower cushion that lacks support and forces your knees up into your chest.</p>, <p>With the absence of a radiator and a traditional front grille, the Model 3 lets you know right away it’s an EV, and a handsome one at that. This compact new EV sedan stands out from the crowd, highlighted by its low cowl, sweeping aerodynamic roofline, and flush door handles.</p>, <p>Besides standard automatic emergency braking and eight airbags, the 2018 Tesla Model 3 has Wi-Fi and LTE Internet connectivity, voice-activated controls, keyless entry, dual-zone climate control, and a center console with two USB ports. Streaming FM/internet radio is also standard, as is a front trunk just big enough to accept a large piece of carry-on airline baggage.</p>, <p>A $5,000 Premium Upgrades package includes heated 12-way power-adjustable front seats, tinted-glass roof, two rear USB ports, and premium interior materials with handsome open-pore wood trim. The package also includes a more powerful audio system with tweeters, surround speakers and a subwoofer, plus a special center console offering covered storage and docking for two smartphones. In regard to autonomous driving, the 2018 Tesla Model 3 is available right now with a $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package. Promised for later is a Full Self-Driving Capability package that doubles the number of active cameras to eight, but still needs software validation and regulatory approval.</p>, <p>If you open the Model’s 3’s hood, all you’ll see is that handy front trunk. The electric motor, with an estimated 220 horsepower, is nestled between the rear wheels. The long-range Tesla Model 3 being delivered now has a 75-kWh lithium-ion battery; the standard Model 3 coming later is fitted with a 50-kWh pack.<br>

Problem is, the base Model 3 with the promised Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $36,000 is not being built right now. The Model 3 being sold right now is the rear-drive long-range model, which has the $9,000 long-range battery pack and $5,000 Premium interior upgrades that drive the price to $50,000. When you add the $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package and $3,000 Full-Self-Driving Capability, you’re looking at nearly $60,000 before any tax credits.

[<p>Conceived and built in California, the 2018 Tesla Model S is the future of automotive design available for purchase right now. The all-electric Model S is Tesla’s flagship, producing zero emissions and offering a range in excess of 300 miles. The Model S features cutting-edge technology allowing nearly full autonomous driving, as well as more traditional features like all-wheel drive. A pair of electric motors generates massive torque permitting this 4-door hatchback to outrun some of the world’s most prestigious performance cars, yet it costs less than most premium luxury sedans. Those concerned with long-distance travel will be happy to know Tesla has built over 1,100 charging stations in all 48 contiguous states plus parts of Canada, totaling nearly 8,500 superchargers.</p>, <p>If you have the cash to spend on a high-end luxury car, and you want something forward thinking, environmentally friendly and really, really fast, the 2018 Tesla Model S is it. Standard all-wheel drive enhances performance, while autonomous capability allows the Model S to practically drive itself.</p>, <p>If you’re the kind of person always in a hurry, the Model S’s charging time may seem an eternity. Life with an electric takes some compromises, such as limited repair facilities. Some may find the Model S’s touch-screen control panel a bit too much technology.</p>, <p>In keeping with its non-traditional image, Tesla does not do model-year specific upgrades. The base 2018 Model S now has a standard 75-kWh powertrain and all-wheel drive. The unlimited free supercharging offer is reduced to 400 kWh per year, after which the owner must pay a fee.</p>, <p>The top-dog Tesla Model S P100D for 2018 has two driving modes dubbed Sport and Ludicrous. The latter can generate a zero-to-60-mph run in under three seconds, which is insanely fast for any car let alone a $140,000 luxury sedan. However, unlike a traditional car that has its engine up front and power routed to the wheels via a transmission and driveshaft, the Model S has its electric motors affixed directly between the wheels. There’s an odd sensation upon takeoff, with all that speed being generated minus the accompanying growl of a V8 or V12 engine. Once in motion, the Model S proves it’s more than just a one-trick electric pony, delivering a refined ride, excellent steering feel and, thanks in part to its low center of gravity, impressive cornering. Those in the back seat will find headroom a bit snug, but passengers riding up front should have no complaints other than they’re not in the driver’s seat.</p>, <p>LUDICROUS MODE<br>
 Never has there been a more aptly named feature than the 2018 Tesla Model S’s Ludicrous mode. With a push of a button, the electric motors put full power to the wheels generating a neck-snapping zero-to-60-mph run in just 2.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
AUTOPILOT<br>
Using a complex array of cameras, GPS and sensors, the Model S can not only stop and go without input from the driver, it can also steer. The system monitors traffic and events around the car at all time and will alert the driver should he or she need to take control.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The interior of the 2018 Model S is dominated by a massive 17-inch touch screen that takes up most of its dashboard and houses controls for its climate system, all infotainment and vehicle settings. It’s a masterpiece: fast to react, simple to use and beautifully crafted. It’s the benchmark for the industry for in-cabin technology. Actually a hatchback, the Tesla Model S offers a ton of cargo space behind its rear seats. In addition, there's a supplemental front trunk, or "frunk" as Tesla calls it. All seating positions are comfortable, and visibility is excellent. Unfortunately, fit and finish can be inconsistent.</p>, <p>The Tesla’s clean, uncluttered lines debuted back in 2012, and it immediately became one of the most striking cars on the road. It still is. But Tesla has continued to make more upgrades, such as ditching the faux grille. Last year’s refresh saw the sedan get a new look with a more daring grille-less design and revised headlights. It’s a small change, but it makes a big difference. Other highlights like the car’s signature retractable door handles, which emerge when the key is nearby, and its recharging port that's hidden in the taillights, remain unchanged.</p>, <p>The 2018 Tesla Model S luxury EV has power heated front seats, navigation and a rearview camera as standard equipment. All models get collision avoidance with automatic emergency braking, Bluetooth, a power rear hatch, keyless entry, eight airbags, a 7-speaker/200-watt audio system with two USB inputs and a 17-inch touch screen handling climate, entertainment and vehicle controls. It also has the most advanced starter system imaginable: There's no "Start" button -- you simply climb in, shift into gear, and start driving.</p>, <p>Options on the base 75D model include a panoramic glass roof, Nappa leather, high-end audio, and an enhanced version of Tesla’s Autopilot automated driving technology. Buyers can also step up to a Full Self-Driving Capability package. An active air suspension and a Subzero package, which adds a heated steering wheel, heated rear seat, heated washer nozzles and a windshield-wiper de-icer, are also available. An available Premium Package adds a HEPA air-filtration system with a bio-weapons defense mode and leather trim to the interior. Two rear-facing seats can also be added to the cargo area to increase seating capacity to seven.</p>, <p>With the 75D, even the least expensive Tesla Model S has an estimated range of nearly 260 miles thanks to a 75-kWh battery. This model also comes standard with a dual-motor system and all-wheel drive. We expect that the 100D and flagship P100D boast well over 700 horsepower -- although officially Tesla doesn’t offer specific power numbers -- and an estimated range of 335 miles for the 100D and 315 miles for the P100D.<br>

[<p>For 2018, the Tesla Model X continues to be the only fully electric 3-row SUV on the market. Beyond an electric powertrain that can deliver nearly 300 miles on a single charge, the Model X displays a number of unique features that include Falcon Wing rear doors and an autonomous-driving system known as Autopilot. Because electric motors are all about torque and lots of it, the Model X can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in a mere 2.9 seconds. The base Model X 75D can travel up to 237 miles on a charge, the 100D 295 miles and the P100D 289 miles. On the flip side, the Model X is expensive and its interior isn’t as versatile as many gasoline-powered rivals.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a luxury SUV that is truly unique, but that can also accommodate the needs of a family on the go, check out the 2018 Tesla Model X. Its features and speed will delight colleagues and kids alike, and its zero emissions help keep the planet green.</p>, <p>You could fill a traditional car’s gas tank, go have lunch and come back before a Tesla Model X took a full charge, and that’s with a supercharger. A cramped interior and inflexible seats limit the Model X’s versatility.</p>, <p>Other than a slightly lower base price and the deletion of the rear-drive models, the Model X sees no new changes for 2018.</p>, <p>In everyday driving, you’d be hard-pressed to distinguish among the Model X’s three trim levels. The ride is smooth and comfortable, power is abundant and accommodations are fairly comfortable, so long as you’re not jammed into the 3rd-row seat. Responsive steering feedback helps this big-crossover SUV feel a bit smaller and more agile than one would think, making the Model X an easy vehicle to live with. The real thrill in owning a Model X, however, is the instantaneous rush of speed that comes when you put your foot down. On the P100D trim, the available Ludicrous Mode delivers 100 percent of the electric motor’s power to the wheels, delivering a breathtaking zero-to-60-mph run in 2.9 seconds. For about $50,000, the 75D may not be as fast or go as far, but it’s no slouch.</p>, <p>17-INCH INFOTAINMENT SCREEN<br>
 If you’re the type who lives for the next Consumer Electronics Show, the 2018 Model X’s massive 17-inch infotainment screen will have you jumping for joy. Serving as the car’s command center, the tablet-like screen uses a pinch-and-swipe function to control audio, climate and navigation.<br>
<br>
AUTOPILOT<br>
 The Tesla Model X’s Autopilot allows the car to do the braking, accelerating and steering with no input from the driver. A system of GPS, external sensors and numerous cameras permit the vehicle to see traffic and pedestrians. It’s even smart enough to alert the driver if he or she needs to take control.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Inside, the Model X is essentially identical to the Tesla Model S sedan. That means comfort is high, as is material quality, but fit can be inconsistent. It also means the controls for the climate, audio and other functions are electronic and found on a massive 17-inch touch screen that makes up the majority of the dashboard. It’s the largest screen in the business, and it’s fast to react and simple to use. Also unique are the Tesla’s power-operated Falcon Wing doors that open up instead of out. They’ll wow your neighbors but can be frustrating in tight spaces.</p>, <p>Much of the Tesla’s appeal is that it looks like nothing else on the road. Well, except for another Tesla. When viewed from the front, the 2018 Tesla Model X is almost indistinguishable from its sexy sedan brother, the Model S, which is still one of the best-looking cars around. And the family resemblance continues with the SUV’s steep windshield, flush chrome door handles and fastback roofline. However, while the Model S pleases the eyes with a low silhouette and wide stance, when viewed from some angles the Model X looks awkwardly tall and a bit slab-sided.</p>, <p>There’s no such thing as a “stripper” Tesla. The Model X comes very well equipped, even in base 75D configuration. Standard equipment includes all-wheel drive, air suspension, navigation with real-time traffic, LED headlights, power-folding, heated outside mirrors, keyless entry, power Falcon Wing rear doors and a power rear liftgate. Standard is a 2-row configuration that seats five. There’s also an 8-year/infinite-mile warranty on the battery and drive unit as well as a 4-year/50,000-mile limited warranty on the rest of the vehicle. The 100D and P100D models get a few more features, and the P100D comes with Ludicrous Mode for ultimate acceleration.</p>, <p>A third row is optional as are 2nd-row captain’s chairs, so the new Model X can be configured as a 5-, 6- or 7-passenger SUV. Available are a Subzero Weather Package with seat heaters throughout the cabin and a heated steering wheel, an optional 17-speaker audio system, a towing package and a Premium Upgrades Package, which allows the front doors to open automatically as you approach the vehicle, a HEPA air-filtration system with a Bio-weapons Defense Mode and leather interior trim. You can also order Full Self-Driving Capability, which enables the car to drive itself and park itself.</p>, <p>Every 2018 Tesla Model X is powered by two AC electric motors and a lithium-ion battery pack, with either 75 kWh (75D) or 100 kWh (100D and P100D). All three models use the same single-speed transmission and all three models are all-wheel drive. The 100D offers the most driving range, an incredible 295 miles. The 75D can travel 237 miles on a charge. Tesla says charging from a standard 240v 48-amp wall connector will take about eight hours. That quickens to five hours using a 72-amp wall connector and only an hour using one of Tesla’s nationwide Superchargers.<br>

The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the base 75D before federal tax credits but with $1,200 destination fee is $80,700. Step up to the 100D and the price jumps to right around $97,200. And the P100D before options costs a mouth-watering $141,200. Add all the available options to a P100D and your new Tesla Model X will cost about $155,000. Alternatives for fans of electrified SUVs include the Volvo XC90 Plug-In Hybrid, which starts just under $70,000; the Porsche Cayenne Hybrid that costs around $78,000 and the popular Lexus RX Hybrid at about $53,000.

[<p>The 2018 Toyota 4Runner SUV continues its dominance over a rapidly shrinking field of body-on-frame midsize SUVs. Rugged, reliable and highly valued, the 5-7-passenger Toyota 4Runner feels right at home on paved roads, although its ride and handling are nowhere near as good as that of the Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder or GMC Acadia. Then again, none of these competitors can venture to the off-road destinations a 4Runner can access, although they can match or exceed the 4Runner’s 5,000-pound tow rating. And while we admire the 4Runner’s numerous accolades, its aging design precludes it from offering the latest safety and driver-assist features such as forward-collision mitigation and blind-spot monitoring.</p>, <p>If you care more about where your vehicle can take you than how comfortable it is along the way, the 2018 Toyota 4Runner SUV might be worth a test drive. Its standard V6 can tow up to 5,000 pounds, and the optional 3rd-row seat expands the 4Runner’s passenger complement to seven.</p>, <p>If you need an all-wheel-drive SUV that places a premium on safety, comfort and drivability, a GMC Acadia or Honda Pilot makes a better choice. Toyota’s 2018 4Runner isn’t cheap, so if money is a factor, buying a base Jeep Wrangler Unlimited will save you about $6,000.</p>, <p>New for the 2018 Toyota 4Runner are the Wilderness and TRD Enhancement packages. The Wilderness package brings roof-rack crossbars, all-weather floor mats and cargo tray, while the TRD Enhancement adds 17-inch matte-gray off-road wheels and a TRD-stamped aluminum front skidplate.</p>, <p>You’ll get no argument from us that the 2018 Toyota 4Runner drives more like a pickup truck than a car, but that doesn’t mean its ride is unbearable or even uncivilized. Over smooth pavement the 4Runner exhibits good road manners, although its cornering abilities do result in noticeable lean. The 4Runner’s 270-horsepower V6 is a marvelous engine, delivering ample power for passing, merging and towing. Fuel economy, on the other hand, is rather dismal, especially when compared with other midsize SUVs in this class; blame the 5-speed automatic and the 4Runner’s excessive weight. Another weak spot we found is the 4Runner’s brake pedal that at first feels a bit soft, but after applying more pressure, causes the brakes to grab too quickly. Off-road, Toyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV exhibits amazing capabilities. Its narrow body and up to 9.6 inches of ground clearance make it easy to move through rugged trails.</p>, <p>REAR LIFTGATE POWER WINDOW<br>
Toyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV features a power-retractable rear window incorporated into the rear liftgate. Lowering the window allows cargo or gear to more easily be loaded into the cargo bay. Should caked-on dust or mud impede rear visibility, the driver can simply lower the rear window.<br>
<br>
TRD PRO SERIES<br>
The TRD Pro Series equips the 4Runner with Nitto Terra Grappler tires, Bilstein custom off-road shocks and additional skidplating, helping the 4Runner to tackle the most stubborn off-road obstacles. For 2018, a TRD Pro exclusive Calvary Blue paint is offered.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Although rather simple, the 2018 4Runner's cabin is roomy and versatile. The 4Runner's large dials and buttons operating everything from the radio to the low-range gearing are a cinch to use. The large center console has an available 120V AC power outlet, helpful for charging accessories. The power-adjustable front seats are comfortable and supportive. In back, a 40/20/40-split seat offers numerous cargo/seating configurations and reclines. Seven-passenger seating is available in SR5 and Limited trims, though the small third row is best suited for children. Folding the rear seats yields a flat floor and nearly 90 cubic feet of cargo space.</p>, <p>Not much has changed on the outside for the 2018 4Runner. In an effort to give the SUV a "more rugged and aggressive appearance," Toyota has endowed the front fascia with large, boomerang-shaped indentations below the slanted headlights. If that gaping design is a deterrent, know that it doesn't apply to the top-line Limited edition. The rest of the 4Runner successfully carries on the SUV's rugged, boxy shape. We dig the 4-wheel-drive TRD model's hood scoop and additional ground clearance that totals 9.6 inches. All trims feature a standard roof rack.</p>, <p>Toyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV is available in six trims: SR5, SR5 Premium, Limited, TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium and TRD Pro Series. The base SR5 includes Entune Audio Plus with Connected Navigation app and Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth music streaming, rearview camera and an 8-way-power driver's seat. The TRD models, which include 4-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive, add water-resistant seat fabric, locking rear differential, and multi-terrain select with crawl control. Limited models add leather-trimmed seats (heated and ventilated in front), dual-zone climate control, a 15-speaker JBL sound system with navigation, moonroof, X-REAS automatic-adjust suspension, and 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Depending on trim, extras for the Toyota SUV include a 3rd-row seat, 4-wheel drive (4WD), Entune premium audio with navigation, and the helpful sliding rear cargo deck. TRD Off-Road models can be equipped with the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which can disconnect the stabilizer bars to allow more axle travel to help conquer tough terrain.</p>, <p>The sole powertrain combination in Toyota’s 4Runner SUV for 2018 is a 270-horsepower V6 mated to a responsive 5-speed automatic transmission. There are three drivetrain choices: 2-wheel drive (2WD) in the SR5 and Limited, part-time 4WD (SR5 and TRD), or full-time 4WD (Limited) with a limited-slip, locking center differential. Towing is a strong point for the 4Runner, with an SAE J2807-compliant rating of 5,000 pounds. A not-so-strong point is fuel economy, with 2WD models returning a combined 19 mpg and 4WD models rated at 18 mpg combined. Thankfully, the Toyota's V6 drinks regular unleaded.<br>
<br>
 4.0-liter V6 engine<br>

 278 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 17/21 mpg (2WD), 17/20 mpg (4WD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Toyota’s 2018 4Runner SUV has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $35,500 for a base 2WD SR5 model. TRD models begin closer to $38,500 and Limited models start around $43,750. The TRD Pro Series starts close to $43,700. At its starting price, the 4Runner costs more than the Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer and Kia Sorento, though those three are car-based crossover SUVs not meant for serious off-roading. The Jeep Wrangler Unlimited is a more like-minded competitor, but again, all have starting prices several thousand dollars below that of the 4Runner. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Toyota. In long-term value, the 4Runner is a Best Resale Value Award winner, with predicted residuals near those of the stellar Jeep Wrangler.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/toyota/86/2018
[<p>A small, lightweight coupe, the affordable 2018 Toyota 86 is a favorite with young driving enthusiasts eager to explore the limits of its well-balanced rear-wheel-drive chassis. With a 205-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, the new Toyota 86 is no muscle car, but it’s quick and it comes standard with a 6-speed manual transmission which is perfectly in character for the little sports car. Marketed as the Scion FR-S until last year, the 86 is now the only real performance car and the only 2-door model in Toyota’s expansive lineup. The "86" name is an homage to the car's spiritual ancestor, the mid-1980s’ Toyota Corolla GT-S, affectionately known to fans by its internal model designation, AE86, or <i>hachiroku</i> in Japanese. The fun-to-drive 4-seater competes directly with the Subaru BRZ, which is its virtual twin both visually and mechanically, and the Mazda Miata.</p>, <p>If you like to drive you’ll like the 2018 Toyota 86. It’s quick and its rear-wheel-drive chassis is unique in a sea of front-wheel-drive hatchbacks like the VW Golf GTI and Ford Focus ST. Its 205 horsepower doesn’t sound like much, but it’s enough to drift the coupe around corners. This is a fun car to toss around.</p>, <p>There are quicker, faster and more powerful cars available for the money including hot hatchbacks like the VW Golf GTI and American muscle cars like the Ford Mustang. Also, unless you’re a hardcore enthusiast, the Toyota’s stiff suspension and loud interior are not to be listed in the “good” column.</p>, <p>After a long list of changes and improvements last year, updates to the 2018 Toyota 86 are few but significant and include a new GT trim level with leather upholstery and a few other features, and a top-of-the-line trim level called the 86 Black. Both are available with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Prices start just over $29,000.</p>, <p>For the enthusiast looking for affordable daily street thrills and the occasional track-day superstar, the new 2018 Toyota 86 is still a tough act to beat. With 205 horsepower, the small, lightweight coupe isn’t going to blaze its rear tires or out-drag a V8-powered Camaro or Mustang, but it’s quick, hitting 60 mph in about 6.2 seconds and it’s fun to throw gears at the 2.0-liter engine’s lofty 7,000-rpm redline. In the corners, the rear-wheel-drive Toyota is well-balanced, and it has a tossability that's rare in today's cars. The taut suspension lets you carry speed into a corner unlike nearly anything at this price point, and Toyota’s steering is well-weighted, properly quick and it offers excellent feel. On the other side of the coin the Toyota 86 can be a bit crude doing the daily life thing. For hardcore enthusiasts it’s perfect, but the casual driver may find the 86 to be noisy and its ride a bit rough.</p>, <p>TRACK MODE<br>
 A unique feature of the Toyota’s electronic Vehicle Stability Control system, Track mode loosens the system’s parameters, allowing the driver more wheel slip and yaw angle before it steps in to get you back on the proper line. It’s engaged by holding the “Track” button down for one second. There’s also a Full-Off mode, which puts the driver in complete control.<br>
<br>
 FOLD-DOWN REAR SEAT<br>
 Every 2018 Toyota 86 comes with a fold-down rear seat to expand the capacity of the coupe’s small 6.9-cubic-foot trunk. With it folded the 86 can carry two sets of golf clubs or, more importantly, it can haul a jack, tools and an extra set of wheels and tires to the racetrack.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>There’s a small back seat, but the 2018 Toyota 86 is essentially a 2-seater. The good news is that the rear seat folds flat to expand the trunk. Unlike a Mazda Miata, the Toyota can carry two golf bags or it can get your extra set of wheels and tires to the racetrack. Seat comfort is good and the low seating position is perfect for this sporty coupe. The faux-suede upholstery is grippy so you don’t slide around when you’re driving hard. Control placement is perfect and the tachometer is right where it should be, center-mounted just as it is in the Porsche 911.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota 86 isn’t just a mechanical twin to the Subaru BRZ, but the two look nearly identical as well, with only small differences in front-end styling and trim. We like its long, low hood and extra-low stance, which are meant to recall the legendary Toyota 2000 GT of 1967, and the simplicity and tidy proportions of the design keep it from looking like it fell out of a <i>Fast and Furious</i> movie. There aren't any giant wings, huge scoops or obtuse flares over the fenders, but don't worry; there’s an ample aftermarket that can supply those accessories if you're so inclined.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota 86 may be the easiest car to buy in Toyota's lineup. There are only two trim levels. The base model includes air conditioning, cruise control, one-touch power windows, power mirrors and door locks. There are also 17-inch alloy wheels, Bluetooth and a touch-screen audio system that includes a rearview camera, plus auxiliary and USB inputs. The standard transmission -- and one you should stick with -- is a 6-speed manual. The GT and Black trim levels get dual-zone climate control, push-button start and a display with a g-meter. For safety, the Toyota 86 features stability control, traction control and six airbags.</p>, <p>The only factory option on the 2018 Toyota 86, beyond color choice, is the 6-speed automatic transmission, a pretty good unit that includes steering-wheel-mounted paddles for rev-matching downshifts. Still, stick with the stick. Other factory options are listed as accessories, and include an upgraded audio system with navigation. The GT trim level gets some exterior upgrades like LED fog lights, and the 86 Black get blacked-out mirrors and rear wing supports. For enthusiasts, the real news is the extensive list of TRD performance gear you can add, including lowering springs, a quick-shift kit, anti-roll bars, larger wheels and more, all while keeping the factory warranty.</p>, <p>There is only one engine in the 2018 Toyota 86, a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed 4-cylinder engine engineered and supplied by Subaru. It puts out 205 horsepower in manual-transmission cars and 200 horsepower with the automatic. The engine in manual cars also gets a flatter torque curve which improves responsiveness. "Horizontally opposed" means the cylinders are parallel to the ground, lowering the center of gravity and helping the Toyota 86 feel more nimble. Those thinking of the TRD shift kit may like the shorter throws, but we think it hurts the overall feel. And skip the 6-speed automatic; the paddle shifters are fine, and you get better fuel economy, but the new 86 is simply more fun to drive with the manual.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter flat-4 (manual transmission)<br>

 156 lb-ft of torque @ 6,400 rpm<br>

 151 lb-ft of torque @ 6,400 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/32 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Prices for the 2018 Toyota 86 jump off with a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) just over $27,000 when you include the $895 destination charge. Throw in about $900 for the navigation system, and note that the automatic transmission only adds $720 to the price, although you should still skip it. The better-equipped 2018 Toyota 86 GT and the top Black trim level both start just over $29,000 with the manual transmission. These prices make the little Toyota sports car easily competitive with the Mazda Miata, and even low-end models of the Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang, although the last two aren't nearly as fun to drive. The Subaru BRZ costs slightly less. Whatever you do, check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their 2018 Toyota 86, which holds its value well.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Avalon is the automaker's flagship sedan, the larger, plusher brother to the Camry. The Avalon appeals to those who want a full-size sedan with presence, a roomy interior, impressive safety features and a ride quality that favors comfort over athleticism. Unlike the Chevrolet Impala, the Avalon comes standard with a V6 engine, and it stands apart from sportier rivals like the Nissan Maxima and Dodge Charger with a hybrid version that attains up to 40 mpg. While facing the same headwinds as other rivals -- buyers favoring crossover SUVs to large sedans -- the 2018 Avalon remains among the best of its kind thanks to its reputation for reliability, efficiency and Lexus-like refinement at a Toyota price.</p>, <p>If you're looking for a comfortable, full-size sedan with the latest features and a proven track record, all at a price that's only slightly above that of a well-equipped midsize sedan, the Avalon still holds plenty of appeal. The Avalon hybrid checks another box with its 40-mpg fuel economy.</p>, <p>Toyota still hasn't embraced Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration, so if you want either in your next vehicle, shop elsewhere. If you want V8 power or an all-wheel-drive full-size sedan, look to the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger or Buick LaCrosse.</p>, <p>After last year's update to include the Toyota Safety Sense-P (TSS-P) suite of driver assists, the Avalon carries over unchanged for 2018 except for variations to some trim names. For example, the former XLE Touring trim simply becomes Touring.</p>, <p>The latest Avalon sedan hasn't strayed far from the formula that has worked so well for over two decades: Provide driver and passengers a comfortable, quiet, plush experience. While most at home on the highway, the Avalon is easy to handle in the city and confined settings; it feels smaller than its size suggests. Power from the V6 is impressive. While the all-new V6 Camry now has more horsepower, the Avalon remains strong. It smoothly and effortlessly accelerates on freeway onramps, and has good oomph for passing. A Sport mode quickens throttle response and stiffens the steering feel. The Avalon is no corner-carver, but the Touring model has its own suspension system that offers more athletic handling. Unlike the buttery 6-speed automatic of the standard model, the hybrid Avalon has a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that can drone but helps this full-size Toyota sedan achieve fuel economy equated with an economy car.</p>, <p>PREMIUM FEATURES, MAINSTREAM PRICE<br/> Take the badge off an Avalon, and you might think you're in a Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand. In addition to its velvety V6 and hushed ride, the Avalon coddles with leather interior, heated front seats and nice touches like wood-grain interior trim.<br/> <br/> TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE-P<br/> Standard in every new Avalon is the Toyota Safety Sense-P suite. It includes an array of active-safety and driver-assist features such as pre-collision warning with automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, radar-based adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams and lane-departure alert with steering assist.</p>, <p>Step inside the 2018 Avalon and two traits immediately stand out: The first is that it's roomy, and the second is that it's lush and sophisticated. Roominess is most apparent in the rear, where passengers have 39.2 inches of legroom, over an inch more than the Camry. The front seats are supportive and comfortable, and the armrest between driver and passenger provides good separation. The flush, angular central display and capacitive touch switches look high-tech, but are mercifully quite easy to use. At 16 cubic feet, the Avalon's trunk is huge, with hybrid models only losing 2 cubic feet to their battery.</p>, <p>The 2018 Avalon’s athletic stance and sculpted bodywork were conceived by Toyota’s famed Southern California-based Calty Design studio. The forward-raked C-pillar and sweeping roofline impart an almost coupe-like silhouette. Although it seems counterintuitive, this aggressive design actually improves rear-seat headroom. The headlights incorporate a pair of stylish square-shaped projector lenses, which Toyota calls Quadrabeams. The massive maw that is the Avalon's grille will likely be a love-it-or-hate-it affair. The rest of this Toyota sedan's contemporary appeal is finished off with 17-inch or optional 18-inch alloy wheels, LED taillights and dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>The Avalon sedan is offered in XLE, XLE Plus, XLE Premium, Touring and Limited trims with hybrid variants available in XLE Plus, XLE Premium and Limited. In base form, the Avalon includes the Toyota Safety Sense-P system (see Favorite Features), leather interior with heated and power-adjustable front seats, heated outside mirrors, rearview camera, smart-key access with push-button start, dual-zone climate control and a 7-inch infotainment system with AM/FM//HD Radio/CD player, Bluetooth connectivity and two USB inputs. While the Avalon can connect to iPhones and Android devices, it does not support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, offering instead various apps and Siri Eyes Free.</p>, <p>Options are mainly tied to trims, and stepping up to XLE Plus brings enhancements like a moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror and universal garage remote. XLE Premium trims include Toyota's Entune audio system with navigation, Qi-compatible wireless phone charging, driver's-seat memory and blind-spot monitoring. Avalon Touring models have a sportier suspension and 18-inch wheels, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters and LED headlights. The top-line Avalon Limited is loaded with perforated leather seats with heating and ventilation in front, power-operated rear window shade, high-intensity-discharge (HID) headlights, rear-seat climate controls and heated rear seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and JBL audio system.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Avalon sedan gets its motivation from the tried-and-true 3.5-liter V6 or Atkinson-cycle 2.5-liter 4-cylinder hybrid powerplant. The conventional engine churns out a healthy 268 horsepower through a 6-speed automatic gearbox, while the hybrid system's 200 total horsepower is transmitted via a gearless continuously variable transmission. Similar to a Prius or Toyota Camry Hybrid, the Avalon Hybrid doesn't require you to plug the car in to charge it. The whole system is self-contained, self-managed and seamless. If not for the hybrid badges and slightly slower acceleration than the V6 model, many drivers might not even know it uses both a gasoline engine and an electric motor to move. All Avalons are front-wheel drive. All also feature Eco, Normal and Sport driving modes.<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6<br/> 268 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br/> 248 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/30 mpg<br/> <br/> 2.5-liter inline-4 + electric motor (Avalon hybrid)<br/> 200 net hybrid system horsepower<br/> Engine: 156 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm<br/> Battery: 199 lb-ft of torque @ 0-1,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 40/39 mpg</p>, <p>The 2018 Avalon has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $34,395, including destination, for an XLE model. Each successive trim is about $1,500 more. The top-line Avalon Limited is just over $42,000. The 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid starts at $38,395 and reaches $43,695 in top form. The Avalon starts higher than the base Chevy Impala, even when the Impala is optioned with the V6, engine. It is also higher than the Kia Cadenza, and slightly above the Nissan Maxima, Chrysler 300 and Buick LaCrosse. Before buying, do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Toyota sedan. While the Avalon has higher starting prices than competitors, it's predicted to hold its value better than most. In fact, it took second place in this year's Kelley Blue Book Best Resale Value Awards, only behind the Nissan Maxima in its segment.</p>]

At 16 cubic feet, the Avalon's trunk is huge, with hybrid models only losing 2 cubic feet to their battery.</p>, <p>The 2018 Avalon’s athletic stance and sculpted bodywork were conceived by Toyota’s famed Southern California-based Calty Design studio. The forward-raked C-pillar and sweeping roofline impart an almost coupe-like silhouette. Although it seems counterintuitive, this aggressive design actually improves rear-seat headroom. The headlights incorporate a pair of stylish square-shaped projector lenses, which Toyota calls Quadrabeams. The massive maw that is the Avalon's grille will likely be a love-it-or-hate-it affair. The rest of this Toyota sedan's contemporary appeal is finished off with 17-inch or optional 18-inch alloy wheels, LED taillights and dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets.</p>, <p>The Avalon sedan is offered in XLE, XLE Plus, XLE Premium, Touring and Limited trims with hybrid variants available in XLE Plus, XLE Premium and Limited. In base form, the Avalon includes the Toyota Safety Sense-P system (see Favorite Features), leather interior with heated and power-adjustable front seats, heated outside mirrors, rearview camera, smart-key access with push-button start, dual-zone climate control and a 7-inch infotainment system with AM/FM//HD Radio/CD player, Bluetooth connectivity and two USB inputs. While the Avalon can connect to iPhones and Android devices, it does not support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, offering instead various apps and Siri Eyes Free.</p>, <p>Options are mainly tied to trims, and stepping up to XLE Plus brings enhancements like a moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror and universal garage remote. XLE Premium trims include Toyota's Entune audio system with navigation, Qi-compatible wireless phone charging, driver's-seat memory and blind-spot monitoring. Avalon Touring models have a sportier suspension and 18-inch wheels, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters and LED headlights. The top-line Avalon Limited is loaded with perforated leather seats with heating and ventilation in front, power-operated rear window shade, high-intensity-discharge (HID) headlights, rear-seat climate controls and heated rear seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and JBL audio system.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Avalon sedan gets its motivation from the tried-and-true 3.5-liter V6 or Atkinson-cycle 2.5-liter 4-cylinder hybrid powerplant. The conventional engine churns out a healthy 268 horsepower through a 6-speed automatic gearbox, while the hybrid system's 200 total horsepower is transmitted via a gearless continuously variable transmission. Similar to a Prius or Toyota Camry Hybrid, the Avalon Hybrid doesn't require you to plug the car in to charge it. The whole system is self-contained, self-managed and seamless. If not for the hybrid badges and slightly slower acceleration than the V6 model, many drivers might not even know it uses both a gasoline engine and an electric motor to move. All Avalons are front-wheel drive. All also feature Eco, Normal and Sport driving modes.<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6<br/> 268 horsepower @ 6,200 rpm<br/> 248 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/30 mpg<br/> <br/> 2.5-liter inline-4 + electric motor (Avalon hybrid)<br/> 200 net hybrid system horsepower<br/> Engine: 156 lb-ft of torque @ 4,500 rpm<br/> Battery: 199 lb-ft of torque @ 0-1,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 40/39 mpg</p>, <p>The 2018 Avalon has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $34,395, including destination, for an XLE model. Each successive trim is about $1,500 more. The top-line Avalon Limited is just over $42,000. The 2018 Toyota Avalon Hybrid starts at $38,395 and reaches $43,695 in top form. The Avalon starts higher than the base Chevy Impala, even when the Impala is optioned with the V6, engine. It is also higher than the Kia Cadenza, and slightly above the Nissan Maxima, Chrysler 300 and Buick LaCrosse. Before buying, do check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Toyota sedan. While the Avalon has higher starting prices than competitors, it's predicted to hold its value better than most. In fact, it took second place in this year's Kelley Blue Book Best Resale Value Awards, only behind the Nissan Maxima in its segment.</p>]

[<p>The Toyota Camry is all-new for 2018, ushering in its eighth generation and 35th year in existence. For its latest act, Toyota's iconic midsize sedan has reinvented itself with bold new looks and athletic manners. The latter narrows or nullifies the fun-to-drive gap that once existed between the Camry and its Honda Accord archrival, all without sacrificing the Toyota's reputation for comfort, convenience and ease of use. The Camry remains available with 4- or 6-cylinder engines and as a gasoline-electric hybrid, all of which have been revamped for admirable power and efficiency. The Camry's driving manners have never been better, but Toyota's reluctance to integrate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto could be a chink in the Camry's otherwise impenetrable armor.</p>, <p>If you want a midsize sedan with a sterling reputation for reliability, satisfaction and ease of use, the Camry continues to fit the bill. The latest version of this Toyota sedan further benefits from an impressive roster of standard safety features and driving aids, plus enhanced power and efficiency.</p>, <p>If your next new car must have Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration, look elsewhere. While every other major automaker has gotten on board with Apple and Google's systems, Toyota is going its own route with its Entune infotainment setup.</p>, <p>The Toyota Camry sedan is all-new for 2018. Now in its eighth generation and 35th model year, the latest Camry emphasizes style and better driving dynamics. A variety of trims and three powertrains are available: the standard 4-cylinder, a powerful V6, and a hybrid that earns over 50 mpg.</p>, <p>For as long as we can remember, the Toyota Camry has been comfortable and compliant, but not exactly invigorating to drive. It was essentially the vanilla ice cream of family sedans. That changes with the new Camry. A double-wishbone rear suspension, lower center of gravity and stiffer body structure with a 30-percent increase in torsional rigidity translate to a more dynamic and ultimately fun-to-drive experience. The 2018 Camry feels tauter than the outgoing model, and the steering is more precise. The new 8-speed automatic transmission is a solid partner and in some models can even be shifted via paddles. The standard 4-cylinder engine that powers the majority of Camrys will suffice for most buyers and has a satisfying blend of performance and efficiency. The optional V6, now making over 300 horsepower, can easily chirp the front tires. Our surprise favorite is the Camry Hybrid (see Favorite Features).</p>, <p>CAMRY HYBRID<br>
Given Toyota's massive success with the Prius hybrid, it's no surprise the latest gasoline-electric Camry Hybrid is better than ever. The new version has a fuel-economy rating of up to 53 mpg, packs more power than the standard 4-cylinder model and is satisfying to drive. It's the best of all worlds.<br>
<br>
TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P (TSS-P)<br>
The 2018 Camry has an impressive suite of safety and driving aids. More impressive is that it's standard. Even the lowest-priced model has dynamic radar cruise control, the ability to detect pedestrians or objects and apply the brakes, keep the vehicle from drifting in lanes and automatically adjust the high beams.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Camry's 5-passenger interior didn't get quite the extreme makeover as its exterior, and that's perfectly fine. The cabin carries over its best traits: roominess, comfort and easy-to-use controls. Regarding controls, small touches like placing the tune/scroll audio knob directly below the volume knob make a big difference. Likewise, the steering-wheel-mounted controls are easy to see and use. Most models have only one USB port, while higher trims are better-stocked with three. Even the standard 7-inch touch screen looks good. In lieu of navigation via CarPlay or Android Auto, Toyota offers its Scout GPS Link App.</p>, <p>Toyota continues to up its game with the Camry's exterior style, and this newest model is its most daring yet. From front to back, the new Camry aims to show off its newfound athleticism and attitude. Its large front grille is hard to miss, and the Camry's new, 1.6-inch-lower aluminum hood shows off interesting creases. One of the most surprising features is found on the sporty XSE models, which boast four -- count 'em four! -- chrome exhaust tips. One of the most distinguishing style elements is the 2-tone Midnight Black Metallic roof, also only available on XSE models.</p>, <p>The 2018 Camry’s lineup consists of L, LE, SE, XSE and XLE, with SE and XSE the sportier pair. The least expensive 2018 Toyota Camry L is a solid buy that includes automatic transmission, 6-way-manually adjustable front seats, the TSS-P suite of safety and driving aids, and an infotainment system that bundles a rearview camera and 6-speaker AM/FM audio system with Bluetooth and USB/auxiliary inputs. For $500 more, we recommend the LE as it includes a power driver's seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats, alarm system and 17-inch alloy wheels. Toyota Care (two years/25,000 miles of complimentary maintenance and 24/7 roadside assistance) is standard.</p>, <p>SE models have sportier exterior aesthetics, 18-inch wheels, paddle shifters, sport front seats and sport-tuned suspension. XSE and XLE models have dual-zone climate control, 7-inch configurable instrument display and 8-inch central touch screen, leather seats, selectable drive modes (Eco, Normal, Sport), blind-spot monitoring, panoramic glass roof with moonroof, and electric parking brake. Among the various options are JBL premium audio system with navigation, bird's-eye camera, Qi-compatible wireless phone-charging cradle and head-up display. The standard Entune 3.0 infotainment system has built-in Wi-Fi, and while it lacks CarPlay or Android Auto integration, it does offer Siri Eyes Free and Google voice control.</p>, <p>Three powertrains remain available, and all have been revamped. Most popular is the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that now boasts 203 horsepower (206 in XSE models) and earns up to 41 mpg. The most powerful Camry is the V6, now packing 301 horsepower. Both of those engines are mated to a new 8-speed automatic transmission. The 2018 Camry Hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor for enviable fuel economy of up to 53 mpg. Camry Hybrid LE models actually use a pricier lithium-ion pack, while the higher-trim Camry Hybrid SE and XLE variants use a nickel-metal hydride battery. Toyota reps say the rational for this has to do with fuel-efficiency goals and pricing strategy. All Camrys are front-wheel drive.<br>

The V6 Camry, only available in XLE and XSE trim, begins over $35,000, and the new Hybrid is $28,685. At these prices, the Camry is in line with a comparably equipped Honda Accord.

---------http://www.kbb.com/toyota/c-hr/2018
[<p>The 2018 Toyota C-HR is the company's first foray into the hotly contested subcompact-SUV segment. Competing with the likes of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/hr-v/">Honda HR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-3/">Mazda CX-3</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/compass/">Jeep Compass</a> and others, the C-HR brings unique styling, a roomy interior, good handling, and a surprising level of standard high-tech safety equipment. Left on the cutting-room floor were all-wheel drive and, more importantly, infotainment tech like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It's an interesting play: Will millennials -- the new C-HR's target audience -- be attracted to an unusually styled <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a> that lacks all-wheel drive and those tech options? Or will competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/soul/">Kia Soul</a> prove more satisfying? Time will tell, but there's no doubt that the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/c-hr/">Toyota C-HR</a>'s charms are as noteworthy as its peculiar shortcomings.</p>, <p>Like it or not, the 2018 C-HR is long on style, and it's sure to be a hit with attention-seekers everywhere. The roomy and comfortable interior extends to the back seat, strong points for a class defined by compact dimensions. The handling and ride might surprise you.</p>, <p>Outlandish styling cuts both ways, and the C-HR's lines could turn some buyers off. The engine struggles against the mass of this surprisingly heavy small SUV. Lastly, the lack of Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or even <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a>'s Entune infotainment suite could leave buyers who are dependent on that technology cold.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota C-HR is an all-new vehicle for Toyota. Originally conceived for the now-defunct <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/scion/">Scion</a> brand, Toyota builds the C-HR off the same underpinnings as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius/">Toyota Prius</a> and the upcoming new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry/">Toyota Camry</a>.</p>, <p>Around Texas hill country north of Austin, two things became clear about the way the Toyota C-HR gets around. First, the talk of tuning the suspension on European roads is more than talk, as the new C-HR offers a ride-and-handling combination that we usually associate with higher-end European brands. Comfortably firm around town and on the highway, the C-HR can carry a remarkable amount of its speed through a corner, with even a satisfying little bit of rotation from the rear. It's fun, complemented by solid brakes and steering that makes up for its lack of feel with linear response and good weight. Sadly, it's let down by the drivetrain, a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder with 144 horsepower routed through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). At full throttle, the engine noisily struggles to move the 3,300-pound C-HR, and the transmission's manual mode isn't much help.</p>, <p>STANDARD TSS-P<br>
 This bundle of safety technology includes a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams, and full-range active cruise control. The system is also standard on every 2018 C-HR, handily out-equipping many of its rivals that don't even offer similar systems.<br>
<br>
 INTERIOR SPACE<br>
 The C-HR is built off the same underpinnings as the next-generation Toyota Camry, and it puts this to its benefit with a surprisingly roomy interior. Not only do front passengers get good space, but rear seaters -- often neglected in this segment -- have ample leg- and headroom.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Interior style on the C-HR is notably more subdued than the exterior, with only the diamond pattern on the dash, doors and headliner reflective of the exterior styling storm. The speedometer and tachometer are separated by a small color information screen, and a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system floats above the climate controls. The cloth-covered manual front seats offer good comfort and support, and it was easy to find a good driving position. The rear seats offer ample leg- and headroom for tall passengers, but the claustrophobia-inducing rear pillars are so thick that passengers have to lean forward to look outside.</p>, <p>Insect-like, angular, diamond-themed, or just plain weird, there's no shortage of opinion on the new C-HR exterior. The squinting headlights and angled roof, nose, doors and hood evoke the even more outrageous Prius. From the rear, a roof extension hovers over the rear glass, and the taillights project outward from the bodywork, sure to be an expensive repair when they're eventually cracked. The style is very color-dependent: In more neutral tones like gray and silver, the C-HR looks quite good from most angles. However, the R-Code option -- which paints the roof white on some models -- is an acquired taste.</p>, <p>Prices for the 2018 Toyota C-HR XLE start higher than its competition, but it makes up for that with a generous amount of standard equipment. There are auto up-down windows on all four positions, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Bluetooth and USB inputs, and even an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The electronic parking brake includes a brake-hold feature for traffic, and there are 10 airbags. On top of that, there's the Toyota Safety Sense P suite, which adds a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert with steering assist, full-range active cruise control, and more.</p>, <p>The only stand-alone option for the C-HR is the R-Code, which adds a white roof to certain colors of the subcompact SUV. For more than the standard features you need to step up to the XLE Premium, which adds nicer fabric on the seats, push-button ignition and keyless entry, fog lights, and puddle lights that project "Toyota C-HR" on the ground under the outside mirrors. The XLE Premium also gets blind-spot monitoring. However, note that there is no factory navigation system available, nor is the C-HR available with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or even Toyota's in-house Entune system.</p>, <p>There's only one engine available in the 2018 Toyota C-HR, and unfortunately it's not up to the task of hauling around this 3,300 pound crossover SUV. It’s a new engine, with 2.0 liters and 144 horsepower routed to the front wheels through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). However the C-HR struggles under acceleration. The transmission has a Manual mode, but it really isn't any help, and neither is the Sport driving mode. Despite its SUV label the C-HR is only available with front-wheel drive. Fuel-economy projections are good though, with Toyota estimating an EPA highway fuel economy of about 31 mpg, and 27 mpg in the city.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter inline-4<br>
144 horsepower @ 6,100 rpm<br>
139 lb-ft of torque @ 3,900 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/31 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Toyota C-HR XLE starts at $23,460, including the $960 destination charge. That gets you a very nicely equipped <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">compact SUV</a>, with lots of standard features including TSS-P. However, if you want blind-spot monitoring, fog lights and keyless ignition, you'll need to step up to the $25,310 XLE Premium. Considering the XLE is equipped more like the mid-level models of its competitors, we think the prices are competitive against the likes of the Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3 and especially the Kia Soul, which we think is the C-HR's most direct competitor. Whatever you decide, be sure to check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new C-HR. As for resale, it's too early to tell, but Toyotas generally fare very well.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Corolla compact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> may not be the fastest or most technologically advanced <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small car</a> you can buy, but its dedication to value, economy and comfort is unsurpassed. For the money, Toyota’s 2018 Corolla sedan offers a spacious cabin wrapped in an attractive body, and a list of unrivaled standard safety features including adaptive cruise control, pre-collision warning and automatic high-beam headlights. A wide model range offers something for everyone, although the Corolla’s standard 1.8-liter won’t impress like the turbocharged engines in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a> or VW Golf, and its driving dynamics are no match for competitors like the Mazda3 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/cruze/">Chevrolet Cruze</a>. High-tech fans won’t be happy with the omission of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, either.</p>, <p>Toyota’s 2018 Corolla makes a great first car, but even longtime drivers will appreciate the Corolla’s exceptional value. From its low price to its fuel-efficient engine to its impressive list of standard safety and driver-assist features, the Corolla compact sedan checks all the right boxes.</p>, <p>If you can’t live without high-tech features like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, you won’t be happy with the 2018 Toyota Corolla’s audio setup. Those seeking an aggressive driving attitude won’t find much excitement here, nor will speed demons. <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">Hatchback</a> fans will have to look to the smaller Corolla iM.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a> compact sedan carries over with no changes of note. The 50th Anniversary trim is discontinued.</p>, <p>Driving enthusiasts aside, most people will find much to like about the 2018 Toyota Corolla sedan. The ride is soft without excessive wallowing, and the steering is surprisingly responsive with good on-center feel. Visibility is also a Corolla strong point, as are its comfortable and supportive front seats. While it can’t compare with the Mazda3 or Honda Civic for performance, the 2018 Corolla SE trim does offer a bit more athleticism thanks to a sportier suspension setup and 6-speed manual-transmission option. A 132-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine is standard on all but the LE Eco model, which gets a slight bump to 140 horses. This setup won’t encourage any daring passing maneuvers, but at least the CVT automatic makes the most of what little power is on tap while maximizing fuel economy. There is a lot of noise at full-throttle, however, but otherwise the Corolla’s cabin is surprisingly quiet.</p>, <p>STANDARD <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">TOYOTA</a> SAFETY SENSE-P<br/> No other compact car offers the standard safety equipment found in the 2018 Toyota Corolla. The Safety Sense-P suite includes pre-collision warning and pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning and assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams. Better still, the system is standard on every trim level.<br/> <br/> INTERIOR DESIGN<br/> For an entry-level compact, Toyota’s 2018 Corolla sedan offers a rather pleasing interior. An elegant dash design is bolstered by an extensive use of soft-touch materials and quality plastics throughout the roomy and comfortable cabin.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Corolla interior may be short on pizazz, but it's quiet, comfortable and gets the job done. The modern dash design features round air vents, a user-friendly climate-control interface, updated infotainment system, improved and more legible gauges, and a multi-information display. The Corolla’s front seats are comfortable and supportive, and the rear seats are surprisingly roomy, even for tall passengers. Even with the new features everything is easy to use and see, and there's good cargo space with split-folding rear seatbacks to help with longer objects.</p>, <p>The 2018 Corolla offers two different exterior designs, reflecting the new model lineup. The L, LE, XLE and LE Eco offer a nose-and-tail treatment that's distinct from the sportier SE and XSE models. Yet both offer similarities. There are standard LED headlights, with a 2-element version on the SE-type Corollas. The SE-based models also get vertically styled front vents and LED fog lights, plus all-red taillights, while LE-type models use subtle cues, such as 2-color taillights, to look a little more upscale. </p>, <p>We've already mentioned the array of active-safety systems now standard on even the base 2018 Toyota Corolla L. Beyond that the Corolla L offers LED headlights, a rearview camera with path projection, air conditioning, cruise control, and tilt-telescope steering wheel with audio and Bluetooth controls on the spokes. There's a USB port for phone recharging and audio integration, and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display audio system that includes Toyota's Entune multimedia bundle and Siri Eyes Free, although Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren't available at all. The 6-way-adjustable driver's seat and the rest of the interior are upholstered in comfortable cloth.</p>, <p>Corolla LE models get automatic climate control, a multi-information display (MID) between the gauges, and nicer interior trim. The XLE and XSE get faux-leather seating surfaces and an 8-way-power driver's seat, nicer instrumentation with a color MID, and push-button start and keyless entry. If you want a "sporty" Corolla, the SE can be equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission. SE models are generally equipped a little better than LE models, offering a color MID among other things. XLE, XSE and SE manual Corollas get a standard 7-inch infotainment system, which can be upgraded with an integrated navigation system.</p>, <p>There are two versions of the same 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine for Toyota’s 2018 Corolla. The one used in nearly all models offers 132 horsepower, routing it through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), or in the case of the SE, an available 6-speed manual transmission. The Corolla LE Eco offers a 140-horsepower version of the same engine, but it's no hot rod, instead being tuned for better fuel economy. Fuel economy is good, especially the Eco getting up to 40 mpg on the highway, but these days that's par for the course instead of class-leading. Some 2018 models may show slightly lower fuel-economy numbers due to changes in EPA testing.<br>
<br>
 1.8-liter inline-4 (L, LE and S)<br>
 132 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br>
 128 lb-ft of torque @ 4,400 rpm<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/40 mpg (15-inch wheels), 29/38 mpg (16-inch wheels)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Corolla L base model has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $19,400. On the other end of the scale is the Corolla XSE, which comes in fully loaded at just above the $24,000 mark. That's a pretty good bargain on both ends; on the low end, the Civic LX with the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/honda/">Honda</a> Sensing package comes closest, but still runs about $1,000 more. On the high side, a loaded Corolla is notably less than many competitors. Check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their new Corolla. As for <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>, the Corolla outpaces virtually everything but the Civic, where the two run neck-and-neck.</p>]

[<p>Offering a bit more sportiness and a lot more versatility than the Corolla <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/toyota/corolla%20im/2018/">2018 Toyota Corolla iM</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> gives budget-minded buyers all the quality and high resale that come with owning a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> at a price that won’t break the bank. Because most cars bundle popular options into pricey packages, the iM’s one-size-fits-all mono-spec equipment list gives customers popular features that can cost hundreds, even thousands more on a comparably equipped Mazda3, VW Golf or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a>. And, although its fuel economy is impressive, the Corolla iM’s modest 137 horsepower pales in comparison to the competition. Need another reason to buy a Corolla iM? Toyota Safety Sense C (TSS-C) is standard on every car.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a safe and reliable <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small car</a>, we think the 2018 Toyota Corolla iM is a very good choice. The hatchback allows easy loading of bikes, skis or cargo, a bonus for drivers with active lifestyle, and standard driver-assist safety features include pre-collision warning and braking.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a low-priced hatchback, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa%20note/">Nissan Versa Note</a> undercuts the Corolla iM by about $5,000, although it’s not as well equipped. You’ll find more features in a Mazda3, VW Golf or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/cruze/">Chevrolet Cruze</a>, options such as leather seating, Apple CarPlay, a power moonroof and heated seats.</p>, <p>There are no major changes for the 2018 Toyota Corolla iM.</p>, <p>What the 2018 Toyota Corolla iM lacks in power, it more than makes up for in efficiency. The 137-horsepower 1.8-liter engine is a mileage champ, but if you’re looking to get the most of the engine’s ability, we suggest opting for the 6-speed manual. The story improves when we get to the ride and handling department. The Corolla iM’s light body and taut suspension make it quite enjoyable on curving mountain roads, yet amazingly maneuverable in tight city confines. We dare say it’s as enjoyable as the more robust Mazda3 and far more connected to the road than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/rio/">Kia Rio</a> or VW Golf. Best of all, unlike a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mini/cooper/">Mini Cooper</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500/">Fiat 500</a>, the Corolla iM’s ride isn’t harsh or punishing over rough pavement. The cabin is fairly quiet at highway speeds, and what noise does get through can quickly be mitigated by turning up the iM’s excellent standard 6-speaker Display audio system.</p>, <p>MONO-SPEC PACKAGING<br>
The 2018 Corolla iM comes as one, well-equipped model, taking all the hassle out of buying a car. Most of the iM’s best features are optional on other cars, leaving buyers with only two choices: transmission and color.<br>
<br>
TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE C<br>
TSS-C is Toyota’s comprehensive suite of driver assists that includes pre-collision braking, lane-departure alert and auto high beams. Where other manufacturers make you buy expensive packages or top-line trims to get these features, the Corolla iM delivers them as part of its standard-equipment list.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Boasting an edgy-yet-tasteful layout, the Corolla iM's cockpit emphasizes functionality. The audio and climate controls are as straightforward as they come, while symmetrical armrests and an adjustable steering column yield an appropriately neutral driving position. Power seats are not available, but the 6-way front buckets leave nothing to be desired in comfort or lateral support. And while rear legroom can’t measure up to rivals like the Mazda3, Kia Rio5 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/golf/">Volkswagen Golf</a> on paper, the Corolla iM’s rear quarters feel plenty roomy in the outboard seating positions. Space behind the rear seat stands at 20.8 cubic feet, topping the Mazda3 and Rio5.</p>, <p>Design-wise, the Toyota’s Corolla iM hatchback for 2018 keenly embraces the tuxedo T-shirt philosophy: It wants to be formal, but it’s also here to party. A sweptback roofline, aggressive lower body panels, and LED running lights and taillights suggest all the makings of a hot hatch, while projector-beam headlights and a versatile liftback speak to the iM's practical side. For those who desire some additional show without the go, Toyota offers a host of dealer-installed accessories like TRD lowering springs, carbon-fiber window trim and body graphics.</p>, <p>Every Corolla iM comes with 17-inch alloys, LED running lights and taillights, power-folding/heated side mirrors, power windows and door locks, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a tilt/telescopic steering wheel, a nifty 4.2-inch driver-information display, a rearview camera, plus a 6-speaker Display audio system with Bluetooth and a USB port. Toyota’s Safety Sense C driver-assist suite adds pre-collision braking, lane-departure alert and automatic high beams, as well as eight airbags including front-seat side, side-curtain and a driver’s-knee airbag. Moonroof lovers, you’re out of luck.</p>, <p>The Corolla iM's mono-spec packaging structure means that aside from the transmission and exterior color, your options are limited to some dealer-installed equipment such as a navigation system, the aHa Radio app, body-side ground effects, side graphics, rear wind deflector, paint protector and interior lighting.</p>, <p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla%20im/">Toyota Corolla iM</a> is powered by Toyota's 1.8-liter, 4-cylinder engine with Valvematic continuously variable-valve timing, which is also used in the Corolla sedan. Developing 137 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque, it can be paired with a standard 6-speed manual or optional continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) featuring a 7-speed simulated sequential-shift mode. Beyond altering shift points, there's a Sport setting that also quickens throttle response and adds weighting to the electric power steering. Combined fuel economy averages rank in the low-30-mpg range and, as you might have guessed, all Corolla iM's run on regular gasoline.<br/> <b><br/> </b>1.8-liter inline-4<br/> 137 horsepower @ 6,100 rpm<br/> 126 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 27/35 mpg (manual), 28/36 mpg (automatic)</p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Toyota Corolla iM 5-door compact begins just under $19,750, including destination and delivery fees. Adding an automatic transmission to the mix still keeps the price under $20,500. If this sounds like a terrific value, you would be right. Similarly equipped models from <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mazda/">Mazda</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> linger in the $23,000 range and up, and none of them can match the Toyota Corolla iM when it comes to long-term ownership costs and resale value.

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Highlander continues to be the choice for families seeking a safe, secure and comfortable 8-passenger crossover SUV, but one that isn’t boring or lacking modern amenities. After a complete refresh last year, the 2018 Highlander is again poised to take on rivals like the Honda Pilot, Chevrolet Traverse and Nissan Pathfinder. To accomplish this, the Highlander offers a standard suite of driver-safety assists including pre-collision warning and braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning. And, while its various infotainment systems lack Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, they are up to date in every other aspect. Those concerned with fuel economy can opt for the Highlander Hybrid that delivers class-leading city-fuel-economy figures.</p>, <p>In a segment where family values equal safety, room, comfort and reliability, the 2018 Toyota Highlander SUV is bound to please. A powerful standard engine, an optional hybrid model and an enviable resale and repair history make the 2018 Highlander a very tempting prospect.</p>, <p>While the 2018 Highlander can fit up to eight passengers and some gear, it’s not as spacious as a Honda Pilot or Chevy Traverse. Those seeking to tackle modest off-road challenges might be happier in a Chevrolet Tahoe or Dodge Durango, both of which can tow more than the Highlander’s 5,000-pound limit.</p>, <p>The Toyota Highlander sails into 2018 with no major changes or upgrades.</p>, <p>Powered by a recently revised 3.5-liter V6 mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission, the 2018 Toyota Highlander is both powerful and fuel-efficient. Although the standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder, its 185 horses haven’t kept up with the Highlander’s growing dimensions. Trust us, if you carry more than two people, need power for passing and merging or pull a small trailer, the V6 is the engine you’ll want (and need). Still thinking you need 4-cylinder fuel economy? Check out the Highlander Hybrid. It’s combined electric/gasoline motor output reaches 306 horsepower, yet it can travel nearly 30 miles in the city on a single gallon of gas. Regardless of engine choice, the Highlander makes a great family carrier, with good steering feedback, a tight turning radius, comfortable yet controlled ride and excellent crash-test scores. The sporty SE trim delivers the best handling and looks without any noticeable impact on ride comfort.</p>, <p>DRIVER EASY SPEAK SYSTEM<br>
With the Highlander’s Driver Easy Speak, cries of “DON’T MAKE ME PULL THIS CAR OVER” are reduced to a mere vocal warning via an intercom system that allows the driver’s intention to be conveyed loud and clear to 3rd-row-seat occupants.<br>
<br>
FLIP-UP REAR HATCH WINDOW<br>
The Highlander’s 2-piece rear hatch offers the convenience of a flip-up glass window. This design makes it easier to load and unload items without valuable cargo rolling out the back, or the family pooch making a break for freedom.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Highlander interior is largely unchanged from the previous iteration. We like that there are numerous USB ports, attractive seat upholstery, and a few other selective trim upgrades. All things considered, the Highlander's interior is one of its strong points. The comfortable front- and 2nd-row seats are great for long drives, and little ones in the third row will be satisfied, although adults should skip it. The dash-width shelf up front is perfect for your wallet, smartphone, keys or whatever else, and the huge center console bin can easily swallow anything too big for the shelf.</p>, <p>The 2018 Highlander's grille is huge, following the big-grille trend that's been stylish for the past few years. Yet it emphasizes the already blunt nose of this midsize SUV, with different models getting different trims, seeming to shrink the headlights in the process. The rest of the Highlander isn’t as dramatic, although the sporty Highlander SE features a blackout trim package that tones down the grille and ultimately looks pretty good. The latest styling trend further emboldens a design that was already a departure of sorts from the Highlander's bland predecessors, and although the grille won't appeal to everybody, it's certainly distinctive.</p>, <p>The base-model 2018 Highlander LE still comes with the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, a combo good for fuel economy but not much else. However, it also comes standard with Toyota Safety Sense Plus (TSS-P), which bundles high-tech safety gear like active cruise control, forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, and lane-departure alert and warning. There's 8-passenger seating, standard rearview camera, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, day/night rearview mirror, and three 12-volt auxiliary power outlets (two up front and one in the second row), and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display with Toyota's Entune audio system, Bluetooth and voice recognition.</p>, <p>Most options are added by trim level; the LE Plus adds 3-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen display and faux-leather seats; the XLE gets real leather and better infotainment that includes navigation; Limited and Limited Platinum get even better audio systems, heated and ventilated front seats, and even an around-view camera, heated steering wheel and heated 2nd-row seats in the Limited Platinum. A panoramic moonroof is available, plus rear-seat entertainment including Blu-ray and DVD, Driver Easy Speak, and of course the V6 or Hybrid powertrains.</p>, <p>Three basic powertrain choices face 2018 Highlander buyers. Base LE models come with a 185-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. We say skip it unless budget is your biggest priority, because the 295-horsepower V6 with 8-speed automatic not only has 110 more horses, but actually gets better highway fuel economy as well (27 mpg vs. 24 mpg). Then there's the hybrid, which combines a version of the V6 with electric motors for a total of 306 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Highlander V6 models, including hybrids, but unless you need the extra traction for foul weather, we suggest skipping it in favor of the better fuel economy you get from front-wheel drive (FWD).<br/> <br/> 2.7-liter inline-4<br/> 185 horsepower @ 5,800 rpm<br/> 184 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/24 mpg<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6<br/> 295 horsepower @ 6,600 rpm<br/> 263 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (FWD LE, AWD LE Plus), 19/26 mpg (LE AWD), 21/27 mpg (FWD LE Plus, XLE, SE, Limited, Limited Platinum), 20/26 mpg (AWD XLE, SE, Limited, Limited Platinum)<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6 + AC 650-volt permanent-magnet motors<br/> 306 hybrid system net horsepower<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/28 mpg (LE), 29/27 mpg (XLE, Limited, Limited Platinum)</p>, <p style="text-align: center;">Despite the equipment upgrades, the 2018 Toyota Highlander Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) doesn't change much, with a base 4-cylinder FWD Highlander LE costing about $32,000 including the $995 destination charge; a V6 will add about $2,000 to that price. On the other end of the lineup is the V6-powered Limited Platinum AWD, which runs about $47,700. Then there's the Highlander Hybrid lineup, which now ranges from about $37,700 for the base LE to just under $49,300 for the Limited Platinum version. Those prices are in line with competing midsize SUV models like the Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and Nissan Pathfinder. We think the best value is the nicely equipped mid-level Highlander XLE at about $40,000. Be sure to check your pick against the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note the Highlander has excellent resale value.<br>

There's 8-passenger seating, standard rearview camera, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, day/night rearview mirror, and three 12-volt auxiliary power outlets (two up front and one in the second row), and a 6.1-inch touch-screen display with Toyota's Entune audio system, Bluetooth and voice recognition.</p>, <p>Most options are added by trim level; the LE Plus adds 3-zone automatic climate control, an 8-inch touch-screen display and faux-leather seats; the XLE gets real leather and better infotainment that includes navigation; Limited and Limited Platinum get even better audio systems, heated and ventilated front seats, and even an around-view camera, heated steering wheel and heated 2nd-row seats in the Limited Platinum. A panoramic moonroof is available, plus rear-seat entertainment including Blu-ray and DVD, Driver Easy Speak, and of course the V6 or Hybrid powertrains.</p>, <p>Three basic powertrain choices face 2018 Highlander buyers. Base LE models come with a 185-horsepower 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission. We say skip it unless budget is your biggest priority, because the 295-horsepower V6 with 8-speed automatic not only has 110 more horses, but actually gets better highway fuel economy as well (27 mpg vs. 24 mpg). Then there's the hybrid, which combines a version of the V6 with electric motors for a total of 306 horsepower. All-wheel drive (AWD) is an option on all Highlander V6 models, including hybrids, but unless you need the extra traction for foul weather, we suggest skipping it in favor of the better fuel economy you get from front-wheel drive (FWD).<br/> <br/> 2.7-liter inline-4<br/> 185 horsepower @ 5,800 rpm<br/> 184 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/24 mpg<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6<br/> 295 horsepower @ 6,600 rpm<br/> 263 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg (FWD LE, AWD LE Plus), 19/26 mpg (LE AWD), 21/27 mpg (FWD LE Plus, XLE, SE, Limited, Limited Platinum), 20/26 mpg (AWD XLE, SE, Limited, Limited Platinum)<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6 + AC 650-volt permanent-magnet motors<br/> 306 hybrid system net horsepower<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/28 mpg (LE), 29/27 mpg (XLE, Limited, Limited Platinum)</p>, <p style="text-align: center;">Despite the equipment upgrades, the 2018 Toyota Highlander Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) doesn't change much, with a base 4-cylinder FWD Highlander LE costing about $32,000 including the $995 destination charge; a V6 will add about $2,000 to that price. On the other end of the lineup is the V6-powered Limited Platinum AWD, which runs about $47,700. Then there's the Highlander Hybrid lineup, which now ranges from about $37,700 for the base LE to just under $49,300 for the Limited Platinum version. Those prices are in line with competing midsize SUV models like the Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and Nissan Pathfinder. We think the best value is the nicely equipped mid-level Highlander XLE at about $40,000. Be sure to check your pick against the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid, and note the Highlander has excellent resale value.<br>

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/toyota/land%20cruiser/2018/">2018 Toyota Land Cruiser</a> incorporates modern-day comforts and amenities and an aging platform to create a full-size SUV with real off-road credentials. Unlike the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/expedition/">Ford Expedition</a> or Chevy Tahoe, the Land Cruiser’s sophisticated Multi-Terrain 4-wheel-drive setup and low-range transfer case allow it to tackle boulder-strewn trails and steep declines. Though it lacks some newer safety assists and infotainment features such as Apply CarPlay, many Land Cruiser owners still feel their SUV plays in the same league as more expensive luxury brands such as <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/land%20rover/">Land Rover</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>. With its potent V8 engine, rugged body-on-frame construction and 8,100-pound tow rating, the 2018 Land Cruiser is the perfect vehicle for families whose outdoor adventures extend beyond a campground parking lot.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a full-size SUV as rugged and off-road capable as it is reliable and comfortable, the 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser hits the sweet spot. Outstanding resale and an extensive national dealer network are two more pluses to consider.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a modern SUV with the latest safety and tech features, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/tahoe/">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/armada/">Nissan Armada</a> will serve you better, plus both offer more interior room. If you’re seeking an equally capable off-road SUV in a slightly smaller package, a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery/">Land Rover Discovery</a> might make a better choice.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser gains key-activated swing-away exterior mirrors, while the rear-seat entertainment system is now a stand-alone option.</p>, <p>Scratch the surface of the 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser’s luxurious image and you’ll find a surprisingly capable and rugged off-road adventurer. Riding on the same body-on-frame architecture that has been part of its well-respected resume for more than 60 years, the Land Cruiser not only goes where most SUV only dream, it can take a level of punishment that would leave lesser <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> waiting for AAA to arrive. A fully independent suspension permits the generous wheel articulation required for crawling over rocks and logs, yet also endows the Land Cruiser with a stable, if not somewhat firm, on-road driving experience. Toyota’s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) adjusts rollbar stiffness, preventing excessive lean in the curves while keeping all four wheels planted when off-roading. The 5,700-pound Land Cruiser isn’t a light or nimble SUV, but that same bulk and brawn contribute to its 8,100-pound tow rating.</p>, <p>5.7-LITER V8 ENGINE<br>
The Land Cruiser’s 5.7-liter V8 is one of the most refined and respected in the industry. With 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, this Lexus-derived motor may not be the most powerful in its class, but its reputation for longevity and reliability is unimpeachable.<br>
<br>
KINETIC DYNAMIC SUSPENSION SYSTEM (KDSS)<br>
Toyota’s KDSS adaptive suspension operates by controlling the stiffness of the Land Cruiser’s anti-sway bars, allowing for betting cornering on paved roads and better wheel articulation off-road.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Land Cruiser offers seating for eight passengers, with acceptable cargo space behind the third row. From behind the wheel, you'll enjoy plenty of power, a comfortable ride, exquisite seats and quiet running, thanks to the Land Cruiser's luxury levels of sound-deadening. However, the Land Cruiser's not the best cargo-hauler, thanks to 3rd-row seats that fold up against the sides of the cargo area, reducing how much you can carry inside. At least the interior is awash in luxury touches, like soft leather and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a>'s Entune audio system.</p>, <p>Toyota adds a bit of flair to the 2018 Land Cruiser’s exterior, with a dynamic front end, power bulge hood, prominent taillights and rear bumper plus handsome 18-inch wheels. The exterior reflects the Land Cruiser's purpose in life, that is, to be ruggedly dependable in any weather, over any terrain, while offering the ultimate in refined luxury. The look emphasizes the capabilities of this luxury SUV with ample ground clearance and short front and rear overhangs for the rough stuff, while adding enough chrome and flourishes to get the front spot at a high-end restaurant's valet parking.</p>, <p>The Land Cruiser’s standard-equipment is surprisingly long, as there's only one stand-alone option. Standard, full-time 4-wheel drive with a low range, traction and stability control -- both optimized for off-road capability -- plus the multi-terrain-select system. Then there's the luxury, like a 4-zone climate-control system, standard leather upholstery, and an adaptive cruise-control system that employs radar to detect the speed of and distance to the vehicle ahead of it, alleviating part of the stress associated with extended road trips. The Safety Sense-P system, Qi wireless phone charging and Siri Eyes-Free are also included.</p>, <p>Outside of some dealer-installed items, the only option is a rear-seat entertainment system comprising two 11.6-inch displays, HDMI input, wireless headphones and a wireless remote.</p>, <p>The only engine available for Toyota’s 2018 Land Cruiser is a 5.7-liter V8 with 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. Toyota says that 90 percent of that torque is available at just 2,200 rpm, meaning you don't have to rev this engine to get moving. It's matched to an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard 4-wheel drive. When you put it all together, you have a drivetrain that's worthy of a <a alt_o_t="Luxury Car" href="/luxury-car/">luxury car</a>...literally, as the exact same drivetrain is in the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> version of the Land Cruiser, the LX 570. Not only does it deal with the Land Cruiser's weight with aplomb, but it can also tow 8,100 pounds. The Land Cruiser SUV is one of the most capable vehicles on the planet.<br/> <br/> 5.7-liter V8<br/> 381 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br/> 401 lb-ft of torque @ 3,600 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/18 mpg</p>, <p>Bring plenty of money to your Toyota dealership. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the 2018 Land Cruiser starts just shy of $85,500 including the $1,295 destination charge. That's not cheap, but then again, just about everything is standard equipment. When you consider that the Land Cruiser competes against SUVs like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/gls/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a> 550, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/range%20rover/">Land Rover Range Rover</a> HSE and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx80/">Infiniti QX80</a> -- all of which have extensive lists of options driving up the price -- it's not bad. Still, check out the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the 2018 Land Cruiser. The Land Cruiser is expected to hold its resale value better than its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> and Land Rover rivals, and far better than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/escalade/">Cadillac Escalade</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lincoln/navigator/">Lincoln Navigator</a>.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/toyota/mirai/2018
[<p>In the 2018 Toyota Mirai, we get a glimpse of a future that could be, but probably won’t. That’s because the Mirai is an electric vehicle powered by hydrogen or, more precisely, by a hydrogen fuel cell. A fuel cell converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity and its only byproduct is water vapor. Sounds like the ideal answer to global warming and fossil-fuel dependence, no? Well, no. A limited number of refueling station operating only in Southern California and the fossil-fuel-intensive process needed to make hydrogen are two huge stumbling blocks, but it’s nice that Toyota offers a 4-passenger zero-emission car with a 300-mile range that can be leased for around $350 a month.</p>, <p>If you need to one-up your Prius and Bolt-driving green buddies, the hydrogen-powered 2018 Mirai is the car that can do it. Toyota picks up the fuel bill for the first three years, provided the total doesn’t exceed $15,000.</p>, <p>The Mirai isn’t particularly practical if you don’t live near a hydrogen refueling station and even less so if you need to travel long distances. You can get a Prius plug-in hybrid for a lot less, or the larger Honda Clarity Fuel Cell for about the same price.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle carries over unchanged.</p>, <p>If you didn’t know hydrogen and oxygen were combining under the driver’s seat (that’s where the fuel cell is stored) to power the 2018 Toyota Mirai’s electric motor, you might easily think you were driving just another electric car. The absence of motor noise takes some getting used to, but the overall driving experience is very much like being behind the wheel of Toyota’s Prius hybrid, that is to say, pleasant but not thrilling. Push the button to “start” the car, shift the console lever into Drive and press the accelerator and off you go. As electric motors are pure torque, acceleration is brisk and the 2018 Toyota Mirai’s ride and handling feel very familiar. Also familiar are Toyota mainstays, like the Entune connectivity and slider-based climate controls. A large center-mounted screen displays usage and range, and is placed at the windshield’s base similar to the setup in the Prius.</p>, <p>Conveniently located beneath the center-console armrest, the Mirai’s Qi wireless charging pad makes it easy to store and charge your smartphone without a nasty tangle of cords and wires running from the 12-volt or USB sockets.<br>
<br>
 24/7 CARE<br>
 Calming fears around any new technology is always a good idea, so Toyota offers an extensive suite of services for future Mirai owners including a concierge service, a loner vehicle for when the car is in the shop, three years’ free fuel and an app for locating current and future hydrogen fuel stations.<br>
</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>If the 2018 Toyota Mirai’s interior seems unremarkable, it's because it bears a striking resemblance to the company’s other EVs and hybrids, most notably the Prius Prime. A large center-mounted infotainment screen with bright graphics is the focal point inside the car, above which resides a center-mounted instrument display. Below the infotainment screen reside a flurry of buttons and touch-activated climate controls, as well as the gear-selection lever. Seating for four is standard, with a center console dividing the rear seats. The front center console conceals a Qi wireless charging pad for smartphones so equipped.</p>, <p>The futuristic exterior of Toyota’s Mirai is partly stylistic and partly dictated by necessity. The two massive front intakes funnel cool air to the car’s three radiators (fuel cells produce a lot of heat), while the overall shape improves aerodynamics to help cheat the wind. While Toyota explained that the design theme of the Mirai is that of flowing water, with a rear end resembling a catamaran, most people will most likely mistake it for just another Prius Prime.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Mirai fuel-cell vehicle comes with numerous features as standard, many of which are aimed at making hydrogen life easier. Hydrogen fill-ups are free for three years. Entune comes standard, along with three years of Safety Connect (including the hydrogen-station map app). Also standard are dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, 11-speaker JBL Premium audio with navigation, Smart Key with push-button start, 8-way-power driver’s and passenger seats with driver power-lumbar support, LED headlights, rain-sensing wipers, adaptive cruise control, pre-collision warning and emergency braking, a blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert.</p>, <p>With a vehicle this specialized and with a premium price, it should come as no surprise that there are no factory options and just a few dealer add-ons.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle doesn’t use an engine. At its heart it's an electric car, but instead of plugging into an outlet, owners fill the tank with hydrogen. That combines with oxygen to produce electricity, which powers the car's motor. The Mirai's electric motor uses an ECVT, a continuously variable automatic transmission, like the Prius. Refueling takes a mere five minutes.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>Fuel cell stack, electric motor<br>
 153 horsepower<br>
 247 lb-ft of torque<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 67 MPGe (estimated), 312-mile range</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>As is the case with many fuel-cell vehicles, there is an option to lease. In the case of the 2018 Toyota Mirai, $2,499 will be due at signing, and the lease is $349 a month for 36 months with a 12,000-mile-per-year allowance. Unlike other FCVs, however, you can buy the new Mirai. While buying one would cost $59,250, and though the federal tax credit from last year has expired, California still offers a $5,000 rebate. As the Mirai is such a unique vehicle, resale information is still unavailable, but given Toyota’s reputation, we suspect as other FCVs come to market, the Mirai will hold its value better than most.</p>]

[<p>This family-friendly 4-door <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> is America’s best-selling <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>. Now in its fourth generation, the 2018 Toyota Prius has a well-earned reputation for safety and reliability, plus it continues to deliver industry-leading fuel economy. The 2018 Prius offers radical futuristic styling, a refined interior with room for five and it has earned a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Seven trim levels are available, all powered by a 1.8-liter internal-combustion engine and a small <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor, a potent combination that delivers 121 horsepower and over 50 mpg. Prices start around $24,000 and a fully loaded model can creep past $30,000. Built in Japan, the new Prius remains the gold standard in hybrid automobiles. It competes with the Chevy Volt, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/niro/">Kia Niro</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Ioniq and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/c-max%20hybrid/">Ford C-Max Hybrid</a>, as well as hybrid <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry%20hybrid/">Toyota Camry Hybrid</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord%20hybrid/">Honda Accord Hybrid</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an affordable family-friendly hybrid with industry-leading fuel economy and the highest safety ratings, you’ll like the 2018 Toyota Prius. The 4-door hatchback also has a golden reputation for reliability as well as high <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a>, plus it enjoys one of the lowest 5-year cost-to-own ratings in the industry.</p>, <p>Although popular, the futuristic face of the 2018 Toyota Prius isn’t for everyone. More subdued design is offered by the Kia Niro, Hyundai Ioniq and Chevy Volt. Although more fuel efficient, the new Prius is also down on power compared to the Ford C-Max Hybrid, which also offers more rear-seat space.</p>, <p>Updates to the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius/">Toyota Prius</a> for 2018 are minimal. The massive 11.6-inch HD Multimedia Display, which is rivaled only by those in more expensive Teslas, now comes standard on the top-of-the line Prius Four and Prius Four Touring trim levels.</p>, <p>Smooth and precise, the 2018 Toyota Prius is comfortable, quiet and easy to drive. It’s also agile. It’s not a sports car by any stretch of the imagination, but it offers surprisingly sporty handling, which could not be said of previous versions of the popular hybrid. Body roll in the corners is kept to a minimum, and the steering, although not on par with the Mazda3 or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a>, is light and fairly precise. The ride is agreeable, even on choppy urban boulevards, and it’s very happy on the highway, feeling more substantial than its predecessors, which lacked stability especially in windy conditions. There’s also a satisfying burst of power off the line, which makes the new Prius feel quicker than it is. Its zero-to-60-mph time of about 10 seconds isn’t going to thrill, but there’s more than enough power when you need it. And the fuel economy is exceptional, which is of course the point. Drive it like Burt Reynolds in <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i> and you’ll still average over 45 mpg.</p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">TOYOTA</a> SAFETY SENSE P<br/> Standard on every 2018 Prius is the brand’s Safety Sense P suite of driver assists. Along with radar-adaptive cruise control, which will keep a set distance from the car ahead, the system includes a pedestrian-detection feature, lane-departure warning and steering assist, which will make small steering corrections for you, automatic high-beam headlights and autonomous braking.<br/> <br/> INTELLIGENT PARK ASSIST<br/> Available on the top trim level, this high-tech system will practically parallel-park your 2018 Prius for you. Sensors mounted around the vehicle work with a sonar system to identify a potential space and then steer the hybrid into the spot as you work the brake pedal and the gear selection.<br/> </p>, <p>Inside, the 2018 Toyota Prius is a satisfying mix of technology, comfort and exacting build quality. With its gauges mounted in the center, between the driver and front passenger, the Toyota’s layout is a bit funky, but you’ll quickly acclimate to the design, which Toyota says reduces the time your eyes are focused off the road. You sit low in the Prius, which some drivers may not like. Interior materials, including new synthetic leather in higher trims, look and feel rich. A low center-console height gives the front compartment a more open feeling, and the rear compartment feels roomy. Lower trim levels get a 6.2-inch color screen for the infotainment, while the highest two trims get a massive 11.4-inch screen, which rivals the setup in Teslas.</p>, <p>Priuses of the past were considered boring to look at. They weren’t unattractive, but they didn’t excite either. This time Toyota’s design team took a few chances and the exterior design of the 2018 Toyota Prius is anything but uninteresting. No, it probably isn’t going to win any beauty contests, but its futuristic lines and avant-garde lighting certainly stand out in a crowd. This Prius has presence. It’s larger too, longer, lower and wider than previous Priuses, and more aerodynamic. Its low hoodline doesn’t just cheat the wind to improve fuel economy, it also improves visibility for the driver, which helps in tight parking lots.</p>, <p>The feature list for the basic Prius Two makes it clear that “basic” does not mean “stripper” for this car. Dual 4.2-inch customizable color information displays, 6.2-inch color touch screen, 6-speaker AM/FM/CD Entune audio, 2.0 USB port, Bluetooth streaming, Siri eyes-free, hands-free phone link, voice recognition, 3-mode driver pre-sets (EV, Eco, Power), cruise control, tilt/telescope steering column, cargo-area tonneau cover, rearview camera, stability control, traction control and eight airbags. Toyota’s Safety Sense P includes full-speed dynamic cruise control, capable of bringing the car to a complete stop. The system also includes a pedestrian-detection feature, lane-departure warning and steering assist, which will make small steering corrections for you, and automatic high-beam headlights.</p>, <p>On the Prius Three and higher trims, the Advanced Technology package adds a power tilt/slide moonroof with a sliding sunshade, and the color head-up display. The Premium Convenience Package includes a 7-inch touch screen, navigation, Entune 10-speaker JBL audio, advanced voice recognition, as well as the standard Prius Two and Three features, and a good many others. Premium Convenience is limited to Prius Four and Prius Four Touring trims. This year a massive 11.6-inch HD Multimedia Display, which is rivaled only by those in more expensive Teslas, now comes standard on the top-of-the-line Prius Four and Prius Four Touring trim levels.</p>, <p>Powering the 2018 Toyota Prius is Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive, which has been adapted to a number of the company’s vehicles. It’s also been licensed to other carmakers. It consists of a 95-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine, which runs on old-fashioned gasoline, an electric motor and an automatic transmission. Combined output is a respectable 121 horsepower, but it’s the powertrain’s smooth function and delivery that impress, and of course its industry-leading fuel economy. The Prius runs on regular-grade gasoline to keep operating costs low. This is a traditional hybrid; if you’re looking for a plug-in hybrid, Toyota offers the Prius Prime, which is a similar but different model. All Priuses are front-wheel drive.<br>

Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Prices (MSRP) range from about $24,500 for the basic Prius One to over $31,000 for the top Prius Four Touring. The Prius Two Eco manages a bump in miles per gallon over the other models and starts about $26,000. Prius Three and Prius Three Touring models add desirable equipment, but to get the massive and massively cool 11.4-inch infotainment screen you have to step up to the Prius Four, which costs just over $30,000. Prius pricing compares favorably with its major hybrid competitors, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/volt/">Chevrolet Volt</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> C-Max, but while Toyotas are some of the top cars in the resale market, the Prius won't fare as well as its stablemates as it ages.

[<p>With a 48-mpg fuel-economy rating in the city, the <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/toyota/prius%20c/2018/">2018 Toyota Prius C</a> is America’s most fuel-efficient subcompact. The comfortable and sporty 4-door <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> is also Toyota’s smallest and most affordable hybrid with a starting price just over $21,000. For 2018, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> has updated the exterior design, giving it some sporty black trim and a more rugged small-SUV vibe in the process. It has also added a rearview camera to the Prius C’s extensive list of standard safety equipment, which includes a Pre-Collision System with autonomous braking, Lane Departure Alert and Automatic High Beam headlights. Four trim levels are available, which Toyota has lazily named One, Two, Three and Four. Key competitors include the Toyota’s larger Prius, which starts around $24,000, and non-hybrids like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a>, Chevy Sonic and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a>.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for ultimate fuel economy for your money, you’ll like the 2018 Toyota Prius C. The hatchback is America’s least expensive hybrid and there isn’t another subcompact available that can match its fuel-economy ratings of 48-mpg city and 43 mpg on the highway. The Prius C also has a stellar reputation for reliability and comes standard with many high-tech active-safety systems.</p>, <p>Some may find the new 2018 Toyota Prius C too small for family use. They should consider the larger and more fuel-efficient Prius, which costs a few thousand dollars more, as well as the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/niro/">Kia Niro</a> and Hyundai Ioniq <a alt_o_t="Hybrids" href="/hybrid/">hybrids</a>. Both are larger than the Prius C and start around $23,000.</p>, <p>For 2018 the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/prius%20c/">Toyota Prius C</a> hybrid hatchback gets an updated look with sporting intentions. Toyota has added SUV-inspired black roof rails, black side rockers and black wheelwell moldings as well as lower-body guards with silver accents. Toyota has also added a standard rearview camera to all Prius C models.</p>, <p>Toyota says the “C” in Prius C stands for “city,” and that’s where this little hybrid hatchback earns its money. In the congested urban sprawl of Los Angeles, the 2018 Prius C is fun to fling around with a playful chassis and precise steering. It feels sturdy, offers impressive agility and it’s confident in the curves. And its compact size makes it easy to maneuver in traffic and you can park it almost anywhere. It’s not as sporty as a Mazda3 or Honda Fit, but the Prius C isn’t a bore either, and the ride is comfortable, even over the potholes of West L.A. If only it had a bit more oomph for passing and merging. Acceleration is adequate, with a satisfying jump off the line. But the hybrid’s 99 horsepower can offer only so much thrust, so 0-60 mph takes a leisurely 12 seconds, and highway passing can be a roll of the dice.</p>, <p>TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P<br>
 Standard on every 2018 Toyota Prius C is the brand’s Safety Sense P suite of driver assists. It includes Lane Departure Alert, Automatic High Beam headlights and Toyota’s Pre-Collision System with autonomous braking, which first warns you of a potential forward collision and will then apply the brakes for you if you do not take evasive action.<br>
  <br>
 EV/ECO MODE<br>
 In standard driving mode, the 2018 Toyota Prius C achieves awesome fuel economy and qualifies as a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV). But the hatchback offers the driver two other modes to help improve that performance. In Eco mode, the powertrain’s parameters are retuned for ultimate efficiency, and in EV mode the Prius C can be driven emissions-free for one-half mile.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Far from bare-bones, the 2018 Toyota Prius C subcompact offers the standard Prius’ center-mounted gauges, which take a little getting used to, and multifunction steering wheel that carry over directly from the larger Prius liftback. The Prius C has comfortable and supportive seats up front, and a back seat that's good for two adults or three kids. Those rear seats fold to nearly double the 17.1-cubic-foot cargo area. Fit/finish is admirable, but there are more hard plastics than we normally like to see. Visibility is excellent, and the futuristic shape of the dashboard and climate controls is kinda cool.</p>, <p>With the Prius hybrid and plug-in Prius Prime taking on radical styling cues seemingly brought back from an apocalyptic future by Doc Brown, Toyota has taken a more sporty and conservative approach to the design of the new Prius C. And it’s the best-looking of the bunch. For 2018 the small hatchback gets an updated look with SUV-inspired black roof rails, black side rockers and black wheelwell moldings as well as lower-body guards with silver accents. It works, while its sweeping headlights with standard LEDs and distinctive taillights remain firmly rooted in the Prius design language, and the "boomerang"' shape within the rear doors is unique.</p>, <p>Like other Prius models, the 2018 Toyota Prius C hybrid comes in trim levels designated by spelled-out numbers. The Prius C One comes with standard LED headlights, power mirrors, Entune audio, Toyota Safety Sense-C, a rearview camera, automatic climate control, cloth seats and Bluetooth phone controls. Prius C Two models add cruise control and a center-console storage compartment, while Prius Three models get push-button start. Prius C Four models get heated faux-leather seats and a power moonroof. Audio systems all include a 6.1-inch touch-screen display and USB input, but Three and Four models get navigation and a few other amenities.</p>, <p>Because of the 4-tier model lineup, individual options are sparse for the 2018 Prius C hybrid, and are confined to the Three and Four models. The Prius C Three model can be fitted with a power moonroof, and the Four model can be upgraded with 16-inch alloy wheels.</p>, <p>Lift the hood, and the 2018 Toyota Prius C will look familiar to any Prius driver. Using a smaller version of the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive found in the larger Prius, the Prius C teams a 73-horsepower, 1.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine with a 60-horsepower <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor energized by a compact nickel-metal hydride battery located beneath the rear seat. It combines for a peak of 99 horsepower, sending it through a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) to the front wheels. Normal, Eco and EV drive modes let drivers amp up the thriftiness, from Normal's already good settings to Eco's subtle adjustments of throttle response and climate control to maximize efficiency. The EV takes gasoline completely out of the equation for short periods of time at speeds below 25 mph.<br/> <br/> 1.5-liter inline-4<br/> 73 horsepower @ 4,800 rpm<br/> 82 lb-ft of torque @ 4,000 rpm<br/> 45-kilowatt electric motor<br/> 60 horsepower, 125 lb-ft of torque<br/> Total System output: 99 horsepower<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 48/43 mpg<b></b></p>, <p>When you include the $895 destination charge, the base 2018 Toyota Prius C One hybrid subcompact has a modest Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) around $21,500. That climbs to around $26,000 for the Prius C Four, still not terribly expensive. Those prices start about $3,000 less than that of the traditional Prius liftback, but for the price of a Prius C Four you can get a well-equipped Prius Two Eco, which gets 58 mpg in the city. There are also less expensive gasoline-only cars on the market, such as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/accent/">Hyundai Accent</a>, Ford Fiesta and Honda Fit, but none hold a candle to the Prius C's fuel economy. If gasoline ever rises above $4/gallon, that advantage turns into big savings over the years, beyond any psychological lift you get from using less gas. Before buying, be sure to check KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see what others are paying in your area, and know that when you buy, the Prius C should hold its value as well as the rest of the Prius family.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Prius Prime is one of the most fuel-efficient cars in the world. It’s a plug-in hybrid version of the popular Toyota Prius Hybrid and it can be driven over 25 miles on electricity alone, just like a pure electric vehicle. When the battery’s charge is depleted a small internal-combustion engine begins to help power the car, but the Prius Prime still returns over 50 mpg and has a total range of over 600 miles. The Prius Prime’s powertrain has multiple driving modes including a Recharge mode that uses the engine to charge the battery, and its distinctive and user-friendly interior includes a huge 11.6-inch touch screen in some models. After tax incentives the Prius Prime actually undercuts the standard Prius. Three trim levels are available starting around $28,000.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a comfortable 4-door hatchback that delivers industry-leading fuel economy, you’ll like the 2018 Toyota Prius Prime. The plug-in hybrid offers over 25 miles of emissions-free electric-only range, over 50 mpg, over 600 miles of total range and after tax incentives, it’s even less expensive than a standard Prius.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a plug-in hybrid with the most electric-only range, check out the Chevy Volt, which can be driven over 50 miles emissions-free on a full charge. That’s approximately twice the range of the Toyota. Also, the 2018 Prius Prime only seats four, while a standard Prius hybrid can accommodate five.</p>, <p>All-new just last year, the 2018 Toyota Prius Prime plug-in hybrid is unchanged this year.</p>, <p>Few cars drive as smoothly or as effortlessly as the 2018 Toyota Prius Prime. From behind the wheel it feels small but substantial. Its steering is light and outward visibility is excellent thanks to a low hoodline, which makes the hybrid easy to maneuver in and out of tight parking spaces.<b> </b>The Prime's suspension smartly trades handling prowess for an excellent freeway and around-town ride, but the Toyota’s small footprint and low center of gravity give it an unexpected agility no small crossover SUV or full-size SUV can match. It feels light on its feet and it’s quick to change direction. Acceleration, even in Power mode, isn't exactly brisk, with Toyota saying it reaches 60 mph in about 11 seconds, but the Prime is quick enough to satisfy most drivers and the powertrain is incredibly smooth, combining electric and internal-combustion power with little noise or vibration. And the 8.8-kWh battery pack can drive the Prius Prime for up to 25 miles in pure-EV mode, so if your commute is short you won’t burn a drop of gasoline.</p>, <p>TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P<br>
Standard on every 2018 Toyota Prius Prime is the brand’s Safety Sense P suite of driver assists. Along with autonomous braking and radar-adaptive cruise control, which will keep a set distance from the car ahead, the system includes a pedestrian-detection feature, lane-departure warning and steering assist, which will make small steering corrections for you. Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross-Traffic Alert are also available.<br>
<br>
INTELLIGENT PARK ASSIST<br>
Standard on the Toyota Prius Prime Advanced, which is the top trim level, this high-tech system uses sensors mounted around the vehicle as well as sonar to practically parallel-park your Prius for you. It first identifies a potential space and then steers the hatchback into the spot as you work the brake pedal and the gear selection.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Those looking for a fuel-efficient family car should know the 2018 Toyota Prius Prime only seats four passengers, as its rear middle seat has been replaced by a center console. Seating is comfortable, and the driver’s seat is mounted low, which gives the plug-in hybrid a sporty sports-car-like driving position. Ergonomics is excellent, but unconventional. The shifter is stubby and sticks out of the dashboard. The gauges are digital and mounted far from the driver, near the base of the windshield. But the centerpiece is the 11.6-inch touch-screen infotainment display that's standard on Premium and Advanced trim levels. Cribbing from Tesla, the big screen provides two levels of information, such as maps and audio controls, with a tablet-like interface.</p>, <p>There’s no risk of the 2018 Toyota Prius Prime getting lost in a crowded mall parking lot. It looks like something out of a sci-fi movie. It wouldn’t look out of place driving around Hill Valley’s town center in <i>Back to the Future Part II.</i> Although it’s the same size and basic wedge shape as the standard Prius Hybrid, Toyota borrowed some cues from its hydrogen-powered Mirai to give the Prius Prime a face all its own. The multi-lens headlights are all LED and look sleek and modern alongside the unique grille treatment. In back, LED taillights wrap horizontally around the trailing edge of the carbon-fiber hatch, which sports "dual-wave" glass and the same carbon-fiber loom as the high-tech Lexus LF-A exotic sports car.</p>, <p>There's the plug-in hybrid drivetrain plus all the various trimmings, of course. The base Prius Prime Plus skips the cool touch screen, though, in favor of a 7.0-inch color infotainment display with an integrated rearview camera and navigation, USB port, and phone and music connectivity through Bluetooth. Also standard is Toyota Safety Sense P, which bundles full-speed adaptive cruise control, pre-collision with pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high beams. Cloth covers the heated seats, push-button start is standard, and fog lights dress up the exterior. With no spare tire, three years of roadside service also come standard.</p>, <p>If you want more features, Toyota asks you to buy more Prius Prime. The mid-level Prius Prime Premium gets SofTex faux-leather seats, including an 8-way-power-adjustable driver's seat, keyless entry, and Qi compatible wireless smartphone charging (sorry, iPhone users). It also gets the big 11.6-inch infotainment screen. Opt for the top-line Prius Prime Advanced and you'll get a similar screen but backed by a premium JBL sound system. The Advanced also gets a remotely controlled climate-control system, heated multi-function steering wheel, color head-up display, blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, and backup sensors with parking assist.</p>, <p>The Prius Prime’s 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine provides 95 horsepower on its own, then combines with two electric motors that put out a total of 76 kW; do the math and you get a peak of 121 horsepower. The 8.8-kWh battery pack provides enough juice to drive the Prius Prime just on electricity for up to 25 miles, at speeds up to 84 mph. That works out to 133 MPGe, which Toyota notes is the best rating of any vehicle. In hybrid mode, it beats the regular Prius by a few mpg. Recharge times are about two hours using a 240V charger, or a little more than five hours on a standard 120V outlet. Oddly, the Prius Prime does not support fast "Stage 3" recharging.<br>
<b><br>
</br></b>4-cylinder hybrid (1.8-liter engine with 53- and 23-kilowatt electric motors)<br>
 95 horsepower @ 5,200 rpm (1.8-liter engine)<br>
 105 lb-ft torque @ 3,600 rpm (1.8-liter engine)<br>
 121 net horsepower (1.8-liter engine plus combined electric output)<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 55/53 mpg, 133 MPGe (EV mode)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Toyota Prius Prime Plus is pretty reasonable at around $28,000, including the $895 destination charge. A Prius Prime Premium starts just under $30,000, and the top-level Advanced runs about $34,000. Factor in roughly $4,000 in federal tax credits, and the plug-in Prius, with all its fancy hardware, actually undercuts the standard Prius by about $2,400. That's a pretty solid deal however you look at it, and it’s why we awarded it a KBB Best Buy Award in 2017. It's also important to note that the new Prius Prime is less expensive than the Chevrolet Volt by several thousand dollars, although it doesn't have the Volt's 50-mile EV range or its 5-passenger capacity. It's also less expensive than the Ford Fusion Energi. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid for their 2018 Prius Prime, and note that it's a wise investment, as Prius models tend to hold their value.</p>]

[<p>Among the numerous compact-SUV choices out there, the 2018 Toyota RAV4 remains a standout. As the vehicle that started the compact-crossover-SUV segment, the RAV4 has consistently been a top seller, right alongside the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/escape/">Ford Escape</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/forester/">Subaru Forester</a>. While not as off-road capable as a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/cherokee/">Jeep Cherokee</a>, the RAV4 is far more reliable and holds exceptionally strong resale values. Its 4-cylinder engine delivers decent power with good fuel economy, and it has enough ground clearance to tackle most snow and light off-road situations. Better still, every RAV4 comes standard with Toyota’s Safety Sense-P suite of driver assists, and there’s even a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> model. Unfortunately, Toyota’s 2018 RAV4 still isn’t compatible with either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.</p>, <p>Toyota’s 2018 RAV4 is the perfect vehicle for those who want a worry-free ownership experience in a compact-crossover SUV that offers a roomy interior, excellent fuel economy and high resale values. Models range from basic to plush and all keep the price well within reason.</p>, <p>If you’re seeking a compact-crossover SUV with real off-road ability, a Subaru Forester or Jeep Cherokee makes a better choice. The 2018 Toyota RAV4 doesn’t offer a V6 engine, so passing and towing abilities are somewhat limited, and unlike the VW Tiguan, there’s no 3rd-row-seat option.</p>, <p>A new Adventure trim adds more ground clearance, 18-inch wheels and a 120-volt outlet, plus optional Cold Weather package with heated/power front seats, heated steering wheel and windshield wiper de-icers. A Tow Prep package increases the tow rating to 2,900 pounds with front-wheel drive (FWD) and 3,500 pounds with all-wheel drive (AWD).</p>, <p>While its competitors have grown larger and more powerful, Toyota’s RAV4 SUV for 2018 remains true to its roots. There’s a roomy interior with plenty of cargo space, plus lots of optional features to fit just about any taste. While the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a> offers better handling and a more modern interior, the RAV4 offers a softer, more comfortable ride and a bit more pep under the hood. It’s true the 2018 Toyota RAV4’s 2.5-liter engine isn’t as powerful as some competitors, but its acceleration and fuel economy remain in line with other 4-cylinder compacts like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jeep/compass/">Jeep Compass</a>, Subaru Forester and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/equinox/">Chevrolet Equinox</a>. When it comes to fuel economy, the RAV4 Hybrid pushes 34 mpg, and that’s with the sure-footed traction of standard AWD. The hybrid’s 2-motor setup also makes it a bit quicker to 60 mph than the gasoline-only version.</p>, <p>ADVENTURE TRIM<br/> The Adventure trim gives the 2018 RAV4 a bit more off-road cred, elevating ride height to 6.5 inches and offering available heated cloth seats, heated steering wheel and front wiper de-icers.

Interestingly, leather isn't available, substituted with a material called SofTex, which does a pretty good impression of the real thing. The driver's seat is comfortable and supportive, especially the Limited and Platinum models with their added lumbar support. Rear-seat passengers have good legroom, and there's plenty of cargo space.</p>, <p>Overall, we like the looks of the 2018 RAV4 compact-crossover SUV, and its sharp lines are positively aggressive compared to previous models. Owners of those older models may notice that there's no rear-mounted spare tire on the current generation. However, despite it being a fixture since the RAV4's introduction, Toyota was smart in dropping it, as it allows for a swing-up rear door instead of the swing-out design on previous versions, making it easier to load items into the cargo area. A power assist is standard on Limited and Platinum models, and available on XLE models.</p>, <p>The base RAV4 LE trim comes with Entune, which includes a 6.1-inch display, Bluetooth connectivity, AM/FM/CD system with six speakers, and auxiliary and USB inputs to control your iPod. XLE models add a power moonroof, upgraded Entune with satellite and HD Radio, dual-zone climate control, and better front seats with French stitching. The SE trim receives a sport suspension, paddle shifters, SofTex seating, 2-tone paint and rear cross-traffic alert. Limited models add the power liftgate, SofTex upholstery, Entune Premium audio with navigation and apps, push-button start, and more. The AWD RAV4 Hybrid is offered in XLE, SE and Limited trims.</p>, <p>All-wheel drive is available on all <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a> models and standard on the Hybrid, enhancing the SUV's traction in wet weather and on dirt roads. Other options include a navigation system with Toyota's Entune telematics -- which has voice recognition and various apps for everything from making reservations to finding sports scores -- JBL premium audio system with 11 speakers, Bird’s Eye View Parking System, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert and, on the XLE, a power rear liftgate. The Platinum trim adds body-color side molding, a heated steering wheel, JBL audio, navigation, Smart Key and a foot-activated power rear liftgate.</p>, <p>There are two powertrain choices for the 2018 Toyota RAV4. Gasoline-powered models employ a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine with 176 horsepower. Coupled with the standard 6-speed automatic transmission, it's enough to get the SUV from a standstill to 60 mph in a little less than 10 seconds, not exactly quick, but good enough. The standard FWD can be replaced with an AWD system, and the RAV4 will tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped. The RAV4 Hybrid uses the same 2.5-liter engine only with Atkinson-cycle technology mated with two small <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motors (one at each axle). AWD comes standard on the hybrid models, as does a CVT automatic transmission.<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.5-liter inline-4 <br/> 176 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 172 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/29 mpg (FWD), 22/28 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 2.5-liter inline-4 engine + electric motor (Hybrid)<br/> 194 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm (peak output with gasoline and electric combined)<br/> 206 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 34/30 mpg</p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Toyota RAV4 LE is about $25,500, including the destination charge. The top-of-the-line Platinum model with AWD tops out around $37,200. The XLE Hybrid starts around $30,000. Those prices are right in line with rivals like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape, two of its strongest competitors. Other compact <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a> and Mazda CX-5 start lower, but the RAV4's simplified trim levels keep even a loaded RAV4 well below the mid- to high-$30,000 prices that afflict other vehicles in this segment, like the Ford Escape and VW Tiguan. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new Toyota RAV4. The RAV4 should retain its value on par with the Honda CR-V and better than <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a>'s Escape, but below the Subaru Forester.<br>

The RAV4 Hybrid uses the same 2.5-liter engine only with Atkinson-cycle technology mated with two small <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motors (one at each axle). AWD comes standard on the hybrid models, as does a CVT automatic transmission.<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.5-liter inline-4 <br/> 176 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 172 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 23/29 mpg (FWD), 22/28 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 2.5-liter inline-4 engine + electric motor (Hybrid)<br/> 194 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm (peak output with gasoline and electric combined)<br/> 206 lb-ft of torque @ 4,100 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 34/30 mpg</p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Toyota RAV4 LE is about $25,500, including the destination charge. The top-of-the-line Platinum model with AWD tops out around $37,200. The XLE Hybrid starts around $30,000. Those prices are right in line with rivals like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape, two of its strongest competitors. Other compact <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/sportage/">Kia Sportage</a> and Mazda CX-5 start lower, but the RAV4's simplified trim levels keep even a loaded RAV4 well below the mid- to high-$30,000 prices that afflict other vehicles in this segment, like the Ford Escape and VW Tiguan. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for the new Toyota RAV4. The RAV4 should retain its value on par with the Honda CR-V and better than <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a>'s Escape, but below the Subaru Forester.<br>

[<p>Toyota’s 2018 Sequoia is a massive SUV renowned for its dependability and family-friendly hauling abilities. Although not as modern or roomy as the Chevy Suburban or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/expedition%20max/">Ford Expedition Max</a>, the Sequoia still has much to offer, with 3-row seating and a new suite of standard driver-assist features including pre-collision warning and automatic braking. And, while the Sequoia’s 7,400-pound tow rating does fall short of its competitors, we think it will work for most family hauling needs. The powerful 5.7-liter V8 is another proven component, offering plenty of muscle to move this big SUV around. Those looking to venture off-road will appreciate the Sequoia’s Multi-mode 4-wheel-drive system that allows this rugged body-on-frame SUV to go places many of its competitors can’t.</p>, <p>If a solid reputation for reliability, resale and capability mean more to you than maximum towing and fuel-economy figures, the 2018 Toyota Sequoia earns two thumbs-up. New standard safety features further improve an already great SUV.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a more modern design, better horsepower and tow ratings or more interior room, you’ll be better off shopping the big <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a> from Chevrolet/GMC, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ford/">Ford</a> and even <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a>. Those seeking 7- and 8-passenger seating in a car-like SUV might like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a> or <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevrolet Traverse</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/sequoia/">Toyota Sequoia</a> gains Toyota’s Safety Sense-P that adds automatic emergency braking, lane-departure alert with sway warning, adaptive cruise control and auto high beams. A blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert are also standard. Along with refreshed styling comes a new TRD Sport trim.</p>, <p>While driving this big SUV is never going to compare to a lighter <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV like the Toyota Highlander, the 2018 Sequoia proves remarkably easy to control. Despite its vast bulk, the Sequoia takes corners with confidence, and its independent rear suspension helps keep lean to a minimum while making off-road adventures all the more doable. This same setup, however, does return a rather firm ride, one that is livable so long as the paved road below remains smooth. Things improve vastly with the Platinum trim’s air-spring suspension, but you’ll pay a premium to get it. The Sequoia’s steering is fairly precise, although it tends to feel a bit heavy at lower speeds, and its interior is well isolated from obnoxious levels of wind and tire noise. Standard rearview monitor, blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert are welcome assistants when attempting to maneuver the Sequoia’s massive proportions.</p>, <p>PROVEN RUGGED DURABILITY<br/> Full-size SUVs don’t come cheap, so it’s nice to know your hefty investment will hold its value for the duration of your loan. An excellent record of reliability and longevity also goes a long way to sealing the deal.<br/> <br/> <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">TOYOTA</a> SAFETY SENSE-P (TSS-P)<br/> While some manufacturers still require pricey packages or model upgrades to get these features, Toyota makes its TSS-P standard on every Sequoia. The system includes collision warning with pedestrian detection and emergency automatic braking, auto high beams, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure alert with sway warning.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Sequoia SUV is a true 8-seater, with a 3rd-row seat that really will accommodate adults and is easily reached, thanks to big rear doors and sliding 2nd-row seats. The 3-passenger 2nd-row bench seat allows individual sections to slide fore-and-aft and also fold flat. Noteworthy options include captain’s chairs for the second row and a power-folding feature for the third row. Basically, the Sequoia’s interior will swap around into any configuration needed. The design is somewhat bland and a couple notches below sinfully luxurious but, as would be expected of a Toyota, the assembly detail is without fault.</p>, <p>In all its majestic glory the Sequoia for 2018 is the longest, widest and tallest full-size SUV Toyota builds and, with its long wheelbase, it appears even longer. But that long wheelbase pays dividends -- it enhances interior room, improves ride quality, contributes to directional stability and, with the resultant short overhangs, gives extra clearance when approaching steep angles. The Sequoia’s appearance is fairly innocuous and can’t be accused of standing out in a crowd, but with its new grille and front bumper, it’s certainly not unattractive.</p>, <p>There are four trim levels for Toyota’s 2018 Sequoia SUV: SR5, TRD Sport, Limited and Platinum. Standard equipment on the SR5 includes integrated fog lights, power tilt/slide moonroof, rearview camera, roof rack, 3-zone automatic climate control, Optitron instruments, leather-trimmed tilt/telescoping steering wheel with Bluetooth hands-free telephone controls, 8-way driver’s and 4-way front-passenger’s seats, 18-inch alloy wheels, all the expected power and convenience features, and Entune Audio Plus. The Limited adds a power liftgate, 20-inch wheels, leather seating and Entune Premium Audio. The Platinum adds perforated leather seating, Dynamic laser cruise control, Adaptive Variable Suspension, air suspension, and Entune Premium JBL Audio.</p>, <p>All four of the Sequoia’s trim levels -- SR5, TRD Sport, Limited and Platinum -- are available with either rear-wheel drive (RWD) or 4-wheel drive (4WD). Options for the SR5 include a Sport Package, with 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and a Premium Package, with leather-trimmed seating, power-reclining fold-flat 3rd-row seat, heated front seats, and the Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and App Suite. Optional on the Limited is a rear-seat Blu-ray entertainment system with 9-inch display and 7-passenger seating with 2nd-row captain’s chairs. The only option for the Platinum is the Blizzard Pearl exterior color.</p>, <p>One of the best features offered in Toyota’s full-size Sequoia is its strong and quiet 5.7-liter V8 engine, with 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque. It’s unobtrusively reassuring and is equal to any task the Sequoia may be asked to accomplish. It’s matched to a 6-speed automatic transmission that includes a low first gear for getting a heavy load moving and two overdrive gears that help enhance fuel economy and reduce noise at highway speeds. Taken together, the engine and transmission contribute to the Sequoia’s towing capacity of 7,400 pounds.<br>
<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 13/17 mpg (RWD), 13/17 mpg (4WD), 9/13 mpg (E85, 4WD)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The rear-wheel-drive 2018 Toyota Sequoia SR5 has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting around $49,600, while the mid-level TRD Sport and Limited start just over $52,300 and $58,000, respectively. Opting for 4-wheel drive will add a few thousand more, and the top-of-the-line Platinum model starts at about $65,500. Overall, the Toyota Sequoia’s price range overlaps those of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/expedition/">Ford Expedition</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/tahoe/">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> and Suburban 1500, but is slightly more expensive than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/armada/">Nissan Armada</a>. Before heading off to the dealer, a check of the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price will show what other buyers in your area are actually paying for the 2018 Sequoia. For a longer-term investment, the Sequoia is excellent and should hold its <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> better than any other large SUV.</p>]
---------http://www.kbb.com/toyota/sienna/2018
[<p>With a limited number of minivans available in the marketplace, the 2018 Toyota Sienna qualifies as one of the better choices. Over the years, Toyota’s family van has grown in size, power and price, meaning when it comes to hauling the kids and all their stuff, the Sienna is still far superior to any SUV or wagon. With seating for up to eight passengers, the Sienna offers a versatile interior as attractive as it is functional. Options galore spread over five trims cater to just about every budget and personal taste, and while the Sienna’s styling remains more conservative than the Chrysler Pacifica and Honda Odyssey, it has one trick up its sleeve more important than looks: the option of all-wheel drive.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a roomy minivan that specializes in reliability, longevity and ease of operation, the 2018 Toyota Sienna checks all the right boxes. Standard driver assists maximize safety, while options such as mobility-needs systems and all-wheel drive widen the Sienna’s already broad appeal.</p>, <p>The Sienna is not the least expensive minivan you can buy; that honor goes to the Dodge Grand Caravan and Kia Sedona, neither of which can match the Sienna’s resale value. The Chrysler Pacifica offers better styling, more features and a hybrid option, but can’t match the Sienna’s cargo volume.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Sienna receives the Toyota Safety Sense (TSS-P) suite of driver assists as standard equipment. This includes a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning and assist plus automatic high beams. A newly styled front end, upgraded Entune multimedia system, additional USB ports and a Bird’s-Eye View monitor for the Limited trim round out the changes.</p>, <p>With its powerful 296-horsepower V6 engine, the Toyota Sienna has always delivered impressive acceleration that borders on sporty, although we don’t envision many Sienna drivers challenging other cars to a drag race. The Sienna’s power is better used for passing and merging, and tackling steep grades with a full complement onboard. On the highway, the Sienna is a serene machine, cruising effortlessly at 75 mph with barely a hint of road or wind noise infiltrating the cabin. Those looking for a bit more feedback from their minivan’s driving experience should look to the SE trim. It features 19-inch wheels and a sport-tuned suspension for improved cornering. The trade-off for the SE’s better drivability, however, is a firmer ride and a bit more tire noise. Those living in snowy climes will definitely want the optional all-wheel drive, although models so equipped do surrender a few mpg vs. the front-drive vans.</p>, <p>ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
 Why other minivans don’t offer the option of all-wheel drive is a mystery, but one that works in the Sienna’s favor. Although not inexpensive, for anyone living in the northern portion of the country, this option is worth its weight in gold.<br>
<br>
 MOBILITY SOLUTIONS<br>
 Passengers in need of mobility assistance will find the 2018 Sienna’s available equipment to be a lifesaver. Among the more notable features are an aftermarket wheelchair ramp and the Auto Access Seat, a factory-installed power-operated chair providing easier access to the second row.<br>
<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Sienna minivan has three rows of seats and can accommodate seven or eight passengers. Seven-passenger models have a pair of 2nd-row captain's chairs, while 8-passenger models have a bench that seats three. You can opt for a 7- or 8-passenger arrangement in every Sienna except the SE, which is 8-passenger-only. If you choose 2nd-row captain's seats in the XLE or Limited, your passengers get lounge seats with adjustable ottomans and armrests. Toyota's minivan features four LATCH points for child-safety seats, plenty of nooks and crannies up front for electronics and bags, and ample storage in back behind the third row.</p>, <p>Compared to the Honda Odyssey with its "lightning-bolt" side-window treatment or the Kia Sedona and new Chrysler Pacifica with their progressive stances, the Toyota Sienna appears more conservative to our eyes, although this year’s revised front end does add a bit more flair. Like all matters of taste, this isn't a bad thing, and whether the Sienna looks the best among its peers or is lost in the crowd will be subject to your eyes. Sienna SE models strive to put the "swagger" in this Toyota's wagon with big 19-inch alloy wheels, front and rear underbody spoilers and smoked headlights.</p>, <p>Toyota’s Sienna minivan for 2018 spans five trims: L, LE, SE, XLE and Limited. A base L model comes with the Toyota Safety Sense system, tri-zone climate control, fabric seats, rearview camera, automatic headlights and the Entune Audio system with 6.1-inch touch screen, AM/FM/CD player with USB, and iPod and Bluetooth connectivity with Siri Eyes Free for Apple devices. That model is only available with seating for seven; all others can accommodate seven or eight. The LE gets easy-clean fabric, power-operated sliding doors, upgraded infotainment system and power-adjustable driver's seat. All 2018 Siennas come with Toyota Care, which covers two years/25,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.</p>, <p>Keep climbing trims and you'll get extra conveniences such as a power liftgate (optional on LE models), Leatherette or genuine leather seats, push-button start, moonroof, navigation system and Driver Easy Speak, which broadcasts the driver's voice to the rear speakers -- no more needing to turn around and yell at the kids! Active safety features include blind-spot monitoring, while the Limited models get a JBL audio system with a 10-inch subwoofer. A rear-seat entertainment system with Blu-ray DVD player and ultra-wide 16.4-inch screen with HDMI inputs, Android streaming capabilities and twin power outlets is available to further keep the kiddos occupied.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Sienna is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 with power ratings of 296 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque while running on regular unleaded gasoline. Power is routed through an 8-speed automatic transmission. This combo helps push fuel-economy figures close to best-in-class, although both the Honda Odyssey and Chrysler Pacific Hybrid do better. As with its competitors, the Sienna comes standard with front-wheel drive (FWD), while unlike the rest it's available with all-wheel drive (AWD) across every trim except the base L and sportier SE, a boon for drivers living in cold-weather states. With either layout, the Toyota Sienna is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds.<br/> <br/> 3.5-liter V6<br/> 296 horsepower @ 6,600 rpm<br/> 263 lb-ft of torque @ 4,700 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 19/27 mpg (FWD), 18/24 mpg (AWD)<b></b></p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The 2018 Toyota Sienna L has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $30,745 for a base L model, including destination charges. On the other end of the Sienna spectrum, a loaded all-wheel-drive Limited Premium model tops $48,000. You can find a lot of value in between, starting with an LE model. At these prices, the Sienna nearly mirrors those of its Honda Odyssey competition, is slightly above the new Chrysler Pacifica, and is a few thousand more than the starting prices of the Nissan Quest, Kia Sedona and Dodge Grand Caravan. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Sienna. Another feather in this Toyota's cap is resale value: The Sienna has routinely been a KBB Best Resale Value Award winner, including most recently in 2016.<br>

---------http://www.kbb.com/toyota/tacoma-access-cab/2018
[<p>America’s best-selling midsize pickup for more than a decade, the comfortable and capable 2018 <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> Tacoma has been improved with new standard safety technology, including a Pre-Collision system and Lane Departure Alert. Available in six trim levels and over 30 configurations, the new Toyota Tacoma enjoys a stellar reputation for excellent durability and reliability as well as on- and off-road performance. Two engines are available starting with a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that makes 159 horsepower. We recommend the 278-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, which can be paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual. And when equipped with an optional V6 Tow Package, the Tacoma can tow up to 6,800 pounds. Competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> Colorado and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/gmc/">GMC</a> Canyon, as well as the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/nissan/">Nissan</a> Frontier.</p>, <p>Few vehicles are as versatile or as personally customizable as the 2018 Toyota Tacoma. With six trim levels and over 30 configurations available, there’s a new Tacoma to fit any budget, any want and any need. If you’re looking for a reliable work truck, a capable surf wagon, a durable dirt-bike hauler, a comfortable daily driver or an ultimate off-road adventure vehicle, you’ll like the 2018 Tacoma.</p>, <p>Both the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon offer a diesel engine, which the Tacoma does not. Both also offer superior interior comfort to the Toyota as well as onboard Wi-Fi. Also, if your needs include full-size loads or large-scale towing, you’ll reach the Tacoma’s limits quickly and should consider a <a alt_o_t="Full-size Truck" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/pickup-trucks-new/2000010267/">full-size truck</a> like the Toyota Tundra.</p>, <p>For 2018 all Tacoma models gain Toyota Safety Sense electronic driver aids as standard equipment. It includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. Most trim levels also get a new and distinct grille treatment. The 5-speed manual transmission is no longer available.</p>, <p>In most driving environments and situations, the Tacoma’s 159-horsepower 2.7-liter engine is powerful enough, but climbing grades with a full load in the bed will require some planning and probably full throttle. Plus, the 4-cylinder can get a little rowdy when you rev it out. This is also easily fixed by choosing the 3.5-liter V6. This engine makes 278 horsepower and significantly improves the capability of the 2018 Tacoma, and it makes the Toyota a more enjoyable pickup to drive. The 6-speed automatic transmission isn’t exactly state of the art, but it works well with both engines. The V6 and 6-speed manual combination is rewarding to drive. Seating is comfortable and overall visibility is excellent; however, the Tacoma’s pedal and steering-wheel placement may be an issue for shoppers with long legs. The Tacoma also rides well, with less chop than you might expect from a small pickup.</p>, <p>PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM<br/> This clever system, which is also found on Toyota’s <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> as well as <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> cars and <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, scans the road ahead for obstacles including other vehicles and pedestrians. When a possible collision is detected it will warn you, but if you do not take action to avoid the accident, the system will apply the truck’s brakes for you.<br/> <br/> TRD Pro<br/> The TRD Pro is the ultimate off-road-capable Tacoma. It’s also the most expensive at about $43,000, but its unique list of specialized hardware is worth it. These trucks get Fox shocks, additional ground clearance and thick aluminum skidplates, as well as special tires and other equipment and trim. The Tacoma TRD Pro and the Chevy Colorado ZR2 are the elite off-road machines in this class.<br/> </p>, <p>As is Toyota's tradition, assembly quality is excellent. The 2018 Tacoma interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats and everywhere else. Overall the Chevy Colorado’s interior is more car-like and it’s quieter, but the dynamic design of the Tacoma’s dash and controls is more interesting. It gets push-button start, and the handy multi-information display between the main gauges displays fuel economy, outside temperature and even off-road info such as trail mode or angle of the Tacoma on a steep hill. The new Tacoma also comes with a new version of Entune, the connectivity and entertainment-control center, and Qi wireless charging. However, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren't available on any model. Neither are power seats.</p>, <p>Now in its third generation, the Toyota Tacoma was redesigned extensively in 2015 and it still looks fresh. Designed and built in the United States, the 2018 Toyota Tacoma looks rugged and carries the kind of swagger most pickup truck buyers appreciate. But it’s no wallflower, and it certainly isn’t old school. There are modern cues, such as LED daytime running lights, and the separate models -- SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Pro and Limited -- each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. Our Tacoma TRD Pro drew a crowd at gas stations and thumbs-up from other truck enthusiasts.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Tacoma offers Toyota Safety Sense electronic driver aids as standard equipment. It includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. A rearview camera, a basic version of Entune connectivity, an automatic limited-slip differential, eight airbags, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a lockable tailgate, 16-inch wheels and adjustable tie-down cleats in the bed are also standard. The standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the rear wheels. Interestingly, the Tacoma uses old-school drum brakes in the rear, and power seats are not available, even in high-end models. On the other hand, the standard GoPro camera mount is as 21st-  century as it gets.</p>, <p>Options for the new 2018 Toyota Tacoma roughly divide into features that make it more rugged and tough, and those that bump up technology and refinement. There's the TRD Pro trim level, of course, but beyond that on the tough-truck side of the list are Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control, and a hard tonneau cover. On the technology side the Tacoma offers rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking assist and blind-spot monitoring. Making life more comfortable is push-button start with Smart Key, Qi wireless charging, tilt-and-slide moonroof, heated leather seats, Entune with a full App suite, and a JBL sound system.</p>, <p>The base engine in the 2018 Toyota Tacoma is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that's been part of the Tacoma lineup pretty much forever. It powers the rear wheels (2WD) or all four wheels (4WD) through a 6-speed automatic. But we suggest skipping it for the 3.5-liter V6. The bigger engine offers nearly 120 more horsepower (278 vs. 159) but gets nearly the same fuel economy and doesn't cost much more. It's also available with a 6-speed automatic, and 4WD models can opt for a 6-speed manual, too.<br>

Put simply, the least expensive model is an SR trim 4-cylinder Double Cab with 2-wheel drive, starting about $27,000 when the $995 destination charge is included. On the other end of the scale is the Tacoma 4x4 TRD Pro Double Cab with the automatic transmission, which starts around $45,500. You can mix and match to just about anything in between, but for what it's worth the prices start higher than a Nissan Frontier, Chevrolet Colorado or GMC Canyon, but the new Tacoma comes with a lot of standard equipment. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what people are paying in your area for the Tacoma, and note that resale value is just another one of this truck's many strengths.</p>]

The 5-speed manual transmission is no longer available.</p>, <p>In most driving environments and situations, the Tacoma’s 159-horsepower 2.7-liter engine is powerful enough, but climbing grades with a full load in the bed will require some planning and probably full throttle. Plus, the 4-cylinder can get a little rowdy when you rev it out. This is also easily fixed by choosing the 3.5-liter V6. This engine makes 278 horsepower and significantly improves the capability of the 2018 Tacoma, and it makes the Toyota a more enjoyable pickup to drive. The 6-speed automatic transmission isn’t exactly state of the art, but it works well with both engines. The V6 and 6-speed manual combination is rewarding to drive. Seating is comfortable and overall visibility is excellent; however, the Tacoma’s pedal and steering-wheel placement may be an issue for shoppers with long legs. The Tacoma also rides well, with less chop than you might expect from a small pickup.</p>, <p>PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM<br/> This clever system, which is also found on Toyota’s <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> as well as <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> cars and <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, scans the road ahead for obstacles including other vehicles and pedestrians. When a possible collision is detected it will warn you, but if you do not take action to avoid the accident, the system will apply the truck’s brakes for you.<br/> <br/> TRD Pro<br/> The TRD Pro is the ultimate off-road-capable Tacoma. It’s also the most expensive at about $43,000, but its unique list of specialized hardware is worth it. These trucks get Fox shocks, additional ground clearance and thick aluminum skidplates, as well as special tires and other equipment and trim. The Tacoma TRD Pro and the Chevy Colorado ZR2 are the elite off-road machines in this class.<br/> </p>, <p>As is Toyota's tradition, assembly quality is excellent. The 2018 Tacoma interior uses high-quality materials on the doors, dash, seats and everywhere else. Overall the Chevy Colorado’s interior is more car-like and it’s quieter, but the dynamic design of the Tacoma’s dash and controls is more interesting. It gets push-button start, and the handy multi-information display between the main gauges displays fuel economy, outside temperature and even off-road info such as trail mode or angle of the Tacoma on a steep hill. The new Tacoma also comes with a new version of Entune, the connectivity and entertainment-control center, and Qi wireless charging. However, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aren't available on any model. Neither are power seats.</p>, <p>Now in its third generation, the Toyota Tacoma was redesigned extensively in 2015 and it still looks fresh. Designed and built in the United States, the 2018 Toyota Tacoma looks rugged and carries the kind of swagger most pickup truck buyers appreciate. But it’s no wallflower, and it certainly isn’t old school. There are modern cues, such as LED daytime running lights, and the separate models -- SR, SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Pro and Limited -- each get different front-end styling, making it easy to tell which is which at a glance. Our Tacoma TRD Pro drew a crowd at gas stations and thumbs-up from other truck enthusiasts.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Tacoma offers Toyota Safety Sense electronic driver aids as standard equipment. It includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. A rearview camera, a basic version of Entune connectivity, an automatic limited-slip differential, eight airbags, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a lockable tailgate, 16-inch wheels and adjustable tie-down cleats in the bed are also standard. The standard engine is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder powering the rear wheels. Interestingly, the Tacoma uses old-school drum brakes in the rear, and power seats are not available, even in high-end models. On the other hand, the standard GoPro camera mount is as 21st-  century as it gets.</p>, <p>Options for the new 2018 Toyota Tacoma roughly divide into features that make it more rugged and tough, and those that bump up technology and refinement. There's the TRD Pro trim level, of course, but beyond that on the tough-truck side of the list are Multi-Terrain Select and Crawl Control, and a hard tonneau cover. On the technology side the Tacoma offers rear cross-traffic alert, rear parking assist and blind-spot monitoring. Making life more comfortable is push-button start with Smart Key, Qi wireless charging, tilt-and-slide moonroof, heated leather seats, Entune with a full App suite, and a JBL sound system.</p>, <p>The base engine in the 2018 Toyota Tacoma is a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that's been part of the Tacoma lineup pretty much forever. It powers the rear wheels (2WD) or all four wheels (4WD) through a 6-speed automatic. But we suggest skipping it for the 3.5-liter V6. The bigger engine offers nearly 120 more horsepower (278 vs. 159) but gets nearly the same fuel economy and doesn't cost much more. It's also available with a 6-speed automatic, and 4WD models can opt for a 6-speed manual, too.<br>

Put simply, the least expensive model is an SR trim 4-cylinder Double Cab with 2-wheel drive, starting about $27,000 when the $995 destination charge is included. On the other end of the scale is the Tacoma 4x4 TRD Pro Double Cab with the automatic transmission, which starts around $45,500. You can mix and match to just about anything in between, but for what it's worth the prices start higher than a Nissan Frontier, Chevrolet Colorado or GMC Canyon, but the new Tacoma comes with a lot of standard equipment. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price calculator to see what people are paying in your area for the Tacoma, and note that resale value is just another one of this truck's many strengths.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Toyota Yaris is the kind of no-frills econobox that, decades ago, established <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> as a player in the U.S. But the definition of "frills" has changed, and with it our expectations of what modest dollars can buy. So the 2018 Yaris gets aggressively updated styling this year with a new nose and tail. Standard equipment includes collision warning, automatic braking and lane-departure warning, something that can't be said of primary rivals the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/fit/">Honda Fit</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/accent/">Hyundai Accent</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a>. Yet the Yaris still offers the kind of easy driving and low cost-of-ownership experience one expects from a Toyota, even a little bitty one. With two years of complimentary maintenance, strong <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> and overall practicality, the 2018 Yaris is a compelling subcompact choice.</p>, <p>With its advanced safety features, low price and efficient and inexpensive operation, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/yaris/">Toyota Yaris</a> checks a lot of boxes. The <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> body means practicality, and the updated styling is certainly eye-grabbing, and maybe even cool from some angles.</p>, <p>Despite its aggressive appearance and "SE" trim level, there's little that's sporty about the Toyota Yaris. Take your performance dollars to the Ford Fiesta ST or even the turbocharged Chevy Sonic. Also note that the Honda Fit has better and more flexible cargo space thanks to its flip-and-fold rear seats.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Yaris gets a visual tune-up this year, with a more aggressive nose and tail. Inside, all Yaris models get SE-levels of interior trim. Note that the Yaris is a different car from the Yaris iA, which itself is a refugee from the now-defunct <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/scion/">Scion</a> brand.</p>, <p>Toyota’s Yaris offers a lot of things at its modest price tag, but driving passion isn't one of them. With only 106 horsepower available it's a slow ride to 60 mph, and neither the rubbery and vague 5-speed manual nor antiquated 4-speed automatic really help acceleration feel anything better than barely acceptable. Toyota has tuned the suspension for comfort, and it delivers a smooth-for-a-small-car ride. The Yaris SE is moderately better, with a slightly stiffer suspension, but without any additional power. That said, it's fine for just put-putting around town, and it's likely the sensible types attracted to the Yaris will be more thrilled with the parking-lot maneuverability afforded by the little Toyota's diminutive size. However, note that competitors like the Chevy Spark and Honda Fit offer a CVT automatic or more gears, which improve both performance and fuel economy.</p>, <p>SAFETY SENSE-C TECHNOLOGY<br/> The Safety Sense-C suite of high-tech collision avoidance warns drivers of a frontal collision or if they're drifting into the next lane. It can even automatically apply the brakes in an emergency. Impressive, especially considering it was just a few years ago that this tech was rare even on <a alt_o_t="Luxury Cars" href="/luxury-car/">luxury cars</a>.<br/> <br/> ENTUNE<br/> While the availability of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto has taken the bloom off the Entune rose, it's nice to see that even the least expensive Yaris hatchback comes with the system's 6.1-inch touch screen, USB port with iPod connectivity, Bluetooth hands-free phone compatibility and voice control.<br/> </p>, <p>Toyota has worked hard to keep the Yaris from feeling cheap, and it is most evident inside. The door tops and other surfaces have a soft-touch finish, and the simple dash design cleanly integrates Toyota's touch-screen infotainment. However, there are shortcomings. There's no telescoping steering wheel available, making it hard to get comfortable. Rear-seat passengers are going to feel cramped, and that's whether you pick the 3-door or 5-door Yaris. Behind the seats is some decent cargo space though, and the manually adjusting front seats are pretty comfortable.</p>, <p>Whether you choose the 3-door or 5-door model, the 2018 Toyota Yaris has the same exterior dimensions, the primary distinction being the slightly sportier look of the 3-door. If you plan on using that rear seat frequently, the 5-door offers much better access. We like the new nose, and the way it gives the little Yaris an aggressive, bulldog-like look. But this is French bulldog, not English, and the squat proportions make it kinda cute. The SE adds a bit of visual pizazz like black trim and a rear spoiler.</p>, <p>Most prominent among the standard features is the Toyota Safety Sense-C suite of active safety features, new last year. In addition, you get power windows and locks, air conditioning, and an infotainment system with a 6.1-inch touch screen, Entune, AM/FM/CD player, HD Radio, USB port and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. However, this is a base model of an already-cheap car, so the base model is missing power-mirror adjustments, cruise control and steering-wheel-mounted audio buttons, all standard on the LE model that also adds keyless entry and an automatic transmission. All models include ToyotaCare, which grants two years/25,000 miles of scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance.</p>, <p>If you want more stuff in your Yaris, you have to climb the trim ladder. We mentioned what the LE adds; if you want all the things, you'll have to step up to the SE. That brings along a "sport-tuned" suspension, LED daytime running lights, projector-beam headlights with LED accent bar, 16-inch alloy wheels, and interior and exterior accents. One quick pro tip: If you want a 5-door Yaris with a manual transmission, the SE is the only way to go. The SE also adds a larger touch screen (7.0 inch) and navigation.</p>, <p>There's one engine for the 2018 Toyota Yaris: a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder that's good for 106 horsepower. It sends this to the front wheels through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. That's not a lot of power, and the transmissions' gear count is low by today's standards, but the Yaris holds its own around town. Out on the highway though it's the Little Engine That Barely Can, and that goes double if you want to pass someone; instead, we suggest learning the power of patience. The clunky manual feels antiquated in its operation, too. Fuel economy is pretty good though, and the little engine goes just fine on regular-grade gasoline.<br>
<br>
 1.5-liter inline-4<br>

 103 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/36 mpg (manual), 30/35 mpg (automatic)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The least you can pay for the 2018 Toyota Yaris L with a manual transmission is $16,520, which includes the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and the $885 destination charge. On the other side of the equation is the 5-door Yaris SE with an automatic transmission, a combination that puts you out $19,945. That's not bad for a new Toyota, but it's on the high side for the subcompact segment. Both the Ford Fiesta <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> and hatchback squeak in below the Yaris, as do the Hyundai Accent and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa%20note/">Nissan Versa Note</a>. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Yaris. While this Toyota's initial price is slightly higher than the competition, it is expected to hold its value better than most, trailing only the Honda Fit in residuals.</p>]

[<p>Returning to its small-car roots, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/toyota/">Toyota</a> borrows the global Mazda2 platform in a joint venture that results in the very sporty, very stylish and very economical <a alt_o_t="Year Make Model " href="/toyota/yaris%20ia/2018/">2018 Toyota Yaris iA</a> subcompact <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>. Mazda’s flair for making an inexpensive interior look elegant is on full display in the Yaris iA, and Toyota has given the car enough visual styling cues to make sure it looks more Toyota than <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/mazda/">Mazda</a>. While the Yaris iA does come with low-speed collision-avoidance technology, unlike the Toyota-built Yaris, it doesn’t feature Toyota’s more robust Safety Sense C system. Still, the Yaris iA is a fun, inexpensive and feature-rich <a alt_o_t="Compact Car" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-cars/2000010127/">small car</a> more visually alluring than the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/rio/">Kia Rio</a> and backed by Toyota’s excellent reputation for strong resale and reliability.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an inexpensive <a alt_o_t="New Car" href="/new-cars/">new car</a> with great fuel economy, an attractive interior and lots of cool features all for around $17,000, the 2018 Toyota Yaris iA sedan deserves a test drive. The standard low-speed collision-avoidance system and extensive Toyota dealership network only serve to sweeten the deal.</p>, <p>Toyota’s 2018 Yaris iA sedan comes in only one nicely equipped configuration. If you’re looking for more options or choices, you’ll be better off shopping the new Kia Rio. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a> offers a turbocharged model, while the smaller <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/yaris/">Toyota Yaris</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> has more standard driver-assist features.</p>, <p>The 2018 Toyota Yaris iA carries over with no major changes or updates.</p>, <p>Despite its small size and lack of a center armrest, the 2018 Toyota Yaris iA’s interior is actually quite comfortable. Tall drivers will appreciate the 10 inches of seat travel and tilt/telescopic steering column as well as the form-fitting bucket seats. A large screen atop the dash handles all infotainment functions, controlled by a logically placed rotary knob on the lower console. Climate controls are also large and easy to see and use, as are all the backlit buttons at night. Once in motion, the Yaris iA isn’t as dialed in as the Ford Fiesta, but it does deliver a spirited driving experience once you get it up to speed. The little 1.5-liter engine doesn’t have much muscle, but the slick-shifting 6-speed manual makes milking the engine for all it's worth a fun little game. There’s more body roll than we’d like in tight corners, and the cabin can be a bit noisy at speed, but this is an entry-level subcompact, after all.</p>, <p>TOUCH OR REMOTE CONTROLLED INFOTAINMENT<br>
 The Yaris iA’s menu-driven infotainment system uses a 7-inch touch-screen display for audio, media, navigation and mobile apps. Once in motion, the touch screen is locked out leaving control in the hands of a rotary push control knob located directly where the driver’s right hand naturally comes to rest.<br>
<br>
 LOW-SPEED PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM<br>
 Effective at speeds up to 18 mph, the Yaris iA’s low-speed pre-collision warning system scans the road ahead for potential trouble and alerts the driver. The system can even activate the brakes and bring the car to a stop.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Except for the budget-grade headliner, the Toyota Yaris iA’s cabin looks and feels more sophisticated than its entry-level status would suggest. Although the average American might find them a bit snug, the front seats are supportive. Rear legroom is plentiful for this class, and the trunk is roomier than that of a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a>. Complaints? Sun visors don’t slide to block the sun, and the push-button ignition system lacks a passive-entry function. This results in a worst-of-both-worlds situation, where you remove the key fob from your pocket or bag only to put it right back in once the doors are unlocked.</p>, <p>The iA’s cleanly styled exterior is highlighted by a bold front fascia treatment set off with Toyota’s now-signature piano-black accenting, prominent character lines, and standard 16-inch alloy wheels. We also found nighttime visibility to be quite good for a car fitted with traditional multi-reflector headlights in lieu of more modern projector-beam units.</p>, <p>Every Yaris iA comes standard with cruise control, a 6-way-adjustable driver’s seat, LED turn-signal indicators, alloy wheels, Bluetooth, and a 6-speaker audio system linked to a 7-inch display and two USB ports. On the safety side of the ledger you’ll find six airbags, the aforementioned low-speed pre-collision system, and a rearview camera.</p>, <p>True to its <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/scion/">Scion</a> roots, the 2018 Toyota Yaris iA adheres to a mono-spec packaging structure. This means that beyond the transmission and exterior color, your options are limited to dealer-installed options like a center armrest ($195), front doorsill appliqués ($150), a rear spoiler ($365) and a plug-and-play navigation upgrade ($399).</p>, <p>The lone engine offered is a Mazda-sourced 1.5-liter, direct-injected 4-cylinder that makes 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. It drives the front wheels through a standard 6-speed manual or an optional 6-speed automatic transmission that’ll set you back an extra $1,100 or so. Fuel economy is predictably impressive, scoring EPA combined figures in the mid- to high-30-mpg range regardless of which transmission you choose.<br>

Chevy Sonic, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/hyundai/accent/">Hyundai Accent</a> and Kia Rio base models undercut the iA by roughly $1,500 to $2,000, but end up costing more when comparably equipped. The Ford Fiesta Titanium boasts such standards as leather and heated front seats as well as a more engaging driving experience for a nominal premium of about $1,000. The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/versa/">Nissan Versa</a> SV includes virtually everything found in a loaded iA, for about $500 less. Kelley Blue Book expects the 2018 Yaris iA to hold its resale value better than the Ford Fiesta, Kia Rio, Chevy Sonic, Hyundai Accent and even the Nissan Versa.

---------http://www.kbb.com/volkswagen/atlas/2018
[<p>The Atlas is <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a>'s first foray into the world of midsize 3-row <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>. It came late to the party, but brought a low starting price and an excellent warranty to make up for it. The attractive SUV offers two things you would expect from a VW: an elegant, tech-friendly cabin and a European-inspired driving attitude. Appealing additions to the mix are a spacious, easy-to-access third row, and seats that actually fold flat. While the Atlas could use an engine with more power than the V6 provides, this SUV is a bona-fide competitor for <a alt_o_t="Midsize SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-midsize-crossover-suvs/2000010291/">midsize SUV</a> heavyweights like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/pilot/">Honda Pilot</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/nissan/pathfinder/">Nissan Pathfinder</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/explorer/">Ford Explorer</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/highlander/">Toyota Highlander</a>.</p>, <p>With arguably the roomiest and most easily accessible third row in its class, the 2018 Atlas is a breath of fresh air for tall sixth and seventh passengers. This is also the only midsize SUV that can give you the Euro-inspired driving experience that endears fans to the Volkswagen brand.</p>, <p>The 3.6-liter engine is underpowered in a vehicle this size. In addition, while there's plenty of appealing technology in the Atlas, the route you have to take to reach it can be counterintuitive. Accessing it can take navigating through multiple menus. Plus, maximum towing capacity is only 5,000 pounds.</p>, <p>The 2018 Atlas is an all-new vehicle. Tech-friendly and loaded with safety features, Volkswagen's first 3-row SUV combines entertaining driving dynamics with an interior that's both practical and luxurious. The Atlas's base 2.0-liter turbo-4 is the newest engine in VW's portfolio.</p>, <p>The new Atlas initially will be available with a 276-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 with an 8-speed automatic transmission (front- or all-wheel drive [FWD, AWD]) and later, a 235-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder (FWD only) with V6-like torque. The V6/8-speed is a refined combination, but power is just adequate. With two people aboard, climbing grades was acceptable, but the engine may be overtasked when the Atlas is filled with people and gear. There are Eco, Normal, Sport and Individual driving modes. In Normal mode, steering is very light and lacks the trademark VW fun. We put it in Sport mode and kept it there: it makes the Atlas engaging, with greatly improved steering and transmission response, and snaking through canyons, it's agile like a smaller vehicle. The comfortable ride did not come at the expense of handling, and the interior was quiet. Braking was linear and smooth, with just the right amount of response.</p>, <p>THIRD ROW<br>
 We can't say enough about how good this third row is. It's easy to get into and out of, and there's so much head- and legroom that tall adults can sit back there comfortably. Also, when it and the second row are folded down, the cargo area is legitimately flat<br>
<br>
 SPORT MODE<br>
 The new Atlas offers four on-road driving modes, including Normal and Sport. With Sport mode, the Atlas comes to life, with sharper steering, and quicker throttle and transmission response. It even changes how the Adaptive Cruise Control responds. This is how to make driving the Atlas feel like driving a VW.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Atlas's interior design is elegant and clean, not unlike the simple modern layout of the upscale <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> brand. But the best part of the cabin is its versatility. The 60/40-split second row reclines and slides 7.7 inches back and forth. It folds in such a way that it can hold a child seat in place while someone gets into the third row. The third row is very easy to get into and out of, and is roomy enough to comfortably accommodate two tall adults. And when the two back rows are down, the cavernous space created is legitimately flat.</p>, <p>With all this talk of interior volume and spaciousness, you might think the 2018 Atlas is too big to fit in a garage. However, the Atlas is smaller than other SUVs in its class. Full credit goes to Volkswagen for some of the smartest interior packaging we've seen in quite some time. In addition, the large cargo area is easy to access, with an optional power tailgate that can be upgraded to allow opening with the sweep of one foot under the rear bumper. You can even add 20-inch wheels, LED taillights (SEL Premium), or an R-Line styling package.</p>, <p>Those who buy the Atlas S will get a front-drive SUV equipped with a 2.0-liter turbo 4-cylinder engine with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Cruise control, power mirrors, 2-zone climate control, Bluetooth, CarPlay/Android Auto, 6.5-inch touch screen and a 6-speaker audio system also come at the Atlas's $31,425 starting price. The S comes with three rows of cloth-covered seats, front LED lighting and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Standard safety equipment includes six airbags, automatic post-collision braking, and VW's Intelligent Crash Response System, which cuts the fuel supply, unlocks the doors and turns on the hazard lights in the event of a crash.</p>, <p>Volkswagen offers an extensive list of options for the 2018 Atlas. A V6 engine and all-wheel drive are available, as are VW's Digital Cockpit, an 8-inch touch screen with navigation, an area-view camera, adaptive cruise control, 3-zone climate control, leather seats with heating in the first two rows and cooling up front, a power liftgate you can open by moving your foot, panoramic sunroof, remote start, 115-volt power outlet, rain-sensing windshield wipers and an 8-speaker audio system. Power-folding heated side mirrors and 20-inch black wheels are also available. Added safety includes blind-spot monitoring, lane assist and park assist.</p>, <p>When the Atlas first went on sale, the sole engine was a 276-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 with an 8-speed automatic transmission, with either front- or all-wheel drive. Later, a 235-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder will round out the line, also using an 8-speed automatic. This engine brings with it the advantage of decent fuel economy while offering nearly as much torque. All Atlases that have all-wheel drive come with driving mode selections. Off-road modes let you choose the ideal setup for the type of terrain and weather you encounter, while on-road modes alter throttle, transmission and steering for Eco, Normal and Sport modes.<br>

All Atlases come with an impressive transferrable 6-year/72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty. The trim levels move up, through SE, SE with Technology, SEL, and the top-line V6-only SEL Premium, which at $49,415 comes with basically everything. In fact, some of the Atlas's features are only available on the SEL Premium. The Atlas's pricing aligns nicely with what you’d expect in a Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer or Toyota Highlander.

[<p>Available as a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a> or convertible, the turbocharged 2018 Volkswagen Beetle is all about affordable fun. With a new more powerful and fuel-efficient engine, along with its iconic and timeless shape, the new VW Beetle perfectly blends a retro vibe with modern style, safety and features. The desirable combination makes it a standout against a small pack of rivals including the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mini/cooper/">Mini Cooper</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/fiat/500/">Fiat 500</a>. The 2018 Volkswagen Beetle is available in four trim levels; S, Coast, SE and Dune, with prices starting just over $21,000 for a Beetle S coupe. A Beetle S convertible costs about $5,000 more. All new Beetles are front-wheel drive, come with a standard 6-speed automatic transmission and they’re powered by a new 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that makes 174 horsepower, which is strong for its class.</p>, <p>At its base price around $21,000, the new 2018 VW Beetle offers huge smiles-per-dollar value. It’s one of the happiest and the most stylish cars available at that price, and its new turbocharged 2.0-liter engine gives it more standard power than the Mini Cooper or the Fiat 500.</p>, <p>The Mini Cooper’s 1.5-liter base engine doesn’t pack the power of the Beetle’s new turbocharged 2.0-liter, but the Mini gets better gas mileage. The Mini also offers a manual transmission, and the 189-horsepower Mini Cooper S outpowers the VW. Plus, the Mini is available with four doors, which the Beetle is not.</p>, <p>For 2018, every new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/beetle/">Volkswagen Beetle</a> gets a larger and more powerful 174-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that also improves the VW’s fuel economy. Also new is the Coast trim level, which gets a surfboard-inspired wood-look dash pad, and a longer warranty that covers every new <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> for six years or 72,000 miles. The Beetle R-Line has been discontinued.</p>, <p>The 2018 VW Beetle is a sporty drive, with plenty of power and agile handling. It’s no hot rod, but it’s fun to drive and it’s more comfortable than a Mini Cooper or a Fiat 500, with a smoother ride and a quiet interior. At freeway speeds, the Beetle feels stable and solid, returning the kind of ride and handling more commonly associated with a midsize sedan. Though slightly higher-riding, the Beetle Dune feels nearly similar to the standard model. The Beetle’s new 174-horsepower turbocharged engine is also satisfying. It provides strong acceleration and good passing power, and it’s well-matched to the Beetle’s 6-speed automatic transmission, which has a manual mode if you’d like to choose your own gears and a Sport mode for more aggressive response. Visibility is excellent, although it’s a bit less so in Beetle <a alt_o_t="Convertibles" href="/convertible/">convertibles</a>. With the soft top up or down, rearward visibility is compromised by the roof’s large pillars and high stack.</p>, <p>FENDER PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEM<br>
 One of the strongest audio systems available in this class, the VW Beetle’s optional Fender Premium Audio System packs 400 watts of power and a subwoofer mounted in the trunk. Created in collaboration between Fender and Panasonic, the Beetle’s Fender system features four speakers and four tweeters for high-quality sound.<br>
<br>
 DRIVER-ASSISTANCE TECHNOLOGY<br>
 A rearview camera is standard on every 2018 VW Beetle, as is an Intelligent Crash Response System that cuts the engine’s fuel supply, unlocks the doors and activates the hazard lights in the event of an airbag deployment. The Beetle’s Automatic Post-Collision Braking System also slows the vehicle after an accident to avoid secondary collisions. A Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert as well as bumper-mounted parking sensors are also available.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Front-seat space and comfort are exceptional. The Beetle’s front bucket seats are well-shaped and supportive and there’s enough headroom for Shaq in a 10-gallon hat. The Beetle’s back seat can handle two, but it’s tight back there for tall adults. The interior design is clean and modern with simple and easy-to-use controls, but there’s just enough retro to be found in the shape of the dashboard and the gauges, which keeps things interesting. Multiple storage bins hold cell phones and small items, and there’s an upper, secondary glove box. Coupe models have a hatchback design and surprising cargo space -- 15.4 cubic feet with rear seats upright. Convertibles have less than half that room, and trunk access is awkward.</p>, <p>One the most recognizable shapes in all of automobiledom, the Beetle’s arching roof, curvaceous fenders and short front and rear overhangs are as iconic as any low-slung <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/ferrari/">Ferrari</a>. And the design still turns heads. A rear spoiler adds sporty appeal and a visual break from the rest of the Beetle's mounds of round, and we dig the retro wheel design on the Coast trim level. Convertible Beetle models have a power-operated folding fabric top and a trunklid instead of the hardtop's liftgate. The Beetle Dune is slightly wider and rides a tad higher, which gives it a rugged off-road-ready look, kinda like a Baja Bug if you want to turn back the clock that far.</p>, <p>The new VW Beetle S coupe features a standard automatic transmission, cruise control, heated side mirrors, a rearview camera, auto-dimming rearview mirror 16-inch alloy wheels, 6-way-manual-adjust front seats and 50/50-split folding rear seats. Entertainment and audio are provided by an 8-speaker AM/FM/CD system with USB and auxiliary inputs, plus Bluetooth connectivity. Also standard is a leather-wrapped steering wheel with tilt and telescopic adjustability. The 2018 Beetle S with Style and Comfort adds V-Tex Leatherette seating, heated front seats, keyless access and an upgraded 6.3-inch touch-screen infotainment system with VW's Car-Net app system compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>, <p>Climbing further up the trim chain, a 2018 Beetle Coast adds a unique surfboard look to the dashboard, unique seat fabric and a panoramic sunroof. It rides on 17-inch wheels. The Beetle SE gets blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, automatic dual-zone climate control, keyless entry and push-button start. The top-of-the-range Beetle Dune adds unique front and rear bumpers, which look a little more rugged, bi-xenon headlights, the Fender Premium Audio System, which is also available on the Beetle SE, and 18-inch wheels.</p>, <p>All 2018 VW Beetles, including the Dune and all convertibles, use a new 174-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine with direct fuel injection that most buyers will find plenty adequate for highway cruising and zipping around the city. The engine is linked to 6-speed automatic transmission with a manual mode as well as a Sport mode for quicker response. No manual transmission is available and every Beetle is front-wheel drive. The turbo engine can run on less expensive regular-grade gasoline.<br>

The Beetle Coast coupe is even more recommendable, starting just under $24,000. The SE variant begins closer to $25,000, and the Beetle Dune makes its own statement at around $28,000. 2018 Beetle Convertible models begin over $26,000 and top out just under $33,000 for a Beetle Dune convertible. The Beetle's base price remains slightly below that of the Mini Cooper 2-door. It is above that of the Fiat 500, but that subcompact is less recommendable.

---------http://www.kbb.com/volkswagen/golf/2018
[<p>Fuel-efficient, fun-to-drive and well equipped, Volkswagen offers the popular 2018 VW Golf in an extensive variety of 4-door hatchbacks and wagons. Hatchback models include two high-performance hot hatchbacks, the legendary GTI and the 292-horsepower all-wheel-drive Golf R, and the all-electric e-Golf. The as well as the Golf SportWagen and all-wheel-drive Alltrack wagon versions are reviewed separately. Hatchback prices start around $21,000 with a manual transmission and a 170-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine rated at an impressive 25 mpg in the city and 36 mpg out on the highway. Comfortable, sporty and stylish, the 2018 VW Golf is one of our favorites in the crowded compact class, which also includes the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, Mazda3 and Hyundai Elantra.</p>, <p>With its strong performance, impressive fuel economy, high safety ratings and class-leading fit and finish, the 2018 VW Golf offers an affordable, fun-to-drive package with European flair. The 220-horsepower GTI model is a favorite with enthusiasts all over the world.</p>, <p>Volkswagen does not offer the 2018 Golf as a sedan. If you’re looking for a traditional trunk, the automaker’s popular Jetta model is the same size as the Golf with similar styling. The two also share engines, transmissions, suspensions and interiors. If the Golf’s rear legroom is too tight for your needs, check out the more spacious Honda Civic.</p>, <p>For 2018, Golf hatchback models are offered in Golf S and a new Golf SE trim level. Both get new, larger infotainment touch screens and refreshed front and rear styling that includes LED daytime running lights. All Volkswagens are now backed by a new 6-year/72,000-mile limited warranty, which is one of the longest in the industry. The Golf GTI gets a 10-horsepower increase to 220 horsepower.</p>, <p>From behind the wheel the 2018 VW Golf is one of our favorite compacts, offering a desirable combination of comfort and performance. In all of its forms, the Golf is refined and quiet, but also responsive and sporty, with quick handling and powerful turbocharged engines that provide a satisfying jump off the line. The 170-horsepower Golf S and SE hatchbacks are peppy and handle better than most compacts. And the Golf’s suspension works well with the hatchback’s strong structure to smooth out rough roads. The 220-horsepower Golf GTI is an enthusiast favorite and the 292-horsepower Golf R thrills with all-wheel-drive traction and 0-60-mph acceleration in less than five seconds. Both offer a 6-speed manual transmission, but most buyers choose the excellent DSG dual-clutch automatic, which can be shifted manually via steering-wheel paddle shifters.</p>, <p>4Motion ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
 Volkswagen is one of the few automakers to offer all-wheel drive in the compact class. VW’s excellent 4Motion all-wheel-drive system is standard equipment on the Golf R. The system increases the Golf’s traction on all road surfaces including the snowy and slushy.<br>
<br>
 e-Golf<br>
 Sometimes lost in the Golf’s extensive lineup is the impressive all-electric e-Golf, which offers all of the style, comfort and versatility of the Golf hatchback but with a zero-emissions powertrain. The fun-to-drive e-Golf is quick and agile with a range of 125 miles on a full charge. Powering up its depleted battery pack takes about six hours with a 240V-charging station.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Visibility is excellent thanks to the VW Golf’s large windows and thin pillars. Supportive and well-shaped, the driver’s seat is height adjustable, and a tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel is standard. Getting comfortable in the Golf is not an issue. The overall interior design is upscale and maybe a bit understated with high-quality materials, soft-touch surfaces and, on higher trims, piano-black accents. The cabin has generous shoulder room in both rows. Cargo volume is 16.5 cubic feet below the parcel shelf and 22.8 cubic feet to the roof. The rear seat has a 60/40-split rear-folding back, expanding the load space to 52.7 cubic feet when lowered.</p>, <p>One of the most recognizable and popular cars in the world, the 2018 VW Golf is also one of the most attractive cars in the compact class. Although its shape continues to offer a connection to the original Golf, which became a fashion icon over 40 years ago, the new VW Golf is highly tailored with crisp character lines, a steep hood and a narrow horizontal grille flanked by sharp headlight clusters. The car sits low to the ground and has a wide track, giving it a more muscular, purposeful appearance, and its distinctive C-pillar treatment visually pushes the hatchback down into the road.</p>, <p>Among the 2018 Golf S trim’s standard features are power windows and door locks, air conditioning, a 6.5-inch touch-screen infotainment system, Bluetooth, alloy wheels, cloth seating, steering-wheel controls, rearview camera and cruise control. The SE adds V-Tex Leatherette seating, heated front seats, push-button start, an 8-inch touch screen, blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic detection, Forward Collision Warning and autonomous braking. GTI SE models add the Fender Premium Audio System, rain-sensing wipers and leather seats. The Autobahn brings unique 18-inch alloy wheels, navigation and sport comfort seats with 12-way-power adjustment. In addition to blistering performance, the Golf R offers leather seats, automatic climate control, navigation and bi-xenon headlights. VW's DCC adaptive-damping system can tailor the car for Comfort, Normal or Race modes.</p>, <p>A 6-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission is available on all 2018 VW Golf TSI models, while the GTI offers a 6-speed DSG automatic and the Golf R offers a new 7-speed DSG automatic. A Driver Assistance Package includes autonomous braking, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitor. On cars already equipped with these features, the package adds lane assist, front and rear park-distance control, park-steering assist and auto high beams. On the GTI, options include an adaptive-damping system and a performance package, which features larger brakes.</p>, <p>For 2018, VW Golf engines include a turbocharged gasoline 4-cylinder in 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter displacements. The TSI models use a 1.8-liter engine available with a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, while the GTI's 2.0-liter comes with a 6-speed manual transmission or, optionally, the 6-speed DSG automatic. The 292-horsepower 2.0-liter Golf R has all-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual along with an available 7-speed DSG automatic. Unleaded regular is recommended on the 1.8-liter TSI, while the 2.0-liter GTI and R require premium fuel. The e-Golf uses an electric motor and has an estimated range of 125 miles.

[<p>All-new just last year, the 2018 VW Golf Alltrack is a sporty compact wagon with a fuel-efficient turbocharged engine and standard all-wheel drive (AWD). With additional ground clearance, rugged SUV styling and an off-road driving mode, the new Alltrack is fun to drive and ready for adventure. Main competitors include the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a>, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/crosstrek/">Subaru Crosstrek</a> and the more expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/allroad/">Audi Allroad</a>. Three trim levels are available, S, SE and SEL with prices starting around $26,500. Each comes with a sprightly 170-horsepower 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder, which it shares with the Golf hatchback and Golf SportWagen. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard in the S and SE models, but a slick-shifting 6-speed dual-clutch automatic with paddle shifters is available for an additional $1,100. The automatic is standard on the top-of-the-range Alltrack SEL, which costs over $36,000.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a stylish, affordable and fun all-wheel-drive wagon to get you through snowy winters and get your mountain bike to the trailhead, you’ll like the 2018 VW Golf Alltrack. A real alternative to the gaggle of <a alt_o_t="Compact SUVs" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUVs</a>, the Alltrack delivers an upscale, premium feel as well as impressive fuel efficiency. Plus it’s ranked a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>, <p>Some may find the 2018 VW Alltrack to be too small for their needs. The Subaru Outback is larger and it offers more ground clearance. Audi’s stylish Allroad is far more expensive, but it’s also larger than the Alltrack and packs significantly more power. Hardcore off-roaders should be shopping trucks with a 2-speed transfer case, which these wagons do not offer.</p>, <p>For 2018 the Golf Alltrack gets new LED taillights, LED daytime-running lights and automatic headlights as well as a longer warranty. Base S models also get a larger 6.5-inch touch screen and connectivity upgrades. The SE trim level has been updated with an 8-inch touch screen and a long list of new standard safety systems including Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking.</p>, <p>The new Golf Alltrack is rewarding and surprisingly adept on-road and off. On pavement, it drives much like a standard Golf SportWagen: quick, nimble and compliant. The 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is mostly smooth. We like its traditional shift points more than the continuously variable transmission (CVT) used by <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a>. The 2018 Alltrack is fun to throw into corners, and its steering firms up nicely after initial softness at lower speeds. The new VW Alltrack is well-suited for dirt roads and is capable of light off-roading. Treated as a rally car, the Alltrack is a blast to fling around, and it can make an amateur look like a pro. Pushed hard, the Alltrack will slide just enough for grins until traction and stability controls kick in. The Haldex 4Motion AWD system aptly puts power to the wheel where it's needed, and the built-in hill-descent control helps ease the car down steeper grades.</p>, <p>DRIVER-ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS<br>
 For 2018 the VW Golf Alltrack with the SE trim level comes standard with Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking, as well as Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert. The top SEL trim level adds Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning, parking sensors and Park Assist, which will practically park the wagon for you.<br>
<br>
 FENDER PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEM<br>
 Standard on the 2018 VW Golf Alltrack SEL, this premium sound system packs 400 watts of power through nine speakers and a subwoofer mounted in the cargo area. The award-winning system, created by Fender and Panasonic, is one of the best audio systems in the class with incredible depth and detail.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> is known for its well-built, high-quality and comfortable interiors, and the cabin of the 2018 VW Alltrack lives up to those expectations. The wagon seats five and offers 35.6 inches of rear legroom, with is plenty unless you’re well over 6-feet tall. The front seats are supportive, the driving position is perfect and there’s an adjustable center armrest. The climate and audio systems are easy to use. Behind its rear seat the cargo area measures an ample 30.4 cubic feet of space. When more is needed, you can fold its rear seat, which is split 60/40, and increase the cargo capacity to 66.5 cubic feet, which rivals many small SUVs.</p>, <p>Although it’s based on the VW Golf SportWagen, the Alltrack’s raised suspension, unique front and rear bumpers, and dark body cladding along its side sills and wheel arches give it a tough, rugged look. It isn’t over the top, like it’s looking to charge through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but it doesn’t look like a traditional wagon either. For 2018 VW has added LED taillights and LED daytime-running lights for a more modern look. S and SE trim levels get 17-inch wheels and tires, while the top Alltrack SEL rolls on 18s. Silver mirrors and roof rails are standard and the lower-window chrome molding adds some upscale flair.</p>, <p>The 2018 VW Golf Alltrack comes in three trims: S, SE and SEL. The least expensive Alltrack S is well equipped and completely recommendable. It includes faux-leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, a rearview camera, automatic headlights, heated front seats, heated side mirrors and windshield-washer nozzles, 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, 8-way partially power-operated driver's seat, rearview camera and a 6.5-inch touch-screen infotainment system with AM/FM/CD player with HD Radio, USB and Bluetooth connectivity. The standard Car-Net system works with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone apps. All-wheel drive is standard on all trim levels and features an off-road mode and hill-descent control.</p>, <p>For a better equipped 2018 VW Alltrack we recommend stepping up to the mid-trim SE, which brings keyless entry, push-button start, an 8-inch touch screen, a power panoramic sunroof, forward-collision warning with automatic emergency braking as well as Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert. The top-line Alltrack SEL variant adds dual-zone climate control, Fender premium audio system and upgraded infotainment-system navigation with off-road data, plus 18-inch wheels and a 12-way-power driver's seat. The Alltrack SEL also gets Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning, parking sensors and Park Assist, which will practically park the wagon for you.</p>, <p>While the Subaru Outback offers a choice of 4- or 6-cylinder engines, the 2018 Golf Alltrack offers only one, but it shines: VW's 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Putting out 170 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque, this invigorating engine easily pushes the new Alltrack and happily drinks regular unleaded. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard on the S and SE trim levels, but the dual-clutch 6-speed automatic transmission, which is standard on the Alltrack SEL, is offered for an additional $1,100. At up to 32 mpg on the highway, the Golf Alltrack has respectable fuel economy, but unlike the Subaru Outback, the Alltrack is not rated to tow. All-wheel drive is standard on all models.<br>

 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 24/33 mpg (manual), 22/30 mpg (automatic)</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Including the $850 destination charge, the new 2018 VW Golf Alltrack has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $26,805 for a base model with a 6-speed manual transmission. The SE, which adds many desirable safety systems, costs $30,615. The available dual-clutch 6-speed automatic adds $1,100 to both trim levels. The SEL model starts over $36,000, which is still about $9,000 less than an Audi Allroad. At these prices, the Golf Alltrack starts just above its main rival, the Subaru Outback. Those looking to spend less could opt for the smaller Subaru Crosstrek, or a less-rugged <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/golf%20sportwagen/">Volkswagen Golf SportWagen</a>, which offers all-wheel drive. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new VW. Volkswagens tend to trail others in holding their value, and the Golf Alltrack trails the Subaru Outback in this regard.</p>]

[<p>Fuel-efficient, fun-to-drive and well equipped, Volkswagen offers the popular 2018 VW Golf in an extensive variety of 4-door hatchbacks and wagons. Hatchback models include two high-performance hot hatchbacks, the legendary GTI and the 292-horsepower all-wheel-drive Golf R, and the all-electric e-Golf. The as well as the Golf SportWagen and all-wheel-drive Alltrack wagon versions are reviewed separately. Hatchback prices start around $21,000 with a manual transmission and a 170-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine rated at an impressive 25 mpg in the city and 36 mpg out on the highway. Comfortable, sporty and stylish, the 2018 VW Golf is one of our favorites in the crowded compact class, which also includes the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, Mazda3 and Hyundai Elantra.</p>, <p>With its strong performance, impressive fuel economy, high safety ratings and class-leading fit and finish, the 2018 VW Golf offers an affordable, fun-to-drive package with European flair. The 220-horsepower GTI model is a favorite with enthusiasts all over the world.</p>, <p>Volkswagen does not offer the 2018 Golf as a sedan. If you’re looking for a traditional trunk, the automaker’s popular Jetta model is the same size as the Golf with similar styling. The two also share engines, transmissions, suspensions and interiors. If the Golf’s rear legroom is too tight for your needs, check out the more spacious Honda Civic.</p>, <p>For 2018, Golf hatchback models are offered in Golf S and a new Golf SE trim level. Both get new, larger infotainment touch screens and refreshed front and rear styling that includes LED daytime running lights. All Volkswagens are now backed by a new 6-year/72,000-mile limited warranty, which is one of the longest in the industry. The Golf GTI gets a 10-horsepower increase to 220 horsepower.</p>, <p>From behind the wheel the 2018 VW Golf is one of our favorite compacts, offering a desirable combination of comfort and performance. In all of its forms, the Golf is refined and quiet, but also responsive and sporty, with quick handling and powerful turbocharged engines that provide a satisfying jump off the line. The 170-horsepower Golf S and SE hatchbacks are peppy and handle better than most compacts. And the Golf’s suspension works well with the hatchback’s strong structure to smooth out rough roads. The 220-horsepower Golf GTI is an enthusiast favorite and the 292-horsepower Golf R thrills with all-wheel-drive traction and 0-60-mph acceleration in less than five seconds. Both offer a 6-speed manual transmission, but most buyers choose the excellent DSG dual-clutch automatic, which can be shifted manually via steering-wheel paddle shifters.</p>, <p>4Motion ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br>
 Volkswagen is one of the few automakers to offer all-wheel drive in the compact class. VW’s excellent 4Motion all-wheel-drive system is standard equipment on the Golf R. The system increases the Golf’s traction on all road surfaces including the snowy and slushy.<br>
<br>
 e-Golf<br>
 Sometimes lost in the Golf’s extensive lineup is the impressive all-electric e-Golf, which offers all of the style, comfort and versatility of the Golf hatchback but with a zero-emissions powertrain. The fun-to-drive e-Golf is quick and agile with a range of 125 miles on a full charge. Powering up its depleted battery pack takes about six hours with a 240V-charging station.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Visibility is excellent thanks to the VW Golf’s large windows and thin pillars. Supportive and well-shaped, the driver’s seat is height adjustable, and a tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel is standard. Getting comfortable in the Golf is not an issue. The overall interior design is upscale and maybe a bit understated with high-quality materials, soft-touch surfaces and, on higher trims, piano-black accents. The cabin has generous shoulder room in both rows. Cargo volume is 16.5 cubic feet below the parcel shelf and 22.8 cubic feet to the roof. The rear seat has a 60/40-split rear-folding back, expanding the load space to 52.7 cubic feet when lowered.</p>, <p>One of the most recognizable and popular cars in the world, the 2018 VW Golf is also one of the most attractive cars in the compact class. Although its shape continues to offer a connection to the original Golf, which became a fashion icon over 40 years ago, the new VW Golf is highly tailored with crisp character lines, a steep hood and a narrow horizontal grille flanked by sharp headlight clusters. The car sits low to the ground and has a wide track, giving it a more muscular, purposeful appearance, and its distinctive C-pillar treatment visually pushes the hatchback down into the road.</p>, <p>Among the 2018 Golf S trim’s standard features are power windows and door locks, air conditioning, a 6.5-inch touch-screen infotainment system, Bluetooth, alloy wheels, cloth seating, steering-wheel controls, rearview camera and cruise control. The SE adds V-Tex Leatherette seating, heated front seats, push-button start, an 8-inch touch screen, blind-spot monitor, rear cross-traffic detection, Forward Collision Warning and autonomous braking. GTI SE models add the Fender Premium Audio System, rain-sensing wipers and leather seats. The Autobahn brings unique 18-inch alloy wheels, navigation and sport comfort seats with 12-way-power adjustment. In addition to blistering performance, the Golf R offers leather seats, automatic climate control, navigation and bi-xenon headlights. VW's DCC adaptive-damping system can tailor the car for Comfort, Normal or Race modes.</p>, <p>A 6-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission is available on all 2018 VW Golf TSI models, while the GTI offers a 6-speed DSG automatic and the Golf R offers a new 7-speed DSG automatic. A Driver Assistance Package includes autonomous braking, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitor. On cars already equipped with these features, the package adds lane assist, front and rear park-distance control, park-steering assist and auto high beams. On the GTI, options include an adaptive-damping system and a performance package, which features larger brakes.</p>, <p>For 2018, VW Golf engines include a turbocharged gasoline 4-cylinder in 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter displacements. The TSI models use a 1.8-liter engine available with a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, while the GTI's 2.0-liter comes with a 6-speed manual transmission or, optionally, the 6-speed DSG automatic. The 292-horsepower 2.0-liter Golf R has all-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual along with an available 7-speed DSG automatic. Unleaded regular is recommended on the 1.8-liter TSI, while the 2.0-liter GTI and R require premium fuel. The e-Golf uses an electric motor and has an estimated range of 125 miles. It can recharge in about six hours on a 240-volt outlet and is compatible with DC fast-charging stations.<br>

For 2018, the VW Golf SportWagen is available in three trim levels, S, SE and SEL. All models are powered by a smooth, turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that makes 170 horsepower and provides impressive acceleration. Manual and automatic transmissions are available, and all-wheel drive costs an additional $2,250. This year, VW has also improved the SportWagen’s warranty, extending it to six years or 72,000 miles, which is longer than the coverage offered on the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a> and the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mini/clubman/">Mini Clubman</a>.</p>, <p>The 2018 VW Golf SportWagen carries like a small SUV, but it drives like a hot little hatchback. If you’re looking for an affordable, fun-to-drive and fuel-efficient wagon with available all-wheel drive, you’ll like the new SportWagen. It’s also rated a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>, <p>For about the same price, the popular Subaru Outback also offers all-wheel drive, plus it’s larger with significantly more people and cargo space. And when both are equipped with all-wheel drive and an automatic transmission, the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/subaru/">Subaru</a> is more fuel efficient. Buyers looking for the ultimate fuel efficiency should check out the hybrid-powered <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/niro/">Kia Niro</a>.</p>, <p>For 2018, all VW Golf models get a visual upgrade with new front-end styling, including new LED daytime-running lights, and LED taillights. The Golf SportWagen S trim adds standard automatic headlights, rain-sensing wipers and a 6.5-inch touch screen. VW has also improved the SportWagen’s warranty, extending it to six years or 72,000 miles, which is longer than most.</p>, <p>Sharing its suspension and engine with the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/golf/">Volkswagen Golf</a> makes the 2018 VW Golf SportWagen one fun little machine. The 1.8-liter TSI turbocharged 4-cylinder may not look like much on paper, but it delivers its power smoothly throughout the rev band, and is especially willing when power is needed for passing or merging. It’s also smooth and it delivers impressive fuel economy, especially on the highway. Although we love that VW offers a manual transmission, this one is a bit rubbery and vague. The automatic is a much better choice, offering similar fuel economy and still allowing the option of choosing your own gears. We found the SportWagen’s ride to be on the firm side, but its tight suspension allows for some very rapid high-speed maneuvers through twisting turns with very little evidence of torque steer. The available 4Motion AWD is a great feature; unfortunately, it’s available only on the base S trim level.</p>, <p>4MOTION ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br/> Despite its popularity, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> is one of the few automakers to offer all-wheel drive in the compact class. VW’s excellent 4Motion all-wheel-drive system is available on the Golf SportWagen for around $2,250. The system increases the wagon’s traction on all road surfaces including the snowy and slushy messes of winter.<br/> <br/> DRIVER-ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS<br/> For 2018 the new VW Golf SportWagen with the SE trim level comes standard with Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking, as well as Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert. The top SEL trim level adds Adaptive Cruise Control, which can follow the car ahead at a set speed and distance.<br/> </p>, <p>The 2018 VW Golf SportWagen has enough cargo space to rival many small SUVs. Behind its rear seat the cargo space measures 30.4 cubic feet. When more is needed, you can fold its rear seat, which is split 60/40, and increase the cargo capacity to 66.5 cubic feet. Up front the 2018 Golf SportWagen gets high marks for its interior. Materials used and fit and finish all look like they're from a higher class of car. Comfortable seating includes the rear seats, which offer decent legroom and headroom, even for taller passengers. The cloth seats on the base S trim are stylish and handsome.</p>, <p>It looks quite a bit longer than the Golf hatchback, because it is. The 2018 VW Golf SportWagen is about a foot longer than the hatchback. For 2018 VW has upgraded the look of the SportWagen with new front-end styling, including new LED daytime-running lights, and LED taillights. It’s a cleaner look and it gives the little wagon a more modern appearance. Wagons aren’t as common as they used to be, and the SportWagen’s long roof and upright hatch give it a distinctive European flavor. It looks sporty, especially with the larger wheels and tires of the SE trim level.</p>, <p>The base model VW Golf SportWagen S for 2018 comes pretty nicely equipped. For starters, the SportWagen TSI gets standard 15-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a 5-speed manual transmission, cloth seats, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, rearview camera, heated side mirrors, air conditioning, cruise control, automatic headlights, rain-sensing wipers and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, shift knob and handbrake lever. The standard audio system includes a 6.5-inch touch screen, eight speakers, Bluetooth, a CD player, SiriusXM satellite radio, and Volkswagen's Media Device Interface to connect your smartphone via Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or MirrorLink. SE models get standard 16-inch wheels, an 8-inch touch screen as well as Forward Collision Warning, Autonomous Emergency Braking and Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert.</p>, <p>Options are mostly divided among trim levels. Higher-level Golf SportWagen models (SE and SEL) get a standard automatic transmission. SE equipment also includes 16-inch wheels, heated front seats, Leatherette upholstery, keyless entry and ignition, corner-illuminating fog lights, panoramic sunroof and a rockin’ Fender audio system. The top SEL model adds 17-inch wheels, 12-way-power adjustment for the driver’s seat, automatic climate control, navigation and Adaptive Cruise control. All-wheel drive is available for an additional $2,250 on the S trim level. It’s offered with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel-drive S trim models can also be upgraded to a 6-speed automatic.</p>, <p>Under the hood of every new 2018 VW Golf SportWagen is Volkswagen's excellent 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. Known as the TSI, it puts out 170 horsepower to both front- and all-wheel-drive (FWD, AWD) models. Front-wheel-drive models are available with either a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, while SportWagens with all-wheel drive get a 6-speed manual or the 6-speed dual-clutch automatic from the Golf GTI.<br>
<br>
 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 170 horsepower @ 4,500 rpm<br>
 199 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600 rpm <br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/34 mpg (FWD, manual), 24/33 mpg (FWD, automatic), 22/31 mpg (AWD, manual), 22/29 mpg (AWD, automatic)</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for a 2018 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen starts low, with the 5-speed-manual-equipped TSI S just under $22,500 including an $850 destination fee. An automatic transmission adds $1,100 to the price of any SportWagen, while AWD adds $2,250 to the S trim level. We think the mid-level SE grade offers the best mix of standard features and price for around $28,000. A loaded SportWagen SEL costs over $31,000 so it isn’t as strong a value. Of course, you want a good deal, so check out KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price to see how much people in your area are paying for the new SportWagen. As for resale, the 2018 VW Golf SportWagen looks to be holding only average values, well below those of the Subaru Outback, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/cr-v/">Honda CR-V</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a>.</p>]

[<p>Volkswagen’s least expensive model, the 2018 Volkswagen Jetta is a sporty compact sedan with as much as 210 horsepower. Stylish, fuel-efficient and fun to drive, the new VW Jetta is available in six trim levels, Jetta S, Wolfsburg Edition, SE, SE Sport, SEL and GLI with prices starting under $20,000 with a manual transmission. All 2018 Jettas are powered by turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, ranging from a small 1.4-liter to the potent 2.0-liter in the performance-oriented Jetta GLI. This year, to help the Jetta compete with the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda3, Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze and Hyundai Elantra, it has bettered the sedan’s warranty considerably. New Jettas now come with a 6-year or 72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper Limited Warranty, which is better than most in the class.</p>, <p>If you desire a sporty fuel-efficient sedan with European flair and a comfortable, high-quality interior you’ll like the 2018 Volkswagen Jetta. VW is known for its excellent turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, and the 1.4-liter, 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter variants available in the Jetta are smooth, powerful and they can surely stretch a gallon of gas.</p>, <p>The Jetta is available only as a sedan. If you want a <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hatchback/">hatchback</a> or a small <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/wagon/">wagon</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> offers the very similar and popular Golf. If you’re looking for a diesel engine in this class, check out the Chevy Cruze, and if all-wheel drive is on your wish list, shop the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/impreza/">Subaru Impreza</a> or the VW Golf SportWagen.</p>, <p>For 2018, every trim level of the Jetta gets some styling tweaks to modernize their look. There's also a new value-oriented Wolfsburg Edition with additional creature comforts, including heated Leatherette seats and a unique front sport bumper with fog lights. This year, all Volkswagens get a longer 6-year/72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper Limited Warranty, which is better than most in the class.</p>, <p>Now in its sixth generation, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volkswagen/jetta/">Volkswagen Jetta</a> has been one of the most fun-to-drive small <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> since <i>The Dukes of Hazzard</i> aired on prime time. From behind the wheel the new 2018 Jetta feels small and agile, but also solid and strong. We appreciate the Jetta's responsive steering, and its suspension provides a taut but compliant ride, both in the city and out on the highway. The Jetta S, Wolfsburg Edition and SE models come with a 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that delivers good acceleration and great efficiency, while the Jetta SEL uses a larger, 1.8-liter turbo-4 that has more punch yet still offers good fuel economy. The Jetta GLI is the most powerful variant with its 210-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo, and combined with its sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels can be thought of as a less-expensive <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a3/">Audi A3</a>. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> is the luxury-brand cousin of Volkswagen and the A3 uses the same turbocharged 2.0-liter engine.</p>, <p>The result of collaboration between Fender and Panasonic, the Jetta’s available Fender Premium Audio System cranks 400 watts of power through nine speakers and a trunk-mounted subwoofer. The result is one of the strongest audio systems in the class with good tone, bangin’ bass and impressive highs. Crank it up.<br>
<br>
XDS CROSS DIFFERENTIAL SYSTEM<br>
 Featured on the performance-oriented Jetta GLI this technology improves the Jetta’s cornering performance. It’s an electronic substitute for a traditional mechanical limited-slip differential. If the Jetta’s front tires lose grip with the road while turning, the system automatically applies braking to the driven inside wheel to restore traction.<br>
</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The new VW Jetta is a 5-passenger sedan that offers good interior space, though rear legroom can't quite match that of the Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic. At 15.5 cubic feet, the Jetta's trunk is as big as that of a midsize sedan. The Jetta's interior feels minimalist and clean, with DNA from its European cousin Audi. We like small touches such as the adjustable armrest between the driver and passenger that comes on all but base models, and the 1-touch power operation for all four windows. Unlike competitors, genuine leather seating isn't offered -- just V-Tex Leatherette. All Jettas come with a simple-to-use touch-screen audio system.</p>, <p>This year VW’s designers put on a pot of dark roast and created a new chrome grille for many of the Jetta’s six trim levels, a new black grille for the Jetta SE, and a few other exterior tweaks including new badging and wheel designs. The effort modernizes the sedan’s overall look, but doesn’t radicalize its understated quiet sophistication we’ve always appreciated. While the Jetta may not scream, "Look at me," it will stand the test of time better than a fair share of its rivals. Jetta GLI models can be spotted via their unique front fascia with a honeycomb grille and a small rear spoiler.</p>, <p>The 2018 Jetta lineup consists of six trims: S, Wolfsburg Edition, SE, SE Sport, SEL and the top-line, performance-oriented GLI. At its most basic, the Jetta includes a turbocharged engine, 5-speed manual transmission (automatic is optional), rearview camera, 6-way driver's seat with height adjustment, and 16-inch wheels. Infotainment is provided by a 5-inch color touch-screen system that incorporates an AM/FM/CD player with SD and USB ports, and Bluetooth phone connectivity. For about $2,500 more, the SE model includes a power sunroof, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, heated front seats, larger touch-screen display with phone app features, faux leather seating, push-button start and premium wheels.</p>, <p>Aside from a 6-speed automatic transmission that's standard on SE Sport and SEL models, most extras in the 2018 Jetta sedan are had by climbing trims. The SE Sport and SEL also include a larger, more powerful engine. The SE Sport gets 17-inch wheels and a sunroof, while the SEL gets a power driver's seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation system, a 400-watt Fender premium audio system, rain-sensing windshield wipers and forward-collision warning system with automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Top-line GLI models add a still-more-powerful engine, sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch wheels and the Park Pilot front and rear parking-sensor system.</p>, <p>For 2018, the new VW Jetta is offered with a choice of three turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engines. On the upside, whichever of the three you choose is easy to recommend. Jetta S, Wolfsburg Edition and SE models use a 1.4-liter, SE Sport and SEL models have a more powerful 1.8-liter, and the GLI goes larger (and more powerful still) with a 2.0-liter. All Jettas are front-wheel drive. The S, Wolfsburg Edition and SE models come with a 5-speed manual transmission, but most buyers will opt for the 6-speed automatic, which is standard on the Sport and SEL. The manual transmission on Jetta GLI models is a 6-speed. Though VW notes that the max power figures seen below are achieved via premium gasoline, all the engines are fine drinking less expensive regular grade.<br>

Most buyers will opt for an automatic, which is an extra $1,000, but it’s a no-cost option on the Wolfsburg Edition and SE models. We recommend at least stepping up to the SE model, which has more amenities and the blind-spot-monitoring safety feature. It’s a good value at about $22,000. The Jetta SEL begins quite a bit higher at about $27.000, while the 2018 Jetta GLI starts just over $30,000 with an automatic transmission. At these prices, the Jetta begins slightly above rivals like the Honda Civic, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/chevrolet/cruze/">Chevrolet Cruze</a>, Toyota Corolla, Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/kia/forte/">Kia Forte</a>.

[<p>Built in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the 2018 VW Passat is a spacious, fuel-efficient and fun-to-drive midsize with high safety ratings. Volkswagen’s largest and most powerful sedan is offered in seven trim levels including the new Passat GT that gets sport trim, a lower sport suspension, 19-inch wheels and a 280-horsepower V6 engine, which is also standard on the top Passat V6 SEL Premium. Also new is a longer warranty which covers the sedan for six years or 72,000 miles. That’s longer than the warranties on competitors like the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/honda/accord/">Honda Accord</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/toyota/camry/">Toyota Camry</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/ford/fusion/">Ford Fusion</a>. Prices start just under $24,000 for the Passat S, which gets a 174-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission. It’s a smooth and responsive combination, which is also used in the Passat SE, SE Technology, SEL and R Line trim levels, and it’s rated an impressive 36 mpg on the highway.</p>, <p>The 2018 VW Passat is perfect for families because it offers one of the largest back seats in the midsize-sedan class and a spacious 15.9-cubic-foot trunk. It’s also available with long list of active and passive safety systems, and it’s rated a Top Safety Pick by the <a alt_o_t="Insurance" href="/car-insurance/">Insurance</a> Institute for Highway Safety.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for an all-wheel-drive midsize sedan, look elsewhere; all 2018 VW Passats are front-wheel drive. In this class only the Ford Fusion and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/legacy/">Subaru Legacy</a> offer AWD. Also, VW does not offer a Passat <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a>. For an electrified midsize, shop the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Ford Fusion.</p>, <p>For 2018 the new VW Passat gets a new 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that is more powerful and more fuel-efficient than the 1.8-liter it replaces. The sedan’s longer 6-year or 72,000-mile warranty is also new. And there’s a new Passat GT model with a lower sport suspension, 19-inch wheels and 280-horsepower V6 engine.</p>, <p>There’s an undeniable sporty side to the 2018 Volkswagen Passat personality, but comfort takes precedence in this sizable sedan. The ride is smooth and its spacious interior is quiet, even on the highway, where wind and road noise are kept out of the cabin. Visibility is excellent, and the light steering and brakes are responsive. Overall, it’s a sophisticated drive. The Passat is also playful, and when the situation calls for it this <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> shows an athletic side. The standard 2.0-liter 4-cylinder offers excellent power, providing lively acceleration from a dead stop or when you're at speed. The 6-speed automatic transmission is bit dated compared to the transmission in some of the Passat’s competition, but it’s well-tuned and well-geared. Although the available V6 is expensive and much less fuel-efficient, its additional power gives the Passat a luxury-sedan feel. The dual-clutch automatic transmission which comes with paddles shifters is fun to control manually.</p>, <p>DRIVER ASSISTANCE PACKAGE<br>
 Optional on the Passat S and standard on all other 2018 VW Passat models, this package adds Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert as well as Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking, which will apply the brakes for you in the event of a probable accident.<br>
<br>
 PARK ASSIST<br>
 Standard on the top-of-the-line Passat SEL Premium, this system takes all the stress out of parking. Activate the system with the push of a button and Park Assist will steer the sedan into any parallel or perpendicular parking space while you control the accelerator, brake and gear selection.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Seat comfort is high and the Passat’s driver’s seat is height-adjustable so shorter drivers can get properly situated. Fit/finish is excellent and the sedan’s interior has an upscale feel. VW’s designers resisted the urge to create a futuristic dash with daring shapes and overwrought digital displays. Instead, the Passat’s dashboard is simple if a bit traditional and the controls are well placed. It’s conservative, but it won’t look dated in just a few years. Rear-seat space is cavernous. There’s enough space for three Kobes and a Shaq back there. The infotainment system isn’t exactly class-leading, but it’s easy to use and offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity as well as standard Bluetooth.</p>, <p>Attractive, clean and understated, the exterior of the 2018 VW Passat never shouts or raises its voice. There’s a quiet elegance to its simplicity. But look more closely and you’ll notice artistic details like the intricate sculpting of its hood and doors, its fully chromed 4-bar grille and the aggressive rake of its windshield. LED headlights and taillights are available. Opt for the Passat R-Line or the Passat GT and you get unique front- and rear-end treatments and 19-inch alloy wheels for a true German sports-sedan stance. The GT also gets a lowered ride height, red brake calipers and blacked-out roof, side window trim and rear spoiler.</p>, <p>The base 2018 Passat S comes with a long list of standard equipment that also includes a 174-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, 6-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift mode, dual-zone climate control, auto headlights, infotainment system with 5-inch display, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, rearview camera, 60/40-split-folding rear seat and Automatic Post-Collision Braking System. Cloth upholstery is also standard, as are power mirrors, 16-inch alloy wheels and a power driver’s seat with manual-adjustable lumbar support. Move up to the Passat R Line or SE and you get V-Tex faux leather, blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert and Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking.</p>, <p>Buy a higher trim, get more stuff: That's the way the 2018 VW Passat options list generally works. There are few stand-alone options. The R-Line adds a sporty appearance package and larger 19-inch wheels. The SEL Premium is the full-boat model, with a moonroof, leather seats, premium audio and other traditional upgrades. There are also luxuries such as the radar-based smart cruise control and semi-automatic parallel parking, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available on any Passat equipped with the VW Car-Net system. The SEL is the only trim offered with the turbo engine or the V6. The 2018 Passat GT gets a lower, sport-tuned suspension and the 280-horsepower 3.6-liter V6.</p>, <p>VW is out of the diesel business, and the 2018 VW Passat is not offered as a hybrid. Most trim levels get the new more powerful and fuel-efficient 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, mated to a smooth 6-speed automatic transmission. This combination delivers plenty of performance and 36 mpg on the highway, a solid showing in this class. If you need more power, there are 280 horses under the hood with the 3.6-liter V6 engine. It's mated to a quick-shifting dual-clutch automatic transmission with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, both of which combine to deliver even more European sports-sedan feel. All Passats are front-wheel drive and both engines run on less expensive regular grade gasoline.<br>
<br>

 174 horsepower @ 5,000 rpm<br>
 184 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500 rpm<br>

 EPA city/highway 19/28 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p style="text-align: center;">The bare-bones 2018 Volkswagen Passat has a reasonable Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $23,000 including the $850 destination charge. However, we suggest starting at least at the mid-level R-Line model, which gets you more standard equipment for a bit less than $26,000. SE models start around $27,300, and a leather-clad SEL starts around $32,500. The top V6-powered Passat SEL is about $35,500. On a features-per-dollar scale, the Passat costs more than the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. The Passat's weak reliability record contributes to lower resale values and higher long-term ownership costs, an unfortunate trade-off to one of the most affordable new European <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> money can buy.

[<p>The compact SUV segment has changed quite a bit in the nine years since Volkswagen introduced the Tiguan. And now, finally, the VW has caught up. Totally redesigned for 2018, the 2nd-generation Volkswagen Tiguan is among the roomiest SUVs in the segment and loaded with cutting-edge tech, including dual 12- and 8-inch digital displays, standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and a long list of driver-assist and safety technologies. It’s also the only compact SUV other than the Nissan Rogue to offer seating for seven, and boasts the very best bumper-to-bumper warranty in the segment: a 6-year/72,000-mile limited warranty that’s fully transferable to subsequent owners. The 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan isn’t just a better SUV, it’s a smarter buy right out of the gate.</p>, <p>Now that it’s more comparable to and competitive with segment stalwarts like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape, the Tiguan’s European design and driving sensibilities are much more attractive.</p>, <p>The solidly built Tiguan is neither the quickest nor the most fuel-efficient compact SUV you can buy. And while the new warranty goes a long way in reducing the potential financial impact related to VW’s documented quality shortcomings, we wouldn’t bet on the new Tiguan being as trouble-free as a Honda CR-V, for instance.</p>, <p>The Volkswagen Tiguan has been completely redesigned for 2018.</p>, <p>The Tiguan’s excellent steering and pedal response -- expected attributes of any VW -- contribute to an overall driving feel that’s among the best in the segment. Highway ride is firmer than that of some other small SUVs, but excellent seats, a quiet cabin and superior steering feel qualify the new Tiguan as an excellent long-haul companion. While the Tiguan’s turbocharged engine generates impressive horsepower and torque, a base Tiguan is a whopping 450 pounds heavier than a base Honda CR-V. City scooting and highway cruising are barely impacted, but the added mass is evident in highway merging and passing situations.<br>
<br>
 Although the Tiguan is a bit longer than most compact SUVs, good outward visibility and a decent turning diameter combine to make it a breeze in parking lots. The Tiguan also offers a host of available technologies that make parking maneuvers even easier. Rear Traffic Alert with Braking will warn you of cars coming down the aisle you’re backing into, and can automatically stop the car if necessary. The Overhead View Camera provides a bird’s-eye view of the vehicle and its surroundings, an increasingly common feature that remains among our favorites. Park Distance Control with Maneuver Braking incorporates front and rear parking sensors that warn you of close objects and can even stop the car if you’re about to back into something.</br></br></p>, <p>6-YEAR/72,000-MILE WARRANTY<br>
 The best bumper-to-bumper warranty in the business, the Tiguan’s fully transferable coverage benefits owners who keep their cars a long time, as well as those who typically sell after a few years.<br>
<br>
 APPLE CARPLAY AND ANDROID AUTO<br>
 Choose a song, dictate a text message or navigate to a destination with the ease and familiarity of your smartphone.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Interior design and materials are typical VW highlights, and the new Tiguan follows suit. We’re big fans of open bins with power and USB ports placed ahead of the transmission selector, a feature we were happy to find in the Tiguan. The start/stop button, electronic parking brake, and transmission selector are all placed within inches of each other in the center console, which makes for quicker and easier departures and arrivals. The center armrest is nicely padded but doesn’t offer the cool, ratcheting height adjustability we regularly put to use in other Volkswagens.<br>
<br>
 In addition to accommodating backseat passengers with ample headroom and legroom, the 2018 VW Tiguan features sliding and reclining rear seatbacks that adjust to maximize both passenger comfort and cargo capacity. The seatback also features a 40/20/40 split, which makes it easier to carry long items and two rear passengers at the same time. The rear seat also features dedicated air vents, power and USB ports, plus a good armrest. Even though the Tiguan’s third row is the smallest on the market -- with 3.5 fewer inches of legroom than even the Nissan Rogue’s available third row -- it nevertheless can save you from driving two cars or making two trips or abandoning the idea altogether.<br>
<br>
 Two-row Tiguan models offer 37.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second row, a figure that places it in the top half of the segment. When your hands are full, you can open the Tiguan’s liftgate by gently kicking your foot under the rear bumper. And in a new twist, when you have a large load to remove from the Tiguan, first press a button on the open tailgate and it will automatically close when it senses you (the key) walking away from the vehicle.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The Tiguan’s distinctive and well-tailored look is sure to be among its bigger draws. Already the longest compact SUV in the segment, the Tiguan’s sharp creases add a taut, freshly pressed authority. Complex LED taillights give the rear view a similarly serious, semi-premium feel. The range-topping Tiguan SEL Premium adds LED headlights and LED daytime running lights, while the available R-Line package gives the Tiguan a sportier look that includes unique, larger wheels.</p>, <p>While Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are finally starting to become more common in the category, in the new Tiguan they’re included as standard equipment as part of the Car-Net App-Connect package. Also included in the Tiguan’s base price are the third-row seat, a 6.5-inch touch screen infotainment system, Bluetooth and USB smartphone connectivity, a rearview camera, and a 40/20/40 split, sliding, reclining, fold-flat 2nd-row seat.</p>, <p>In addition to a range of active safety technologies and traditional upgrades like leather seats and premium audio, Tiguan option highlights include a panoramic sunroof, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, a bird’s-eye parking camera, keyless entry/start, a hands-free liftgate with walk-away close, and a 12.3-inch customizable digital instrument panel. As for VW’s Car-Net infotainment system, stepping up to the subscription-based Security &amp; Service group adds capabilities like remote vehicle lock/unlock, automatic crash notification, and the parent-friendly Family Guardian with features including remote speed and boundary alerts. The range-topping Guide &amp; Inform group includes built-in navigation plus the subscription-based SiriusXM Travel Link that includes traffic and weather info, plus local fuel prices, sports scores and movie information.</p>, <p>The Tiguan’s base curb weight of 3,777 pounds qualifies it as the heavyweight champion of the category. As such, its EPA fuel economy ratings are on the low side of the category average, but for most drivers it works out to just an extra gallon or two per month. The added mass also takes a toll on acceleration, even with 221 lb-ft of torque on tap from 1,600 rpm.<br>
<br>
 The Tiguan’s available 4Motion all-wheel-drive system features a mechanical center differential and electronic differential locks, allowing it to transfer power front to back and side to side. The system also includes a variety of driver-selectable modes, including On-Road, Snow, Off-Road and Custom Off-Road. Within On-Road mode are four additional settings: Normal, Sport, Eco and Custom. Combined with 7.9 inches of ground clearance, a 4Motion-equipped Tiguan should deliver as much foul-weather and off-road capability and confidence as most anything in the segment.<br>

 Towing capacity: 1,500 pounds</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan starts at a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price of $26,245 and tops out at $39,945 with all the bells and whistles. While the big new warranty will decrease ownership costs for some and likely increase resale values, it’s unlikely the new Tiguan’s overall cost of ownership will match those of the segment’s proven value leaders. So, generally speaking, it’s likely you’ll pay more to drive a Tiguan than you would a comparably equipped Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4, for instance. But spending a little more for the vehicle you prefer is sometimes the smart choice.</p>]

[<p>The 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan Limited compact SUV shouldn’t be confused with the all-new Tiguan. Its “Limited” name designates it as a carryover version of the previous version. The rationale for having two concurrent Tiguan models is pricing. Starting just over $23,000, the Tiguan Limited is $2,345 less than the all-new model, making it an attractive option for those wanting a small-crossover SUV for a low price. While the Tiguan Limited is smaller than the new version and lacks that model’s advanced safety features and fresh design, this older Tiguan still has appeal. Beyond a price that undercuts rivals like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, the Tiguan Limited has a zesty turbocharged engine, fun driving dynamics, and offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.</p>, <p>If you want a small new crossover SUV for a great value, the Tiguan Limited is worth consideration. Other motivating factors include its taut European driving dynamics, available all-wheel drive, and smartphone connectivity that’s compatible with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink.</p>, <p>Even when it was new, the Volkswagen Tiguan was smaller than most of its rivals, which means you won’t get the kind of room for rear passengers and cargo offered by others. Since the Tiguan Limited is based on a model that came out in 2009, it doesn’t offer the advanced safety features and driver-assistance technology that has since developed.</p>, <p>The 2018 Tiguan Limited is a carryover version of the older Tiguan, not the all-new one that arrived last year. Meant to be a less expensive alternative, the Tiguan Limited is limited to a single trim. The only major options are all-wheel drive and a Premium Package that adds a touch-screen display, cruise control and other features you’ll probably want.</p>, <p>Though it’s older than every other <a alt_o_t="Compact SUV" href="/car-news/all-the-latest/best-compact-crossover-suvs/2000010090/">small SUV</a> in its class, the Tiguan Limited still holds its own in terms of powertrain and driving manners. That’s because it was above-average to begin with, and was among the first to use a turbocharged engine. In fact, at 200 horsepower, the turbocharged 4-cylinder in the Tiguan Limited actually has 16 more horsepower than the engine in the all-new model (though the new Tiguan has more torque). With a peppy engine, smooth 6-speed transmission and small footprint, the Tiguan Limited is fun yet easy to drive, and a cinch to maneuver. For a little extra spice, there’s a Sport mode that holds the gears longer. If you live in a cold-weather state or visit the mountains often, you’ll probably want the 4Motion all-wheel-drive system that enhances traction. In general, the Tiguan Limited has a smooth ride, but our evaluators did note a somewhat noisy cabin, and others found the head restraints intrusive. At a high of 26 mpg, the Tiguan Limited isn’t as fuel efficient as newer competitors. A Honda CR-V, for example, is rated up to 34 mpg.</p>, <p>IMPRESSIVE WARRANTY<br>
The Tiguan Limited may be an old body style, but it has gained VW’s new warranty. Dubbed “The People First Warranty,” it aims to reassure those wary of Volkswagen reliability with six years/72,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage that’s also transferable.<br>
<br>
HIGH-FIDELITY AUDIO<br>
If you appreciate good audio quality, there’s another reason to spring for the Premium Package. It adds a USB input for flash drives and phone connective, plus the ability to play FLAC files, a type of audio codec with CD-quality sound.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 VW Tiguan Limited's 5-passenger interior is straightforward with simple yet logical controls and good fit and finish. Still, there’s little hiding that this Tiguan is the value play, especially if you don’t opt for the Premium Package. Cloth seats are the only choice, and the cabin looks Spartan. You won’t even get steering-wheel-mounted audio controls or a USB input. That will be remedied if you opt for the lone option package, which will also swap the small 5-inch touch-screen display for a 6.3-inch unit. Space has always been tight in the Tiguan due to its smaller size. Where the Honda CR-V boasts 75.8 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded, the Tiguan maxes out at 56.1 cubic feet. That’s about the same as the subcompact, less expensive Honda HR-V.</p>, <p>With an overall length just over 174 inches, Volkswagen's Tiguan Limited is small even by compact-SUV standards. Citing the CR-V again as the benchmark example, the Honda is a half-foot longer. Compared to the new Tiguan, the Tiguan Limited is nearly a foot shorter. Still, we find the old body style of this Tiguan handsome after all these years. The Tiguan Limited's smooth, uncluttered lines and horizontal grille give it a squat appearance. Formerly standard but now costing extra, roof rails add some toughness and utility to the Tiguan Limited.</p>, <p>As a mono-spec, value-priced model, the Tiguan Limited is pretty bare-bones, especially compared to its former self. But you will get what are now basics in new cars, like power windows/door locks, rearview camera, 8-way manual-adjust driver’s seat, a 40/20/40-split rear seat, and 16-inch steel wheels. The basic infotainment system consists of a 5-inch touch-screen display, Bluetooth connectivity and 8-speaker AM/FM/CD player audio system. Also included is VW’s impressive new warranty. If you want features like cruise control or even a USB port, however, you’ll have to opt for the Premium Package. Read on for details on that.</p>, <p>Unless you are content with only the most basic of Tiguans, we recommend spending the extra $1,295 on the Premium Package. It bundles a larger, 6.3-inch touch-screen display, adds HD Radio and satellite radio, a USB port, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel with buttons for audio and cruise control, roof rails, cargo cover, keyless access with push-button start, and VW’s Car-Net that runs certain smartphone apps. Also available is all-wheel drive in lieu of the standard front-wheel drive. Larger, 17-inch wheels are also offered.</p>, <p>The Tiguan Limited may use an older engine, but it’s still impressive, making a robust 200 horsepower. The sole transmission is a 6-speed automatic with manual shift and sport modes. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard and all-wheel drive (AWD) is available. The Tiguan's towing capacity is rated at 2,200 pounds. The Tiguan Limited’s fuel economy lags that of competitors, and adding insult to injury, premium gasoline is recommended (but not required).<br>
<br>
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br>
 200 horsepower @ 5,100 rpm<br>
 207 lb-ft of torque @ 1,700 rpm<br>
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/26 mpg<b></b></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Here’s the big appeal for the 2018 Tiguan Limited: It has a Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $23,150 for a front-wheel-drive model, or $25,125 for an all-wheel-drive version. Loaded with the Premium Package and the upgraded wheels, an AWD Tiguan still slots in under $27,000. That’s a vast departure from its former self, which could run over $37,000 for a highly outfitted model. At these prices, the Tiguan Limited can undercut its fresher and more advanced competitors like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Nissan Rogue and its own sibling -- the all-new Tiguan -- by a couple thousand dollars. Others closer in price include the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and Hyundai Tucson. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Tiguan. Traditionally, the Volkswagen Tiguan’s resale value has significantly trailed that of its rivals.</p>]

[<p>Available in a wide variety of trim levels with a range of powerful yet fuel-efficient turbocharged and supercharged engines, the 2018 Volvo S60 is a sporty, stylish and sophisticated small-luxury sedan with available all-wheel drive and up to 362 horsepower. Its low starting price of around $35,000 also undercuts many of its competitors including the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4/">Audi A4</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/is/">Lexus IS</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/c-class/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a>. Six trim levels are offered on the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s60/">Volvo S60</a>, Dynamic, R-Design, the race-car-inspired Polestar and the unique Cross Country, which combines the rugged style and high ride height of an off-road-ready <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, only in sedan form. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volvo/">Volvo</a> also offers the S60 Inscription and Inscription Platinum, which have a longer wheelbase and three inches of additional rear-seat legroom.</p>, <p>With 240 horsepower, a comfortable interior and emotional styling the 2018 Volvo S60 Dynamic is a strong value at its starting price around $35,000. All S60’s are rated a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Those who think outside the sedan box will like the rugged, all-wheel-drive S60 Cross Country, which adds SUV-like ride height and ground clearance.</p>, <p>Although Volvo offers a plug-in <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">hybrid</a> version of its XC90 SUV, it does not offer an electrified powertrain in the S60. If you’re looking for that technology in this class, <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> offers a plug-in hybrid 3 Series and Mercedes offers a plug-in hybrid C-Class. Some may also find the Volvo’s infotainment system to be outdated compared to others in the class.</p>, <p>Changes to the new Volvo S60 are minimal for 2018. Volvo has added a power passenger seat as well as heated front seats and a heated steering wheel to the option list of the S60 Cross Country model.</p>, <p>Luxury-sedan buyers who think only BMW, Mercedes and <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/audi/">Audi</a> can make a small-luxury sedan that’s powerful and fun-to-drive haven’t driven a 2018 Volvo S60. With a standard 240-horsepower turbocharged engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission with manual mode, the S60 Dynamic is quick. The front-wheel-drive (FWD) model sprints from 0-60 mph in just 6.0 seconds. Impressively it also delivers 26-mpg city and 36 mpg on the highway. And the S60 likes the turns, with a sport-tuned suspension, standard 18-inch wheels and optional all-wheel drive (AWD), which costs an additional $2,000. Sport seats are standard in the Dynamic model. They’re exceptionally well designed and supportive without feeling snug or constricted. With 302 horsepower and standard AWD, the R-Design model is even quicker, and the tire-scorching 362-horsepower S60 Polestar can hit 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds. It’s the ultimate Swedish Driving Machine with AWD, Brembo brakes, Ohlins shocks, 20-inch wheels and high-performance summer tires.</p>, <p>CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT<br>
 Volvo’s reputation for safety is legendary. This optional safety system uses sensors in the S60’s rear bumper to scan the sedan’s surroundings and alert you of traffic approaching from the sides when reversing out of a parking space or out of your driveway. It really takes the stress out of crowded parking lots and tight spaces.<br>
<br>
 DRIVER ALERT CONTROL<br>
 Active at speeds over 40 mph, this clever system monitors your steering inputs to see how they compare to your regular driving style. If you’re driving erratically, or you’re showing signs of being drowsy or distracted, it’ll warn you audibly and with a message on the instrument panel suggesting you take a break.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With simple Swedish elegance, modern finishes and exceptional fit and finish, the interior of the new Volvo S60 is a quiet and comfortable sanctuary from the outside world. The front seats are exceptionally comfortable and supportive, the instrumentation is easy to see, and the climate and audio controls are mostly logical to operate. Unfortunately, the single-knob controller for the infotainment system can be frustrating to use at first, but you get used to it, and the 7-inch screen seems small. Bigger is definitely better when it comes to the latest Volvo Inscription models and their expanded rear seat. With three inches of additional legroom, the S60 goes from cramped to comfy for rear-seaters.</p>, <p>One of the more aggressively styled <a alt_o_t="Sedans" href="/sedan/">sedans</a> in its class, the new 2018 Volvo S60 looks youthful and dynamic with a wide stance and a low, fast roofline. The sloping rear end showcases the currently fashionable "4-door <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/coupe/">coupe</a>" profile and its dual-exhaust pipes speak of power. All Volvo S60 models get a front end with numerous LEDs for lighting functions. Lengthening the standard S60 could have gone badly, but the stretched S60 Inscription is well proportioned with its elongated roofline and rear doors. But our favorite in the sex-appeal department is the high-riding 2018 S60 Cross Country. Rugged, off-road-theme sedans aren't very common, but the Cross Country’s tall stance, big tires and fender extensions are eye-catching.</p>, <p>Buyers in the upscale-sedan market have high expectations, which the 2018 Volvo S60 handily meets. Being a Volvo, the 2018 S60 starts with safety, including three active systems: City Safety helps avoid low-speed collisions in slow, stop-and-go traffic; Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake senses an impending collision and can brake to reduce the severity of a crash; and Pedestrian Detection with Full Auto Brake will stop the car for you to avoid running someone over. Inscription models include three inches of additional rear legroom and upscale interior features, including a rearview camera, walnut wood inlays, additional sound deadening, a power rear-window sunshade, and silk-metal accents.</p>, <p>Options for Volvo’s 2018 S60 sedan lineup include 19-inch wheels for the Sport Package, which also adds paddle shifters and sporty chassis enhancements. You can add a Technology Package with its long list of safety systems including Adaptive Cruise Control and Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake. The Vision Package adds keyless entry and start, a rearview camera and rear parking sensors. Not surprisingly, the Swedish automaker also offers a package that adds heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. A harman/kardon premium audio system and a navigation system are also available along with such accessories as ski racks and a dog harness.</p>, <p>Power for the Volvo S60 lineup is made up of three engine choices all based on the brand’s Drive-E 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. Dynamic, Inscription and Cross Country models get a 240-horsepower turbocharged version, while the T6 R-Design adds a supercharger to the mix for 302 horsepower. The Polestar sticks with just the turbocharger, but manages a whopping 362 horsepower. All three engines come connected to an 8-speed Geartronic automatic transmission with manual-shift mode.<br>

The FWD Inscription T5 starts around $38,000, while the AWD Cross Country starts just over $45,000. The powerful S60 Polestar is about $60,000. It costs $2,000 to add all-wheel drive to models not so equipped, but even then the Volvo S60 generally undercuts competitors like the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan, although some <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/lexus/">Lexus</a> and Infiniti models are more price-competitive. Before buying, be sure to check out KBB.com's Fair Purchase Price tool to see what others in your area are paying. Based on 5-Year Cost-to-Own, the Volvo S60 is a stellar buy. The low initial purchase price plus low maintenance and repair costs make the Volvo S60 a good choice, and its safety story is, of course, unsurpassed.<b></b></p>]

[<p>A sophisticated midsize-luxury <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a> with semi-autonomous capability, the 2018 Volvo S90 gets a radical increase in wheelbase this year. With its newfound 4.5 inches of additional rear-seat legroom it’s now more spacious than the popular <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/5%20series/">BMW 5 Series</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> as well as the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a6/">Audi A6</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/cadillac/cts/">Cadillac CTS</a>. Two trim levels are offered, Momentum and Inscription. Momentum models start with the T5 and an adequate 250-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive (FWD), but all-wheel drive (AWD) is available. Buyers can also move up to a more desirable T6 and its turbocharged and supercharged 4-cylinder engine that makes 316 horsepower. In this model AWD is standard. <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volvo/">Volvo</a> also offers the new <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a> as the T8 Plug-In <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/hybrid/">Hybrid</a> with 400 horsepower. Inscription models are limited to the T6 and the hybrid. Prices start around $49,000, which undercuts the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/bmw/">BMW</a> and the Mercedes by a few grand.</p>, <p>If you’re looking for a luxurious and quiet midsize-premium sedan with state-of-the-art safety features, semi-autonomous capability and class-leading rear-seat legroom, you’ll like the 2018 Volvo S90. Its 13.5-cubic-foot trunk is also sizable for the class, and with 400 horsepower, the S90 Plug-in Hybrid is significantly more powerful than BMW 530e iPerformance.</p>, <p>If you consider a 4-cylinder premium sedan to be an oxymoron like soft rock or jumbo shrimp, then the Volvo S90 probably isn’t for you. The BMW 5 Series, Mercedes E-Class, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/jaguar/xf/">Jaguar XF</a>, Cadillac CTS and Audi A6 are all available with six cylinders and a few offer very powerful V8s.</p>, <p>The Volvo S90 was all-new just last year, yet for 2018 Volvo has significantly increased the sedan’s wheelbase by 4.7 inches. The move dramatically increases its rear-seat legroom by 4.5 inches, making it the most spacious in its class. Other changes include an increase in standard equipment on the T5 and T6 all-wheel-drive models.</p>, <p>The 2018 Volvo S90 is a terrific car to drive, smooth, responsive and powerful. While it might not be the equal of rear-drive, German-designed competitors in full-on performance driving -- something most luxury-sedan drivers never undertake, by the way -- we found the all-wheel-drive T6 version to be a satisfying sports sedan with laudable levels of road-holding, acceleration and steering. The magic of supercharging and turbocharging enables the T6’s little 2.0-liter engine to ladle out 316 largely bog-free horsepower and a stunningly flat torque curve. Slow it is not, and its 8-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly. It’s well matched to the 4-cylinder. But the most interesting aspect about driving the 2018 Volvo S90 is letting it drive itself. With its standard semi-autonomous drive system, called Pilot Assist, the Volvo can basically drive itself, both in stop-and-go traffic and at highway speeds. It goes, stops and steers all on its own. It just asks you to touch the steering wheel every once in a while to prove you’re still paying attention.</p>, <p>DRIVE-MODE SETTINGS<br>
 With a controller on the console behind the Volvo’s shifter, drivers can select from four drive modes, customizing the sedan’s dynamic characteristics to the mood as well as the road and traffic conditions. Comfort, Eco, Dynamic and Individual modes are offered. Each adjusts the S90’s engine, transmission and the optional air suspension. Unfortunately, the Volvo defaults back to Comfort every time you start the engine.<br>
<br>
 VOLVO ON CALL<br>
 Standard on every 2018 S90, Volvo On Call is free for four years. The app lets you lock and unlock the sedan’s doors, start your engine to warm or cool the interior and check the fuel level. If you require roadside assistance you can speak to an operator who will dispatch assistance to your GPS location. And if a collision is detected, the S90 alerts an operator to send emergency response.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>With this year’s 4.5 inches of additional rear-seat legroom, the Volvo S90’s back seat has gone from spacious to cavernous. It’s wide too. This is a true 5-seater. Front-seat accommodations are also worth a few gold stars. Volvo is a world leader in vehicle seat comfort and function, and the S90’s seats are well shaped and its seat heaters can beat back Old Man Winter. Volvo has managed to combine high-tech features in an understated overall design combined with old-world craftsmanship. A single piece of shaped walnut adorns the passenger side of the dash, while most controls are within the large touch screen, which looks and functions like an iPad. It’s a simple, elegant and intuitive design.</p>, <p>Adding 4.7 inches to the wheelbase of a car, any car, could be a recipe for design disaster. Chances are you’ll end up with awkward proportions and a cartoonish profile. Not this time. Volvo has pulled it off. If possible, the new longer 2018 Volvo S90 looks even better. Not just longer, but leaner. This is a handsome sedan. Special features include the front grille that is scalloped in homage to the Volvo P1800 sports car, the “Thor’s hammer” motif in the LED headlights and a sweeping line that extends from bow to stern inspired by the sailboats of Sweden’s incomparable West Coast.</p>, <p>Driver-assist and safety systems lead the Volvo S90’s most notable standard items. In addition to the previously mentioned Gen2 Pilot Assist system, the new S90 offers “Run-off Road Mitigation” that is designed to prevent one of the most common types of fatal accidents. Between speeds of 40-85 mph the system can sense a potential run-off-the-road situation, and in response it can both steer and brake automatically to keep the S90 on the road. Although potentially intrusive, the system can be overridden by overt driver action. It is designed to function in times of driver inattention and/or impairment that could send the car careening off the road. Other standard niceties include Volvo’s justifiably famous City Safety collision-avoidance system and LED headlights.</p>, <p>As one climbs the trim ladder the new Volvo S90 goes from very good to even better. Packages on the T5 Momentum can add heated front seats and steering wheel, a 360-degree camera system, front and rear park assist, a 4-zone climate-control system, high-pressure headlight cleaners and a power-operated trunklid. The Inscription trim brings an available <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">Luxury</a> Package with heated and ventilated rear seats, massaging front seats and a rear console. All-wheel drive is available in both trim levels, and the rear air-suspension system, Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio system and a Head-Up Display are available as stand-alone options.</p>, <p>Using a clean-sheet-of-paper approach to powertrains, Volvo has committed to an inline 4-cylinder engine as its basic building block. From there, it adds increasingly high levels of sophistication on the continuum from the 250-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter engine in the T5 version, to the 316-horsepower direct-injected, supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter engine in the T6. Both engines use an 8-speed automatic transmission to send power to the front (T5) or all four (T6) wheels.

An optioned-up T6 Inscription reaches over $67,000, but you can get a very well equipped T6 with all-wheel drive for less than $60,000. The most expensive model is the T8 Inscription Plug-In Hybrid.

[<p>Recent polling reveals that Americans still don’t like station wagons, which leads us to conclude that those surveyed have never experienced the 2018 Volvo V60. Combining Swedish elegance with seductive styling and potent performance, the V60 is ideal for urbanites needing maximum interior volume without the bulky size and clumsy handling that accompany some SUVs. Enthusiast drivers will love the 300-plus horsepower in the R-Design and Polestar, while those who spend weekends outdoors will gravitate toward the added ground clearance and a rugged all-wheel-drive system of the V60 Cross Country. If you’ve been shopping the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/3%20series/">BMW 3 Series</a> Gran Turismo and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/allroad/">Audi Allroad</a>, you might find a less expensive alternative in the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v60/">Volvo V60</a>.</p>, <p>If your cargo-carrying needs declare “SUV,” but your playful side begs for a sporty European sports sedan, the 2018 Volvo V60 wagon can satisfy both demands. An excellent reputation for safety doesn’t hurt either, nor does the V60’s sleek good looks.</p>, <p>There are a number of larger SUVs with more room, more power and more seats, and you don’t even have to leave the Volvo family to find them. The V90 and V90 Cross Country offer similar wagon attributes, but in a larger package.</p>, <p>For 2018, Volvo drops the base V60 making the Dynamic the entry-level trim. The V60 sees a few features and package reorganized to make pricing more attractive until an all-new V60 arrives early in 2019.</p>, <p>In the 2018 Volvo V60, one finds a wagon that rides and handles like a well-heeled sports sedan, as comfortable on long stretches of highway as it is winding mountain roads. Should the road come to an end, however, the V60 Cross Country’s 7.9 inches of ground clearance allow one to continue unimpeded. For the record, that’s more ground clearance than the Audi Allroad or VW Alltrack, but about an inch shy of the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a> Touring. Although no match for the BMW 3 Series, the V60’s acceleration, handling and braking all fall into the performance-oriented category, making it much more fun to drive than the aforementioned Outback. Tying it all together are the V60's lightweight, high-compression 4-cylinder engines. Their power output feels far more than the 2.0-liter displacement would suggest. Base T5 models make a commendable 240 horsepower, while R-Design and the limited-edition Polestar T6 cars make 302 and 362 horsepower, respectively. A smooth-shifting 8-speed Geartronic automatic is the only transmission choice.</p>, <p>DRIVE-E<br>
Although the name may sound like some fancy new Swedish hybrid system, Volvo’s Drive-E represents a family of engines propelled solely by fossil fuel. However, the Drive-E design does deliver impressive power and fuel economy from one of the most refined 4-cylinder turbos on the market.<br>
<br>
CROSS COUNTRY<br>
With an additional 2.6 inches of ground clearance and capable Haldex all-wheel-drive setup, the V60 Cross Country can tackle mild off-road situations as well as unplowed roads and nasty snow drifts.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Not surprisingly, the 2018 V60 has all the Swedish refinement and simplicity long associated with Volvo cars. While we'll likely have to wait for next-gen versions before getting the astoundingly beautiful interior treatment and the latest tech upgrades of Volvo's new crop of cars like the XC90 and V90, that of the V60 is still quite attractive. All models seat five passengers and have intuitive controls -- just look at the human-figure ventilation directives! And because this is a wagon, there's ample cargo room in back, and even more if you fold the rear seats.</p>, <p>This may be the best-looking of Volvo's "60" series of cars, which includes the S60 sedan and XC60 SUV. The V60's profile is graceful and elegant, with a sloping roofline that extends the cargo area, but without making it look like a sedan wearing a backpack. In fact, some of us prefer it over the stubby-trunk look of the S60, and still others like its sleek, low-to-the-ground stance compared to the XC60. The Volvo V60 Cross Country sits a bit higher than the standard model, but the result is rugged, not awkward.</p>, <p>The 2018 V60 is offered in three trims (Dynamic, R-Design and Polestar), while the V60 Cross Country comes in just two (Cross Country and Cross Country Platinum). The base trim is now the Dynamic which includes such amenities as an 8-way-power driver‘s seat with power lumbar, leather seating, a power moonroof, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic climate controls, 160-watt 8-speaker audio system with 7-inch command screen, Bluetooth, USB/auxiliary input and a Wi-Fi hotspot. Being that the V60 is a Volvo, safety features such as low-speed automatic braking, auto high beams, active bending-light headlights and a rear fog light are also standard.</p>, <p>Climb trims and you'll get a better and better equipped European wagon. Additional amenities include a harman/kardon premium audio system, heated front and rear seats, and universal garage remote. Among the optional safety and driving aids are adaptive cruise control, collision-warning system with full auto brake and pedestrian/cyclist detection, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist and parking sensors. A sport chassis and integrated roof rails are also offered. All-wheel drive (AWD) can be had in lieu of front-drive (FWD) for lower models and is standard on the V60 Cross Country that also includes navigation, 18-inch wheels and skidplates.</p>, <p>Volvo has streamlined its engine offerings using a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder for all V60 trims. But we'll say it again: These are phenomenal engines that punch above their weight. At the very least, a turbocharged T5 version makes 240 horsepower and can move this mover from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds. T6 versions are turbocharged and supercharged. Yes, they use both kinds of forced induction, making 302 horsepower in T6 R-Design models and a whopping 362 horsepower in the V60 Polestar, which enables it to hit 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. Note that V60 Cross Country models are available only with the 240-horsepower engine. All models are connected to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The V60 is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds.<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (T5)<br>
240 horsepower @ 5,600 rpm<br>
258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-4,800 rpm<br>
EPA city/highway fuel economy: 25/36 mpg (FWD), 22/33 mpg (AWD), 22/30 mpg (V60 Cross Country AWD)<br>
<br>
2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 (T6 AWD R-Design)<br>
302 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm<br>

EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The 2018 Volvo V60 Dynamic wagon has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $39,245 in front-drive form. As you climb trims, that price increases, with R-Design models just under $50,000 before options. If you're willing to spend the $60,000-plus it takes to buy a V60 Polestar, know that they're in short supply: Only about 200 Polestars have been allocated to the U.S. market, and that includes S60 Polestar sedans. The V60 Cross Country starts closer to $43,000. At its base price, the Volvo V60, even in all-wheel-drive form, undercuts the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4%20allroad/">Audi A4 Allroad</a> and BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo by several thousand dollars, while the more similar V60 Cross Country is in line with those competitors.

[<p>The 2018 Volvo V90 is the flagship wagon from the Swedish automaker, a luxurious hauler of people and gear that blends upscale amenities, striking design and the brand's latest arsenal of safety and driving aids. In Cross Country form, the V90 is a standout alternative to <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> <a alt_o_t="SUVs" href="/suv/">SUVs</a>, boasting all-wheel drive (AWD) and extra ground clearance while retaining the sophisticated driving manners of a stately <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/sedan/">sedan</a>. The V90 can also be ordered as a standard wagon that sits a bit lower but is elegant in its own right. The V90 Cross Country is unique, with few direct rivals. Rather, it sits atop a pack that begins with rugged <a alt_o_t="Wagons" href="/wagon/">wagons</a> like the <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> Alltrack and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/subaru/outback/">Subaru Outback</a>, and continues to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/a4%20allroad/">Audi A4 Allroad</a>.</p>, <p>If you want an alternative to a luxury SUV, the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/v90/">Volvo V90</a> is a true <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV, hitting the white space between sport-utility vehicle and wagon and sedan. In addition to its premium nature and practicality, the V90 packs a wealth of active safety and driver-assistance features.</p>, <p>The V90 Cross Country is certainly adept slogging through snow and tackling light trails, but it's not quite at SUV levels for anything tougher. If you're not a fan of touch-based controls, be aware that the V90 relies heavily on such a system to control everything from audio to climate functions.</p>, <p>For its second year on the market, a T5 variant joins the V90 Cross Country lineup, which features a lower-powered engine and a lower starting price of just over $53,000. V90 T6 models receive Oncoming Lane Mitigation, a new collision-avoidance feature.</p>, <p>The 2018 V90 Cross Country shares a similar dynamic nature as the S90 sedan, while its long wheelbase grants a supple ride. The steering is direct, well-controlled and offers precise feedback. The difference from the sedan, as well as the standard V90 wagon, is its slightly higher ride height. The V90 Cross Country's 8.3 inches of ground clearance plus its standard all-wheel drive figure greatly in its neutral handling characteristics. The rugged wagon is well-balanced, exhibits little in the way of body roll and is decidedly more car-like in its road-holding than traditional SUVs. But that doesn’t mean the Cross Country gives up the ability to take on 2-track off-road trails or plow through snow. The lower-riding standard V90 has a more dynamic nature. All use a force-fed 4-cylinder engine, the supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter making 316 horsepower. Put your foot into it, and this little engine provides a real rush.</p>, <p>TURBO/SUPERCHARGED ENGINE<br>
 The performance from this 2.0-liter 4-cylinder is simply amazing. Getting 316 horsepower from this engine is quite a feat -- the car doesn’t seem to lack for power and still delivers fuel economy that shames less powerful drivetrains.<br>
<br>
 SELECTABLE DRIVE MODES<br>
 In addition to the Eco, Comfort, Off Road and Dynamic modes (all of which are nicely tailored to their individual missions) is the standard hill-descent feature that gives the 2018 Volvo V90 Cross Country dirt-trail cred.<br>
</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p><a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volvo/">Volvo</a>'s interior design language entered a new realm with the recent revamp of the XC90 flagship SUV, and it continues in a similarly beautiful fashion with the V90. The 5-passenger cabin drips of class, starting with the bejeweled knob that you turn to start the engine. The front seats are comfortable and highly adjustable. Good legroom is had in back, and cargo space is SUV-like at around 54 cubic feet. Dominating the dash is a large, vertically-oriented touch screen reminiscent of a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/tesla/">Tesla</a>. It's elegant, but makes simple actions like changing cabin temperature rely too heavily on touch commands.</p>, <p>The V90's wagon profile makes it look sleeker than the S90 sedan, a looker in its own right. The concave shape of the grille and the detailing from the lighting elements to the use of brightwork match the level of elegance inside. The Cross Country signals its off-road ability via front and rear skidplates, fender extensions and aggressive rocker panels. If you don’t want to look as macho, you can opt for body-colored flares instead of the matte finish. An integrated roof-rack system is both good-looking and functional. The standard V90 is nearly identical in dimensions but sits lower to the ground.</p>, <p>In addition to AWD and hill-descent control, the Volvo V90 Cross Country’s long list of standard features includes Pilot Assist (combining lane-keeping steering assist with adaptive cruise control), blind-spot monitoring, driver-alert sensing, road-sign information and lane-departure warning. Other upscale items include heated leather seats and steering wheel, panoramic moonroof, a digital instrument cluster and 9-inch center screen with navigation, keyless entry and start and hands-free power tailgate. The standard 10-speaker 224-watt audio/infotainment system features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone compatibility. The standard City Safety system can sense cars and pedestrians in front of the vehicle and automatically apply the brakes.</p>, <p>The new V90 Cross Country T5 base model can be upgraded with the Plus Package that bundles 4-zone climate control, 12.3-inch digital dash and active bending headlights, or a Convenience Package with heated washer nozzles, Park Assist Pilot and 360-degree camera. The T6 model has access to the Luxury Package with Nappa leather with ventilated and massaging front seats, leather on the dash and door panels, heated rear seats, 4-zone climate control, rear sun curtains, and body-colored doorsills, bumpers and fender flares. Stand-alone options include air suspension, a 1,400-watt Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium audio system, head-up display, and 2-step rear-seat child-booster cushions.</p>, <p>Two engines are now offered in both the V90 Cross Country and standard V90 wagon. Both are 4-cylinder engines, but don't let that cylinder count fool you. One is turbocharged and makes a respectable 250 horsepower, while the other is turbocharged and supercharged -- yes, both -- to crank out 316 horsepower. All V90 Cross Country models have all-wheel drive (AWD) standard, while the V90 wagon is either front-wheel drive (FWD) or AWD. All models use an 8-speed automatic transmission.<br>

T6 V90 Cross Country models begin at $57,095. The dealer-order V90 wagon, meanwhile, starts just under $51,000 for a T5 model or just under $57,000 for the T6. Fully loaded, a V90 Cross Country can reach into the mid-$60,000 range. At its starting price, a 2018 V90 Cross Country is several thousand more than an Audi A4 Allroad, while the V90 wagon is roughly $12,000 less than a <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/mercedes-benz/e-class/">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> wagon.

[<p>The Volvo XC60 went virtually unchanged for nearly a decade and still captured a substantial portion of the compact-luxury-SUV segment, so Volvo was careful not to mess too much with the basic recipe when it totally redesigned the model for the 2018 model year. The newest iteration is a trimmer, fitter, more muscular version of the vehicle thousands of Americans have fallen in love with. Essentially, this new all-wheel-drive Volvo SUV retains all the previous XC60’s strengths, including its good looks, adds some new luxurious features, and updates the characteristics that made it a favorite in the hot-selling category. What has changed in the past decade is that the XC60 now faces a formidable bevy of competitors, including the Lexus NX, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.</p>, <p>If you like Volvos, Swedish cars in general and/or luxurious simplicity, you will like the XC60. In both exterior and interior style the XC60 adheres to a Scandinavian aesthetic, while its engineering offers straightforward Swedish execution. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the new XC60 took home 2018 World Car of the Year honors at the <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/new-york-auto-show/14111/">2018 New York Auto Show</a>.</p>, <p>If prestige is at the top of your wish list you might find the BMW X3, Audi Q5 or Mercedes-Benz GLC more to your liking, and if you value space the Buick Enclave or Honda Pilot offers more capacity for less money.</p>, <p>The Volvo XC60 small luxury SUV is all-new for 2018 after nine model years.</p>, <p>Most of our time in the XC60 came behind the wheel of an up-level Inscription series XC60 equipped with the T6 AWD (all-wheel drive) powertrain. The ultra-sophisticated and seriously complicated engine combines supercharging and turbocharging to provide a robust and utterly flat torque curve, which translates into ample power when you want it. The engine delivers 316 peak horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The XC60’s suspension provides both comfort and a significant amount of control and is designed to limit both understeer and torque steer for a neutral feel in a variety of circumstances. The integral-link rear arrangement enabled suspension engineers to tune comfort and handling characteristics individually. Our test vehicle, equipped with the optional air suspension, featured automatic leveling and speed-adjustable ride height. We expect that all versions of the XC60 will offer better-than-acceptable ride and handling characteristics and will be fun to drive.</p>, <p>PILOT ASSIST<br>
 Volvo’s advanced semi-autonomous driver-assistance system takes care of steering, acceleration and braking on well-marked roads, though it does require the driver to be attentive. It is available in the new XC60 as an option.<br>
<br>
 SENSUS INFOTAINMENT<br>
 Volvo’s Sensus system has been revised and enhanced for use in the XC60. Among other changes, it now offers bigger icons to improve usability. CarPlay and Android Auto are also included, and the normal touch-screen functions don’t vanish when CarPlay or Android Auto appears.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>The interior of the XC60 captures the same upscale feel as its bigger brother, the XC90 sport utility, bringing a Scandinavian ethos. A key design touch is the “ribbon of woodgrain” that flows along the dash. Instrumentation is clear, and the dash features a sizable driver-information center between speedometer and tachometer. Seats are top-notch with superior adjustment and support. The rear-seat area is comfortable for three adults, and behind it is a voluminous cargo area. If you’d like your XC60’s interior to ring with the majesty of a concert venue, you can choose the 1,100-watt, 15-speaker Bowers &amp; Wilkins sound system.</p>, <p>Volvo’s “Scalable Product Architecture” is the basis of its 60- and 90-series vehicles, and that works to the XC60’s advantage, since it gets the benefit of the sophisticated design of its larger sibling, the popular XC90 SUV. There is a distinct family resemblance between the two models, but the XC60 is definitely the sleeker and sportier of the pair. The 60 and 90 “cluster” vehicles also share powertrains, including the T8 “Twin Engine” hybrid system. The rationalization of the Volvo’s chassis, suspension and powertrain plans enables Volvo, a small player on the world stage, to compete against much-larger global automakers.</p>, <p>The “base” powertrain for the XC60 is the T5 turbocharged gasoline engine with all-wheel drive. All XC60s are equipped with an enviable level of standard equipment including a panoramic moonroof, leather seats, the signature “Thor’s Hammer” LED headlights and an infotainment system with 9-inch touch screen and Apple CarPlay /Android Auto integration. On the safety front, “Lane-Keeping Aids” is standard as is the IntelliSafe City Safety System.</p>, <p>As you navigate the combinations of powertrains and packages you will encounter nine (yes, nine!) variations available here in the United States. While this might seem daunting, the handy way to look at the packages in conjunction with the powertrains (T5, T6, T8) is this: Momentum is a nicely equipped version but lacks some premium features; R Design is for the sporting driver and slants equipment in a handling/performance direction; Inscription is the all-in, fully loaded level. Inscription is the level where you’ll find Nappa leather seats with ventilation and massage, the Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium sound and air suspension, for example.</p>, <p>Volvo offers rational step-ups in its engine choices for the XC60 ranging from the straightforward but still high-tech T5 4-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged engine to the wildly complicated T8 that combines a 4-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged and supercharged engine with a lithium-ion-battery-powered electric motor. In between is the T6 4-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged and supercharged engine that delivers 316 peak horsepower and a rich, flavorful 295 lb-ft of torque that is available between 2,200 and 5,400 rpm. While we expect some Volvo fans will opt for the pricey plug-in hybrid T8, most of the volume will be in T5 and T6 versions. Power from each of the 2018 Volvo XC60 engines travels to all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4<br/> 250 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,5004,800 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/28 mpg<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.0-liter turbocharged/supercharged inline-4<br/> 316 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm<br/> 295 lb-ft of torque @ 2,200-5,400 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 21/27 mpg<br/> <b><br/> </b>2.0-liter turbocharged/supercharged inline-4 with plug-in hybrid <br/> 400 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm<br/> 472 lb-ft of torque @ 2,200-5,400 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: N/A<b></b></p>, <p>The Volvo XC60 T5, the most basic of the XC60’s, starts at $41,500. The T6 with the more powerful and sophisticated engine starts at $44,900, and the plug-in hybrid T8 starts at $52,900. All this puts the XC60 in a very competitive position to fight it out with what has become a flood of small-luxury-crossover SUVs. The Lexus NX has staked out territory at the value end of the spectrum, while relative newcomers like the Jaguar F-Pace and Land Rover Velar are more high-end. Other competitors include the Mercedes-Benz GLC and the Audi Q5. In terms of cost-to-own the XC60 figures to be among the best in the segment, though not quite as good as the Lexus NX. Since at this writing the 2018 XC60 is new to the market, we cannot calculate a Fair Purchase Price yet.</p>]

[<p>The <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/volvo/xc90/">Volvo XC90</a> is the Swedish automaker's flagship <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/suv/">SUV</a>, and a flagship in general for advanced driver-assistance, active-safety features and technology. Reborn in its current form two years ago, the XC90 midsize-luxury SUV went from one of the stalest vehicles to one of the most innovative. The extreme makeover included an interior that remains among the most stylish and sophisticated at any price point to an all-new suite of semi-autonomous driving aids. Even the up-level engine is a marvel: a turbocharged <i>and</i> supercharged 4-cylinder. Now, the XC90 is a legitimate rival to the <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/bmw/x5/">BMW X5</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/audi/q7/">Audi Q7</a> and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/infiniti/qx60/">Infiniti QX60</a>. Issues to be aware of, however, are the finicky touch-based infotainment system and T8 Plug-in Hybrid model's powertrain refinement.</p>, <p>If you want a midsize-luxury SUV that packs some of the most advanced safety and driver-assistance features, put the 2018 Volvo XC90 on your list. If you're more drawn to exquisite styling inside and out, this <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/volvo/">Volvo</a> <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/crossover/">crossover</a> SUV shines there, too.</p>, <p>Some aspects of the XC90 seem too smart for their own good. The touch-centric display that controls everything from phone connectivity to climate features can be fussy. If you want something other than a 4-cylinder under the hood, you'll also have to look to one of the Volvo's rivals.</p>, <p>For 2018, the Volvo XC90 gains as standard the impressive Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving system, plus blind-spot monitoring, auto-dimming mirrors, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.</p>, <p>If you need proof a small engine can power a big vehicle, look no further than Volvo's 4-cylinder. While the automaker recently announced its future vehicles will incorporate electrification, we hope this gem continues to play a role. This gasoline motivator -- namely the T6 variant -- feels at least two cylinders more than it is, and has plenty of guts to get this <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/luxury/">luxury</a> SUV up to speed. Once there, we found the XC90 quiet and compliant, though its ride remains on the firm side. An auto-leveling air-suspension system is available. We found the XC90 plug-in hybrid’s dual powertrain in need of polishing. The requirement of pushing the crystal shifter twice to engage drive or reverse is frustrating, and initial acceleration can be either too aggressive or too conservative in EV mode. Unlike the standard XC90, we found the plug-in hybrid to be neither seamless nor predictable.</p>, <p>BOWERS &amp; WILKINS SOUND<br>
 This optional audio system is the epitome of premium sound. With 1,400 watts and 19 speakers it's loud, yes, but the quality is superb, even when playing tunes from your phone.<br>
<br>
 AIR SUSPENSION<br>
 This optional suspension makes the XC90 more compliant, yes, but we also like its functionality when parked. With the touch of a button, you can lower the entire vehicle or just the rear, making it easier to load people, pets and gear.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p>Volvo's interiors continue to be among the most impressive. Sleek, sophisticated and anchored by Swedish minimalism, it's all elegantly cohesive. From the moment you start the car with the twist of a jewel-like knob, you feel like you're in a special place. Optional leather and wood abound, while the standard 9-inch vertical center display reminds of a <a alt_o_t="Make" href="/tesla/">Tesla</a>. The XC90 can be configured with two rows for five passengers, three rows for seven or, in the $105,000-plus Excellence trim, with four individually heated, cooled and massaging seats. The third row is sufficient for children, and cargo area is impressive with seats folded.</p>, <p>The XC90's exterior is equally elegant with no small dose of strength. Just look to those T-shaped LED running lights, dubbed "Thor's Hammer," or that significant grille with a large Volvo emblem floating in the middle. Around back, long and curvaceous taillights lend grace. Wheels range in size from 18 to 21 inches. On the practical size, the tailgate is power-operated, the door handles are illuminated, and the side mirrors are retractable. Three new colors arrive for the 2018 XC90: Maple Brown, Denim Blue and Pine Grey. Out are Magic Blue, Savile Grey and Twilight Bronze. We can't make up these names.</p>, <p>Volvo’s standard package is even better for 2018 with the inclusion of its semi-autonomous Pilot Assist that includes adaptive cruise control. Also standard are blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping aid, automatic emergency braking, rearview camera and rear parking sensors, power tailgate, dual-zone climate control, navigation, power front seats and moonroof. Standard upholstery is Leatherette, and the base configuration is for five passengers. The basic infotainment system includes CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity and a 224-watt audio system. For 2018, owners get four years of Volvo On Call service with emergency support, remote start and the ability to check fuel level, lock doors and more via a smartphone.</p>, <p>Upgrades to the 2018 Volvo XC90 include interior leather-and-wood treatments, the blissful Bowers &amp; Wilkins audio system, air suspension, 360-degree camera, quad-zone climate control, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, head-up display and even a system the cleans the headlights via high pressure. An integrated child booster seat is available, plus a harness for dogs. If you live where it's cold, you'll like the heated front and rear seats and steering wheel. The lavish -- albeit low-selling -- Excellence plug-in hybrid XC90 includes four individual seats with heat, ventilation and massage, hands-free tailgate, a refrigerator, handcrafted crystal glasses and 2nd-row tray tables.</p>, <p>The 2018 XC90 lineup is fitted with Volvo’s 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. In T5 models, it’s turbocharged for a respectable 250 horsepower. T5 models come standard with front-wheel drive (FWD) and have all-wheel drive (AWD) optional. In the T6, with AWD standard, a supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter Drive-E gasoline engine makes a stout 316 horsepower and develops 295 lb-ft of torque. The T8 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid’s electric-motor/gas-engine combo yields 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. Recharging takes 2.5 to six hours, depending on voltage. All models use an 8-speed automatic transmission and an engine start/stop system that cuts power at idle. In our tests, we opted to shut off that system to prevent rough restarts. The XC90 SUV is rated to tow up to 5,000 pounds.<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (T5)<br/> 250 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm<br/> 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/29 mpg (FWD), 22/28 mpg (AWD)<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter supercharged/turbocharged inline-4 (T6 AWD)<br/> 316 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm<br/> 295 lb-ft of torque @ 2,200 rpm<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy: 20/27 mpg<br/> <br/> 2.0-liter supercharged/turbocharged inline-4 + <a alt_o_t="Category" href="/electric/">electric</a> motor (T8 AWD)<br/> Engine:<br/> 313 horsepower @ 5,700 rpm<br/> 295 lb-ft of torque @ 2,200-5,400 rpm<br/> Electric Motor:<br/> 87 horsepower/177 lb-ft of torque<br/> Net Output: 400 horsepower / 472 lb-ft of torque<br/> EPA city/highway fuel economy, est.: 25 mpg combined, 54 MPGe combined<br/> Pure electric range on a full charge: Up to 14 miles</p>, <p>The 2018 Volvo XC90 SUV has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $47,895 for a base T5 Momentum model. A T6 begins just over $55,000, while the T8 plug-in hybrid XC90 begins around $66,000. These prices are where most XC90 buyers will land, but a small minority will opt for the loaded, 4-passenger Excellence plug-in hybrid model. That extravagant hauler comes with a price tag of nearly $106,000. If it's any consolation, it's eligible for $4,585 in Federal tax incentives (as are the other T8 plug-in <a alt_o_t="Hybrids" href="/hybrid/">hybrids</a>). At these prices, the XC90 starts under the Audi Q7, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/lexus/gx/">Lexus GX</a>, <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/land%20rover/discovery/">Land Rover Discovery</a>, BMW X5, and above the Acura MDX, Infiniti QX60 and <a alt_o_t="Make Model" href="/buick/enclave/">Buick Enclave</a>. Before buying, be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying. The Volvo XC90's <a alt_o_t="Resale Value" href="/whats-my-car-worth/">resale value</a> is expected to hold up quite well in the years ahead.</p>]
